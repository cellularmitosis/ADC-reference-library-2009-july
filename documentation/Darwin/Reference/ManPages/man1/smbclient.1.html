<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       This tool is part of the <a href="../man7/samba.7.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/7/samba"><b>samba</b>(7)</a> suite.

       smbclient is a client that can 'talk' to an SMB/CIFS server. It offers an interface similar  to  that
       of  the ftp program (see <a href="ftp.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ftp"><b>ftp</b>(1)</a>). Operations include things like getting files from the server to the
       local machine, putting files from the local machine to the server, retrieving  directory  information
       from the server and so on.

<b>OPTIONS</b>
       servicename
          servicename  is  the  name  of the service you want to use on the server. A service name takes the
          form <u>//server/service</u> where <u>server</u> is the NetBIOS name of the SMB/CIFS server offering the desired
          service  and  <u>service</u> is the name of the service offered. Thus to connect to the service "printer"
          on the SMB/CIFS server "smbserver", you would use the servicename <u>//smbserver/printer</u>

          Note that the server name required is NOT necessarily the IP (DNS) host name of the server  !  The
          name required is a NetBIOS server name, which may or may not be the same as the IP hostname of the
          machine running the server.

          The server name is looked up according to either the <u>-R</u> parameter to smbclient or using  the  name
          resolve order parameter in the <a href="../man5/smb.conf.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/smb.conf"><b>smb.conf</b>(5)</a> file, allowing an administrator to change the order and
          methods by which server names are looked up.

       password
          The password required to access the specified service on the specified server. If  this  parameter
          is supplied, the <u>-N</u> option (suppress password prompt) is assumed.

          There is no default password. If no password is supplied on the command line (either by using this
          parameter or adding a password to the <u>-U</u> option (see below)) and the <u>-N</u> option is  not  specified,
          the  client  will  prompt for a password, even if the desired service does not require one. (If no
          password is required, simply press ENTER to provide a null password.)

          Note: Some servers (including OS/2 and Windows for Workgroups) insist on  an  uppercase  password.
          Lowercase or mixed case passwords may be rejected by these servers.

          Be cautious about including passwords in scripts.

       -R &lt;name resolve order&gt;
          This  option  is  used by the programs in the Samba suite to determine what naming services and in
          what order to resolve host names to IP addresses. The option takes  a  space-separated  string  of
          different name resolution options.

          The  options  are  :"lmhosts", "host", "wins" and "bcast". They cause names to be resolved as fol-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lows:&nbsp;follows:</font>
          lows:

               <b>lmhosts</b>: Lookup an IP address in the Samba lmhosts file. If the line in lmhosts has no  name
                type  attached  to  the  NetBIOS  name  (see  the <a href="../man5/lmhosts.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/lmhosts"><b>lmhosts</b>(5)</a> for details) then any name type
                matches for lookup.

               <b>host</b>: Do a standard host name to IP address resolution, using the system <u>/etc/hosts</u>  ,  NIS,
                or  DNS  lookups. This method of name resolution is operating system dependent, for instance
                on IRIX or Solaris this may be controlled by the <u>/etc/nsswitch.conf</u> file).  Note  that  this
                method  is  only used if the NetBIOS name type being queried is the 0x20 (server) name type,
                otherwise it is ignored.

               <b>wins</b>: Query a name with the IP address listed in the  <u>wins</u>  <u>server</u>  parameter.  If  no  WINS
                server has been specified this method will be ignored.

               <b>bcast</b>: Do a broadcast on each of the known local interfaces listed in the <u>interfaces</u> parame-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ter.&nbsp;parameter.</font>
                ter. This is the least reliable of the name resolution methods as it depends on  the  target
                host being on a locally connected subnet.

             If this parameter is not set then the name resolve order defined in the <a href="../man5/smb.conf.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/smb.conf"><b>smb.conf</b>(5)</a> file param-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">eter&nbsp;parameter</font>
             eter (name resolve order) will be used.

             The default order is lmhosts, host, wins, bcast and without this parameter or any entry in  the
             <u>name</u>  <u>resolve</u>  <u>order</u>  parameter  of  the  <a href="../man5/smb.conf.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/smb.conf"><b>smb.conf</b>(5)</a>  file the name resolution methods will be
             attempted in this order.

       -M NetBIOS name
          This options allows you to send messages, using the "WinPopup" protocol, to another computer. Once
          a connection is established you then type your message, pressing ^D (control-D) to end.

          If  the  receiving  computer  is running WinPopup the user will receive the message and probably a
          beep. If they are not running WinPopup the message will be lost, and no error message will  occur.

          The  message  is  also  automatically  truncated if the message is over 1600 bytes, as this is the
          limit of the protocol.

          One useful trick is to cat the message through smbclient. For example:




          cat mymessage.txt | smbclient -M FRED

          will send the message in the file <u>mymessage.txt</u> to the machine FRED.

          You may also find the <u>-U</u> and <u>-I</u> options useful, as they allow you to control the FROM and TO parts
          of the message.

          See  the  <u>message</u> <u>command</u> parameter in the <a href="../man5/smb.conf.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/smb.conf"><b>smb.conf</b>(5)</a> for a description of how to handle incoming
          WinPopup messages in Samba.

          <b>Note</b>: Copy WinPopup into the startup group on your WfWg PCs if you want them to always be able  to
          receive messages.

       -p port
          This  number  is  the TCP port number that will be used when making connections to the server. The
          standard (well-known) TCP port number for an SMB/CIFS server is 139, which is the default.

       -P
          Make queries to the external server using the machine account of the local server.

       -h|--help
          Print a summary of command line options.

       -I IP-address
          <u>IP</u> <u>address</u> is the address of the server  to  connect  to.  It  should  be  specified  in  standard
          "a.b.c.d" notation.

          Normally  the client would attempt to locate a named SMB/CIFS server by looking it up via the Net-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">BIOS&nbsp;NetBIOS</font>
          BIOS name resolution mechanism described above in the <u>name</u> <u>resolve</u> <u>order</u>  parameter  above.  Using
          this  parameter  will force the client to assume that the server is on the machine with the speci-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fied&nbsp;specified</font>
          fied IP address and the NetBIOS name component of the resource being connected to will be ignored.

          There  is  no  default for this parameter. If not supplied, it will be determined automatically by
          the client as described above.

       -E
          This parameter causes the client to write messages to the standard error  stream  (stderr)  rather
          than to the standard output stream.

          By default, the client writes messages to standard output - typically the user's tty.

       -L
          This option allows you to look at what services are available on a server. You use it as smbclient
          -L host and a list should appear. The <u>-I</u> option may be useful if your NetBIOS  names  don't  match
          your TCP/IP DNS host names or if you are trying to reach a host on another network.

       -t terminal code
          This  option  tells  smbclient  how  to interpret filenames coming from the remote server. Usually
          Asian language multibyte UNIX implementations use different character sets than  SMB/CIFS  servers
          (<b>EUC</b> instead of
           <b>SJIS</b>  for  example). Setting this parameter will let smbclient convert between the UNIX filenames
          and the SMB filenames correctly. This option has not been seriously tested and may have some prob-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lems.&nbsp;problems.</font>
          lems.

          The  terminal  codes  include  CWsjis, CWeuc, CWjis7, CWjis8, CWjunet, CWhex, CWcap. This is not a
          complete list, check the Samba source code for the complete list.

       -b buffersize
          This option changes the transmit/send buffer size when getting  or  putting  a  file  from/to  the
          server.  The  default is 65520 bytes. Setting this value smaller (to 1200 bytes) has been observed
          to speed up file transfers to and from a Win9x server.

       -V
          Prints the program version number.

       -s &lt;configuration file&gt;
          The file specified contains the configuration details required by the server. The  information  in
          this  file  includes  server-specific  information  such  as what printcap file to use, as well as
          descriptions of all the services that the server is to provide. See <u>smb.conf</u> for more information.
          The default configuration file name is determined at compile time.

       -d|--debuglevel=level
          <u>level</u> is an integer from 0 to 10. The default value if this parameter is not specified is zero.

          The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log files about the activities of the
          server. At level 0, only critical errors and serious warnings will be logged. Level 1 is a reason-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able&nbsp;reasonable</font>
          able  level  for  day-to-day running - it generates a small amount of information about operations
          carried out.

          Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and should only be used when inves-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tigating&nbsp;investigating</font>
          tigating  a  problem.  Levels  above  3  are designed for use only by developers and generate HUGE
          amounts of log data, most of which is extremely cryptic.

          Note that specifying this parameter here will override the

          parameter in the <u>smb.conf</u> file.

       -l|--logfile=logdirectory
          Base directory name for log/debug files. The extension <b>".progname"</b> will be appended (e.g. log.smb-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">client,&nbsp;log.smbclient,</font>
          client, log.smbd, etc...). The log file is never removed by the client.

       -N
          If  specified,  this  parameter suppresses the normal password prompt from the client to the user.
          This is useful when accessing a service that does not require a password.

          Unless a password is specified on the command line or this parameter is specified, the client will
          request a password.

          If a password is specified on the command line and this option is also defined the password on the
          command line will be silently ingnored and no password will be used.

       -k
          Try to authenticate with kerberos. Only useful in an Active Directory environment.

       -A|--authentication-file=filename
          This option allows you to specify a file from which to read the username and password used in  the
          connection. The format of the file is





          username = &lt;value&gt;
          password = &lt;value&gt;
          domain   = &lt;value&gt;



          Make certain that the permissions on the file restrict access from unwanted users.

       -U|--user=username[%password]
          Sets the SMB username or username and password.

          If  %password  is  not  specified, the user will be prompted. The client will first check the <b>USER</b>
          environment variable, then the <b>LOGNAME</b> variable and if either exists, the string is uppercased. If
          these environmental variables are not found, the username <b>GUEST</b> is used.

          A third option is to use a credentials file which contains the plaintext of the username and pass-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">word.&nbsp;password.</font>
          word. This option is mainly provided for scripts where the admin does not wish to pass the creden-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tials&nbsp;credentials</font>
          tials  on the command line or via environment variables. If this method is used, make certain that
          the permissions on the file restrict access from unwanted users. See the <u>-A</u> for more details.

          Be cautious about including passwords in scripts. Also, on many systems the command line of a run-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ning&nbsp;running</font>
          ning  process  may  be  seen via the ps command. To be safe always allow rpcclient to prompt for a
          password and type it in directly.

       -n &lt;primary NetBIOS name&gt;
          This option allows you to override the NetBIOS name that Samba uses for itself. This is  identical
          to setting the

          parameter in the <u>smb.conf</u> file. However, a command line setting will take precedence over settings
          in <u>smb.conf</u>.

       -i &lt;scope&gt;
          This specifies a NetBIOS scope that nmblookup will use to communicate with when generating NetBIOS
          names.  For  details on the use of NetBIOS scopes, see rfc1001.txt and rfc1002.txt. NetBIOS scopes
          are <b>very</b> rarely used, only set this parameter if you are the system administrator in charge of all
          the NetBIOS systems you communicate with.

       -W|--workgroup=domain
          Set  the SMB domain of the username. This overrides the default domain which is the domain defined
          in smb.conf. If the domain specified is the same as the servers NetBIOS name, it causes the client
          to log on using the servers local SAM (as opposed to the Domain SAM).

       -O socket options
          TCP  socket  options to set on the client socket. See the socket options parameter in the <u>smb.conf</u>
          manual page for the list of valid options.

       -T tar options
          smbclient may be used to create <a href="tar.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/tar">tar(1)</a> compatible backups of all the files on an  SMB/CIFS  share.
          The secondary tar flags that can be given to this option are :

               <u>c</u>  -  Create  a tar file on UNIX. Must be followed by the name of a tar file, tape device or
                "-" for standard output. If using standard output you must turn the log level to its  lowest
                value  -d0  to  avoid  corrupting  your tar file. This flag is mutually exclusive with the <u>x</u>
                flag.

               <u>x</u> - Extract (restore) a local tar file back to a share. Unless the -D option is  given,  the
                tar  files will be restored from the top level of the share. Must be followed by the name of
                the tar file, device or "-" for standard input. Mutually exclusive with the <u>c</u> flag. Restored
                files  have  their creation times (mtime) set to the date saved in the tar file. Directories
                currently do not get their creation dates restored properly.

               <u>I</u> - Include files and directories. Is the default  behavior  when  filenames  are  specified
                above. Causes files to be included in an extract or create (and therefore everything else to
                be excluded). See example below. Filename globbing works in one of two ways. See <u>r</u> below.

               <u>X</u> - Exclude files and directories. Causes files to be excluded from an  extract  or  create.
                See example below. Filename globbing works in one of two ways now. See <u>r</u> below.

               <u>F</u>  -  File  containing  a list of files and directories. The <u>F</u> causes the name following the
                tarfile to create to be read as a filename that contains a list of files and directories  to
                be  included  in  an  extract  or create (and therefore everything else to be excluded). See
                example below. Filename globbing works in one of two ways. See <u>r</u> below.

               <u>b</u> - Blocksize. Must be followed by a valid (greater than zero) blocksize. Causes tar file to
                be written out in blocksize*TBLOCK (usually 512 byte) blocks.

               <u>g</u>  -  Incremental.  Only back up files that have the archive bit set. Useful only with the <u>c</u>
                flag.

               <u>q</u> - Quiet. Keeps tar from printing diagnostics as it works. This  is  the  same  as  tarmode
                quiet.

               <u>r</u> - Regular expression include or exclude. Uses regular expression matching for excluding or
                excluding files if compiled with HAVE_REGEX_H. However this mode can be very  slow.  If  not
                compiled with HAVE_REGEX_H, does a limited wildcard match on '*' and '?'.

               <u>N</u>  - Newer than. Must be followed by the name of a file whose date is compared against files
                found on the share during a create. Only files newer than the file specified are  backed  up
                to the tar file. Useful only with the <u>c</u> flag.

               <u>a</u>  -  Set  archive  bit. Causes the archive bit to be reset when a file is backed up. Useful
                with the <u>g</u> and <u>c</u> flags.

             <b>Tar</b> <b>Long</b> <b>File</b> <b>Names</b>

             smbclient's tar option now supports long file names both on backup and  restore.  However,  the
             full  path  name of the file must be less than 1024 bytes. Also, when a tar archive is created,
             smbclient's tar option places all files in the archive with relative names, not absolute names.

             <b>Tar</b> <b>Filenames</b>

             All  file names can be given as DOS path names (with '\' as the component separator) or as UNIX
             path names (with '/' as the component separator).

             <b>Examples</b>

             Restore from tar file <u>backup.tar</u> into myshare on mypc (no password on share).

             smbclient //mypc/yshare "" -N -Tx backup.tar

             Restore everything except <u>users/docs</u>

             smbclient //mypc/myshare "" -N -TXx backup.tar users/docs

             Create a tar file of the files beneath
              <u>users/docs</u>.

             smbclient //mypc/myshare "" -N -Tc backup.tar users/docs

             Create the same tar file as above, but now use a DOS path name.

             smbclient //mypc/myshare "" -N -tc backup.tar users\edocs

             Create a tar file of the files listed in the file <u>tarlist</u>.

             smbclient //mypc/myshare "" -N -TcF backup.tar tarlist

             Create a tar file of all the files and directories in the share.

             smbclient //mypc/myshare "" -N -Tc backup.tar *

       -D initial directory
          Change to initial directory before starting. Probably only of any use with the tar -T option.

       -c command string
          command string is a semicolon-separated list of commands to be executed instead of prompting  from
          stdin.
           <u>-N</u> is implied by <u>-c</u>.

          This is particularly useful in scripts and for printing stdin to the server, e.g.  -c 'print -'.

<b>OPERATIONS</b>
       Once the client is running, the user is presented with a prompt :

       smb:&gt;

       The  backslash  ("\")  indicates  the current working directory on the server, and will change if the
       current working directory is changed.

       The prompt indicates that the client is ready and waiting to carry out a user command.  Each  command
       is  a single word, optionally followed by parameters specific to that command. Command and parameters
       are space-delimited unless these notes specifically state otherwise. All commands  are  case-insensi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tive.&nbsp;case-insensitive.</font>
       tive. Parameters to commands may or may not be case sensitive, depending on the command.

       You  can  specify  file  names  which have spaces in them by quoting the name with double quotes, for
       example "a long file name".

       Parameters shown in square brackets (e.g., "[parameter]") are optional. If  not  given,  the  command
       will use suitable defaults. Parameters shown in angle brackets (e.g., "&lt;parameter&gt;") are required.

       Note  that  all  commands  operating on the server are actually performed by issuing a request to the
       server. Thus the behavior may vary from server to server, depending on  how  the  server  was  imple-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mented.&nbsp;implemented.</font>
       mented.

       The commands available are given here in alphabetical order.

       ? [command]
          If  <u>command</u>  is specified, the ? command will display a brief informative message about the speci-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fied&nbsp;specified</font>
          fied command. If no command is specified, a list of available commands will be displayed.

       ! [shell command]
          If <u>shell</u> <u>command</u> is specified, the ! command will execute a shell locally and  run  the  specified
          shell command. If no command is specified, a local shell will be run.

       altname file
          The  client  will request that the server return the "alternate" name (the 8.3 name) for a file or
          directory.

       case_sensitive
          Toggles the setting of the flag in SMB packets that tells the server to treat  filenames  as  case
          sensitive.  Set to OFF by default (tells file server to treat filenames as case insensitive). Only
          currently affects Samba 3.0.5 and above file servers with the case sensitive parameter set to auto
          in the smb.conf.

       cancel jobid0 [jobid1] ... [jobidN]
          The client will request that the server cancel the printjobs identified by the given numeric print
          job ids.

       chmod file mode in octal
          This command depends on the server supporting the CIFS UNIX extensions and will fail if the server
          does not. The client requests that the server change the UNIX permissions to the given octal mode,
          in standard UNIX format.

       chown file uid gid
          This command depends on the server supporting the CIFS UNIX extensions and will fail if the server
          does  not.  The  client  requests  that the server change the UNIX user and group ownership to the
          given decimal values. Note there is currently no way to remotely look up the UNIX uid and gid val-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ues&nbsp;values</font>
          ues for a given name. This may be addressed in future versions of the CIFS UNIX extensions.

       cd [directory name]
          If  "directory  name" is specified, the current working directory on the server will be changed to
          the directory specified. This operation will fail if for any reason  the  specified  directory  is
          inaccessible.

          If no directory name is specified, the current working directory on the server will be reported.

       del &lt;mask&gt;
          The client will request that the server attempt to delete all files matching <u>mask</u> from the current
          working directory on the server.

       dir &lt;mask&gt;
          A list of the files matching <u>mask</u> in the current working directory on the server will be retrieved
          from the server and displayed.

       exit
          Terminate the connection with the server and exit from the program.

       get &lt;remote file name&gt; [local file name]
          Copy the file called <u>remote</u> <u>file</u> <u>name</u> from the server to the machine running the client. If speci-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fied,&nbsp;specified,</font>
          fied, name the local copy <u>local</u> <u>file</u> <u>name</u>. Note that all transfers in smbclient  are  binary.  See
          also the lowercase command.

       help [command]
          See the ? command above.

       lcd [directory name]
          If <u>directory</u> <u>name</u> is specified, the current working directory on the local machine will be changed
          to the directory specified. This operation will fail if for any reason the specified directory  is
          inaccessible.

          If  no directory name is specified, the name of the current working directory on the local machine
          will be reported.

       link target linkname
          This command depends on the server supporting the CIFS UNIX extensions and will fail if the server
          does  not.  The client requests that the server create a hard link between the linkname and target
          files. The linkname file must not exist.

       lowercase
          Toggle lowercasing of filenames for the get and mget commands.

          When lowercasing is toggled ON, local filenames are converted to lowercase when using the get  and
          mget  commands.  This is often useful when copying (say) MSDOS files from a server, because lower-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">case&nbsp;lowercase</font>
          case filenames are the norm on UNIX systems.

       ls &lt;mask&gt;
          See the dir command above.

       mask &lt;mask&gt;
          This command allows the user to set up a mask which will be used during recursive operation of the
          mget and mput commands.

          The masks specified to the mget and mput commands act as filters for directories rather than files
          when recursion is toggled ON.

          The mask specified with the mask command is necessary to filter files  within  those  directories.
          For example, if the mask specified in an mget command is "source*" and the mask specified with the
          mask command is "*.c" and recursion is toggled ON, the mget command will retrieve all files match-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;matching</font>
          ing "*.c" in all directories below and including all directories matching "source*" in the current
          working directory.

          Note that the value for mask defaults to blank (equivalent to "*") and remains so until  the  mask
          command  is used to change it. It retains the most recently specified value indefinitely. To avoid
          unexpected results it would be wise to change the value of mask back to "*" after using  the  mget
          or mput commands.

       md &lt;directory name&gt;
          See the mkdir command.

       mget &lt;mask&gt;
          Copy all files matching <u>mask</u> from the server to the machine running the client.

          Note that <u>mask</u> is interpreted differently during recursive operation and non-recursive operation -<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">refer&nbsp;operationrefer</font>
          refer to the recurse and mask commands for more information. Note that all transfers in  smbclient
          are binary. See also the lowercase command.

       mkdir &lt;directory name&gt;
          Create  a new directory on the server (user access privileges permitting) with the specified name.

       mput &lt;mask&gt;
          Copy all files matching <u>mask</u> in the current working directory on the local machine to the  current
          working directory on the server.

          Note that <u>mask</u> is interpreted differently during recursive operation and non-recursive operation -<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">refer&nbsp;operationrefer</font>
          refer to the recurse and mask commands for more information. Note that all transfers in  smbclient
          are binary.

       print &lt;file name&gt;
          Print the specified file from the local machine through a printable service on the server.

       prompt
          Toggle prompting for filenames during operation of the mget and mput commands.

          When  toggled ON, the user will be prompted to confirm the transfer of each file during these com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mands.&nbsp;commands.</font>
          mands. When toggled OFF, all specified files will be transferred without prompting.

       put &lt;local file name&gt; [remote file name]
          Copy the file called <u>local</u> <u>file</u> <u>name</u> from the machine running the client to the server. If  speci-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fied,&nbsp;specified,</font>
          fied,  name the remote copy <u>remote</u> <u>file</u> <u>name</u>. Note that all transfers in smbclient are binary. See
          also the lowercase command.

       queue
          Displays the print queue, showing the job id, name, size and current status.

       quit
          See the exit command.

       rd &lt;directory name&gt;
          See the rmdir command.

       recurse
          Toggle directory recursion for the commands mget and mput.

          When toggled ON, these commands will process all directories in the source  directory  (i.e.,  the
          directory  they  are copying from ) and will recurse into any that match the mask specified to the
          command. Only files that match the mask specified using the mask command will  be  retrieved.  See
          also the mask command.

          When recursion is toggled OFF, only files from the current working directory on the source machine
          that match the mask specified to the mget or mput commands will be copied, and any mask  specified
          using the mask command will be ignored.

       rm &lt;mask&gt;
          Remove all files matching <u>mask</u> from the current working directory on the server.

       rmdir &lt;directory name&gt;
          Remove the specified directory (user access privileges permitting) from the server.

       setmode &lt;filename&gt; &lt;perm=[+|-]rsha&gt;
          A version of the DOS attrib command to set file permissions. For example:

          setmode myfile +r

          would make myfile read only.

       stat file
          This command depends on the server supporting the CIFS UNIX extensions and will fail if the server
          does not. The client requests the UNIX basic info level and prints out  the  same  info  that  the
          Linux  stat  command would about the file. This includes the size, blocks used on disk, file type,
          permissions, inode number, number of links and finally the three timestamps  (access,  modify  and
          change).  If  the file is a special file (symlink, character or block device, fifo or socket) then
          extra information may also be printed.

       symlink target linkname
          This command depends on the server supporting the CIFS UNIX extensions and will fail if the server
          does  not.  The client requests that the server create a symbolic hard link between the target and
          linkname files. The linkname file must not exist. Note that the server will not create a  link  to
          any path that lies outside the currently connected share. This is enforced by the Samba server.

       tar &lt;c|x&gt;[IXbgNa]
          Performs  a  tar operation - see the <u>-T</u> command line option above. Behavior may be affected by the
          tarmode command (see below). Using g (incremental) and N (newer)  will  affect  tarmode  settings.
          Note that using the "-" option with tar x may not work - use the command line option instead.

       blocksize &lt;blocksize&gt;
          Blocksize.  Must be followed by a valid (greater than zero) blocksize. Causes tar file to be writ-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ten&nbsp;written</font>
          ten out in <u>blocksize</u>*TBLOCK (usually 512 byte) blocks.

       tarmode &lt;full|inc|reset|noreset&gt;
          Changes tar's behavior with regard to archive bits. In full mode,  tar  will  back  up  everything
          regardless  of  the  archive bit setting (this is the default mode). In incremental mode, tar will
          only back up files with the archive bit set. In reset mode, tar will reset the archive bit on  all
          files it backs up (implies read/write share).

<b>NOTES</b>
       Some  servers  are  fussy  about  the case of supplied usernames, passwords, share names (AKA service
       names) and machine names. If you fail to connect try giving all parameters in uppercase.

       It is often necessary to use the -n option when connecting to some types of servers. For example OS/2
       LanManager  insists on a valid NetBIOS name being used, so you need to supply a valid name that would
       be known to the server.

       smbclient supports long file names where the server supports the LANMAN2 protocol or above.

<b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b>
       The variable <b>USER</b> may contain the username of the person using the client. This information  is  used
       only if the protocol level is high enough to support session-level passwords.

       The variable <b>PASSWD</b> may contain the password of the person using the client. This information is used
       only if the protocol level is high enough to support session-level passwords.

       The variable <b>LIBSMB_PROG</b> may contain the path, executed with system(), which the client  should  con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nect&nbsp;connect</font>
       nect  to instead of connecting to a server. This functionality is primarily intended as a development
       aid, and works best when using a LMHOSTS file

<b>INSTALLATION</b>
       The location of the client program is a matter for individual system  administrators.  The  following
       are thus suggestions only.

       It is recommended that the smbclient software be installed in the <u>/usr/local/samba/bin/</u> or
        <u>/usr/samba/bin/</u>  directory,  this directory readable by all, writeable only by root. The client pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">gram&nbsp;program</font>
       gram itself should be executable by all. The client should <b>NOT</b> be setuid or setgid!

       The client log files should be put in a directory readable and writeable only by the user.

       To test the client, you will need to know the name of a running SMB/CIFS server. It  is  possible  to
       run  <a href="../man8/smbd.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/smbd"><b>smbd</b>(8)</a>  as  an ordinary user - running that server as a daemon on a user-accessible port (typi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cally&nbsp;(typically</font>
       cally any port number over 1024) would provide a suitable test server.

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       Most diagnostics issued by the client are logged in a specified log file. The log file name is speci-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fied&nbsp;specified</font>
       fied at compile time, but may be overridden on the command line.

       The  number and nature of diagnostics available depends on the debug level used by the client. If you
       have problems, set the debug level to 3 and peruse the log files.

<b>VERSION</b>
       This man page is correct for version 3 of the Samba suite.
