<b>NAME</b>
       Mail::SpamAssassin::Plugin - SpamAssassin plugin base class

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>SpamAssassin</b> <b>configuration:</b>

         loadplugin MyPlugin /path/to/myplugin.pm

       <b>Perl</b> <b>code:</b>

         package MyPlugin;

         use Mail::SpamAssassin::Plugin;
         our @ISA = qw(Mail::SpamAssassin::Plugin);

         sub new {
           my ($class, $mailsa) = @_;

           # the usual perlobj boilerplate to create a subclass object
           $class = ref($class) || $class;
           my $self = $class-&gt;SUPER::new($mailsa);
           bless ($self, $class);

           # then register an eval rule, if desired...
           $self-&gt;register_eval_rule ("check_for_foo");

           # and return the new plugin object
           return $self;
         }

         ...methods...

         1;

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       This is the base class for SpamAssassin plugins; all plugins must be objects that implement this
       class.

       This class provides no-op stub methods for all the callbacks that a plugin can receive.  It is
       expected that your plugin will override one or more of these stubs to perform its actions.

       SpamAssassin implements a plugin chain; each callback event is passed to each of the registered
       plugin objects in turn.  Any plugin can call "$self-&gt;inhibit_further_callbacks()" to block delivery
       of that event to later plugins in the chain.  This is useful if the plugin has handled the event, and
       there will be no need for later plugins to handle it as well.

       If you're looking to write a simple eval rule, skip straight to "register_eval_rule()", below.

<b>INTERFACE</b>
       In all the plugin APIs below, "options" refers to a reference to a hash containing name-value pairs.
       This is used to ensure future-compatibility, in that we can add new options in future without
       affecting objects built to an earlier version of the API.

       For example, here would be how to print out the "line" item in a "parse_config()" method:

         sub parse_config {
           my ($self, $opts) = @_;
           print "MyPlugin: parse_config got ".$opts-&gt;{line}."\n";
         }

<b>METHODS</b>
       The following methods can be overridden by subclasses to handle events that SpamAssassin will call
       back to:

       $plugin = MyPluginClass-&gt;new ($mailsaobject)
           Constructor.  Plugins that need to register themselves will need to define their own; the default
           super-class constructor will work fine for plugins that just override a method.

           Note that subclasses must provide the $mailsaobject to the superclass constructor, like so:

             my $self = $class-&gt;SUPER::new($mailsaobject);

           Lifecycle note: plugins that will need to store per-scan state should not store that on the
           Plugin object; see "check_start()" below.  It is also likewise recommended that configuration
           settings be stored on the Conf object; see "parse_config()".

       $plugin-&gt;parse_config ( { options ... } )
           Parse a configuration line that hasn't already been handled.  "options" is a reference to a hash
           containing these options:

           line
               The line of configuration text to parse.   This has leading and trailing whitespace, and
               comments, removed.

           key The configuration key; ie. the first "word" on the line.

           value
               The configuration value; everything after the first "word" and any whitespace after that.

           conf
               The "Mail::SpamAssassin::Conf" object on which the configuration data should be stored.

           user_config
               A boolean: 1 if reading a user's configuration, 0 if reading the system-wide configuration
               files.

           If the configuration line was a setting that is handled by this plugin, the method implementation
           should call "$self-&gt;inhibit_further_callbacks()".

           If the setting is not handled by this plugin, the method should return 0 so that a later plugin
           may handle it, or so that SpamAssassin can output a warning message to the user if no plugin
           understands it.

           Lifecycle note: it is suggested that configuration be stored on the "Mail::SpamAssassin::Conf"
           object in use, instead of the plugin object itself.  That can be found as
           "$plugin-&gt;{main}-&gt;{conf}".   This allows per-user and system-wide configuration to be dealt with
           correctly, with per-user overriding system-wide.

       $plugin-&gt;finish_parsing_end ( { options ... } )
           Signals that the configuration parsing has just finished, and SpamAssassin is nearly ready to
           check messages.

           "options" is a reference to a hash containing these options:

           conf
               The "Mail::SpamAssassin::Conf" object on which the configuration data should be stored.

           Note: there are no guarantees that the internal data structures of SpamAssassin will not change
           from release to release.  In particular to this plugin hook, if you modify the rules data
           structures in a third-party plugin, all bets are off until such time that an API is present for
           modifying that configuration data.

       $plugin-&gt;signal_user_changed ( { options ... } )
           Signals that the current user has changed for a new one.

           username
               The new user's username.

           user_dir
               The new user's home directory. (equivalent to "~".)

           userstate_dir
               The new user's storage directory. (equivalent to "~/.spamassassin".)

       $plugin-&gt;services_authorized_for_username ( { options ... } )
           Validates that a given username is authorized to use certain services.

           In order to authorize a user, the plugin should first check that it can handle any of the
           services passed into the method and then set the value for each allowed service to true (or any
           non-negative value).

           The current supported services are: bayessql

           username
               A username

           services
               Reference to a hash containing the services you want to check.

               {

                 'bayessql' =&gt; 0

               }

           conf
               The "Mail::SpamAssassin::Conf" object on which the configuration data should be stored.

       $plugin-&gt;compile_now_start ( { options ... } )
           This is called at the beginning of <u>Mail::SpamAssassin::compile</u><b>_</b><u>now()</u> so plugins can do any
           necessary initialization for multi-process SpamAssassin (such as spamd or mass-check -j).

           use_user_prefs
               The value of $use_user_prefs option in <u>compile</u><b>_</b><u>now()</u>.

           keep_userstate
               The value of $keep_userstate option in <u>compile</u><b>_</b><u>now()</u>.

       $plugin-&gt;compile_now_finish ( { options ... } )
           This is called at the end of <u>Mail::SpamAssassin::compile</u><b>_</b><u>now()</u> so plugins can do any necessary
           initialization for multi-process SpamAssassin (such as spamd or mass-check -j).

           use_user_prefs
               The value of $use_user_prefs option in <u>compile</u><b>_</b><u>now()</u>.

           keep_userstate
               The value of $keep_userstate option in <u>compile</u><b>_</b><u>now()</u>.

       $plugin-&gt;check_start ( { options ... } )
           Signals that a message check operation is starting.

           permsgstatus
               The "Mail::SpamAssassin::PerMsgStatus" context object for this scan.

               Lifecycle note: it is recommended that rules that need to track test state on a per-scan
               basis should store that state on this object, not on the plugin object itself, since the
               plugin object will be shared between all active scanners.

               The message being scanned is accessible through the "$permsgstatus-&gt;get_message()" API; there
               are a number of other public APIs on that object, too.  See
               "Mail::SpamAssassin::PerMsgStatus" perldoc.

       $plugin-&gt;check_main ( { options ... } )
           Signals that a message should be checked.  Note that implementations of this hook should return
           1.

           permsgstatus
               The "Mail::SpamAssassin::PerMsgStatus" context object for this scan.

       $plugin-&gt;check_tick ( { options ... } )
           Called periodically during a message check operation.  A callback set for this method is a good
           place to run through an event loop dealing with network events triggered in a "parse_metadata"
           method, for example.

           permsgstatus
               The "Mail::SpamAssassin::PerMsgStatus" context object for this scan.

       $plugin-&gt;check_post_dnsbl ( { options ... } )
           Called after the DNSBL results have been harvested.  This is a good place to harvest your own
           asynchronously-started network lookups.

           permsgstatus
               The "Mail::SpamAssassin::PerMsgStatus" context object for this scan.

       $plugin-&gt;check_post_learn ( { options ... } )
           Called after auto-learning may (or may not) have taken place.  If you wish to perform additional
           learning, whether or not auto-learning happens, this is the place to do it.

           permsgstatus
               The "Mail::SpamAssassin::PerMsgStatus" context object for this scan.

       $plugin-&gt;check_end ( { options ... } )
           Signals that a message check operation has just finished, and the results are about to be
           returned to the caller.

           permsgstatus
               The "Mail::SpamAssassin::PerMsgStatus" context object for this scan.  The current score,
               names of rules that hit, etc. can be retrieved using the public APIs on this object.

       $plugin-&gt;finish_tests ( { options ... } )
           Called via SpamAssassin::finish and should clear up any tests that a plugin has added to the
           namespace.

           In certain circumstances, plugins may find it useful to compile perl functions from the ruleset,
           on the fly.  It is important to remove these once the "Mail::SpamAssassin" object is deleted,
           however, and this API allows this.

           Each plugin is responsible for its own generated perl functions.

           conf
               The "Mail::SpamAssassin::Conf" object on which the configuration data should be stored.

           $plugin-&gt;extract_metadata ( { options ... } )
               Signals that a message is being mined for metadata.  Some plugins may wish to add their own
               metadata as well.

               msg The "Mail::SpamAssassin::Message" object for this message.

           $plugin-&gt;parsed_metadata ( { options ... } )
               Signals that a message's metadata has been parsed, and can now be accessed by the plugin.

               permsgstatus
                   The "Mail::SpamAssassin::PerMsgStatus" context object for this scan.

           $plugin-&gt;start_rules ( { options ... } )
               Called before testing a set of rules of a given type and priority.

               permsgstatus
                   The "Mail::SpamAssassin::PerMsgStatus" context object for this scan.

               ruletype
                   The type of the rules about to be performed.

               priority
                   The priority level of the rules about to be performed.

           $plugin-&gt;hit_rule ( { options ... } )
               Called when a rule fires.

               permsgstatus
                   The "Mail::SpamAssassin::PerMsgStatus" context object for this scan.

               ruletype
                   The type of the rule that fired.

               rulename
                   The name of the rule that fired.

               score
                   The rule's score in the active scoreset.

           $plugin-&gt;ran_rule ( { options ... } )
               Called after a rule has been tested, whether or not it fired.  When the rule fires, the
               hit_rule callback is always called before this.

               permsgstatus
                   The "Mail::SpamAssassin::PerMsgStatus" context object for this scan.

               ruletype
                   The type of the rule that was tested.

               rulename
                   The name of the rule that was tested.

           $plugin-&gt;autolearn_discriminator ( { options ... } )
               Control whether a just-scanned message should be learned as either spam or ham.   This method
               should return one of 1 to learn the message as spam, 0 to learn as ham, or "undef" to not
               learn from the message at all.

               permsgstatus
                   The "Mail::SpamAssassin::PerMsgStatus" context object for this scan.

           $plugin-&gt;autolearn ( { options ... } )
               Signals that a message is about to be auto-learned as either ham or spam.

               permsgstatus
                   The "Mail::SpamAssassin::PerMsgStatus" context object for this scan.

               isspam
                   1 if the message is spam, 0 if ham.

           $plugin-&gt;per_msg_finish ( { options ... } )
               Signals that a "Mail::SpamAssassin::PerMsgStatus" object is being destroyed, and any per-scan
               context held on that object by this plugin should be destroyed as well.

               Normally, any member variables on the "PerMsgStatus" object will be cleaned up automatically
               -- but if your plugin has made a circular reference on that object, this is the place to
               break them so that garbage collection can operate correctly.

               permsgstatus
                   The "Mail::SpamAssassin::PerMsgStatus" context object for this scan.

           $plugin-&gt;have_shortcircuited ( { options ... } )
               Has the current scan operation 'short-circuited'?  In other words, can further scanning be
               skipped, since the message is already definitively classified as either spam or ham?

               Plugins should return 0 to indicate that scanning should continue, or 1 to indicate that
               short-circuiting has taken effect.

               permsgstatus
                   The "Mail::SpamAssassin::PerMsgStatus" context object for this scan.

           $plugin-&gt;bayes_learn ( { options ... } )
               Called at the end of a bayes learn operation.

               This phase is the best place to map the raw (original) token value to the SHA1 hashed value.

               toksref
                   Reference to hash returned by call to tokenize.  The hash takes the format of:

                   {

                     'SHA1 Hash Value' =&gt; 'raw (original) value'

                   }

                   NOTE: This data structure has changed since it was originally introduced in version
                   3.0.0.  The values are no longer perl anonymous hashes, they are a single string
                   containing the raw token value.  You can test for backwards compatability by checking to
                   see if the value for a key is a reference to a perl HASH, for instance:

                   if (ref($toksref-&gt;{$sometokenkey}) eq 'HASH') {...

                   If it is, then you are using the old interface, otherwise you are using the current
                   interface.

               isspam
                   Boolean value stating what flavor of message the tokens represent, if true then message
                   was specified as spam, false is nonspam.  Note, when function is scan then isspam value
                   is not valid.

               msgid
                   Generated message id of the message just learned.

               msgatime
                   Received date of the current message or current time if received date could not be
                   determined.  In addition, if the receive date is more than 24 hrs into the future it will

           $plugin-&gt;log_scan_result ( { options ... } )
               Called when spamd has completed scanning a message.  Currently, only spamd calls this API.

               result
                   The 'result: ...' line for this scan.  Format is as described at
                   <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/SpamdSyslogFormat"><b>http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/SpamdSyslogFormat</b></a>

           $plugin-&gt;spamd_child_post_connection_close ()
               Called when child returns from handling a connection.

               If there was an accept failure, the child will die and this code will not be called.

           $plugin-&gt;finish ()
               Called when the "Mail::SpamAssassin" object is destroyed.

<b>HELPER</b> <b>APIS</b>
       These methods provide an API for plugins to register themselves to receive specific events, or
       control the callback chain behaviour.

       $plugin-&gt;register_eval_rule ($nameofevalsub)
           Plugins that implement an eval test will need to call this, so that SpamAssassin calls into the
           object when that eval test is encountered.  See the <b>REGISTERING</b> <b>EVAL</b> <b>RULES</b> section for full
           details.

       $plugin-&gt;register_generated_rule_method ($nameofsub)
           In certain circumstances, plugins may find it useful to compile perl functions from the ruleset,
           on the fly.  It is important to remove these once the "Mail::SpamAssassin" object is deleted,
           however, and this API allows this.

           Once the method $nameofsub has been generated, call this API with the name of the method
           (including full package scope).  This indicates that it's a temporary piece of generated code,
           built from the SpamAssassin ruleset, and when "Mail::SpamAssassin::finish()" is called, the
           method will be destroyed.

           This API was added in SpamAssassin 3.2.0.

       $plugin-&gt;register_method_priority($methodname, $priority)
           Indicate that the method named $methodname on the current object has a callback priority of
           $priority.

           This is used by the plugin handler to determine the relative order of callbacks; plugins with
           lower-numbered priorities are called before plugins with higher-numbered priorities.  Each method
           can have a different priority value.  The default value is 0.  The ordering of callbacks to
           methods with equal priority is undefined.

           Typically, you only need to worry about this if you need to ensure your plugin's method is called
           before another plugin's implementation of that method.  It should be called from your plugin's
           constructor.

           This API was added in SpamAssassin 3.2.0.

       $plugin-&gt;<u>inhibit</u><b>_</b><u>further</u><b>_</b><u>callbacks()</u>
           Tells the plugin handler to inhibit calling into other plugins in the plugin chain for the
           current callback.  Frequently used when parsing configuration settings using "parse_config()".

       dbg($message)
           Output a debugging message $message, if the SpamAssassin object is running with debugging turned
           on.

           <u>NOTE:</u> This function is not available in the package namespace of general plugins and can't be
           called via $self-&gt;<u>dbg()</u>.  If a plugin wishes to output debug information, it should call
           "Mail::SpamAssassin::Plugin::dbg($msg)".

       info($message)
           Output an informational message $message, if the SpamAssassin object is running with
           informational messages turned on.

           <u>NOTE:</u> This function is not available in the package namespace of general plugins and can't be
           called via $self-&gt;<u>info()</u>.  If a plugin wishes to output debug information, it should call
           "Mail::SpamAssassin::Plugin::info($msg)".

<b>REGISTERING</b> <b>EVAL</b> <b>RULES</b>
       Plugins that implement an eval test must register the methods that can be called from rules in the
       configuration files, in the plugin class' constructor.

       For example,

         $plugin-&gt;register_eval_rule ('check_for_foo')

       will cause "$plugin-&gt;check_for_foo()" to be called for this SpamAssassin rule:

         header   FOO_RULE     eval:check_for_foo()

       Note that eval rules are passed the following arguments:

       - The plugin object itself
       - The "Mail::SpamAssassin::PerMsgStatus" object calling the rule
       - standard arguments for the rule type in use
       - any and all arguments as specified in the configuration file

       In other words, the eval test method should look something like this:

         sub check_for_foo {
           my ($self, $permsgstatus, ...arguments...) = @_;
           ...code returning 0 or 1
         }

       Note that the headers can be accessed using the "get()" method on the
       "Mail::SpamAssassin::PerMsgStatus" object, and the body by "get_decoded_stripped_body_text_array()"
       and other similar methods.  Similarly, the "Mail::SpamAssassin::Conf" object holding the current
       configuration may be accessed through "$permsgstatus-&gt;{main}-&gt;{conf}".

       The eval rule should return 1 for a hit, or 0 if the rule is not hit.

       State for a single message being scanned should be stored on the $checker object, not on the $self
       object, since $self persists between scan operations.  See the 'lifecycle note' on the
       "check_start()" method above.

<b>STANDARD</b> <b>ARGUMENTS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>RULE</b> <b>TYPES</b>
       Plugins will be called with the same arguments as a standard EvalTest.  Different rule types receive
       different information by default:

       - header tests: no extra arguments
       - body tests: fully rendered message as array reference
       - rawbody tests: fully decoded message as array reference
       - full tests: pristine message as scalar reference

       The configuration file arguments will be passed in after the standard arguments.

<b>BACKWARDS</b> <b>COMPATIBILITY</b>
       Note that if you write a plugin and need to determine if a particular helper method is supported on
       "Mail::SpamAssassin::Plugin", you can do this:

           if ($self-&gt;can("name_of_method")) {
             eval {
               $self-&gt;name_of_method();        # etc.
             }
           } else {
             # take fallback action
           }

       The same applies for the public APIs on objects of other types, such as
       "Mail::SpamAssassin::PerMsgStatus".
