I have the Japanese Language Kit installed on my development system, and ResEdit 2.1.2 seems to work fine with it. TeachText Japanese should provide the limited amount of Japanese textediting we need (for a Balloon Help rez file), and we are bringing in two interpreters who are experienced computer users.<p>Are there other tools available that would simplify the process? Does Applehave a human-interface guide for Japan (we want to use preferred Apple/Macintosh phraseology for things such as Drag and Drop). Is there a Japanese-Macintosh tutorial or user's guide that we can get in the United States?</p><font size="+4">A</font>  Your tools sound reasonable, but you might want to consider some additions:<p>* AppleGlot. This is a very useful automation tool that strips out textresources for translation -- ResEdit should be used only for non-text resourcesthat AppleGlot can't handle. Note that AppleGlot 2.1 conflicts with the ModernMemory Manager, so if you use this version, use the Memory Control Panel toturn it off. This problem was fixed in AppleGlot 2.2.</p><p>* A true Japanese word processor, such as MacWrite-J. This is very useful tohave. Many of the technical documents that contain information you may need areavailable only in MacWrite-J format, and MacWrite-US is not compatible withthem.</p><p>If your application uses 'inline input', you'll need the Text Services Manager,but for basic Kanji input support, you don't need to do anything special, sincethe operating system takes care of this for you.</p><p>The Developer CDs have international SSW, and the Partners Seed CD includes aSystem 7.5-compatible version of the Japanese Language Kit. Plan on using bothof these for testing. Start off by testing your current application (as-is) onKanjiTalk to see what kinds of problems you have. Once you've identified theproblems, refer to the appropriate sections in <i>Inside Macintosh</i> toresolve them. When your application runs without errors on KanjiTalk, you areready to start the localization process. Typically, the documentation andpackaging take the longest time to localize.</p><p>The sample documentation may present a problem in that paper versions are hardto come by and expensive to ship. If possible, have someone in Japan buy asystem package and ship it to you. Although there may be soft copies of somedocuments available, you might not have access to applications that can readthe formats used.</p><p>To obtain glossaries, it's possible to use AppleGlot to strip text resourcesout of applications, and if you have both English and Japanese applications,you can build a useful table. However, this only works for text that exists inan application's resources -- documentation is more difficult. You may be able to obtain Japanese glossaries or references via eWorld, AppleLink, INTERNET, and so on. For additional information, see <i>Inside Macintosh: Text</i>, which covers virtually everything you need to consider when localizing your application for a world market. <i>Localizing for Japan</i> and <i>Guide to Macintosh Software Localization</i>(published by Addison-Wesley) are also good localization references (these are on some of the older Developer CDs).</p><!-- begin_date --><H4 ALIGN=center>[May 01 1995]</H4><!-- end_date --></td></tr></table></CENTER><!-- begin_footer_information -->	<table width="680" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
