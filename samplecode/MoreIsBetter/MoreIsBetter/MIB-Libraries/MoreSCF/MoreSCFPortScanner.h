// Port Scanner

// IMPORTANT
// Apple currently provides no high-level API for finding all of the ports suitable 
// for networking, nor do we provide an API for getting the user-visible name of a 
// port.  This module solves that problems.  It searches the IORegistry and creates 
// a port list that includes the port's user visible name.  To use it properly you 
// must provide a callback (set via MoreSCFSetPortNameCallback) which it can use 
// to get the localised versions of certain strings.  This means that you have 
// to hard code port name strings in your application.  This is not an ideal 
// solution, but it's the best you can do until we provide the necessary APIs
// [2851695, 2851696, 2851697].  Hopefully I will be able to layer a later 
// version of this code on top of any new APIs we introduce.  At a minimum you 
// will have to recompile your application when these new APIs are introduced.

extern pascal OSStatus MoreSCCreatePortArray(CFArrayRef *portArray);
	// Builds a list of network ports and returns their attributes as a CFArray 
	// of CFDictionaries, with one dictionary per port.  The array is sorted in 
	// the default order which one would display the ports to the user (and set 
	// them up in the IPv4 service order array). Each entries contains the 
	// following required keys.
	//
	// o kSCPropUserDefinedName -- the user-visible name of the port
	//
	// o kSCPropNetInterfaceHardware -- the hardware type of the interface, 
	//   typically kSCEntNetEthernet, kSCEntNetAirPort, or kSCEntNetModem
	//
	// o kSCPropNetInterfaceType -- either kSCValNetInterfaceTypeEthernet 
	//   or kSCValNetInterfaceTypePPP
	//
	// o kSCPropNetInterfaceDeviceName -- typically the BSD name of the 
	//   network device; for serial-like devices this is the base 
	//   name, including the suffix, but not including any leading "cu." 
	//   and so on
	//
	// The dictionary may also contain values for the following keys. 
	//
	// o kSCPropNetInterfaceSubType -- either kSCValNetInterfaceSubTypePPPSerial 
	//   or kSCValNetInterfaceSubTypePPPoE, only present if  
	//   kSCPropNetInterfaceType is kSCValNetInterfaceTypePPP
	// 
	// o kSCPropMACAddress -- the MAC address for Ethernet-like devices,
	//   encoded as a colon delimited string
	//
	// o kMoreSCPropNetInterfaceHardwareVariant -- set to 
	//   kMoreSCValNetInterfaceHardwareVariantIrDACOMM to distinguish 
	//   modem/serial ports from IrDA COMM ports
	//
	// o kSCPropNetInterfaceSupportsModemOnHold -- may be present for 
	//   modem devices (kSCPropNetInterfaceHardware is kSCEntNetModem); if 
	//   present, this is a CFNumber of value 0 or 1 indicating whether the 
	//   modem supports V.92 call waiting; if not present, assume 0
	//
	// The dictionary may also contain other keys. These keys were set up 
	// during the operation of the function. You may find their values useful.
	// 
	// o "AAPL,slot-name" -- For PCI devices this is the name of the 
	//   slot that the device is plugged in to.
	//
	// o "IOChildIndex" -- For PCI devices thish is the port number.
	//   To tell you the truth I'm not exactly sure what this means )-:
	//
	// o kIOBSDNameKey -- For generic Ethernet-like devices this is the 
	//   BSD name of the underlying device.
	//
	// o kIOTTYBaseNameKey -- For generic serial ports this is the 
	//   base name of the serial driver.
	//
	// This function takes a guess at the user-visible name of the port 
	// and then calls your callback function (which you install using 
	// MoreSCFSetPortNameCallback) to refine that name.  If your 
	// callback function doesn't override the user-visible name 
	// this function will just returns its guess.  Note that the code 
	// that generates the guess is bug-for-bug compatible with the 
	// Network preferences panel in Mac OS X 10.1.x and may not produce 
	// ideal results. Moreover, the guess is not localised.
	// 
	//  portArray must not be NULL.
	// *portArray must be NULL.
	// On success, *portArray will be non-NULL; the caller is responsible for 
	// releasing it.
	// On error, *portArray will be NULL.

// Localisable Port Names

// You can install a MoreSCFPortNameCallback to return the localised 
// name for a port.  The function is called with a non-localised 
// port label and is expected to return a localised name.
//
// If you don't install a callback the default (English) names for 
// the ports are used.
//
// One day a revision of IOKit will make it easy to get port names. 
// Until that day...

typedef pascal kern_return_t (*MoreSCFPortNameCallback)(io_object_t interface, 
														CFMutableDictionaryRef interfaceInfo, 
														CFStringRef proposedUserVisibleName, 
														CFStringRef *userVisibleName);
	// MoreSCF calls this callback when it needs to determine the user-visible 
	// name of a port.  The callback is provided with a reference to the 
	// I/O Registry object, a dictionary of information about that object 
	// (this is basically the same dictionary as is returned by 
	// MoreSCCreatePortArray, without the kSCPropUserDefinedName of course) 
	// and a proposed user-visible name.  The routine can either leave 
	// *userVisibleName as NULL, in which case MoreSCF uses the 
	// proposedUserVisible name, or set it to a user-visible name that's 
	// better than the proposed one.  
	//
	// For example, your code might have a set of localised strings 
	// for each of the port labels listed below, and return the 
	// appropriate string based on the current user's preferences.  Or 
	// your code might have special information about a specific 
	// interface, and return a custom string for that interface. 
	//
	// MoreSCF does keyword substitution (for example, replacing 
	// %2$@ with the PCI slot name that the device resides in) *after* 
	// calling this routine, so you don't have to parse these variable 
	// keywords out of proposedUserVisibleName when deciding on your 
	// localisations.  You can also modify the substitions that are 
	// performed by returning a string with different keywords.
	//
	// interface will not be 0.
	// interfaceInfo will not be NULL.
	// proposedUserVisibleName will not be NULL.  It will be either one of the 
	// labels listed below, or a more specific name derived from the I/O Registry.
	// userVisibleName will not be NULL.
	// *userVisibleName will be NULL.
	// On success, *userVisibleName may be NULL or not NULL.  If not NULL, 
	// it's the user visible name of the port.  If NULL, your code doesn't 
	// have a user visible name for this type of port.
	// On error, *userVisibleName must be NULL.
	//
	// *userVisibleName can contain the following strings which are substituted 
	// by MoreSCF upon return.
	//
	//   %1$@ is the BSD name of the device
	//   %2$@ is the PCI slot name of the device
	//   %3$@ is the function number of a multifunction PCI device
	//   %4$@ is the lowercased TTY base name of the device
	//        Why lowercase?  Because that's what the 10.1.x control 
	//        panel does, for reasons unknown.
