This is sample code to accompany Chapter 12 of "An Introduction to Macintosh Programming for Windows Programmers" available at <http://developer.apple.com/macos/macoverview/>.This sample contains a series of six C++ sample programs used to illustrate how to write a simple Macintosh application. The samples use the Metrowerks PowerPlant applications framework, which ships as part of the CodeWarrior Integrated Development environment. (PowerPlant ships with a wide range of useful sample programs. We’ll describe many of those in more detail below.) These samples illustrate many common applications features, including:1. Multiple document windows. 2. Disk files for persistent data. 3. Menu items for modifying the data. 4. Buttons for modifying the data. 5. Modal dialogs. 6. Printing. 7. Custom application and document icons. 8. Customized “About this program…” dialog.
