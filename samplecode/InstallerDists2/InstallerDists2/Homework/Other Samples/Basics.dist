<installer-script minSpecVersion="1.0">
<!-- 
	Purpose: To show the basic structure of a distribution script						
	Overview: Shows the very minimum needed to install a package using a distribution script.															
-->

<!-- 
	The "title element contains the title of the distribution, or a key for the title to be localized with
-->
    <title>My Great Software</title>

<!-- 
	The "choices-outline" element contains the order of the choices.  A line can contain other lines. A parent line will inherit the "selected" state of its children
-->
    <choices-outline>
<!-- 
    The only valid attribute for a line is the "choice".  The value for choice is the identifier for the choice represented by the given line. More then one line can represent the same choice, but be careful, this may effect how the choice interacts with other choices!    
-->
        <line choice="TextEditChoice"/>
    </choices-outline>

<!-- 
	Each choice element has a unique "id" attribute.   Any attribute that contains text displayed in the installer can either be the text or the key for localization. Each choice requires at least an id and title attribute.  The choice is what points to the package to be installed.  Any "pkg-ref" element within a given choice will be installed if a choice is selected. 										
-->
    <choice id="TextEditChoice" title="TextEdit" description="Installs TextEdit.app compiled from source.">

<!-- 
    The pkg-ref is a reference to the package to be installed when this choice is selected.  Note that the reference must have at least an id attribute. The pkg-ref is fully defined later on, but can just as easily be defined in full inside the choice. 
-->
    	<pkg-ref id="com.apple.pkg.example.textedit"/>
    </choice>

<!-- 
	This package ref, referred to by the "TextEditChoice" choice is defined in full below.  The attributes of the pkg-ref element is a cache of the data actually in the package.  These values include, id (the CFShortBundleIdentifier from the real package), installKBytes (the size of the package once installed), version (5 tuple from package 0.0.0.0.0), auth ("none","admin","root'), and onConclusion ("none","recommendedRestart","requireLogout","requireRestart", and "requireShutdown").					
-->
