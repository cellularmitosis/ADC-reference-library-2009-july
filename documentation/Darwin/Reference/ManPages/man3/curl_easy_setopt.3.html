curl_easy_setopt(3)                            libcurl Manual                            curl_easy_setopt(3)



<b>NAME</b>
       curl_easy_setopt - set options for a curl easy handle

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       #include &lt;curl/curl.h&gt;

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLoption option, parameter);

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       curl_easy_setopt()  is  used  to  tell  libcurl  how  to  behave. By using the appropriate options to
       <u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>easy</u><b>_</b><u>setopt</u>, you can change libcurl's behavior.  All options are set with the <u>option</u> followed by
       a  <u>parameter</u>.  That  parameter  can be a <b>long</b>, a <b>function</b> <b>pointer</b>, an <b>object</b> <b>pointer</b> or a <b>curl_off_t</b>,
       depending on what the specific option expects. Read this manual carefully as  bad  input  values  may
       cause libcurl to behave badly!  You can only set one option in each function call. A typical applica-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;application</font>
       tion uses many curl_easy_setopt() calls in the setup phase.

       Options set with this function call are valid for all forthcoming transfers performed using this <u>han</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dle.&nbsp;handle.</font>
       <u>dle</u>.   The  options  are  not in any way reset between transfers, so if you want subsequent transfers
       with different options, you must change them between the transfers.  You  can  optionally  reset  all
       options back to internal default with <a href="curl_easy_reset.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/curl_easy_reset"><u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>easy</u><b>_</b><u>reset(3)</u></a><u></u>.

       Strings  passed  to  libcurl  as  'char  *' arguments, will not be copied by the library. Instead you
       should keep them available until libcurl no longer needs them. Failing to do so will cause  very  odd
       behavior  or  even crashes. libcurl will need them until you call <a href="curl_easy_cleanup.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/curl_easy_cleanup"><u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>easy</u><b>_</b><u>cleanup(3)</u></a><u></u> or you set the
       same option again to use a different pointer.

       The <u>handle</u> is the return code from a <a href="curl_easy_init.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/curl_easy_init"><u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>easy</u><b>_</b><u>init(3)</u></a><u></u> or <a href="curl_easy_duphandle.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/curl_easy_duphandle"><u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>easy</u><b>_</b><u>duphandle(3)</u></a><u></u> call.

<b>BEHAVIOR</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       CURLOPT_VERBOSE
              Set the parameter to non-zero to get the library to display a lot of verbose information about
              its  operations. Very useful for libcurl and/or protocol debugging and understanding. The ver-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">bose&nbsp;verbose</font>
              bose information will be sent to stderr, or the stream set with <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>STDERR</u>.

              You hardly ever want this set in production use, you will almost always  want  this  when  you
              debug/report problems. Another neat option for debugging is the <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>DEBUGFUNCTION</u>.

       CURLOPT_HEADER
              A  non-zero parameter tells the library to include the header in the body output. This is only
              relevant for protocols that actually have headers preceding the data (like HTTP).

       CURLOPT_NOPROGRESS
              A non-zero parameter tells the library to shut off the built-in progress meter completely.

              Future versions of libcurl is likely to not have any built-in progress meter at all.

       CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL
              Pass a long. If it is non-zero, libcurl will not use any functions that  install  signal  han-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dlers&nbsp;handlers</font>
              dlers  or  any  functions  that cause signals to be sent to the process. This option is mainly
              here to allow multi-threaded unix applications to still set/use all timeout options etc, with-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">out&nbsp;without</font>
              out risking getting signals.  (Added in 7.10)

              Consider  building  libcurl  with  ares support to enable asynchronous DNS lookups. It enables
              nice timeouts for name resolves without signals.


<b>CALLBACK</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION
              Function pointer that should match the following prototype: <b>size_t</b> <b>function(</b> <b>void</b> <b>*ptr,</b> <b>size_t</b>
              <b>size,</b>  <b>size_t</b>  <b>nmemb,</b>  <b>void</b> <b>*stream);</b> This function gets called by libcurl as soon as there is
              data received that needs to be saved. The size of the data pointed to by <u>ptr</u>  is  <u>size</u>  multi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">plied&nbsp;multiplied</font>
              plied  with  <u>nmemb</u>,  it will not be zero terminated. Return the number of bytes actually taken
              care of. If that amount differs from the amount passed to your function, it'll signal an error
              to the library and it will abort the transfer and return <u>CURLE</u><b>_</b><u>WRITE</u><b>_</b><u>ERROR</u>.

              This function may be called with zero bytes data if the transfered file is empty.

              Set  this  option  to NULL to get the internal default function. The internal default function
              will write the data to the FILE * given with <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>WRITEDATA</u>.

              Set the <u>stream</u> argument with the <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>WRITEDATA</u> option.

              The callback function will be passed as much data as possible in all invokes, but  you  cannot
              possibly  make any assumptions. It may be one byte, it may be thousands. The maximum amount of
              data that can be passed  to  the  write  callback  is  defined  in  the  curl.h  header  file:
              CURL_MAX_WRITE_SIZE.

       CURLOPT_WRITEDATA
              Data  pointer to pass to the file write function. If you use the <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>WRITEFUNCTION</u> option,
              this is the pointer you'll get as input. If you don't use a callback, you must pass a 'FILE *'
              as libcurl will pass this to fwrite() when writing data.

              The  internal  <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>WRITEFUNCTION</u> will write the data to the FILE * given with this option,
              or to stdout if this option hasn't been set.

              If you're using libcurl as a win32 DLL, you <b>MUST</b> use the <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>WRITEFUNCTION</u> if you set this
              option or you will experience crashes.

              This  option  is  also  known with the older name <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>FILE</u>, the name <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>WRITEDATA</u> was
              introduced in 7.9.7.

       CURLOPT_READFUNCTION
              Function pointer that should match the following prototype: <b>size_t</b> <b>function(</b> <b>void</b> <b>*ptr,</b> <b>size_t</b>
              <b>size,</b> <b>size_t</b> <b>nmemb,</b> <b>void</b> <b>*stream);</b> This function gets called by libcurl as soon as it needs to
              read data in order to send it to the peer. The data area pointed at by the pointer <u>ptr</u> may  be
              filled  with at most <u>size</u> multiplied with <u>nmemb</u> number of bytes. Your function must return the
              actual number of bytes that you stored in that memory area. Returning 0  will  signal  end-of-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">file&nbsp;end-offile</font>
              file to the library and cause it to stop the current transfer.

              If you stop the current transfer by returning 0 "pre-maturely" (i.e before the server expected
              it, like when you've told you will upload N bytes and you upload less than N bytes),  you  may
              experience that the server "hangs" waiting for the rest of the data that won't come.

              The  read  callback  may return <u>CURL</u><b>_</b><u>READFUNC</u><b>_</b><u>ABORT</u> to stop the current operation immediately,
              resulting in a <u>CURLE</u><b>_</b><u>ABORTED</u><b>_</b><u>BY</u><b>_</b><u>CALLBACK</u> error code from the transfer (Added in 7.12.1)

              If you set the callback pointer to NULL, or doesn't set it at all, the default  internal  read
              function  will  be  used.  It  is  simply  doing an fread() on the FILE * stream set with <u>CUR</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">LOPT_READDATA.&nbsp;CURLOPT_READDATA.</font>
              <u>LOPT</u><b>_</b><u>READDATA</u>.

       CURLOPT_READDATA
              Data pointer to pass to the file read function. If you use  the  <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>READFUNCTION</u>  option,
              this is the pointer you'll get as input. If you don't specify a read callback but instead rely
              on the default internal read function, this data must be a valid readable FILE *.

              If you're using libcurl as a win32 DLL, you MUST use a <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>READFUNCTION</u> if  you  set  this
              option.

              This  option  is  also known with the older name <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>INFILE</u>, the name <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>READDATA</u> was
              introduced in 7.9.7.

       CURLOPT_IOCTLFUNCTION
              Function pointer that should match the <u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>ioctl</u><b>_</b><u>callback</u> prototype found  in  <u>&lt;curl/curl.h&gt;</u>.
              This  function gets called by libcurl when something special I/O-related needs to be done that
              the library can't do by itself. For now, rewinding the read data stream is the only action  it
              can  request.  The rewinding of the read data stream may be necessary when doing a HTTP PUT or
              POST with a multi-pass authentication method.  (Option added in 7.12.3)

       CURLOPT_IOCTLDATA
              Pass a pointer that will be untouched by libcurl and passed as the 3rd argument in  the  ioctl
              callback set with <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>IOCTLFUNCTION</u>.  (Option added in 7.12.3)

       CURLOPT_SOCKOPTFUNCTION
              Function pointer that should match the <u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>sockopt</u><b>_</b><u>callback</u> prototype found in <u>&lt;curl/curl.h&gt;</u>.
              This function gets called by libcurl after the socket() call but before  the  connect()  call.
              The  callback's  <u>purpose</u> argument identifies the exact purpose for this particular socket, and
              currently only one value is supported: <u>CURLSOCKTYPE</u><b>_</b><u>IPCXN</u> for the primary connection  (meaning
              the control connection in the FTP case). Future versions of libcurl may support more purposes.
              It passes the newly created socket descriptor so additional setsockopt() calls can be done  at
              the user's discretion.  A non-zero return code from the callback function will signal an unre-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">coverable&nbsp;unrecoverable</font>
              coverable error to the library and it will close the socket and return  <u>CURLE</u><b>_</b><u>COULDNT</u><b>_</b><u>CONNECT</u>.
              (Option added in 7.15.6.)

       CURLOPT_SOCKOPTDATA
              Pass a pointer that will be untouched by libcurl and passed as the first argument in the sock-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">opt&nbsp;sockopt</font>
              opt callback set with <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>SOCKOPTFUNCTION</u>.  (Option added in 7.15.6.)

       CURLOPT_PROGRESSFUNCTION
              Function  pointer  that  should  match   the   <u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>progress</u><b>_</b><u>callback</u>   prototype   found   in
              <u>&lt;curl/curl.h&gt;</u>.  This function gets called by libcurl instead of its internal equivalent with a
              frequent interval during operation (roughly once per second) no matter if data is being trans-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fered&nbsp;transfered</font>
              fered or not.  Unknown/unused argument values passed to the callback will be set to zero (like
              if you only download data, the upload size will remain 0). Returning  a  non-zero  value  from
              this callback will cause libcurl to abort the transfer and return <u>CURLE</u><b>_</b><u>ABORTED</u><b>_</b><u>BY</u><b>_</b><u>CALLBACK</u>.

              If you transfer data with the multi interface, this function will not be called during periods
              of idleness unless you call the appropriate libcurl function that performs transfers. Usage of
              the <b>CURLOPT_PROGRESSFUNCTION</b> callback is not recommended when using the multi interface.

              <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>NOPROGRESS</u> must be set to FALSE to make this function actually get called.

       CURLOPT_PROGRESSDATA
              Pass  a  pointer  that  will  be  untouched by libcurl and passed as the first argument in the
              progress callback set with <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>PROGRESSFUNCTION</u>.

       CURLOPT_HEADERFUNCTION
              Function pointer that should match the following prototype: <u>size</u><b>_</b><u>t</u> <u>function(</u> <u>void</u> <u>*ptr,</u> <u>size</u><b>_</b><u>t</u>
              <u>size,</u>  <u>size</u><b>_</b><u>t</u>  <u>nmemb,</u>  <u>void</u>  <u>*stream);</u>. This function gets called by libcurl as soon as it has
              received header data. The header callback will be called once for each header  and  only  com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">plete&nbsp;complete</font>
              plete  header lines are passed on to the callback. Parsing headers should be easy enough using
              this. The size of the data pointed to by <u>ptr</u> is <u>size</u> multiplied with <u>nmemb</u>. Do not assume that
              the  header line is zero terminated! The pointer named <u>stream</u> is the one you set with the <u>CUR</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">LOPT_WRITEHEADER&nbsp;CURLOPT_WRITEHEADER</font>
              <u>LOPT</u><b>_</b><u>WRITEHEADER</u> option. The callback function must return the number of bytes actually  taken
              care  of,  or return -1 to signal error to the library (it will cause it to abort the transfer
              with a <u>CURLE</u><b>_</b><u>WRITE</u><b>_</b><u>ERROR</u> return code).

              Since 7.14.1: When a server sends a chunked encoded transfer, it may contain a  trailer.  That
              trailer  is  identical  to a HTTP header and if such a trailer is received it is passed to the
              application using this callback as well. There are several ways to detect it being  a  trailer
              and  not  an ordinary header: 1) it comes after the response-body. 2) it comes after the final
              header line (CR LF) 3) a Trailer: header among the response-headers  mention  what  header  to
              expect in the trailer.

       CURLOPT_WRITEHEADER
              (This  option  is  also  known  as  <b>CURLOPT_HEADERDATA</b>) Pass a pointer to be used to write the
              header part of the received data to. If you don't use your own callback to take  care  of  the
              writing,  this must be a valid FILE *. See also the <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>HEADERFUNCTION</u> option above on how
              to set a custom get-all-headers callback.

       CURLOPT_DEBUGFUNCTION
              Function pointer that should match the following prototype: <u>int</u> <u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>debug</u><b>_</b><u>callback</u>  <u>(CURL</u>  <u>*,</u>
              <u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>infotype,</u>  <u>char</u>  <u>*,</u>  <u>size</u><b>_</b><u>t,</u>  <u>void</u>  <u>*);</u> <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>DEBUGFUNCTION</u> replaces the standard debug
              function used when <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>VERBOSE</u>  is in effect. This callback receives debug information, as
              specified  with  the <b>curl_infotype</b> argument. This function must return 0.  The data pointed to
              by the char * passed to this function WILL NOT be zero terminated, but will be exactly of  the
              size as told by the size_t argument.

              Available curl_infotype values:

              CURLINFO_TEXT
                     The data is informational text.

              CURLINFO_HEADER_IN
                     The data is header (or header-like) data received from the peer.

              CURLINFO_HEADER_OUT
                     The data is header (or header-like) data sent to the peer.

              CURLINFO_DATA_IN
                     The data is protocol data received from the peer.

              CURLINFO_DATA_OUT
                     The data is protocol data sent to the peer.

       CURLOPT_DEBUGDATA
              Pass a pointer to whatever you want passed in to your <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>DEBUGFUNCTION</u> in the last void *
              argument. This pointer is not used by libcurl, it is only passed to the callback.

       CURLOPT_SSL_CTX_FUNCTION
              Function pointer that should match the following  prototype:  <b>CURLcode</b>  <b>sslctxfun(CURL</b>  <b>*curl,</b>
              <b>void</b> <b>*sslctx,</b> <b>void</b> <b>*parm);</b> This function gets called by libcurl just before the initialization
              of an SSL connection after having processed all other SSL  related  options  to  give  a  last
              chance  to  an application to modify the behaviour of openssl's ssl initialization. The <u>sslctx</u>
              parameter is actually a pointer to an openssl <u>SSL</u><b>_</b><u>CTX</u>. If an error is returned no  attempt  to
              establish  a connection is made and the perform operation will return the error code from this
              callback function.  Set the <u>parm</u> argument with the <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>SSL</u><b>_</b><u>CTX</u><b>_</b><u>DATA</u>  option.  This  option
              was introduced in 7.11.0.

              This function will get called on all new connections made to a server, during the SSL negotia-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion.&nbsp;negotiation.</font>
              tion. The SSL_CTX pointer will be a new one every time.

              To use this properly, a non-trivial amount of knowledge of the openssl libraries is necessary.
              Using  this  function allows for example to use openssl callbacks to add additional validation
              code for certificates, and even to change the actual URI of an HTTPS request (example used  in
              the lib509 test case).  See also the example section for a replacement of the key, certificate
              and trust file settings.

       CURLOPT_SSL_CTX_DATA
              Data pointer to pass to the ssl context callback set by the  option  <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>SSL</u><b>_</b><u>CTX</u><b>_</b><u>FUNCTION</u>,
              this is the pointer you'll get as third parameter, otherwise <b>NULL</b>. (Added in 7.11.0)

       CURLOPT_CONV_TO_NETWORK_FUNCTION

       CURLOPT_CONV_FROM_NETWORK_FUNCTION

       CURLOPT_CONV_FROM_UTF8_FUNCTION
              Function  pointers  that  should  match  the following prototype: CURLcode function(char *ptr,
              size_t length);

              These  three  options  apply  to  non-ASCII  platforms  only.   They  are  available  only  if
              <b>CURL_DOES_CONVERSIONS</b>  was  defined  when  libcurl was built. When this is the case, <a href="curl_version_info.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/curl_version_info"><u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>ver</u></a>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion_info(3)&nbsp;curl_version_info(3)</font>
              <a href="curl_version_info.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/curl_version_info"><u>sion</u><b>_</b><u>info(3)</u></a><u></u> will return the CURL_VERSION_CONV feature bit set.

              The data to be converted is in a buffer pointed to by the ptr parameter.  The amount  of  data
              to  convert  is indicated by the length parameter.  The converted data overlays the input data
              in the buffer pointed to by the ptr parameter.  CURLE_OK should be  returned  upon  successful
              conversion.   A  CURLcode return value defined by curl.h, such as CURLE_CONV_FAILED, should be
              returned if an error was encountered.

              <b>CURLOPT_CONV_TO_NETWORK_FUNCTION</b> and <b>CURLOPT_CONV_FROM_NETWORK_FUNCTION</b>  convert  between  the
              host  encoding  and  the  network  encoding.   They  are  used when commands or ASCII data are
              sent/received over the network.

              <b>CURLOPT_CONV_FROM_UTF8_FUNCTION</b> is called to convert from UTF8 into the host encoding.  It  is
              required only for SSL processing.

              If  you  set  a  callback  pointer to NULL, or don't set it at all, the built-in libcurl iconv
              functions will be used.  If HAVE_ICONV was not defined when libcurl was built, and no callback
              has been established, conversion will return the CURLE_CONV_REQD error code.

              If HAVE_ICONV is defined, CURL_ICONV_CODESET_OF_HOST must also be defined.  For example:

               #define CURL_ICONV_CODESET_OF_HOST "IBM-1047"

              The iconv code in libcurl will default the network and UTF8 codeset names as follows:

               #define CURL_ICONV_CODESET_OF_NETWORK "ISO8859-1"

               #define CURL_ICONV_CODESET_FOR_UTF8   "UTF-8"

              You will need to override these definitions if they are different on your system.

<b>ERROR</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       CURLOPT_ERRORBUFFER
              Pass  a  char  * to a buffer that the libcurl may store human readable error messages in. This
              may be more helpful than just the return code from <u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>easy</u><b>_</b><u>perform</u>. The buffer  must  be  at
              least CURL_ERROR_SIZE big.

              Use <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>VERBOSE</u> and <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>DEBUGFUNCTION</u> to better debug/trace why errors happen.

              If  the library does not return an error, the buffer may not have been touched. Do not rely on
              the contents in those cases.


       CURLOPT_STDERR
              Pass a FILE * as parameter. Tell libcurl to use this stream instead of stderr when showing the
              progress meter and displaying <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>VERBOSE</u> data.

       CURLOPT_FAILONERROR
              A  non-zero parameter tells the library to fail silently if the HTTP code returned is equal to
              or larger than 400. The default action would be to return the  page  normally,  ignoring  that
              code.

              This  method is not fail-safe and there are occasions where non-successful response codes will
              slip through, especially when authentication is involved (response codes 401 and 407).

              You might get some amounts of headers transferred before this situation is detected, like  for
              when  a  "100-continue"  is  received as a response to a POST/PUT and a 401 or 407 is received
              immediately afterwards.

<b>NETWORK</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       CURLOPT_URL
              The actual URL to deal with. The parameter should be a char * to a zero terminated string. The
              string must remain present until curl no longer needs it, as it doesn't copy the string.

              If the given URL lacks the protocol part ("<a href="http://">http://</a>" or "<a href="ftp://">ftp://</a>" etc), it will attempt to guess
              which protocol to use based on the given host name. If the given protocol of the  set  URL  is
              not  supported,  libcurl  will  return  on  error  (<u>CURLE</u><b>_</b><u>UNSUPPORTED</u><b>_</b><u>PROTOCOL</u>)  when you call
              <a href="curl_easy_perform.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/curl_easy_perform"><u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>easy</u><b>_</b><u>perform(3)</u></a><u></u> or <a href="curl_multi_perform.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/curl_multi_perform"><u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>multi</u><b>_</b><u>perform(3)</u></a><u></u>. Use <a href="curl_version_info.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/curl_version_info"><u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>version</u><b>_</b><u>info(3)</u></a><u></u> for detailed  info  on
              which protocols that are supported.

              The   string   given   to   CURLOPT_URL  must  be  url-encoded  and  following  the  RFC  2396
              (<a href="http://curl.haxx.se/rfc/rfc2396.txt)">http://curl.haxx.se/rfc/rfc2396.txt)</a>

              <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>URL</u> is the only option that <b>must</b> be set before <a href="curl_easy_perform.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/curl_easy_perform"><u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>easy</u><b>_</b><u>perform(3)</u></a><u></u> is called.

       CURLOPT_PROXY
              Set HTTP proxy to use. The parameter should be a char * to a zero  terminated  string  holding
              the  host  name or dotted IP address. To specify port number in this string, append :[port] to
              the end of the host name. The proxy string may be prefixed with [protocol]:// since  any  such
              prefix  will be ignored. The proxy's port number may optionally be specified with the separate
              option <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>PROXYPORT</u>.

              When you tell the library to use an HTTP proxy, libcurl will transparently convert  operations
              to  HTTP even if you specify an FTP URL etc. This may have an impact on what other features of
              the library you can use, such as <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>QUOTE</u> and  similar  FTP  specifics  that  don't  work
              unless  you tunnel through the HTTP proxy. Such tunneling is activated with <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>HTTPPROXY</u>-
              <u>TUNNEL</u>.

              libcurl respects the environment variables <b>http_proxy</b>, <b>ftp_proxy</b>, <b>all_proxy</b>  etc,  if  any  of
              those  is  set.  The  <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>PROXY</u>  option does however override any possibly set environment
              variables.

              Setting the proxy string to "" (an empty string) will explicitly disable the use of  a  proxy,
              even if there is an environment variable set for it.

              Since  7.14.1, the proxy host string given in environment variables can be specified the exact
              same way as the proxy can be set with <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>PROXY</u>, include  protocol  prefix  (<a href="http://)">http://)</a>  and
              embedded user + password.

       CURLOPT_PROXYPORT
              Pass a long with this option to set the proxy port to connect to unless it is specified in the
              proxy string <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>PROXY</u>.

       CURLOPT_PROXYTYPE
              Pass a long with this option to set type of the proxy. Available options for  this  are  <u>CURL</u>-
              <u>PROXY</u><b>_</b><u>HTTP</u>,  <u>CURLPROXY</u><b>_</b><u>SOCKS4</u>  (added  in  7.15.2) <u>CURLPROXY</u><b>_</b><u>SOCKS5</u>. The HTTP type is default.
              (Added in 7.10)

       CURLOPT_HTTPPROXYTUNNEL
              Set the parameter to non-zero to get the library to tunnel all operations through a given HTTP
              proxy.  There is a big difference between using a proxy and to tunnel through it. If you don't
              know what this means, you probably don't want this tunneling option.

       CURLOPT_INTERFACE
              Pass a char * as parameter. This set the interface name to use as outgoing network  interface.
              The name can be an interface name, an IP address or a host name.

       CURLOPT_LOCALPORT
              Pass  a  long.  This sets the local port number of the socket used for connection. This can be
              used in combination with <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>INTERFACE</u> and you are recommended  to  use  <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>LOCALPOR</u>-
              <u>TRANGE</u>  as  well  when this is set. Note that port numbers are only valid 1 - 65535. (Added in
              7.15.2)

       CURLOPT_LOCALPORTRANGE
              Pass a long. This is the number of attempts libcurl should do to find  a  working  local  port
              number.  It starts with the given <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>LOCALPORT</u> and adds one to the number for each retry.
              Setting this value to 1 or below will make libcurl do only one try for exact port number. Note
              that  port  numbers  by nature is a scarce resource that will be busy at times so setting this
              value to something too low might  cause  unnecessary  connection  setup  failures.  (Added  in
              7.15.2)

       CURLOPT_DNS_CACHE_TIMEOUT
              Pass  a  long, this sets the timeout in seconds. Name resolves will be kept in memory for this
              number of seconds. Set to zero (0) to completely disable caching, or set to  -1  to  make  the
              cached entries remain forever. By default, libcurl caches this info for 60 seconds.

       CURLOPT_DNS_USE_GLOBAL_CACHE
              Pass  a long. If the value is non-zero, it tells curl to use a global DNS cache that will sur-
              vive between easy handle creations and deletions. This is not thread-safe and this will use  a
              global variable.

              <b>WARNING:</b>  this  option  is  considered obsolete. Stop using it. Switch over to using the share
              interface instead! See <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>SHARE</u> and <a href="curl_share_init.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/curl_share_init"><u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>share</u><b>_</b><u>init(3)</u></a><u></u>.

       CURLOPT_BUFFERSIZE
              Pass a long specifying your preferred size (in bytes) for the receive buffer in libcurl.   The
              main  point  of  this would be that the write callback gets called more often and with smaller
              chunks. This is just treated as a request, not an order. You cannot be guaranteed to  actually
              get the given size. (Added in 7.10)

              This  size  is by default set as big as possible (CURL_MAX_WRITE_SIZE), so it only makes sense
              to use this option if you want it smaller.

       CURLOPT_PORT
              Pass a long specifying what remote port number to connect to, instead of the one specified  in
              the URL or the default port for the used protocol.

       CURLOPT_TCP_NODELAY
              Pass  a  long specifying whether the TCP_NODELAY option should be set or cleared (1 = set, 0 =
              clear). The option is cleared by default. This will have no effect after  the  connection  has
              been established.

              Setting  this  option  will disable TCP's Nagle algorithm. The purpose of this algorithm is to
              try to minimize the number of small packets on the network (where "small  packets"  means  TCP
              segments less than the Maximum Segment Size (MSS) for the network).

              Maximizing  the  amount of data sent per TCP segment is good because it amortizes the overhead
              of the send. However, in some cases (most notably telnet or rlogin) small segments may need to
              be  sent  without delay. This is less efficient than sending larger amounts of data at a time,
              and can contribute to congestion on the network if overdone.

<b>NAMES</b> <b>and</b> <b>PASSWORDS</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> <b>(Authentication)</b>
       CURLOPT_NETRC
              This parameter controls the preference of libcurl between using user names and passwords  from
              your <u>~/.netrc</u> file, relative to user names and passwords in the URL supplied with <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>URL</u>.

              libcurl uses a user name (and supplied or prompted password) supplied with <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>USERPWD</u>  in
              preference to any of the options controlled by this parameter.

              Pass a long, set to one of the values described below.

              CURL_NETRC_OPTIONAL
                     The  use  of  your  <u>~/.netrc</u> file is optional, and information in the URL is to be pre-
                     ferred.  The file will be scanned with the host and user name  (to  find  the  password
                     only)  or  with  the  host  only,  to  find the first user name and password after that
                     <u>machine</u>, which ever information is not specified in the URL.

                     Undefined values of the option will have this effect.

              CURL_NETRC_IGNORED
                     The library will ignore the file and use only the information in the URL.

                     This is the default.

              CURL_NETRC_REQUIRED
                     This value tells the library that use of the file is required, to ignore  the  informa-
                     tion in the URL, and to search the file with the host only.
       Only  machine  name,  user  name  and password are taken into account (init macros and similar things
       aren't supported).

       libcurl does not verify that the file has the correct properties set (as the standard Unix ftp client
       does). It should only be readable by user.

       CURLOPT_NETRC_FILE
              Pass a char * as parameter, pointing to a zero terminated string containing the full path name
              to the file you want libcurl to use as .netrc file.  If  this  option  is  omitted,  and  <u>CUR</u>-
              <u>LOPT</u><b>_</b><u>NETRC</u>  is  set, libcurl will attempt to find the a .netrc file in the current user's home
              directory. (Added in 7.10.9)

       CURLOPT_USERPWD
              Pass a char * as parameter, which should be [user name]:[password] to use for the  connection.
              Use <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>HTTPAUTH</u> to decide authentication method.

              When  using  NTLM,  you  can  set  domain by prepending it to the user name and separating the
              domain and name with a forward (/) or backward slash (\). Like this: "domain/user:password" or
              "domain\user:password".  Some  HTTP  servers  (on  Windows)  support this style even for Basic
              authentication.

              When using HTTP and <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>FOLLOWLOCATION</u>, libcurl might perform several requests to possibly
              different  hosts. libcurl will only send this user and password information to hosts using the
              initial host name (unless <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>UNRESTRICTED</u><b>_</b><u>AUTH</u> is set), so if libcurl  follows  locations
              to  other  hosts  it will not send the user and password to those. This is enforced to prevent
              accidental information leakage.

       CURLOPT_PROXYUSERPWD
              Pass a char * as parameter, which should be [user name]:[password] to use for  the  connection
              to the HTTP proxy.  Use <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>PROXYAUTH</u> to decide authentication method.

       CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH
              Pass  a  long  as  parameter,  which  is set to a bitmask, to tell libcurl what authentication
              <!-- a -->method(s)<!-- /a --> you want it to use. The available bits are listed below. If more  than  one  bit  is
              set, libcurl will first query the site to see what authentication methods it supports and then
              pick the best one you allow it to use. For some methods, this will  induce  an  extra  network
              round-trip.  Set  the  actual  name  and  password  with the <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>USERPWD</u> option. (Added in
              7.10.6)

              CURLAUTH_BASIC
                     HTTP Basic authentication. This is the default choice, and the only method that  is  in
                     wide-spread  use  and supported virtually everywhere. This is sending the user name and
                     password over the network in plain text, easily captured by others.

              CURLAUTH_DIGEST
                     HTTP Digest authentication.  Digest authentication is defined in RFC2617 and is a  more
                     secure  way  to  do  authentication over public networks than the regular old-fashioned
                     Basic method.

              CURLAUTH_GSSNEGOTIATE
                     HTTP GSS-Negotiate authentication. The GSS-Negotiate (also known as plain  "Negotiate")
                     method was designed by Microsoft and is used in their web applications. It is primarily
                     meant as a support for Kerberos5 authentication but may be also used along with another
                     authentication  methods.  For  more  information  see  IETF  draft draft-brezak-spnego-
                     http-04.txt.

                     You need to build libcurl with a suitable GSS-API library for this to work.

              CURLAUTH_NTLM
                     HTTP NTLM authentication. A proprietary protocol invented and  used  by  Microsoft.  It
                     uses  a  challenge-response and hash concept similar to Digest, to prevent the password
                     from being eavesdropped.

                     You need to build libcurl with OpenSSL support  for  this  option  to  work,  or  build
                     libcurl on Windows.

              CURLAUTH_ANY
                     This is a convenience macro that sets all bits and thus makes libcurl pick any it finds
                     suitable. libcurl will automatically select the one it finds most secure.

              CURLAUTH_ANYSAFE
                     This is a convenience macro that sets all bits except Basic and thus makes libcurl pick
                     any  it finds suitable. libcurl will automatically select the one it finds most secure.

       CURLOPT_PROXYAUTH
              Pass a long as parameter, which is set to a  bitmask,  to  tell  libcurl  what  authentication
              <!-- a -->method(s)<!-- /a -->  you  want  it  to  use for your proxy authentication.  If more than one bit is set,
              libcurl will first query the site to see what authentication methods it supports and then pick
              the  best  one you allow it to use. For some methods, this will induce an extra network round-
              trip. Set the actual name and password with the <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>PROXYUSERPWD</u> option. The  bitmask  can
              be constructed by or'ing together the bits listed above for the <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>HTTPAUTH</u> option. As of
              this writing, only Basic, Digest and NTLM work. (Added in 7.10.7)

<b>HTTP</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       CURLOPT_AUTOREFERER
              Pass a non-zero parameter to enable this. When enabled, libcurl  will  automatically  set  the
              Referer: field in requests where it follows a Location: redirect.

       CURLOPT_ENCODING
              Sets the contents of the Accept-Encoding: header sent in an HTTP request, and enables decoding
              of a response when a Content-Encoding: header is received.   Three  encodings  are  supported:
              <u>identity</u>, which does nothing, <u>deflate</u> which requests the server to compress its response using
              the zlib algorithm, and <u>gzip</u> which requests the gzip algorithm.  If a  zero-length  string  is
              set, then an Accept-Encoding: header containing all supported encodings is sent.

              This is a request, not an order; the server may or may not do it.  This option must be set (to
              any non-NULL value) or else any unsolicited encoding done by the server is  ignored.  See  the
              special file lib/README.encoding for details.

       CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION
              A non-zero parameter tells the library to follow any Location: header that the server sends as
              part of an HTTP header.

              This means that the library will re-send the same request on the new location and  follow  new
              Location:  headers  all the way until no more such headers are returned. <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>MAXREDIRS</u> can
              be used to limit the number of redirects libcurl will follow.

       CURLOPT_UNRESTRICTED_AUTH
              A non-zero parameter tells the library it can continue to send authentication  (user+password)
              when following locations, even when hostname changed. This option is meaningful only when set-
              ting <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>FOLLOWLOCATION</u>.

       CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS
              Pass a long. The set number will be the redirection limit. If that many redirections have been
              followed,  the  next redirect will cause an error (<u>CURLE</u><b>_</b><u>TOO</u><b>_</b><u>MANY</u><b>_</b><u>REDIRECTS</u>). This option only
              makes sense if the <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>FOLLOWLOCATION</u> is used at the same time. Added in  7.15.1:  Setting
              the  limit  to 0 will make libcurl refuse any redirect. Set it to -1 for an infinite number of
              redirects (which is the default)

       CURLOPT_PUT
              A non-zero parameter tells the library to use HTTP PUT to transfer data. The  data  should  be
              set with <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>READDATA</u> and <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>INFILESIZE</u>.

              This  option  is  deprecated  and  starting  with  version  7.12.1 you should instead use <u>CUR</u>-
              <u>LOPT</u><b>_</b><u>UPLOAD</u>.

       CURLOPT_POST
              A non-zero parameter tells the library to do a regular HTTP post.  This  will  also  make  the
              library  use  the  a "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" header. (This is by far
              the most commonly used POST method).

              Use the <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>POSTFIELDS</u> option to specify what data to post  and  <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>POSTFIELDSIZE</u>  to
              set the data size.

              Optionally,  you  can provide data to POST using the <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>READFUNCTION</u> and <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>READDATA</u>
              options but then you must make sure to not set <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>POSTFIELDS</u> to anything but  NULL.  When
              providing  data  with  a callback, you must transmit it using chunked transfer-encoding or you
              must set the size of the data with the <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>POSTFIELDSIZE</u> option.

              You can override the default POST Content-Type: header by setting your own with  <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>HTTP</u>-
              <u>HEADER</u>.

              Using  POST with HTTP 1.1 implies the use of a "Expect: 100-continue" header.  You can disable
              this header with <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>HTTPHEADER</u> as usual.

              If you use POST to a HTTP 1.1 server, you can send data without knowing the size before start-
              ing  the  POST if you use chunked encoding. You enable this by adding a header like "Transfer-
              Encoding: chunked" with <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>HTTPHEADER</u>. With HTTP 1.0 or  without  chunked  transfer,  you
              must specify the size in the request.

              When  setting  <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>POST</u> to a non-zero value, it will automatically set <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>NOBODY</u> to 0
              (since 7.14.1).

              If you issue a POST request and then want to make a HEAD or GET using the same re-used handle,
              you  must explicitly set the new request type using <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>NOBODY</u> or <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>HTTPGET</u> or simi-
              lar.

       CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS
              Pass a char * as parameter, which should be the full data to post in an HTTP  POST  operation.
              You  must  make  sure  that  the  data is formatted the way you want the server to receive it.
              libcurl will not convert or encode it for you. Most web servers will assume this  data  to  be
              url-encoded. Take note.

              This  POST  is a normal application/x-www-form-urlencoded kind (and libcurl will set that Con-
              tent-Type by default when this option is used), which is the most commonly used  one  by  HTML
              forms. See also the <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>POST</u>. Using <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>POSTFIELDS</u> implies <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>POST</u>.

              Using  POST with HTTP 1.1 implies the use of a "Expect: 100-continue" header.  You can disable
              this header with <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>HTTPHEADER</u> as usual.

              To make multipart/formdata posts (aka rfc1867-posts), check out the <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>HTTPPOST</u> option.

       CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE
              If you want to post data to the server without letting libcurl do a strlen()  to  measure  the
              data  size, this option must be used. When this option is used you can post fully binary data,
              which otherwise is likely to fail. If this size is set to -1, the library will use strlen() to
              get the size.

       CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE_LARGE
              Pass  a  curl_off_t  as  parameter. Use this to set the size of the <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>POSTFIELDS</u> data to
              prevent libcurl from doing strlen() on the data to figure out the size. This is the large file
              version of the <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>POSTFIELDSIZE</u> option. (Added in 7.11.1)

       CURLOPT_HTTPPOST
              Tells libcurl you want a multipart/formdata HTTP POST to be made and you instruct what data to
              pass on to the server.  Pass a pointer to a linked list of curl_httppost structs as parameter.
              .  The easiest way to create such a list, is to use <a href="curl_formadd.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/curl_formadd"><u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>formadd(3)</u></a><u></u> as documented. The data in
              this list must remain intact until you close this curl handle again with <a href="curl_easy_cleanup.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/curl_easy_cleanup"><u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>easy</u><b>_</b><u>cleanup(3)</u></a><u></u>.

              Using  POST with HTTP 1.1 implies the use of a "Expect: 100-continue" header.  You can disable
              this header with <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>HTTPHEADER</u> as usual.

              When setting <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>HTTPPOST</u>, it will automatically set <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>NOBODY</u> to 0 (since 7.14.1).

       CURLOPT_REFERER
              Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as parameter. It will be used to set  the  Referer:
              header  in  the  http  request  sent to the remote server. This can be used to fool servers or
              scripts. You can also set any custom header with <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>HTTPHEADER</u>.

       CURLOPT_USERAGENT
              Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as parameter. It will be  used  to  set  the  User-
              Agent:  header in the http request sent to the remote server. This can be used to fool servers
              or scripts. You can also set any custom header with <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>HTTPHEADER</u>.

       CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER
              Pass a pointer to a linked list of HTTP headers to pass to the server in  your  HTTP  request.
              The  linked list should be a fully valid list of <b>struct</b> <b>curl_slist</b> structs properly filled in.
              Use <a href="curl_slist_append.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/curl_slist_append"><u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>slist</u><b>_</b><u>append(3)</u></a><u></u> to create the list and <a href="curl_slist_free_all.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/curl_slist_free_all"><u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>slist</u><b>_</b><u>free</u><b>_</b><u>all(3)</u></a><u></u> to clean up  an  entire
              list.  If  you  add  a header that is otherwise generated and used by libcurl internally, your
              added one will be used instead. If you add a header with no contents as in 'Accept:' (no  data
              on  the  right  side  of the colon), the internally used header will get disabled. Thus, using
              this option you can add new headers, replace internal headers and remove internal headers.  To
              add  a  header  with no contents, make the contents be two quotes: "". The headers included in
              the linked list must not be CRLF-terminated, because curl adds CRLF after  each  header  item.
              Failure  to  comply  with this will result in strange bugs because the server will most likely
              ignore part of the headers you specified.

              The first line in a request (containing the method, usually a GET or POST) is not a header and
              cannot  be  replaced using this option. Only the lines following the request-line are headers.
              Adding this method line in this list of headers will  only  cause  your  request  to  send  an
              invalid header.

              Pass a NULL to this to reset back to no custom headers.

              The  most  commonly  replaced  headers  have  "shortcuts"  in the options <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>COOKIE</u>, <u>CUR</u>-
              <u>LOPT</u><b>_</b><u>USERAGENT</u> and <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>REFERER</u>.

       CURLOPT_HTTP200ALIASES
              Pass a pointer to a linked list of aliases to be treated as valid HTTP  200  responses.   Some
              servers respond with a custom header response line.  For example, IceCast servers respond with
              "ICY 200 OK".  By including this string in your list of aliases, the response will be  treated
              as a valid HTTP header line such as "HTTP/1.0 200 OK". (Added in 7.10.3)

              The  linked  list  should  be a fully valid list of struct curl_slist structs, and be properly
              filled in.  Use <a href="curl_slist_append.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/curl_slist_append"><u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>slist</u><b>_</b><u>append(3)</u></a><u></u> to create the list and <a href="curl_slist_free_all.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/curl_slist_free_all"><u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>slist</u><b>_</b><u>free</u><b>_</b><u>all(3)</u></a><u></u> to clean up
              an entire list.

              The  alias  itself  is not parsed for any version strings. Before libcurl 7.16.3, Libcurl used
              the value set by option <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>HTTP</u><b>_</b><u>VERSION</u>, but starting with 7.16.3 the protocol is assumed
              to match HTTP 1.0 when an alias matched.

       CURLOPT_COOKIE
              Pass  a  pointer  to a zero terminated string as parameter. It will be used to set a cookie in
              the http request. The format of the string should be NAME=CONTENTS, where NAME is  the  cookie
              name and CONTENTS is what the cookie should contain.

              If  you  need to set multiple cookies, you need to set them all using a single option and thus
              you need to concatenate them all in one single string. Set multiple cookies in one string like
              this: "name1=content1; name2=content2;" etc.

              Using  this  option  multiple  times  will only make the latest string override the previously
              ones.

       CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE
              Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as parameter. It should contain the  name  of  your
              file  holding  cookie  data  to read. The cookie data may be in Netscape / Mozilla cookie data
              format or just regular HTTP-style headers dumped to a file.

              Given an empty or non-existing file or by passing the empty  string  (""),  this  option  will
              enable  cookies for this curl handle, making it understand and parse received cookies and then
              use matching cookies in future request.

              If you use this option multiple times, you just add more files to read.  Subsequent files will
              add more cookies.

       CURLOPT_COOKIEJAR
              Pass a file name as char *, zero terminated. This will make libcurl write all internally known
              cookies to the specified file when <a href="curl_easy_cleanup.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/curl_easy_cleanup"><u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>easy</u><b>_</b><u>cleanup(3)</u></a><u></u> is called. If no cookies are known, no
              file  will  be  created. Specify "-" to instead have the cookies written to stdout. Using this
              option also enables cookies for this session, so if you for example follow a location it  will
              make matching cookies get sent accordingly.

              If  the  cookie  jar  file  can't  be  created or written to (when the <a href="curl_easy_cleanup.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/curl_easy_cleanup"><u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>easy</u><b>_</b><u>cleanup(3)</u></a><u></u> is
              called), libcurl will not and cannot report an error for this. Using <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>VERBOSE</u>  or  <u>CUR</u>-
              <u>LOPT</u><b>_</b><u>DEBUGFUNCTION</u>  will  get  a warning to display, but that is the only visible feedback you
              get about this possibly lethal situation.

       CURLOPT_COOKIESESSION
              Pass a long set to non-zero to mark this as a new cookie "session". It will force  libcurl  to
              ignore  all  cookies it is about to load that are "session cookies" from the previous session.
              By default, libcurl always stores and loads all cookies, independent if they are session cook-
              ies  are  not.  Session cookies are cookies without expiry date and they are meant to be alive
              and existing for this "session" only.

       CURLOPT_COOKIELIST
              Pass a char * to a cookie string. Cookie can be either in Netscape / Mozilla  format  or  just
              regular  HTTP-style  header (Set-Cookie: ...) format. If cURL cookie engine was not enabled it
              will enable its cookie engine.  Passing a magic string "ALL" will erase all cookies  known  by
              cURL.  (Added in 7.14.1) Passing the special string "SESS" will only erase all session cookies
              known by cURL. (Added in 7.15.4)

       CURLOPT_HTTPGET
              Pass a long. If the long is non-zero, this forces the HTTP request to get back to GET.  usable
              if a POST, HEAD, PUT or a custom request have been used previously using the same curl handle.

              When setting <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>HTTPGET</u> to a non-zero value, it will automatically set <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>NOBODY</u>  to
              0 (since 7.14.1).

       CURLOPT_HTTP_VERSION
              Pass  a long, set to one of the values described below. They force libcurl to use the specific
              HTTP versions. This is not sensible to do unless you have a good reason.

              CURL_HTTP_VERSION_NONE
                     We don't care about what version the library uses. libcurl will use whatever it  thinks
                     fit.

              CURL_HTTP_VERSION_1_0
                     Enforce HTTP 1.0 requests.

              CURL_HTTP_VERSION_1_1
                     Enforce HTTP 1.1 requests.

              CURLOPT_IGNORE_CONTENT_LENGTH
                     Ignore  the  Content-Length header. This is useful for Apache 1.x (and similar servers)
                     which will report incorrect content length for files over 2 gigabytes. If  this  option
                     is  used, curl will not be able to accurately report progress, and will simply stop the
                     download when the server ends the connection. (added in 7.14.1)

              CURLOPT_HTTP_CONTENT_DECODING
                     Pass a long to tell libcurl how to act on content decoding. If  set  to  zero,  content
                     decoding  will be disabled. If set to 1 it is enabled. Note however that libcurl has no
                     default content decoding but requires you to use <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>ENCODING</u> for that.  (added  in
                     7.16.2)

              CURLOPT_HTTP_TRANSFER_DECODING
                     Pass  a  long to tell libcurl how to act on transfer decoding. If set to zero, transfer
                     decoding will be disabled, if set to 1 it is enabled (default).  libcurl  does  chunked
                     transfer decoding by default unless this option is set to zero. (added in 7.16.2)

<b>FTP</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       CURLOPT_FTPPORT
              Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as parameter. It will be used to get the IP address
              to use for the ftp PORT instruction. The PORT instruction tells the remote server  to  connect
              to  our  specified  IP  address. The string may be a plain IP address, a host name, an network
              interface name (under Unix) or just a '-' letter to let the library use your  systems  default
              IP address. Default FTP operations are passive, and thus won't use PORT.

              You  disable  PORT  again  and  go back to using the passive version by setting this option to
              NULL.

       CURLOPT_QUOTE
              Pass a pointer to a linked list of FTP or SFTP commands to pass to the server  prior  to  your
              ftp  request. This will be done before any other commands are issued (even before the CWD com-
              mand for FTP). The linked list should be a fully valid list  of  'struct  curl_slist'  structs
              properly filled in with text strings. Use <a href="curl_slist_append.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/curl_slist_append"><u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>slist</u><b>_</b><u>append(3)</u></a><u></u> to append strings (commands) to
              the list, and clear the entire list afterwards with <a href="curl_slist_free_all.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/curl_slist_free_all"><u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>slist</u><b>_</b><u>free</u><b>_</b><u>all(3)</u></a><u></u>. Disable this oper-
              ation again by setting a NULL to this option.

       CURLOPT_POSTQUOTE
              Pass  a  pointer to a linked list of FTP or SFTP commands to pass to the server after your ftp
              transfer request. The linked list should be a fully valid list of  struct  curl_slist  structs
              properly  filled  in as described for <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>QUOTE</u>. Disable this operation again by setting a
              NULL to this option.

       CURLOPT_PREQUOTE
              Pass a pointer to a linked list of FTP commands to pass to the server after the transfer  type
              is  set.  The  linked  list should be a fully valid list of struct curl_slist structs properly
              filled in as described for <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>QUOTE</u>. Disable this operation again by setting  a  NULL  to
              this  option.  Before  version  7.15.6,  if  you also set <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>NOBODY</u> non-zero, this option
              didn't work.

       CURLOPT_FTPLISTONLY
              A non-zero parameter tells the library to just list the names of an ftp directory, instead  of
              doing a full directory listing that would include file sizes, dates etc.

              This  causes  an FTP NLST command to be sent.  Beware that some FTP servers list only files in
              their response to NLST; they might not include subdirectories and symbolic links.

       CURLOPT_FTPAPPEND
              A non-zero parameter tells the library to append to the remote file instead of  overwrite  it.
              This is only useful when uploading to an ftp site.

       CURLOPT_FTP_USE_EPRT
              Pass  a  long. If the value is non-zero, it tells curl to use the EPRT (and LPRT) command when
              doing active FTP downloads (which is enabled by <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>FTPPORT</u>). Using  EPRT  means  that  it
              will  first  attempt to use EPRT and then LPRT before using PORT, but if you pass FALSE (zero)
              to this option, it will not try using EPRT or LPRT, only plain PORT. (Added in 7.10.5)

              If the server is an IPv6 host, this option will have no effect as of 7.12.3.

       CURLOPT_FTP_USE_EPSV
              Pass a long. If the value is non-zero, it tells curl to use the EPSV command when  doing  pas-
              sive  FTP  downloads  (which  it  always does by default). Using EPSV means that it will first
              attempt to use EPSV before using PASV, but if you pass FALSE (zero) to this  option,  it  will
              not try using EPSV, only plain PASV.

              If the server is an IPv6 host, this option will have no effect as of 7.12.3.

       CURLOPT_FTP_CREATE_MISSING_DIRS
              Pass  a  long. If the value is non-zero, curl will attempt to create any remote directory that
              it fails to CWD into. CWD is the command that changes working directory. (Added in 7.10.7)

              This setting also applies to SFTP-connections. curl will attempt to create the  remote  direc-
              tory  if  it can't obtain a handle to the target-location. The creation will fail if a file of
              the same name as the directory to create already exists or lack of permissions  prevents  cre-
              ation. (Added in 7.16.3)

       CURLOPT_FTP_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT
              Pass  a long.  Causes curl to set a timeout period (in seconds) on the amount of time that the
              server is allowed to take in order to generate a response message for  a  command  before  the
              session  is  considered hung.  While curl is waiting for a response, this value overrides <u>CUR</u>-
              <u>LOPT</u><b>_</b><u>TIMEOUT</u>. It is recommended that if used in conjunction with <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>TIMEOUT</u>, you set <u>CUR</u>-
              <u>LOPT</u><b>_</b><u>FTP</u><b>_</b><u>RESPONSE</u><b>_</b><u>TIMEOUT</u> to a value smaller than <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>TIMEOUT</u>.  (Added in 7.10.8)

       CURLOPT_FTP_ALTERNATIVE_TO_USER
              Pass  a  char  *  as parameter, pointing to a string which will be used to authenticate if the
              usual FTP "USER user" and "PASS password" negotiation fails. This is currently only  known  to
              be required when connecting to Tumbleweed's Secure Transport FTPS server using client certifi-
              cates for authentication. (Added in 7.15.5)

       CURLOPT_FTP_SKIP_PASV_IP
              Pass a long. If set to a non-zero value, it instructs libcurl to not use the  IP  address  the
              server  suggests  in its 227-response to libcurl's PASV command when libcurl connects the data
              connection. Instead libcurl will re-use the same IP address it already uses  for  the  control
              connection. But it will use the port number from the 227-response. (Added in 7.14.2)

              This option has no effect if PORT, EPRT or EPSV is used instead of PASV.

       CURLOPT_FTP_SSL
              Pass  a long using one of the values from below, to make libcurl use your desired level of SSL
              for the ftp transfer. (Added in 7.11.0)

              CURLFTPSSL_NONE
                     Don't attempt to use SSL.

              CURLFTPSSL_TRY
                     Try using SSL, proceed as normal otherwise.

              CURLFTPSSL_CONTROL
                     Require SSL for the control connection or fail with <u>CURLE</u><b>_</b><u>FTP</u><b>_</b><u>SSL</u><b>_</b><u>FAILED</u>.

              CURLFTPSSL_ALL
                     Require SSL for all communication or fail with <u>CURLE</u><b>_</b><u>FTP</u><b>_</b><u>SSL</u><b>_</b><u>FAILED</u>.

       CURLOPT_FTPSSLAUTH
              Pass a long using one of the values from below, to alter how  libcurl  issues  "AUTH  TLS"  or
              "AUTH SSL" when FTP over SSL is activated (see <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>FTP</u><b>_</b><u>SSL</u>). (Added in 7.12.2)

              CURLFTPAUTH_DEFAULT
                     Allow libcurl to decide

              CURLFTPAUTH_SSL
                     Try "AUTH SSL" first, and only if that fails try "AUTH TLS"

              CURLFTPAUTH_TLS
                     Try "AUTH TLS" first, and only if that fails try "AUTH SSL"

       CURLOPT_FTP_SSL_CCC
              If  enabled,  this  option  makes  libcurl  use CCC (Clear Command Channel). It shuts down the
              SSL/TLS layer after authenticating. The rest of the  control  channel  communication  will  be
              unencrypted.  This  allows NAT routers to follow the FTP transaction. Pass a long using one of
              the values below.  (Added in 7.16.1)

              CURLFTPSSL_CCC_NONE
                     Don't attempt to use CCC.

              CURLFTPSSL_CCC_PASSIVE
                     Do not initiate the shutdown, but wait for the server to do it. Do not send a reply.

              CURLFTPSSL_CCC_ACTIVE
                     Initiate the shutdown and wait for a reply.

       CURLOPT_FTP_ACCOUNT
              Pass a pointer to a zero-terminated string (or NULL to disable). When an FTP server  asks  for
              "account data" after user name and password has been provided, this data is sent off using the
              ACCT command. (Added in 7.13.0)

       CURLOPT_FTP_FILEMETHOD
              Pass a long that should have one of the following values. This  option  controls  what  method
              libcurl  should use to reach a file on a <!-- a -->FTP(S)<!-- /a --> server. The argument should be one of the fol-
              lowing alternatives:

              CURLFTPMETHOD_MULTICWD
                     libcurl does a single CWD operation for each path part in the given URL. For deep hier-
                     archies this means very many commands. This is how RFC1738 says it should be done. This
                     is the default but the slowest behavior.

              CURLFTPMETHOD_NOCWD
                     libcurl does no CWD at all. libcurl will do SIZE, RETR, STOR etc and give a  full  path
                     to the server for all these commands. This is the fastest behavior.

              CURLFTPMETHOD_SINGLECWD
                     libcurl does one CWD with the full target directory and then operates on the file "nor-
                     mally" (like in the multicwd case). This is  somewhat  more  standards  compliant  than
                     'nocwd' but without the full penalty of 'multicwd'.

<b>PROTOCOL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       CURLOPT_TRANSFERTEXT
              A  non-zero  parameter  tells  the library to use ASCII mode for ftp transfers, instead of the
              default binary transfer. For win32 systems it does not set the stdout  to  binary  mode.  This
              option  can be usable when transferring text data between systems with different views on cer-
              tain characters, such as newlines or similar.

              libcurl does not do a complete ASCII conversion when doing ASCII transfers over FTP. This is a
              known  limitation/flaw  that  nobody  has rectified. libcurl simply sets the mode to ascii and
              performs a standard transfer.

       CURLOPT_CRLF
              Convert Unix newlines to CRLF newlines on transfers.

       CURLOPT_RANGE
              Pass a char * as parameter, which should contain the specified range you want. It should be in
              the format "X-Y", where X or Y may be left out. HTTP transfers also support several intervals,
              separated with commas as in <u>"X-Y,N-M"</u>. Using this kind of multiple intervals  will  cause  the
              HTTP  server  to  send  the  response document in pieces (using standard MIME separation tech-
              niques). Pass a NULL to this option to disable the use of ranges.

       CURLOPT_RESUME_FROM
              Pass a long as parameter. It contains the offset in number of bytes that you want the transfer
              to start from. Set this option to 0 to make the transfer start from the beginning (effectively
              disabling resume). For FTP, set this option to -1 to make the transfer start from the  end  of
              the target file (useful to continue an interrupted upload).

       CURLOPT_RESUME_FROM_LARGE
              Pass  a  curl_off_t  as parameter. It contains the offset in number of bytes that you want the
              transfer to start from. (Added in 7.11.0)

       CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST
              Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as parameter. It will be user  instead  of  GET  or
              HEAD  when doing an HTTP request, or instead of LIST or NLST when doing an ftp directory list-
              ing. This is useful for doing DELETE or other more or less obscure  HTTP  requests.  Don't  do
              this at will, make sure your server supports the command first.

              Restore to the internal default by setting this to NULL.

              Many  people  have  wrongly  used  this  option  to replace the entire request with their own,
              including multiple headers and POST contents. While that might work in  many  cases,  it  will
              cause  libcurl to send invalid requests and it could possibly confuse the remote server badly.
              Use <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>POST</u> and <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>POSTFIELDS</u> to set POST data. Use <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>HTTPHEADER</u> to replace or
              extend the set of headers sent by libcurl. Use <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>HTTP</u><b>_</b><u>VERSION</u> to change HTTP version.

       CURLOPT_FILETIME
              Pass  a  long. If it is a non-zero value, libcurl will attempt to get the modification date of
              the remote document in this operation. This requires that the remote server sends the time  or
              replies  to a time querying command. The <a href="curl_easy_getinfo.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/curl_easy_getinfo"><u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>easy</u><b>_</b><u>getinfo(3)</u></a><u></u> function with the <u>CURLINFO</u><b>_</b><u>FILE</u>-
              <u>TIME</u> argument can be used after a transfer to extract the received time (if any).

       CURLOPT_NOBODY
              A non-zero parameter tells the library to not include the body-part in  the  output.  This  is
              only relevant for protocols that have separate header and body parts. On <!-- a -->HTTP(S)<!-- /a --> servers, this
              will make libcurl do a HEAD request.

              To change request to GET, you should use <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>HTTPGET</u>. Change request  to  POST  with  <u>CUR</u>-
              <u>LOPT</u><b>_</b><u>POST</u> etc.

       CURLOPT_INFILESIZE
              When  uploading  a  file to a remote site, this option should be used to tell libcurl what the
              expected size of the infile is. This  value  should  be  passed  as  a  long.  See  also  <u>CUR</u>-
              <u>LOPT</u><b>_</b><u>INFILESIZE</u><b>_</b><u>LARGE</u>.

              For uploading using SCP, this option or <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>INFILESIZE</u><b>_</b><u>LARGE</u> is mandatory.

              Note that this option does not limit how much data libcurl will actually send, as that is con-
              trolled entirely by what the read callback returns.

       CURLOPT_INFILESIZE_LARGE
              When uploading a file to a remote site, this option should be used to tell  libcurl  what  the
              expected  size  of  the  infile  is.   This  value should be passed as a curl_off_t. (Added in
              7.11.0)

              For uploading using SCP, this option or <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>INFILESIZE</u> is mandatory.

              Note that this option does not limit how much data libcurl will actually send, as that is con-
              trolled entirely by what the read callback returns.

       CURLOPT_UPLOAD
              A non-zero parameter tells the library to prepare for an upload. The <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>READDATA</u> and <u>CUR</u>-
              <u>LOPT</u><b>_</b><u>INFILESIZE</u> or <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>INFILESIZE</u><b>_</b><u>LARGE</u> options are also interesting for uploads.  If  the
              protocol is HTTP, uploading means using the PUT request unless you tell libcurl otherwise.

              Using  PUT  with HTTP 1.1 implies the use of a "Expect: 100-continue" header.  You can disable
              this header with <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>HTTPHEADER</u> as usual.

              If you use PUT to a HTTP 1.1 server, you can upload  data  without  knowing  the  size  before
              starting  the  transfer  if  you use chunked encoding. You enable this by adding a header like
              "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" with <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>HTTPHEADER</u>. With HTTP 1.0 or without chunked  trans-
              fer, you must specify the size.

       CURLOPT_MAXFILESIZE
              Pass  a long as parameter. This allows you to specify the maximum size (in bytes) of a file to
              download. If the file requested is larger than this value, the transfer  will  not  start  and
              CURLE_FILESIZE_EXCEEDED will be returned.

              The  file  size  is  not always known prior to download, and for such files this option has no
              effect even if the file transfer ends up being larger than this  given  limit.  This  concerns
              both FTP and HTTP transfers.

       CURLOPT_MAXFILESIZE_LARGE
              Pass  a  curl_off_t  as parameter. This allows you to specify the maximum size (in bytes) of a
              file to download. If the file requested is larger than this value, the transfer will not start
              and <u>CURLE</u><b>_</b><u>FILESIZE</u><b>_</b><u>EXCEEDED</u> will be returned. (Added in 7.11.0)

              The  file  size  is  not always known prior to download, and for such files this option has no
              effect even if the file transfer ends up being larger than this  given  limit.  This  concerns
              both FTP and HTTP transfers.

       CURLOPT_TIMECONDITION
              Pass  a  long  as parameter. This defines how the <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>TIMEVALUE</u> time value is treated. You
              can set this parameter to <u>CURL</u><b>_</b><u>TIMECOND</u><b>_</b><u>IFMODSINCE</u> or <u>CURL</u><b>_</b><u>TIMECOND</u><b>_</b><u>IFUNMODSINCE</u>. This feature
              applies to HTTP and FTP.

              The  last  modification  time of a file is not always known and in such instances this feature
              will have no effect even if the given time condition would have not been met.

       CURLOPT_TIMEVALUE
              Pass a long as parameter. This should be the time in seconds since 1 jan 1970,  and  the  time
              will be used in a condition as specified with <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>TIMECONDITION</u>.

<b>CONNECTION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       CURLOPT_TIMEOUT
              Pass  a  long  as  parameter containing the maximum time in seconds that you allow the libcurl
              transfer operation to take. Normally, name lookups can take a considerable time  and  limiting
              operations  to  less than a few minutes risk aborting perfectly normal operations. This option
              will cause curl to use the SIGALRM to enable time-outing system calls.

              In unix-like systems, this might cause signals to be used unless <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>NOSIGNAL</u> is set.

       CURLOPT_TIMEOUT_MS
              Like <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>TIMEOUT</u> but takes number of milliseconds instead. If libcurl is built to use  the
              standard  system  name resolver, that part will still use full-second resolution for timeouts.
              (Added in 7.16.2)

       CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT
              Pass a long as parameter. It contains the transfer speed in bytes per second that the transfer
              should  be below during <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>LOW</u><b>_</b><u>SPEED</u><b>_</b><u>TIME</u> seconds for the library to consider it too slow
              and abort.

       CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_TIME
              Pass a long as parameter. It contains the time in seconds that the transfer  should  be  below
              the <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>LOW</u><b>_</b><u>SPEED</u><b>_</b><u>LIMIT</u> for the library to consider it too slow and abort.

       CURLOPT_MAX_SEND_SPEED_LARGE
              Pass  a curl_off_t as parameter.  If an upload exceeds this speed on cumulative average during
              the transfer, the transfer will pause to keep the average rate  less  than  or  equal  to  the
              parameter value.  Defaults to unlimited speed. (Added in 7.15.5)

       CURLOPT_MAX_RECV_SPEED_LARGE
              Pass a curl_off_t as parameter.  If a download exceeds this speed on cumulative average during
              the transfer, the transfer will pause to keep the average rate  less  than  or  equal  to  the
              parameter value. Defaults to unlimited speed. (Added in 7.15.5)

       CURLOPT_MAXCONNECTS
              Pass  a long. The set number will be the persistent connection cache size. The set amount will
              be the maximum amount of simultaneously open connections that libcurl may cache in  this  easy
              handle.  Default  is  5, and there isn't much point in changing this value unless you are per-
              fectly aware of how this work and changes libcurl's behaviour. This concerns connection  using
              any of the protocols that support persistent connections.

              When reaching the maximum limit, curl closes the oldest one in the cache to prevent the number
              of open connections to increase.

              If you already have performed transfers with this curl handle, setting a  smaller  MAXCONNECTS
              than before may cause open connections to get closed unnecessarily.

              Note  that  if  you add this easy handle to a multi handle, this setting is not being acknowl-
              edged, but you must instead use <a href="curl_multi_setopt.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/curl_multi_setopt"><u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>multi</u><b>_</b><u>setopt(3)</u></a><u></u> and the <u>CURLMOPT</u><b>_</b><u>MAXCONNECTS</u> option.

       CURLOPT_CLOSEPOLICY
              (Obsolete) This option does nothing.

       CURLOPT_FRESH_CONNECT
              Pass a long. Set to non-zero to make the next transfer use a new (fresh) connection by  force.
              If  the  connection cache is full before this connection, one of the existing connections will
              be closed as according to the selected or default policy. This option should be used with cau-
              tion  and  only if you understand what it does. Set this to 0 to have libcurl attempt re-using
              an existing connection (default behavior).

       CURLOPT_FORBID_REUSE
              Pass a long. Set to non-zero to make the next transfer explicitly close  the  connection  when
              done.  Normally,  libcurl keep all connections alive when done with one transfer in case there
              comes a succeeding one that can re-use them.  This option should be used with caution and only
              if you understand what it does. Set to 0 to have libcurl keep the connection open for possibly
              later re-use (default behavior).

       CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT
              Pass a long. It should contain the maximum time in seconds that you allow  the  connection  to
              the server to take.  This only limits the connection phase, once it has connected, this option
              is of no more use. Set to zero to disable connection timeout (it will then only timeout on the
              system's internal timeouts). See also the <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>TIMEOUT</u> option.

              In unix-like systems, this might cause signals to be used unless <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>NOSIGNAL</u> is set.

       CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT_MS
              Like  <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>CONNECTTIMEOUT</u>  but takes number of milliseconds instead. If libcurl is built to
              use the standard system name resolver, that part will still  use  full-second  resolution  for
              timeouts. (Added in 7.16.2)

       CURLOPT_IPRESOLVE
              Allows  an  application  to select what kind of IP addresses to use when resolving host names.
              This is only interesting when using host names that resolve addresses using more than one ver-
              sion of IP. The allowed values are:

              CURL_IPRESOLVE_WHATEVER
                     Default, resolves addresses to all IP versions that your system allows.

              CURL_IPRESOLVE_V4
                     Resolve to ipv4 addresses.

              CURL_IPRESOLVE_V6
                     Resolve to ipv6 addresses.

       CURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY
              Pass  a long. A non-zero parameter tells the library to perform any required proxy authentica-
              tion and connection setup, but no data transfer.

              This option is useful with the <u>CURLINFO</u><b>_</b><u>LASTSOCKET</u> option to <a href="curl_easy_getinfo.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/curl_easy_getinfo"><u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>easy</u><b>_</b><u>getinfo(3)</u></a><u></u>. The library
              can  set  up  the connection and then the application can obtain the most recently used socket
              for special data transfers. (Added in 7.15.2)

<b>SSL</b> <b>and</b> <b>SECURITY</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       CURLOPT_SSLCERT
              Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as parameter. The string should be the file name of
              your certificate. The default format is "PEM" and can be changed with <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>SSLCERTTYPE</u>.

              With NSS this is the nickname of the certificate you wish to authenticate with.

       CURLOPT_SSLCERTTYPE
              Pass  a  pointer  to a zero terminated string as parameter. The string should be the format of
              your certificate. Supported formats are "PEM" and "DER".  (Added in 7.9.3)

       CURLOPT_SSLCERTPASSWD
              Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as parameter. It  will  be  used  as  the  password
              required to use the <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>SSLCERT</u> certificate.

              This  option is replaced by <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>SSLKEYPASSWD</u> and should only be used for backward compati-
              bility. You never needed a pass phrase to load a certificate but you need  one  to  load  your
              private key.

       CURLOPT_SSLKEY
              Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as parameter. The string should be the file name of
              your private key. The default format is "PEM" and can be changed with <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>SSLKEYTYPE</u>.

       CURLOPT_SSLKEYTYPE
              Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as parameter. The string should be  the  format  of
              your private key. Supported formats are "PEM", "DER" and "ENG".

              The  format  "ENG" enables you to load the private key from a crypto engine. In this case <u>CUR</u>-
              <u>LOPT</u><b>_</b><u>SSLKEY</u> is used as an identifier passed to the engine. You have to set the  crypto  engine
              with  <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>SSLENGINE</u>.   "DER"  format  key file currently does not work because of a bug in
              OpenSSL.

       CURLOPT_SSLKEYPASSWD
              Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as parameter. It  will  be  used  as  the  password
              required to use the <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>SSLKEY</u> or <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>SSH</u><b>_</b><u>PRIVATE</u><b>_</b><u>KEYFILE</u> private key.

       CURLOPT_SSLENGINE
              Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as parameter. It will be used as the identifier for
              the crypto engine you want to use for your private key.

              If the crypto device cannot be loaded, <u>CURLE</u><b>_</b><u>SSL</u><b>_</b><u>ENGINE</u><b>_</b><u>NOTFOUND</u> is returned.

       CURLOPT_SSLENGINE_DEFAULT
              Sets the actual crypto engine as the default for (asymmetric) crypto operations.

              If the crypto device cannot be set, <u>CURLE</u><b>_</b><u>SSL</u><b>_</b><u>ENGINE</u><b>_</b><u>SETFAILED</u> is returned.

       CURLOPT_SSLVERSION
              Pass a long as parameter to control what version of SSL/TLS to attempt to use.  The  available
              options are:

              CURL_SSLVERSION_DEFAULT
                     The default action. When libcurl built with OpenSSL or NSS, this will attempt to figure
                     out the remote SSL protocol version. Unfortunately there are a lot of ancient and  bro-
                     ken  servers  in  use which cannot handle this technique and will fail to connect. When
                     libcurl is built with GnuTLS, this will mean SSLv3.

              CURL_SSLVERSION_TLSv1
                     Force TLSv1

              CURL_SSLVERSION_SSLv2
                     Force SSLv2

              CURL_SSLVERSION_SSLv3
                     Force SSLv3

       CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER
              Pass a long as parameter.

              This option determines whether curl verifies the authenticity of the  peer's  certificate.   A
              nonzero  value means curl verifies; zero means it doesn't.  The default is nonzero, but before
              7.10, it was zero.

              When negotiating an SSL connection, the server sends a certificate  indicating  its  identity.
              Curl verifies whether the certificate is authentic, i.e. that you can trust that the server is
              who the certificate says it is.  This trust is based on a chain of digital signatures,  rooted
              in  certification authority (CA) certificates you supply.  As of 7.10, curl installs a default
              bundle of CA certificates and you can specify alternate certificates with  the  <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>CAINFO</u>
              option or the <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>CAPATH</u> option.

              When  <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>SSL</u><b>_</b><u>VERIFYPEER</u> is nonzero, and the verification fails to prove that the certifi-
              cate is authentic, the connection fails.  When the option is  zero,  the  connection  succeeds
              regardless.

              Authenticating  the  certificate  is  not by itself very useful.  You typically want to ensure
              that the server, as authentically identified by its certificate, is the server you mean to  be
              talking to.  Use <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>SSL</u><b>_</b><u>VERIFYHOST</u> to control that.

       CURLOPT_CAINFO
              Pass  a  char  * to a zero terminated string naming a file holding one or more certificates to
              verify the peer with.   This  makes  sense  only  when  used  in  combination  with  the  <u>CUR</u>-
              <u>LOPT</u><b>_</b><u>SSL</u><b>_</b><u>VERIFYPEER</u>  option.   If <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>SSL</u><b>_</b><u>VERIFYPEER</u> is zero, <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>CAINFO</u> need not even
              indicate an accessible file.

              Note that option is by default set to the system path where libcurl's cacert bundle is assumed
              to be stored, as established at build time.

              When built against NSS this is the directory that the NSS certificate database resides in.

       CURLOPT_CAPATH
              Pass  a char * to a zero terminated string naming a directory holding multiple CA certificates
              to verify the peer with. The certificate directory must be prepared using the openssl c_rehash
              utility.  This  makes  sense  only  when  used  in combination with the <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>SSL</u><b>_</b><u>VERIFYPEER</u>
              option.  If <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>SSL</u><b>_</b><u>VERIFYPEER</u> is zero, <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>CAPATH</u> need not even indicate an  accessi-
              ble path.  The <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>CAPATH</u> function apparently does not work in Windows due to some limita-
              tion in openssl. This option is OpenSSL-specific and does nothing if libcurl is built  to  use
              GnuTLS.

       CURLOPT_RANDOM_FILE
              Pass  a  char * to a zero terminated file name. The file will be used to read from to seed the
              random engine for SSL. The more random the specified file is, the more secure the SSL  connec-
              tion will become.

       CURLOPT_EGDSOCKET
              Pass a char * to the zero terminated path name to the Entropy Gathering Daemon socket. It will
              be used to seed the random engine for SSL.

       CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST
              Pass a long as parameter.

              This option determines whether libcurl verifies that the server cert is for the server  it  is
              known as.

              When negotiating an SSL connection, the server sends a certificate indicating its identity.

              When <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>SSL</u><b>_</b><u>VERIFYHOST</u> is 2, that certificate must indicate that the server is the server
              to which you meant to connect, or the connection fails.

              Curl considers the server the intended one when the Common Name field or a  Subject  Alternate
              Name  field in the certificate matches the host name in the URL to which you told Curl to con-
              nect.

              When the value is 1, the certificate must contain a Common Name field, but it  doesn't  matter
              what name it says.  (This is not ordinarily a useful setting).

              When the value is 0, the connection succeeds regardless of the names in the certificate.

              The default, since 7.10, is 2.

              The checking this option controls is of the identity that the server <u>claims</u>.  The server could
              be lying.  To control lying, see <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>SSL</u><b>_</b><u>VERIFYPEER</u>.

       CURLOPT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST
              Pass a char *, pointing to a zero terminated string holding the list of ciphers to use for the
              SSL  connection.  The  list  must  be syntactically correct, it consists of one or more cipher
              strings separated by colons. Commas or spaces are also acceptable separators  but  colons  are
              normally used, , - and + can be used as operators.

              For  OpenSSL  and GnuTLS valid examples of cipher lists include 'RC4-SHA', 'SHA1+DES', 'TLSv1'
              and 'DEFAULT'. The default list is normally set when you compile OpenSSL.

              You'll     find     more     details     about     cipher     lists     on      this      URL:
              <a href="http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html"><u>http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html</u></a>

              For NSS valid examples of cipher lists include 'rsa_rc4_128_md5', 'rsa_aes_128_sha', etc. With
              NSS you don't add/remove ciphers. If one uses this option then all known ciphers are  disabled
              and only those passed in are enabled.

              You'll  find more details about the NSS cipher lists on this URL: <a href="http://directory.fedora.redhat.com/docs/mod_nss.html#Directives"><u>http://directory.fedora.red</u>-</a>
              <a href="http://directory.fedora.redhat.com/docs/mod_nss.html#Directives"><u>hat.com/docs/mod</u><b>_</b><u>nss.html#Directives</u></a>


       CURLOPT_SSL_SESSIONID_CACHE
              Pass a long set to 0 to disable libcurl's use of SSL session-ID caching.  Set  this  to  1  to
              enable  it.  By  default  all transfers are done using the cache. Note that while nothing ever
              should get hurt by attempting to reuse SSL session-IDs, there seem to be broken SSL  implemen-
              tations  in  the wild that may require you to disable this in order for you to succeed. (Added
              in 7.16.0)

       CURLOPT_KRB4LEVEL
              Pass a char * as parameter. Set the krb4 security level, this  also  enables  krb4  awareness.
              This  is  a  string,  'clear',  'safe', 'confidential' or 'private'.  If the string is set but
              doesn't match one of these, 'private' will be used. Set the string to  NULL  to  disable  Ker-
              beros4. The Kerberos support only works for FTP.

<b>SSH</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       CURLOPT_SSH_AUTH_TYPES
              Pass  a  long  set  to  a  bitmask  consisting  of  one  or  more  of  CURLSSH_AUTH_PUBLICKEY,
              CURLSSH_AUTH_PASSWORD, CURLSSH_AUTH_HOST, CURLSSH_AUTH_KEYBOARD. Set CURLSSH_AUTH_ANY  to  let
              libcurl pick one.

       CURLOPT_SSH_PUBLIC_KEYFILE
              Pass  a  char  * pointing to a file name for your public key. If not used, libcurl defaults to
              using <b>~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub</b>.

       CURLOPT_SSH_PRIVATE_KEYFILE
              Pass a char * pointing to a file name for your private key. If not used, libcurl  defaults  to
              using <b>~/.ssh/id_dsa</b>.  If the file is password-protected, set the password with <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>SSLKEY</u>-
              <u>PASSWD</u>.

<b>OTHER</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       CURLOPT_PRIVATE
              Pass a char * as parameter, pointing to data that should be associated with this curl  handle.
              The pointer can subsequently be retrieved using <a href="curl_easy_getinfo.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/curl_easy_getinfo"><u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>easy</u><b>_</b><u>getinfo(3)</u></a><u></u> with the CURLINFO_PRIVATE
              option. libcurl itself does nothing with this data. (Added in 7.10.3)

       CURLOPT_SHARE
              Pass a share handle as a parameter. The share handle must have been created by a previous call
              to  <a href="curl_share_init.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/curl_share_init"><u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>share</u><b>_</b><u>init(3)</u></a><u></u>.  Setting this option, will make this curl handle use the data from the
              shared handle instead of keeping the data to itself. This  enables  several  curl  handles  to
              share  data.  If the curl handles are used simultaneously, you <b>MUST</b> use the locking methods in
              the share handle. See <a href="curl_share_setopt.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/curl_share_setopt"><u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>share</u><b>_</b><u>setopt(3)</u></a><u></u> for details.

<b>TELNET</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       CURLOPT_TELNETOPTIONS
              Provide a pointer to a curl_slist with variables to pass to the telnet negotiations. The vari-
              ables should be in the format &lt;option=value&gt;. libcurl supports the options 'TTYPE', 'XDISPLOC'
              and 'NEW_ENV'. See the TELNET standard for details.

<b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b>
       CURLE_OK (zero) means that the  option  was  set  properly,  non-zero  means  an  error  occurred  as
       <u>&lt;curl/curl.h&gt;</u> defines. See the <a href="libcurl-errors.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/libcurl-errors"><u>libcurl-errors(3)</u></a><u></u> man page for the full list with descriptions.

       If  you  try to set an option that libcurl doesn't know about, perhaps because the library is too old
       to  support  it  or  the  option  was  removed  in  a  recent  version,  this  function  will  return
       <u>CURLE</u><b>_</b><u>FAILED</u><b>_</b><u>INIT</u>.
