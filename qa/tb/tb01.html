We want to let the user easily add "Special Folders," such as the System Folder and the Control Panels folder (basically, all the FindFolderfolders). We are experiencing a few problems:<p>1.	There doesn't seem to be a way to find out about new special folders (forthe application) without using a new header file and compiling with specialcases for these items. Is there a generic way that to do this (I know we arenot supposed to use the fld# resource)?</p><p>2.	I know we could treat these folders as a special case, but then we also haveto treat the icons as special cases. This creates a problem because some of theicon numbers are not in the header file. What should we do?</p><p>3.	There are some folders in System 7.5, notably the Documents folder, theRecent Files folder, the Recent Servers folder, and so on, that are not in theheader files or in the fld# resource. How do we deal with these?</p><font size="+4">A</font>  Unfortunately, there is no way to check for folders without using the constants that are defined in Folders.h, and you cannot use FindFolder to generically find folders that are added in new system releases. Folder types which are not defined in Folders.h should be regarded as private (for System use only), andyou should not create files in these folders. The documentation for FindFolderassumes that the only folders applications will add files to are the'Preferences' and 'Temporary Items' folders.<p>However, it's understandable that, in some circumstances, your utility mightneed to access other folders, but this access should be restricted to thefolders listed in Inside Macintosh. The folders introduced in System 7.5, suchas the Recent Applications, Recent Documents, and Recent Servers folders areonly for the use of the Apple Menu Options control panel, and you should avoidaccessing them. The 'ShutDown Items' folder, which was introduced in System 7Pro, is not included in Folders.h, but it is defined in the fld# resource withan id of 'shdf'. You should avoid accessing this folder also.</p><p>As you have noticed, the fld# resource contains only the folders defined inInside Macintosh and included in Folders.h (with the exception of the foldersused by the Extensions Manager). If new system releases introduce folders whichdevelopers need to access, then the folder constant will be made available.There is no way to use FindFolder without explicitly referencing the folder'ssignature, so you'd have to update your code, if this happens.</p><p>For folder icons, you have to use the icons documented in Inside Macintosh orincluded in icons.h. The icon ID for any folder which is not documented shouldbe regarded as subject to change. <br><i>Inside Macintosh: Toolbox Essentials</i>, pages 7 - 53 through 7 - 57<i>Inside Macintosh:Finding Directories </i><br><i>More Macintosh Toolbox</i>, page 1 - 132, "System Folder icons"</p><!-- begin_date --><H4 ALIGN=center>[May 01 1995]</H4><!-- end_date --></td></tr></table></CENTER><!-- begin_footer_information -->	<table width="680" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
