The sample demonstrates the use of DirectSetEntries.  The code scans throught the GDevice list for all monitors which are in 16 or 32 bit mode and then changes the entires on those monitors.  It looks real ugly, but if you feel the need to animate colors on a direct monitor, then this is the way you do it.
