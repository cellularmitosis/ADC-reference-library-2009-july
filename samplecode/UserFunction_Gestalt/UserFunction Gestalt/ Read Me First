The enclosed Snippet is for Installer scripters.  The UserChkGestaltFunction provides an alternative to the CheckGestalt clause which requires that the scripter provide all possible matches to the results of the Gestalt call.  With the User Function, the script writer can simply check for the existence of a gestalt selector, without having to worry about it's return values.  Of course, if the return value is important, the user function can easily be modified.Rich KubotaDev Tech Support
