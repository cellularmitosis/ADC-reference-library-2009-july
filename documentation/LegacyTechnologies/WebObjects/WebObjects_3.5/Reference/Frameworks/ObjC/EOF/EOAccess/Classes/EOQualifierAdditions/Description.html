<h3>Class Description </h3>

</a>The access layer adds one method to the EOQualifier class, for "rerooting" a qualifier to another entity. EOQualifiers (except EOSQLQualifier) aren't based on SQL and they don't rely upon an EOModel. Because this method is reroots a qualifier in terms of model objects, it is only useful to the classes in the access layer. It is not used in in-memory searches.<p>

<h4> <a name="//apple_ref/occ/clm/EOQualifier Additions/qualifierMigratedFromEntity:relationshipPath:">qualifierMigratedFromEntity:relationshipPath:</a></h4>

</a>- (EOQualifier *)<B>qualifierMigratedFromEntity: </B>(EOEntity *)<em>entity<br></em><B>relationshipPath: </B>(NSString *)<em>relationshipPath</em><p>

Creates a copy of the receiver, translates all the copy's keys to work with the entity specified in <em>relationshipPath</em>, and returns the copy. The receiver's keys are all specified in terms of <em>entity</em>. For example, assume that an Employee entity has a relationship to a Department entity named "department". You could migrate a qualifier described in terms of the Employee entity (department.name = `Finance', for example) to a qualifier described in terms of the Department entity (name = `Finance'). To do so, you send a <B>qualifierMigratedFromEntity:relationshipPath: </B> message with the Employee entity as the entity and "department" as the relationship path.<p>
