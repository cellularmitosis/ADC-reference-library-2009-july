README documentColorSyncDevices Sample CodeSeptember 10, 2002Version 1.0This code demonstrates how to use the new ColorSync Device Support API's introduced with Mac OS X. More specifically, this sample demonstrates how to use the following API's:CMGetDefaultDeviceCMGetDeviceProfileCMIterateColorDevicesCMIterateDeviceProfilesThe program first displays the default display device and profile using CMGetDefaultDevice and CMGetDeviceProfile. Next, it iterates over and displays all ColorSync devices using CMIterateColorDevices. Lastly, CMIterateDeviceProfiles is used to iterate over the current, custom and factory profiles for each device.Note all output is directed to the console.
