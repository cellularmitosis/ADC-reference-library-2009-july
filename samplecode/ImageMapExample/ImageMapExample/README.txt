ImageMapExample demonstrates how to support accessibility. Some of the more interesting issues it deals with are: 

- How to add descriptions to the segments of a segmented control.

- How to accessorize a custom class (in this case ImageMap a subclass of NSView).

- How to represent UI Elements for which there exist no underlying NSObjects (in this case, the hot spots of the ImageMap).
