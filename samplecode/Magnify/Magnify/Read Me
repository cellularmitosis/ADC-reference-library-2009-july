This is a Carbon based sample which compiles into both a CFM and Mach-O, Nib based application bundle.  The application simply creates a window in which pixels around the cursor are magnified and displayed.  The user may specify through its preferences weather the window be created as a floating or utility window as well as the magnification amount. The sample application works on both Mac OS 8/9 and Mac OS X.
