KRB5.CONF(5)                                                                                    KRB5.CONF(5)



<b>NAME</b>
       krb5.conf - Kerberos configuration file

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       <u>krb5.conf</u> contains configuration information needed by the Kerberos V5 library.  This includes infor-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mation&nbsp;information</font>
       mation describing the default Kerberos realm, and the location of the Kerberos key distribution  cen-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ters&nbsp;centers</font>
       ters for known realms.

       The  <u>krb5.conf</u>  file  uses an INI-style format.  Sections are delimited by square braces; within each
       section, there are relations where tags can be assigned to have specific values.  Tags can also  con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tain&nbsp;contain</font>
       tain  a subsection, which contains further relations or subsections.  A tag can be assigned to multi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ple&nbsp;multiple</font>
       ple values.  Here is an example of the INI-style format used by <u>krb5.conf</u>:


                 [section1]
                      tag1 = value_a
                      tag1 = value_b
                      tag2 = value_c

                 [section 2]
                      tag3 = {
                           subtag1 = subtag_value_a
                           subtag1 = subtag_value_b
                           subtag2 = subtag_value_c
                      }
                      tag4 = {
                           subtag1 = subtag_value_d
                           subtag2 = subtag_value_e
                      }



       The following sections are currently used in the <u>krb5.conf</u> file:

       [libdefaults]
              Contains various default values used by the Kerberos V5 library.


       [login]
              Contains default values used by the Kerberos V5 login program, <!-- a --><u>login.krb5</u>(8)<!-- /a -->.


       [appdefaults]
              Contains default values that can be used by Kerberos V5 applications.


       [realms]
              Contains subsections keyed by Kerberos realm names which describe where to find  the  Kerberos
              servers for a particular realm, and other realm-specific information.


       [domain_realm]
              Contains  relations  which  map  subdomains and domain names to Kerberos realm names.  This is
              used by programs to determine what realm a host should be in, given its fully qualified domain
              name.


       [logging]
              Contains relations which determine how Kerberos entities are to perform their logging.


       [capaths]
              Contains  the authentication paths used with non-hierarchical cross-realm. Entries in the sec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;section</font>
              tion are used by the client to determine the intermediate realms which may be used  in  cross-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">realm&nbsp;crossrealm</font>
              realm authentication. It is also used by the end-service when checking the transited field for
              trusted intermediate realms.


       [dbdefaults]
              Contains default values for database specific parameters.


       [dbmodules]
              Contains database specific parameters used by the database library.

       Each of these sections will be covered in more details in the following sections.

<b>LIBDEFAULTS</b> <b>SECTION</b>
       The following relations are defined in the [libdefaults] section:


       default_keytab_name
              This relation specifies the default keytab name to be used by application severs such as  tel-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">netd&nbsp;telnetd</font>
              netd   and   rlogind.    The  default  is  "/etc/krb5.keytab".   This  formerly  defaulted  to
              "/etc/v5srvtab", but was changed to the current value.


       default_realm
              This relation identifies the default realm to be used in a client host's Kerberos activity.


       default_tgs_enctypes
              This relation identifies the supported list of session key encryption  types  that  should  be
              returned by the KDC. The list may be delimited with commas or whitespace.


       default_tkt_enctypes
              This  relation  identifies  the  supported list of session key encryption types that should be
              requested by the client, in the same format.


       permitted_enctypes
              This relation identifies the permitted list of session key encryption types.


       clockskew
              This relation sets the maximum allowable amount of clockskew in seconds that the library  will
              tolerate  before  assuming  that a Kerberos message is invalid.  The default value is 300 sec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">onds,&nbsp;seconds,</font>
              onds, or five minutes.


       kdc_timesync
              If the value of this relation is non-zero (the default), the library will compute the  differ-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ence&nbsp;difference</font>
              ence  between the system clock and the time returned by the KDC and in order to correct for an
              inaccurate system clock.  This corrective factor is only used by the Kerberos library.


       kdc_req_checksum_type
              For compatability with DCE security servers which do not support the default CKSUMTYPE_RSA_MD5
              used  by this version of Kerberos. Use a value of 2 to use the CKSUMTYPE_RSA_MD4 instead. This
              applies to DCE 1.1 and earlier.


       ap_req_checksum_type
              This allows you to set the checksum type used in the  authenticator  of  KRB_AP_REQ  messages.
              The  default  value  for  this type is CKSUMTYPE_RSA_MD5.  For compatibility with applications
              linked against DCE version 1.1 or earlier Kerberos libraries, use a value  of  2  to  use  the
              CKSUMTYPE_RSA_MD4 instead.


       safe_checksum_type
              This  allows  you  to set the preferred keyed-checksum type for use in KRB_SAFE messages.  The
              default value for this type is CKSUMTYPE_RSA_MD5_DES.   For  compatibility  with  applications
              linked  against  DCE  version  1.1  or earlier Kerberos libraries, use a value of 3 to use the
              CKSUMTYPE_RSA_MD4_DES instead.  This field is ignored when its value is incompatible with  the
              session key type.


       preferred_preauth_types
              This  allows  you  to  set the preferred preauthentication types which the client will attempt
              before others which may be advertised by a KDC.  The default value for this  setting  is  "17,
              16, 15, 14", which forces libkrb5 to attempt to use PKINIT if it is supported.


       ccache_type
              User  this parameter on systems which are DCE clients, to specify the type of cache to be cre-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ated&nbsp;created</font>
              ated by kinit, or when forwarded tickets are received. DCE and Kerberos can share  the  cache,
              but  some  versions of DCE do not support the default cache as created by this version of Ker-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">beros.&nbsp;Kerberos.</font>
              beros. Use a value of 1 on DCE 1.0.3a systems, and a value of 2 on DCE 1.1 systems.


       krb4_srvtab
              Specifies the location of the Kerberos V4 srvtab file.  Default is "/etc/srvtab".


       krb4_config
              Specifies the location of the Kerberos V4 configuration file.  Default is "/etc/krb.conf".


       krb4_realms
              Specifies the  location  of  the  Kerberos  V4  domain/realm  translation  file.   Default  is
              "/etc/krb.realms".


       dns_lookup_kdc
              Indicate  whether  DNS  SRV  records  shoud be used to locate the KDCs and other servers for a
              realm, if they are not listed in the information for the realm.  The default is to  use  these
              records.


       dns_lookup_realm
              Indicate  whether  DNS  TXT  records should be used to determine the Kerberos realm of a host.
              The default is not to use these records.


       dns_fallback
              General flag controlling the use of DNS for Kerberos information.  If both  of  the  preceding
              options are specified, this option has no effect.


       extra_addresses
              This  allows a computer to use multiple local addresses, in order to allow Kerberos to work in
              a network that uses NATs.  The addresses should be in a comma-separated list.


       udp_preference_limit
              When sending a message to the KDC, the library will try using TCP before UDP if  the  size  of
              the  message  is  above  "udp_preference_limit".   If the message is smaller than "udp_prefer-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ence_limit",&nbsp;"udp_preference_limit",</font>
              ence_limit", then UDP will be tried before TCP.  Regardless of the size, both  protocols  will
              be tried if the first attempt fails.


       verify_ap_req_nofail
              If  this  flag  is  set,  then  an  attempt to get initial credentials will fail if the client
              machine does not have a keytab.  The default for the flag is false.


       renew_lifetime
              The value of this tag is the default renewable lifetime  for  initial  tickets.   The  default
              value for the tag is 0.


       noaddresses
              Setting  this  flag causes the initial Kerberos ticket to be addressless.  The default for the
              flag is true.


       forwardable
              If this flag is set, initial tickets by default will be forwardable.  The  default  value  for
              this flag is false.


       proxiable
              If this flag is set, initial tickets by default will be proxiable.  The default value for this
              flag is false.


<b>APPDEFAULTS</b> <b>SECTION</b>
       Each tag in the [appdefaults] section names a Kerberos V5 application or an option that  is  used  by
       some  Kerberos  V5 application[s].  The four ways that you can set values for options are as follows,
       in decreasing order of precedence:


                 #1)
                      application = {
                           realm1 = {
                                option = value
                           }
                           realm2 = {
                                option = value
                           }
                      }
                 #2)
                      application = {
                           option1 = value
                           option2 = value
                      }
                 #3)
                      realm = {
                           option = value
                      }
                 #4)
                      option = value



<b>LOGIN</b> <b>SECTION</b>
       The  [login]  section  is  used  to  configure  the  behavior  of  the  Kerberos  V5  login  program,
       <!-- a --><u>login.krb5</u>(8)<!-- /a -->.   Refer  to the manual entry for <u>login.krb5</u> for a description of the relations allowed
       in this section.

<b>REALMS</b> <b>SECTION</b>
       Each tag in the [realms] section of the file names a Kerberos realm.  The value of the tag is a  sub-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">section&nbsp;subsection</font>
       section  where  the relations in that subsection define the properties of that particular realm.  For
       example:


                 [realms]
                      ATHENA.MIT.EDU = {
                           admin_server = KERBEROS.MIT.EDU
                           default_domain = MIT.EDU
                           database_module = ldapconf
                           v4_instance_convert = {
                                mit = mit.edu
                                lithium = lithium.lcs.mit.edu
                           }
                           v4_realm = LCS.MIT.EDU
                      }


       For each realm, the following tags may be specified in the realm's subsection:


       kdc    The value of this relation is the name of a host running a KDC for that  realm.   An  optional
              port  number (preceded by a colon) may be appended to the hostname.  This tag should generally
              be used only if the realm administrator has not made the information available through DNS.


       admin_server
              This relation identifies the host where the administration server is running.  Typically  this
              is the Master Kerberos server.


       database_module
              This  relation  indicates  the  name of the configuration section under dbmodules for database
              specific parameters used by the loadable database library.


       default_domain
              This relation identifies the default domain for which hosts in this realm are  assumed  to  be
              in.  This is needed for translating V4 principal names (which do not contain a domain name) to
              V5 principal names (which do).


       v4_instance_convert
              This subsection allows the administrator to configure exceptions to the default_domain mapping
              rule.   It  contains  V4  instances (the tag name) which should be translated to some specific
              hostname (the tag value) as the second component in a Kerberos V5 principal name.


       v4_realm
              This relation is used by the krb524 library routines when converting a V5 principal name to  a
              V4  principal name. It is used when V4 realm name and the V5 realm are not the same, but still
              share the same principal names and passwords. The tag value is the Kerberos V4 realm name.


       auth_to_local_names
              This subsection allows you to set explicit mappings from principal names to local user  names.
              The tag is the mapping name, and the value is the corresponding local user name.


       auth_to_local
              This tag allows you to set a general rule for mapping principal names to local user names.  It
              will be used if there is not an explicit mapping for the principal name that is  being  trans-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lated.&nbsp;translated.</font>
              lated.  The possible values are:

                   DB:&lt;filename&gt;
                        The principal will be looked up in the database &lt;filename&gt;.  Support for this is not
                        currently compiled in by default.
                   RULE:&lt;exp&gt;
                        The local name will be formulated from &lt;exp&gt;.
                   DEFAULT
                        The principal name will be used as the local name.  If the principal has  more  than
                        one  component  or  is not in the default realm, this rule is not applicable and the
                        conversion will fail.


<b>DOMAIN_REALM</b> <b>SECTION</b>
       The [domain_realm] section provides a translation from a hostname to the Kerberos realm name for  the
       services provided by that host.

       The  tag  name can be a hostname, or a domain name, where domain names are indicated by a prefix of a
       period ('.') character.  The value of the relation is the Kerberos realm  name  for  that  particular
       host or domain.  Host names and domain names should be in lower case.

       If  no  translation entry applies, the host's realm is considered to be the hostname's domain portion
       converted to upper case.  For example, the following [domain_realm] section:


                 [domain_realm]
                      .mit.edu = ATHENA.MIT.EDU
                      mit.edu = ATHENA.MIT.EDU
                      dodo.mit.edu = SMS_TEST.MIT.EDU
                      .ucsc.edu = CATS.UCSC.EDU

       maps dodo.mit.edu into the SMS_TEST.MIT.EDU realm, all other hosts  in  the  MIT.EDU  domain  to  the
       ATHENA.MIT.EDU  realm,  and  all  hosts  in  the  UCSC.EDU domain into the CATS.UCSC.EDU realm.  ucb-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">vax.berkeley.edu&nbsp;ucbvax.berkeley.edu</font>
       vax.berkeley.edu  would  be  mapped  by  the  default  rules  to  the   BERKELEY.EDU   realm,   while
       sage.lcs.mit.edu would be mapped to the LCS.MIT.EDU realm.


<b>LOGGING</b> <b>SECTION</b>
       The  [logging]  section  indicates  how a particular entity is to perform its logging.  The relations
       specified in this section assign one or more values to the entity name.

       Currently, the following entities are used:

       kdc    These entries specify how the KDC is to perform its logging.

       admin_server
              These entries specify how the administrative server is to perform its logging.

       default
              These entries specify how to perform logging in the absence of explicit specifications  other-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">wise.&nbsp;otherwise.</font>
              wise.

       Values are of the following forms:

       FILE=&lt;filename&gt;

       FILE:&lt;filename&gt;
              This value causes the entity's logging messages to go to the specified file.  If the <b>=</b> form is
              used, then the file is overwritten.  Otherwise, the file is appended to.

       STDERR This value causes the entity's logging messages to go to its standard error stream.

       CONSOLE
              This value causes the entity's logging messages to go to the console, if the  system  supports
              it.

       DEVICE=&lt;devicename&gt;
              This causes the entity's logging messages to go to the specified device.

       SYSLOG[:&lt;severity&gt;[:&lt;facility&gt;]]
              This causes the entity's logging messages to go to the system log.

              The  <b>severity</b> argument specifies the default severity of system log messages.  This may be any
              of the following severities supported by the <a href="../man3/syslog.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/syslog"><u>syslog(3)</u></a><u></u> call minus the LOG_ prefix:  LOG_EMERG,
              LOG_ALERT,  LOG_CRIT, LOG_ERR, LOG_WARNING, LOG_NOTICE, LOG_INFO, and LOG_DEBUG.  For example,
              to specify LOG_CRIT severity, one would use CRIT for <b>severity.</b>

              The <b>facility</b> argument specifies the facility under which the messages are logged.  This may be
              any  of  the  following  facilities  supported  by  the  <a href="../man3/syslog.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/syslog"><u>syslog(3)</u></a><u></u> call minus the LOG_ prefix:
              LOG_KERN, LOG_USER, LOG_MAIL, LOG_DAEMON, LOG_AUTH, LOG_LPR, LOG_NEWS, LOG_UUCP, LOG_CRON, and
              LOG_LOCAL0 through LOG_LOCAL7.

              If  no <b>severity</b> is specified, the default is ERR, and if no <b>facility</b> is specified, the default
              is AUTH.

       In the following example, the logging messages from the KDC will go to the console and to the  system
       log  under  the  facility LOG_DAEMON with default severity of LOG_INFO; and the logging messages from
       the administrative server will be appended to the file /var/adm/kadmin.log and  sent  to  the  device
       /dev/tty04.

                 [logging]
                      kdc = CONSOLE
                      kdc = SYSLOG:INFO:DAEMON
                      admin_server = FILE:/var/adm/kadmin.log
                      admin_server = DEVICE=/dev/tty04



<b>CAPATHS</b> <b>SECTION</b>
       Cross-realm  authentication  is  typically  organized hierarchically.  This hierarchy is based on the
       name of the realm, which thus imposes restrictions on the choice of realm names, and on who may  par-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ticipate&nbsp;participate</font>
       ticipate  in  a cross-realm authentication. A non hierarchical orgization may be used, but requires a
       database to construct the authentication paths between the realms. This section  defines  that  data-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">base.&nbsp;database.</font>
       base.

       A client will use this section to find the authentication path between its realm and the realm of the
       server. The server will use this section to verify the authentication path used  be  the  client,  by
       checking the transited field of the received ticket.

       There  is  a  tag name for each participating realm, and each tag has subtags for each of the realms.
       The value of the subtags is an intermediate realm which may participate in the cross-realm  authenti-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cation.&nbsp;authentication.</font>
       cation.  The  subtags  may  be  repeated if there is more then one intermediate realm. A value of "."
       means that the two realms share keys directly, and no intermediate realms should be allowed  to  par-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ticipate.&nbsp;participate.</font>
       ticipate.

       There  are  n**2  possible  entries in this table, but only those entries which will be needed on the
       client or the server need to be present. The client needs a tag for its local realm, with subtags for
       all  the realms of servers it will need to authenticate with.  A server needs a tag for each realm of
       the clients it will serve.

       For example, ANL.GOV, PNL.GOV, and NERSC.GOV all wish to use the  ES.NET  realm  as  an  intermediate
       realm.  ANL  has  a sub realm of TEST.ANL.GOV which will authenticate with NERSC.GOV but not PNL.GOV.
       The [capath] section for ANL.GOV systems would look like this:

                 [capaths]
                      ANL.GOV = {
                           TEST.ANL.GOV = .
                           PNL.GOV = ES.NET
                           NERSC.GOV = ES.NET
                           ES.NET = .
                      }
                      TEST.ANL.GOV = {
                           ANL.GOV = .
                      }
                      PNL.GOV = {
                           ANL.GOV = ES.NET
                      }
                      NERSC.GOV = {
                           ANL.GOV = ES.NET
                      }
                      ES.NET = {
                           ANL.GOV = .
                      }

       The [capath] section of the configuration file used on NERSC.GOV systems would look like this:

                 [capaths]
                      NERSC.GOV = {
                           ANL.GOV = ES.NET
                           TEST.ANL.GOV = ES.NET
                           TEST.ANL.GOV = ANL.GOV
                           PNL.GOV = ES.NET
                           ES.NET = .
                      }
                      ANL.GOV = {
                           NERSC.GOV = ES.NET
                      }
                      PNL.GOV = {
                           NERSC.GOV = ES.NET
                      }
                      ES.NET = {
                           NERSC.GOV = .
                      }
                      TEST.ANL.GOV = {
                           NERSC.GOV = ANL.GOV
                           NERSC.GOV = ES.NET
                      }

       In the above examples, the ordering is not important, except when the same subtag name is  used  more
       then  once. The client will use this to determing the path. (It is not important to the server, since
       the transited field is not sorted.)

       If this section is not present, or if the client or server cannot find  a  client/server  path,  then
       normal hierarchical orginization is assumed.

       This  feature  is  not  currently  supported by DCE. DCE security servers can be used with Kerberized
       clients and servers, but versions prior to DCE 1.1 did not fill in the transited field, and should be
       used with caution.


<b>DATABASE</b> <b>DEFAULT</b> <b>SECTION</b>
       The  [dbdefaults] section indicates default values for the database specific parameters.  It can also
       specify the configuration section under dbmodules for database specific parameters used by the  load-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able&nbsp;loadable</font>
       able database library.


       The following tags are used in this section:

              space-separated.  The  LDAP  server is specified by a LDAP URI.  This value is used if no LDAP
              servers are mentioned in the configuration section under dbmodules.


       ldap_conns_per_server
              This LDAP specific tag indicates the number of connections to be maintained per  LDAP  server.
              This  value is used if the number of connections per LDAP server are not mentioned in the con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">figuration&nbsp;configuration</font>
              figuration section under dbmodules. The default value is 5.


<b>DATABASE</b> <b>MODULE</b> <b>SECTION</b>
       Each tag in the [dbmodules] section of the file names a configuration section for  database  specific
       parameters  that can be referred to by a realm.  The value of the tag is a subsection where the rela-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tions&nbsp;relations</font>
       tions in that subsection define the database specific parameters.


       For each section, the following tags may be specified in the subsection:
