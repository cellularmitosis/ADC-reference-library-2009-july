<TITLE>Creating Applications</TITLE>

<H1><A NAME="REF11664">Creating Applications</A></H1>
<P><B>Note:</B> To create an application that has compiled code, use Project Builder instead of WebObjects Builder. See "<U><A HREF="../../GettingStarted/Compiled/compiled.book.html">Creating a Compiled WebObjects Application</A></U>" in <I>Getting Started</I>.
<P>To create a new application in WebObjects Builder:

<OL>
<P><B><LI></B>Choose File-&gt;New Application.
<P>The panel that opens shows you the contents of <I><B>&lt;DocumentRoot&gt;</I>/WebObjects</B> (unless you have previously saved into a different directory). <I><B>&lt;DocumentRoot&gt;</B></I> is your HTTP server's document root, which you specified when you installed WebObjects. 
<BR>
<P><B><LI></B>Enter a name for the application. 
<BR>
<P><B><LI></B>Click Save to create the application directory. 
<BR>
</OL>

<P>WebObjects Builder creates the application directory <I>AppName</I><B>.woa</B>, where <I>AppName</I> is the name you specified. Under <I>AppName</I><B>.woa</B>, WebObjects Builder creates another directory called <B>Main.wo</B> for your first page, or <I>component</I>. (See "<U><A HREF="AppLayout.html#REF57649">Layout of Application in the File System</A></U>.") 
<P>An empty editing window for <B>Main.wo</B> opens along with an <U><A HREF="AppWindow.html">application window</A></U> that lists all the components in your application. At first only <B>Main.wo</B> is listed in the application window.
