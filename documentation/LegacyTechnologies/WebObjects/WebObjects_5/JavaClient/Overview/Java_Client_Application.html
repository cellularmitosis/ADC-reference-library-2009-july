The distributionlayer on the client provides an HTTP channel to handle communicationbetween the application server and the Java Client application.</font></p><p><font face="Times">A Java Client WebObjects application gives you considerableflexibility in how you compose the pages of your application. However,it is strongly recommended that your Java Client projects be executedon the client as stand-alone applications instead of applets. Bydoing this, you avoid the many compatibility issues present whenrunning applets inside different browsers. However, if your businessrequires that your project use applets on the client instead ofapplications, you can combine Java Client applets and static and dynamic(WebObjects) HTML elements in various ways. You can have pages withor without Java Clients or pages with multiple Java Clients, eachwith its own controller. For example, you could have a login pagethat takes the user to one of many Java Client pages based on somepiece of account data. In addition, Java Client applets are notlimited to the downloaded JFC components; as can any applet, theycan create dialogs and secondary windows on the fly.</font></p><p><font face="Times">When you create a Java Client project using Project Builder,the project is organized using three targets:</font></p><ul><p><li>The Web Servertarget, which lists the files required to build the client application.<p>Thistarget contains an interface file that stores an archive of J2SE(and other 100% Pure Java) objects. That file's owner is a customsubclass of EOInterfaceController. For more on Interface Buildersee  <a sector="mod" href="../Creating/iCreating_th_r_Interface.html" target="_top">"Creating the User Interface"</a>.</p></li></p><p><li>The Application Server target, which lists the files neededto build the server application.<p>This target includes the <code>Main.wo</code> componentthat contains a subcomponent of type WOJavaClientApplet. Also includedare the <code>Application</code>, <code>Session</code>,and <code>DirectAction</code> classes.</p></li></p><p><li>The root target, named after the project, which groups theClient and Server targets. It is used to build the entire project(the Client and Server products) as a single unit.</li></p></ul><p><font face="Times">For more on Project Builder's targets see  <a sector="mod" href="../Creating/iThe_Ingredi_ent_Project.html" target="_top">"File Organization in Project Builder"</a>.</font></p><p><font face="Times">The frameworks required to build a Java Client applicationare also automatically added to your project.</font></p><p><font face="Times">When you launch the client side of a Java Client application(an application or an applet), the server application creates aWOSession object. It contains the EOEditingContext and EODistributionContextobjects used to manage enterprise objects (read from and write to adatabase) and to synchronize them with their counterparts on theclient.</font></p><p><font face="Times">With Java Client applets, the client automatically downloadsthe classes that it needs to run from the server if they are notalready installed on the client's classpath. This way the client-sideapplet is always updated. There are several disadvantages with thisapproach: </font></p><ul><p><li><b>Longerapplication launch times</b> Launch times suffer becausethe client has to make sure that the appropriate classes are installedbefore the applet can run.</li></p><p><li><b>Security restrictions</b> Browsers imposerestrictions on the actions that downloaded code can perform onthe client machine (those restrictions can be modified or removed byediting preference settings in the browser).</li></p><p><li><b>Application instability</b> Java VirtualMachine (VM) implementations in browsers are generally poor. Whenmore than one applet are run inside a browser, they often share thesame VM, contributing to application instability.</li></p></ul><p><font face="Times">When the client-side applications are executed as applicationsinstead of applets, launch times are minimized because the serversends only data to the client, not class implementations. However,when a new version of an application is developed, the client needsto be manually upgraded; otherwise, an exception is thrown whenthe user tries to run the application.</font></p><p><font face="Times">As you can see from the diagram in  <a href="#BCIJEBJF">Figure 1-3</a>, each session createdand managed by the WebObjects application has, if it is communicatingwith a Java Client application, its own editing context and itsown server-side distribution layer. As described earlier, communicationbetween the server and client is handled through the distributionlayers on the server and the client. The WOApplication maintainsthe object store (EODatabaseContext) for all its sessions. </font></p><a name = "BCIJEBJF"></a><p><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande"><b>Figure1-3 Java Client in a WebObjects application</b></font></p> <img src = "../Art/javaclientinwoapp.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/javaclientinwoapp.gif]"><p><font face="Times">The session object is, by default, the delegate of the distributionlayer's EODistributionContext, the object that handles communicationon the server. The EODistributionContext class defines several security-relateddelegate methods for validating remote invocations; if you wish,you can simply implement these methods in your Session class.</font></p><br>    <br><a href="Java_Client_Architecture.html" target="_right"><img src="../Images/previous.gif" border="0" alt="Previous"></a><a href="Java_Client_and_Classes.html" target="_right"><img src="../Images/next.gif" border="0" alt="Next"></a>&nbsp;<p><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="1">&#169; 2001 Apple Computer, Inc.</font></p><!-- start of footer --><!--#include virtual="/includes/framesetfooter" --><!-- end of footer --></body></html>
