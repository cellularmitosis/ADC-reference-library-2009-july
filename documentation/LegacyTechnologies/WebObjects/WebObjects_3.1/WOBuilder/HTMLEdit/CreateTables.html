<H1><A NAME="REF72665"><B></B>Creating Tables</A></H1>
<P>Create a table just like you would any other type of static HTML element: Place the cursor where the table should appear, and drag the table from the Static Elements palette. (See "<U><A HREF="UsingStaticElementsPalette.html#REF81034">Using the Static Elements Palette</A></U>".)

<BR>
<P><LI>Set the HTML attributes for a table (for example the size of its border, cell padding, and alignment) in the inspector window. 
<BR>
<P><LI>To add another HTML element inside of a cell, make sure you have the text inside the cell selected rather than the cell itself, then drag the element from the palette.
<BR>
<P><LI>You can also add an element outside of a table cell (for example, you can add a WORepetition around a table row) by selecting the row and dragging the element onto it.
<P><B>Tip: </B>To set bindings for an element that surrounds a table row, use the inspector interface. Click inside the row, then select the element from the icon path in the inspector. See "<U><A HREF="SelectElements.html#REF21198">Selecting Elements</A></U>" and "<U><A HREF="../DynElem/BindInInspector.html">Binding Elements Using the Inspector</A></U>" for more information.
