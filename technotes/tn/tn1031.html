The rest, of course, is Dogcow history. In the span of seven years, the Dogcow has gained almostmythological status, serving as the de facto mascot and torchbearer for legionsof Apple Developer Technical Support engineers. And its magic continues to thisday.</p><p id = "introtext">This Technote attempts to document the Dogcow's various and sundry exploits --most recently, in the world of QuickTime VR. Indeed, some might say that theDogcow has "gone VR." In any case, this Note looks at some of the Dogcow'shistory and peregrinations and then explains the technique for creating aQuickTime VR object movie with the Dogcow as star. Could a part in the next<i>Babe</i> movie be far behind?

This is quite anaccomplishment for a two-dimensional object; note that the filing cabinet is athree-dimensional object. The filing cabinet originally had no belt wrappedaround it as it does now. Mike Marinkovich, a prodigiously talented DTSengineer, suggested in a flash of brilliance that<i> a belt was necessary.</i>So we had one custom tailored by a belt manufacturer, just for Clarus. The beltextended all the way around Clarus's belly. But after a lengthy debate amongDTS engineers and managers, it was decided that no belt was necessary afterall! Figure 5 shows the Dogcow performing extra duty, archiving the 350 "old"Macintosh Technical Notes.</p><center><img src="images/tn1031_008.gif" alt="" width=171 height=157><P><b>Figure 5</b>.

Thetechniques for doing this are explained in the VR Cookbook.</p><P>Here is the finished DogCow.MoofVR movie (352K in size) for you to download: </p><A HREF = "downloads/tn_1031.6.hqx"><img src="images/tn1031_015.gif" alt="" width=92 height=59></a><p>You'll also need the QuickTime VR Player to play the movie, which you candownload from Apple's QuickTime VR Website at<A HREF = "http://www.apple.com/quicktime/qtvr/index.html">http://www.apple.com/quicktime/qtvr/index.html</a>.</p><h3>A Cookbook for Creating the DogCow.MoofVR Movie</h3><P>What follows is a cookbook, with a couple of recipes, for creating your ownQuickTime VR object movie. George Warner and I have worked through theingredients and steps involved, using an image processing tool, a 3D renderingpackage, and Adobe Premiere.</p><h3>Step #1</h3><P>The first thing you want to do is get a PICT of the Dogcow. You need thehigh-resolution version. Using Resedit, you can grab the PICT resource -8187from the LaserWriter 8 driver.</p><P>Figure 8 shows you the Dogcow in a PICT resource.</p><center><img src="images/tn1031_016.gif" alt="" width=101 height=111><P><b>Figure 8</b>. Dogcow as PICT resource -8187</p></center><h3>Step #2</h3><P>Using an image processing tool, such as Adobe PhotoShop or Dazzler, you need tocreate four PICT files: </p><ul><li>the Dogcow</li><li>the Dogcow mask</li><li>grass (a green circle)</li><li>a black mask for the grass </li></ul><P>Use the Dogcow PICT that you saved in the previous step to create the Dogcowmask. The grass is just a green circle; the mask is a black circle.</p><P>Figure 9 shows you the four PICT files you need to create.</p><center><img src="images/tn1031_017.gif" alt="" width=340 height=81><P><b>Figure 9</b>. Four PICTs you need to create, with masks of the Dogcowand grass.</p></center><h3>Step #3</h3><P>Using a 3D Modeling and Rendering package, such as INFINI-D or StrataVision,you want to create two rectangle objects for the Dogcow standing on thegrass.</p><P>Use the masks and pictures generated in Step #2 to generate the surfaces of theobjects. The masks are used as part of the textures to show where the objectsare transparent. You should now have four objects in your scene: </p><ul><li>the Dogcow (rectangle object with Dogcow surface)</li><li>the grass (rectangle object with grass surface)</li><li>a lightsource (default)</li><li>the camera (default)</li></ul><P>Figure 10 shows you the Dogcow standing the grass.</p><center><img src="images/tn1031_018.gif" alt="" width=65 height=59><P><b>Figure 10</b>. The Dogcow standing on the grass.</p></center><h3>Step #3a: Some Choices You Need to Make</h3><P>You now have to make some choices (George's choices are shown in parentheses).These include the following: </p><ul><li>movie size (128 x 96, George recommends a 3: 4 aspect ratio)</li><li>number of frames/revolution (36, in 10deg. steps)</li><li>number of revolutions (19, north 90deg. to south 90deg. in 10deg. steps)</li><li>frame rate (12 frames/second for 3 seconds for 36 frames/revolution)</li><li>QuickTime compressor (Animation)</li></ul><P>These options tradeoff resolution against memory size or performance. Thebigger the screen size, or the greater the number of frames, the more memoryrequired. The fewer the frames, the coarser the results.</p><h3>Step #4 </h3><P>What QuickTime VR expects is an array of frames, rows and columns. To generatethose, you need to create a movie for every row and then paste them togetherinto a single movie.</p><P>Starting at the top of your object, record a movie of one rotation. Move thecamera down 10deg. and point it at the Dogcow.</p><P>Move the camera down 10deg., point it at the Dogcow, and record another fullrotation. Repeat this until you're at the bottom of the object. You now have 19movies of 36 frames each. Using MoviePlayer or Adobe Premiere, paste all ofthese into a single movie and save it flattened. You now have 36frames/revolution for 19 revolutions for a total of 684 frames.</p><h3>Step #5</h3><P>Drag this movie and drop it on the "Make QTVR Object 1.0b1" application. PressCommand-1 to add object data to the movie, as shown Figure 11.</p><Center><P><A HREF = "downloads/tn_1031.7.hqx">Make QTVR Object 1.0b1 (116K)</a></p><img src="images/tn1031_019.gif" alt="" width=32 height=32></center><BR><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=550><TR><td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><P><B>Note:</B><BR>These are the values that George used.

Add Object Data dialog </p></center><h3>Step #6</h3><P>Hit the OK button and enjoy!</p><h3>Step #7</h3><P>Go to lunch, or depending on your time zone, dinner.</p><h3>A Sidebar: How George Did Texture Maps in Infini-D</h3><P>To add surface for the Dogcow and the grass, use a mask layer to set thetransparency. Import the Dogcow mask generated in Step #2. Set mapping mode toCopy and the repeat to H: 1, V: 1. Also set the transparency to 100% and invert.Now import the Dogcow PICT from Step #2 as the second layer. This layer will bein mapping mode Reveal, and the repeat is H: 1, V: 1, with no transparency, andno invert. The grass surface is generated the same way, using the appropriatepictures from Step #2.</p><center><img src="images/tn1031_021.gif" alt="" width=277 height=203><P><b>Figure 12</b>.
