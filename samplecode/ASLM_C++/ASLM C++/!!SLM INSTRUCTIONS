# List of things when moving a generic C++ class to a SLM C++ class1. Remove all #pragma segment statements if you don't wantexplicit segmentation handling. SLM will do that anyway.2. Move all constructors to a NV.cp file.3. Make sure to have a default constructor and destructor.4. Create a Makefile.5. Add the needed .r files that will be used to Rez things into code resources	- we need two, one for the Library rez, and the other for the 	  test tool rez.6. Add pragma statements about the shared library rules.7. Make sure that all exported class functions are virtual!8. Make sure you have a InitLibraryManager() call in the main   function.   9. Don't forget to add 'public TDynamic' base class.10.Hack when needed.
