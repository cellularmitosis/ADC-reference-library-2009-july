README - QTReadWriteJPEG This sample code illustrates how to compress and decompress JPEG images using QuickTime. We use the FCompressImage function, but you could also use the CompressImage function.Although this sample demonstrates only JPEG compression/decompression, you could use thisas a framework for other types of compression (except for the decoding of the JPEG header).This code is based largely on the existing code sample "JPEG Sample" by Mike Marinkovich andGuillermo Ortiz. This newer version is uncoupled from the Mac application framework they usedand now runs on Windows.Enjoy,QuickTime Team
