Where Do I look for what I want?????This is a rather large sample, and it combines two major areas, AppleEventsand the Edition Manager.  I have tried to break up the source filesinto easy to understand chunks, so you can find what you need without too much flailing around in code you don't care about.Here's a breakdown of what each file contains....Files :obj:	just a directory.  Needs to be here so the Make file knows where to put the 		object filesAEObject.c	AppleEvent Object Model code.  If you are interested in working			with the AppleEventª Object Model (and you should be) this is the 			file you should look in for seeing Object Accessor routines, Object			Packing routines, OSL callbacks, and the AppleEvent Handlers			for AppleEvents that take objects as their direct object.Sampdefines.h	This file includes all the other headers neededAEObject-Edition Sample.make	The make file.  Oh, you already knew that?AESample.rscr		Copy of all the non-code resourcesStructs.h	All the structures used in this sampleAEUtilities.c	Some handy common AppleEvent routines.AppleEventCore.c	The core AppleEvent code.  This is the file that					installs all the AppleEvent Handlers, handles all the					Required and some of the Edition Manager AppleEvents,					calls AEProcessAppleEvent, and handles the AppleEvent 					dialog boxesBuildHeaders.c	A file that builds and dumps all the header (.h) files				into a precompiled version.  If you are NOT using precompiled				headers in MPW C yet, you SHOULD!!!! They will save you 				at least 40% of your current compile time.Files.c		Handles file opening and saving.  Also writes out and reads			my preferences file.  Uses the new StandardFile calls, FSSpecs,			and the FindFolder routine.globals.c	Application globals.  There are more globals here that you would probably 			want in a 'real' application, I kept many things as globals for the			sake of clarity.Initialize.c	Application initialization routines.Macros.h	All the macros (not many) that I use in this app.main.c		The main event loop for this app.Menu.c		Uhhhh, handles menu stuff. Also has some of the self-contained			Dialog boxes (like the About box).Print.c		Minimal printing routine.prototypes.h	All the prototypes for this applicationPublish.c	Publisher routines.  Almost all the code used for handling			publishing is in this file.  Publisher dialog, writing Publisher 			data, handlers for the Publisher AppleEvents, and some other routines			are here.  However, there are some publishing routines that 			are very similar to Subscriber routines, and they will be in the 			Subscribe.c file.'¥Read Me¥'	Simple read meSampConstants.h	Constants for this applicationSubscribe.c		All the subscriber code for this application.				Subscriber dialogs, option dialogs,				reading AppleEvent handler, and all the routines 				that deal with Sections on the ClipBoard are in this file.TextSections.c	This file contains the minimal handling I do of text subscribers				and publishers.  This is the weakest section, since I am using 				TextEdit for my word processor.  However, it will give you				an idea of how to do publishing and subscribing in text,				and show you one way of doing it.Utilities.c		Utility routines.  Nuff said.  Steal these and use them.Windows.c		My window handling code.  Window creation, window drawing,				hit testing, and all that other nastiness is in here.  If it has				to do with windows, I hope I put it here.And that's the lot.  If this is not organized in a helpful way, please let me knowand I will change things.  If you do like it, let me know so I have bothsides of the story.Also, if the comments in any section are not clear enough, please tell me.I want this to be a solid reference for AppleEvents and the Edition Manager,and if the comments aren't clear I haven't done my job.C.K.
