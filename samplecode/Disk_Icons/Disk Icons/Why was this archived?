Why Was This Archived?This sample was archived because the techniques it uses, csCode 21 and 22, are of limited value.  They calls still work, but they rarely return the icon that's actually being displayed to the user.  Client software that wants to get an icon for a volume should use Icon Services instead.Quinn "The Eskimo!"Worldwide Developer Technical Support9 Jun 1999
