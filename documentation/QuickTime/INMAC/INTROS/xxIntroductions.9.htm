QuickTime also relies on the Component Manager, as well as a set of predefined components. Figure 0-1 shows the relationships of these managers and an application that is playing a movie.</P><P CLASS="Fg.Figure"><A NAME="pgfId=25455"> </A>Figure 0-4	QuickTime playing a movie<DIV><IMG SRC="xxIntroductions-6.gif"></DIV></P><DIV><IMG SRC="xxIntroductions-5.gif"></DIV><P CLASS="T1.Text1"><A NAME="pgfId=25456"> </A>The following sections discuss these managers in more detail.</P><DIV><H2 CLASS="H3.Heading3"><A NAME="pgfId=25457"> </A>The Movie Toolbox</H2><P CLASS="T0.Text0"><A NAME="pgfId=25459"> </A><A NAME="marker=25458"> </A>Your application gains access to the capabilities of QuickTime by calling functions in the Movie Toolbox. The Movie Toolbox allows you to store, retrieve, and manipulate time-based data that is stored in QuickTime movies. A single movie may contain several types of data. For example, a movie that contains video information might include both video data and the sound data that accompanies the video.</P><P CLASS="T1.Text1"><A NAME="pgfId=25460"> </A>The Movie Toolbox also provides functions for editing movies. For example, there are editing functions for shortening a movie by removing portions of the video and sound tracks, and there are functions for extending it with the addition of new data from other QuickTime movies. </P></DIV><DIV><H2 CLASS="H3.Heading3"><A NAME="pgfId=25462"> </A>The Image Compression Manager</H2><P CLASS="T0.Text0"><A NAME="pgfId=25464"> </A><A NAME="marker=25463"> </A>The Image Compression Manager comprises a set of functions that compress and decompress images or sequences of graphic images. </P><P CLASS="T1.Text1"><A NAME="pgfId=25465"> </A>The Image Compression Manager provides a device-independent and driver-independent means of compressing and decompressing images and sequences  of images. It also contains a simple interface for implementing software and hardware image-compression algorithms. It provides system integration functions for storing compressed images as part of PICT files, and it offers the ability to automatically decompress compressed PICT files on any QuickTime-capable Macintosh computer.</P><P CLASS="T1.Text1"><A NAME="pgfId=25466"> </A>In most cases, applications use the Image Compression Manager indirectly, by calling Movie Toolbox functions or by displaying a compressed picture. However, if your application compresses images or makes movies with compressed images, you will call Image Compression Manager functions.</P><P CLASS="T1.Text1"><A NAME="pgfId=25467"> </A>The Image Compression Manager is described in the chapter &quot;Image Compression Manager&quot; later in this book. This chapter also includes code samples that show how to compress images or make movies with compressed images.</P></DIV><hr>&#169; 1997 Apple Computer, Inc.<!-- QTnavbar start --><P><I>QuickTime API Documentation</I><P><A target="doc" HREF="xxIntroductions.8.htm">Previous</A> | <A target="doc" HREF="xxIntroductions.7.htm">Chapter Top</A> | <A target="doc" HREF="xxIntroductions.1.htm">Chapter Contents</A> | <A target="doc" HREF="xxIntroductions.a.htm">Next</A> | <!-- QTnavbar end --><!-- start of footer --><!--#include virtual="/includes/framesetfooter" --><!-- end of footer --></BODY></HTML>
