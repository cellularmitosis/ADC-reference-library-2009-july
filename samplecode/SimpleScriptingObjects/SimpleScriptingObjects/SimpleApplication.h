	/* kvc methods for the 'trinkets' AppleScript element.  Here we implement the methods
	necessary for maintaining the list of trinkets inside of the application container.
	Note the names. In our scripting definition file we specified that the application container
	class contains an element of type 'trinket', like so:
		<element type="trinket"/>
	Cocoa will use the plural form of the class name, 'trinkets',  when naming the
	property used by AppleScript to access the list of buckets, and we should use
	the property name when naming our methods.  So, using the property name, we
	name our methods as follows:
		- (NSArray*) trinkets;
		-(void) insertInTrinkets:(id) trinket;
		-(void) insertInTrinkets:(id) trinket atIndex:(unsigned)index;
		-(void) removeFromTrinketsAtIndex:(unsigned)index;
	*/

	/* return the entire list of trinkets */
- (NSArray*) trinkets;

	/* insert a trinket at the beginning of the list */
-(void) insertInTrinkets:(id) trinket;

	/* insert a trinket at some position in the list */
-(void) insertInTrinkets:(id) trinket atIndex:(unsigned)index;

	/* remove a trinket from the list */
-(void) removeFromTrinketsAtIndex:(unsigned)index;




	/* kvc methods for the 'treasures' AppleScript element.  Here we implement the methods
	necessary for maintaining the list of treasures inside of the application container.
	Note the names. In our scripting definition file we specified that the application container
	class contains an element of type 'treasure', like so:
		<element type="treasure"/>
	Cocoa will use the plural form of the class name, 'treasures',  when naming the
	property used by AppleScript to access the list of buckets, and we should use
	the property name when naming our methods.  So, using the property name, we
	name our methods as follows:
		- (NSArray*) treasures;
		-(void) insertInTreasures:(id) treasure;
		-(void) insertInTreasures:(id) treasure atIndex:(unsigned)index;
		-(void) removeFromTreasuresAtIndex:(unsigned)index;
	*/
	
	/* return the entire list of treasures */
- (NSArray*) treasures;

	/* insert a treasure at the beginning of the list */
-(void) insertInTreasures:(id) treasure;

	/* insert a treasure at some position in the list */
-(void) insertInTreasures:(id) treasure atIndex:(unsigned)index;

	/* remove a treasure from the list */
-(void) removeFromTreasuresAtIndex:(unsigned)index;




	/* kvc methods for the 'buckets' AppleScript element.  Here we implement the methods
	necessary for maintaining the list of buckets inside of the application container.
	Note the names. In our scripting definition file we specified that the application container
	class contains an element of type 'bucket', like so:
		<element type="bucket"/>
	Cocoa will use the plural form of the class name when naming the property used by
	AppleScript to access the list of buckets, and we should use the property name
	when naming our methods.  So, using the property name, we name our methods as follows:
		- (NSArray*) buckets;
		-(void) insertInBuckets:(id) bucket;
		-(void) insertInBuckets:(id) bucket atIndex:(unsigned)index;
		-(void) removeFromBucketsAtIndex:(unsigned)index;
			
	*/
	
	/* return the entire list of buckets */
- (NSArray*) buckets;

	/* insert a bucket at the beginning of the list */
-(void) insertInBuckets:(id) bucket;

	/* insert a bucket at some position in the list */
-(void) insertInBuckets:(id) bucket atIndex:(unsigned)index;

	/* remove a bucket from the list */
-(void) removeFromBucketsAtIndex:(unsigned)index;



	/* kvc methods for the 'strong boxes' AppleScript element.  Here we implement the methods
	necessary for maintaining the list of strong boxes inside of the application container.
	Note the names. In our scripting definition file we specified that the 'strong box'
	class contains an element of type 'strong box', like so:
			<element type="strong box">
				<cocoa key="strongBoxes"/>
			</element>
	But, in our class definition of 'strong box' we have specified an irregular plural form
	for the class name:
		<class name="strong box" plural="strong boxes" code="ScOS" inherits="bucket"
			description="An object that can contain other objects.">
	This makes sense, because simply slapping an 's' on the end of our class name won't
	produce the correct plural form for our class (ie, 'strong boxes') and we would like
	the user to see a proper spelling.
	
	But, now, since we have provided our own plural form, exactly what Cocoa key should
	be used becomes ambiguous.  So, what we have done is explicitly called out the Cocoa
	key we are going to use for our collection of strong boxes inside of our element
	declaration inside of our application class object (see above).   With that in place,
	we can define our accessor methods using the key strongBoxes and normal kvc conventions:
			
	*/
	
	/* return the entire list of strong boxes */
- (NSArray*) strongBoxes;

	/* insert a strong box at the beginning of the list */
-(void) insertInStrongBoxes:(id) strongBox;

	/* insert a strong box at some position in the list */
-(void) insertInStrongBoxes:(id) strongBox atIndex:(unsigned)index;

	/* remove a strong box from the list */
-(void) removeFromStrongBoxesAtIndex:(unsigned)index;




	/* since the application object will act as a container for other objects,
	and the objectSpecifier method on all of our objects that our application
	can contain will call the objectSpecifier method on it's container object
	we have provided an objectSpecifier method here.  The method on the application
	container object always returns nil to indicate that it is the root container
	object.   See the description of the objectSpecifier method in Element.h/m
	for more information. */
- (NSScriptObjectSpecifier *)objectSpecifier;




	/* kvc method for the 'weight' AppleScript property.  Note that rather
	than simply returning a value, this method calculates its result by
	summing the weights of all of the trinkets, treasures, buckets,
	and strong boxes contained in the application.
	
	Also note, 'weight' is a declared as a read only property in our scripting
	definition file so we have not defined a 'setWeight:' method here.  */
- (NSNumber*) weight;



	/* kvc method for the 'value' AppleScript property.  Here also rather
	than simply returning a value, this method calculates its result by
	summing the values of all of the treasures, buckets, and strong boxes
	contained in the application.  And, as with the 'weight' property,
	'value' is a declared as a read only property in our scripting
	definition file so we have not defined a 'setValue:' method here. */
