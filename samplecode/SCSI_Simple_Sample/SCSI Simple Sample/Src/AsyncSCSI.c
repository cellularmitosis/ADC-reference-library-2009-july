This is a * synchronous call that executes a single SCSI Command on a device. It will * automatically calls Request Sense on errors. Note: this is intended as a self- * contained illustration of the Asynchronous SCSI Manager and is (intentionally) * inefficient in that it does many "bureaucratic" things that would normally * be done once when an application or device driver is initialized. * * Calling Sequence: *		OSErr				AsyncSCSI( *				DeviceIdent				scsiDevice, *				const SCSI_CommandPtr	scsiCommand, *				unsigned short			cmdBlockLength, *				Boolean					writeToDevice, *				Ptr						bufferPtr, *				unsigned long			transferSize, *				unsigned short			scsiHandshake[handshakeDataLength], *				SCSI_Sense_Data			*senseDataPtr, *				unsigned long			senseDataSize, *				unsigned long			completionTimeout, *				unsigned short			*stsBytePtr, *				unsigned long			*actualTransferCount *			); * The parameters have the following meaning: * *	scsiDevice			The SCSI host bus, target, lun that we are talking to. *	scsiCommand			The SCSI Command Block (6, 10, or 12 bytes). *	cmdBlockLength		The length in bytes of the command block. *	writeToDevice		TRUE if this command writes to the device. FALSE if this *						command reads from the device or does not require a data *						phase. *	bufferPtr			The user data buffer for Read/Write commands. It should be *						NULL if a data transfer phase is not used for this command. *						(e.g. for Test Unit Ready). *	transferSize		The total number of bytes to transfer. *	scsiHandshake		This will be copied to the scsiHandshake field in the *						SCSIAction parameter block. Useful handshake fields *						include the following: *							0				No handshake: do one blind transfer, *							512,0			Normal disk blind transfer, *							1,511,0			Disk blind transfer if the device *											can stall before *and* after the *											first byte in a sector. *						If scsiHandshake is NULL, a polled transfer will be done.. *	senseDataPtr		If not NULL and the original request failed, this will *						be filled with the result from a Request Sense operation. *	senseDataSize		This is the size of the Request Sense data buffer. *	completionTimeout	The timeout (in Ticks) for the command. This should be *						short for disks, but must be long for tape devices and *						some setup requests, such as Mode Select. *	stsBytePtr			This short is set to the byte returned in the device's *						Status Phase. *	actualTransferCount	This will be set to the number "cycles" through the TIB *						loop. This should equal the number of bytes transferred if *						transferCount is set to one. (Ignored if NULL.) * Return codes: *	noErr			normal *	unimpErr		SCSI Manager 4.3 is not available: the calling function should *					call the "old" (Inside Mac IV) SCSI Manager. *	statusErr		Device returned "Check condition" and SCSI Manager was able *					to successfully issue Request Sense. There is data in the *					Sense Record, but you cannot assume that the original request *					succeeded. *	paramErr		Could not determine the command length. *	scsi...
