If we are in the old 68K environment	then this macro does nothing. MakeProcPtr creates a reference to	the function pointer 'proc'. If we are using routine descriptors	then the reference is the address of the descriptor created by	DeclareProcPtr(). If we are in a 68K world then the reference	is just the proc pointer itself.*/#if TARGET_RT_MAC_CFM#define DeclareProcPtr(proc, upp)	\		RoutineDescriptor g_##proc = BUILD_ROUTINE_DESCRIPTOR(upp, proc);#define ExternalProcPtr(proc)	\		extern RoutineDescriptor g_##proc;#define MakeProcPtr(proc, procType)	\		((procType)&g_##proc)		#else#define DeclareProcPtr(proc, upp)#define ExternalProcPtr(proc)#define MakeProcPtr(proc, procType)	\		((procType)proc)		#endif
