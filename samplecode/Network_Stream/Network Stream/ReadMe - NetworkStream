However, what you arenot permitted to do is to redistribute the source as "DTS Sample Code"after having made changes. If you're going to re-distribute the source,we require that you make it clear in the source that the code wasdescended from Apple Sample Code, but that you've made changes.NetworkStream is a C++ Stream IO class object for OpenTransport Network I/O.Written in Metrowerks C++ It implements a TNetworkBuf, TNetworkOStream  andTNetworkIOStream object.  Although I have implemented the insertion class TNetworkOStream I have not yetimplemented what is needed for the TNetworkIStream class. THis is mostlybecause I am unclear how to best handle what happens when you read more datathan is in the buffer. If you support the thread mamanger then I need tohandle the yield/suspend/resume thread issues.This code has been extracted from my httpServer Sample.although the project compiles it is really a snippet and isnt nearly ready torun. examine the main.cp file to understand how to use it.I was last able to compile it under CW9.good luck*------------Vinnie MoscaritoloApple DTS Sniper"One Shot..One Kill"http://www.vmeng.com/-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----Version: 2.6.2iQCVAwUBMauKV/MF2+rAU+UdAQE0JgQAj2Vx+ual6uqw8eC+ff5bSGbWgFvjjEpBP7lIZD819dRgs0P1F3/HUOvL61npBz1bDfC5xp8TQ6k1L4Mix1yD4BmYjJnsRgDxHVZIaCUTDIsEV2JWBvFMoRQEeckrcZqm6I5rUvoryM4n9TYR9HT1kZtFg8v7a5lKRnlZUOeX07M==5x4a-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----
