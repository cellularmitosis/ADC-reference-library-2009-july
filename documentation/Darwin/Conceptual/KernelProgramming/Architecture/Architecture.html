        <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000905-CH1g-CACDAEDC" title="Kernel Architecture Overview"></a><h1>Kernel Architecture
Overview</h1><p>Mac OS X provides many benefits to the Macintosh
user and developer communities. These benefits include improved
reliability and performance, enhanced networking features, an object-based
system programming interface, and increased support for industry
standards. </p>
<p>In creating Mac OS X, Apple has completely re-engineered the
Mac OS core operating system. Forming the foundation of Mac OS X
is the kernel. <span class="content_text"><a href="Architecture.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000905-CH1g-CACEFCJA">Figure 3-1</a></span> illustrates the Mac OS X architecture.</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000905-CH1g-CACEFCJA" title="Figure 3-1Mac OS X architecture"></a><p><strong>Figure 3-1&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Mac OS X architecture</p>
<img src = "../art/osxlayers.gif" alt = "" width="457" height="151"></div><br/>
<p>The kernel provides many enhancements for Mac OS X. These
include <strong>preemption</strong>, <strong>memory protection</strong>,
enhanced performance, improved networking facilities, support for both
Macintosh (Extended and Standard) and non-Macintosh (UFS, ISO 9660,
and so on) file systems, object-oriented APIs, and more. Two of
these features, preemption and memory protection, lead to a more
robust environment. </p>
<p>In Mac OS 9, applications cooperate to share processor time.
Similarly, all applications share the memory of the computer among
them. Mac OS 9 is a <strong>cooperative multitasking</strong> environment.
The responsiveness of all processes is compromised if even a single application
doesn’t cooperate. On the other hand, real-time applications such
as multimedia need to be assured of predictable, time-critical,
behavior.</p>
<p>In contrast, Mac OS X is a <strong>preemptive multitasking</strong> environment.
In Mac OS X, the kernel provides enforcement of cooperation, scheduling
processes to share time (preemption). This supports real-time behavior
in applications that require it.</p>
<p>In Mac OS X, processes do not normally share memory. Instead,
the kernel assigns each <strong>process</strong> its own <strong>address
space</strong>, controlling access to these address spaces. This
control ensures that no application can inadvertently access or
modify another application’s memory (protection). Size is not
an issue; with the virtual memory system included in Mac OS X, each
application has access to its own 4 GB address space.</p>
<p>Viewed together, all applications are said to run in user
space, but this does not imply that they share memory. User space
is simply a term for the combined address spaces of all user-level
applications. The kernel itself has its own address space, called
kernel space. In Mac OS X, no application can directly modify the
memory of the system software (the kernel).</p>
<p>Although user processes do not share memory by default as
in Mac OS 9, communication (and even memory sharing) between applications
is still possible. For example, the kernel offers a rich set of
primitives to permit some sharing of information among processes. These
primitives include shared libraries, frameworks, and POSIX shared
memory. Mach messaging provides another approach, handing memory
from one process to another. Unlike Mac OS 9, however, memory sharing
cannot occur without explicit action by the programmer.</p>

<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000905-CH1g-TPXREF101" title="Darwin"></a><h2>Darwin</h2>
<p>The Mac OS X kernel is an <strong>Open Source</strong> project.
The kernel, along with other core parts of Mac OS X are collectively
referred to as <strong>Darwin</strong>. Darwin is a complete operating
system based on many of the same technologies that underlie Mac
OS X. However, Darwin does not include Apple’s proprietary graphics
or applications layers, such as Quartz, QuickTime, Cocoa, Carbon,
or OpenGL.</p>
<p><span class="content_text"><a href="Architecture.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000905-CH1g-CACFIEGI">Figure 3-2</a></span> shows the relationship between Darwin and Mac OS
X. Both build upon the same kernel, but Mac OS X adds Core Services,
Application Services and QuickTime, as well as the <strong>Classic</strong>, <strong>Carbon</strong>, <strong>Cocoa</strong>,
and Java (JDK) application environments. Both Darwin and Mac OS
X include the BSD command-line application environment; however,
in Mac OS X, use of environment is not required, and thus it is
hidden from the user unless they choose to access it.</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000905-CH1g-CACFIEGI" title="Figure 3-2Darwin and Mac OS X"></a><p><strong>Figure 3-2&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Darwin and Mac OS X</p>
<img src = "../art/darwinlayers.gif" alt = "" width="456" height="151"></div><br/>
<p>Darwin technology is based on <strong>BSD</strong>, Mach
3.0, and Apple technologies. Best of all, Darwin technology is Open
Source technology, which means that developers have full access
to the source code. In effect, Mac OS X third-party developers can
be part of the Darwin core system software development team. Developers
can also see how Apple is doing things in the core operating system
and adopt (or adapt) code to use within their own products. Refer
to the <strong>Apple Public Source License</strong> (APSL) for
details.</p>
<p>Because the same software forms the core of both Mac OS X
and Darwin, developers can create low-level software that runs on
both Mac OS X and Darwin with few, if any, changes. The only difference
is likely to be in the way the software interacts with the application
environment. </p>
<p>Darwin is based on proven technology from many sources. A
large portion of this technology is derived from FreeBSD, a version
of 4.4BSD that offers advanced networking, performance, security,
and compatibility features. Other parts of the system software,
such as Mach, are based on technology previously used in Apple’s
MkLinux project, in Mac OS X Server, and in technology acquired
from NeXT. Much of the code is platform-independent. All of the
core operating-system code is available in source form.</p>
<p>The core technologies have been chosen for several reasons.
Mach provides a clean set of abstractions for dealing with memory
management, interprocess (and interprocessor) communication (IPC),
and other low-level operating-system functions. In today’s rapidly changing
hardware environment, this provides a useful layer of insulation
between the operating system and the underlying hardware. </p>
<p>BSD is a carefully engineered, mature operating system with
many capabilities. In fact, most of today’s commercial UNIX and
UNIX-like operating systems contain a great deal of BSD code. BSD
also provides a set of industry-standard APIs.</p>
<p>New technologies, such as the I/O Kit and Network Kernel Extensions
(NKEs), have been designed and engineered by Apple to take advantage
of advanced capabilities, such as those provided by an object-oriented
programming model. Mac OS X combines these new technologies with
time-tested industry standards to create an operating system that
is stable, reliable, flexible, and extensible.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000905-CH1g-TPXREF102" title="Architecture"></a><h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>The foundation layer of Darwin and Mac OS X is composed of
several architectural components, as shown in <span class="content_text"><a href="Architecture.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000905-CH1g-CACDCAGC">Figure 3-3</a></span>. Taken together, these
components form the <strong>kernel environment</strong>. </p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000905-CH1g-CACDCAGC" title="Figure 3-3Mac OS X kernel architecture"></a><p><strong>Figure 3-3&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Mac OS X kernel architecture</p>
<img src = "../art/osxarchitecture.gif" alt = "" width="298" height="181"></div><br/>
<div class="importantbox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000905-CH1g-DontLinkElementID_1" title="Important:"></a><p><strong>Important:</strong>&nbsp;

Note that Mac OS X uses the term <strong>kernel</strong> somewhat
differently than you might expect.</p><p></p></div>
<p>“A kernel, in traditional operating-system terminology,
is a small nucleus of software that provides only the minimal facilities
necessary for implementing additional operating-system services.”
— from <em>The Design and Implementation of the 4.4 BSD
Operating System</em>, McKusick, Bostic, Karels, and Quarterman,
1996.</p>
<p>Similarly, in traditional Mach-based operating systems, the
kernel refers to the Mach microkernel and ignores additional low-level
code without which Mach does very little.</p>
<p>In Mac OS X, however, the kernel environment contains much
more than the Mach kernel itself. The Mac OS X kernel environment
includes the Mach kernel, BSD, the I/O Kit, file systems, and networking
components. These are often referred to collectively as the kernel.
Each of these components is described briefly in the following sections.
For further details, refer to the specific component chapters or
to the reference material listed in the bibliography.</p>
<p>Because Mac OS X contains three basic components (Mach, BSD,
and the I/O Kit), there are also frequently as many as three APIs
for certain key operations. In general, the API chosen should match
the part of the kernel where it is being used, which in turn is
dictated by what your code is attempting to do. The remainder of
this chapter describes Mach, BSD, and the I/O Kit and outlines the
functionality that is provided by those components.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000905-CH1g-TPXREF103" title="Mach"></a><h3>Mach</h3>
<p>Mach manages processor resources such as CPU usage and memory,
handles scheduling, provides memory protection, and provides a messaging-centered
infrastructure to the rest of the operating-system layers. The Mach
component provides</p>

<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000905-CH1g-TPXREF104" title="BSD "></a><h3>BSD </h3>
<p>Above the Mach layer, the BSD layer provides “OS personality”
APIs and services. The BSD layer is based on the BSD kernel, primarily <strong>FreeBSD</strong>.
The BSD component provides</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>file systems</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>networking (except for the hardware device level)</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>UNIX security model</p></li>
<li class="li"><p><code><!--a-->syscall<!--/a--></code> support</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>the BSD process model, including process IDs and signals</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>FreeBSD kernel APIs</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>many of the <strong>POSIX</strong> APIs</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>kernel support for <strong>pthreads</strong> (POSIX threads)</p></li></ul>
<p>The BSD component is described in more detail in the chapter <span class="content_text"><a href="../BSD/BSD.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000905-CH214-TPXREF101">“BSD Overview.”</a></span></p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000905-CH1g-TPXREF106" title="Networking"></a><h4>Networking</h4>
<p>Mac OS X networking takes advantage of BSD’s advanced networking
capabilities to provide support for modern features, such as Network
Address Translation (<strong>NAT</strong>) and <strong>firewalls</strong>.
The networking component provides</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>4.4BSD TCP/IP
stack and socket APIs</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>support for both IP and DDP (AppleTalk transport)</p></li>
<li class="li"><p><strong>multihoming</strong></p></li>
<li class="li"><p>routing</p></li>
<li class="li"><p><strong>multicast</strong> support</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>server tuning</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>packet filtering</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Mac OS Classic support (through filters)</p></li></ul>
<p>More information about networking may be found in the chapter <span class="content_text"><a href="../Networking/Networking.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000905-CH216-BABHCHFC">“Network Architecture.”</a></span></p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000905-CH1g-TPXREF107" title="File Systems"></a><h4>File Systems</h4>
<p>Mac OS X provides support for numerous types of file systems,
including <strong>HFS</strong>, <strong>HFS+</strong>, <strong>UFS</strong>, <strong>NFS</strong>, <strong>ISO
9660</strong>, and others. The default file-system type is HFS+;
Mac OS X boots (and “roots”) from HFS+, UFS, ISO, NFS, and UDF.
Advanced features of Mac OS X file systems include an enhanced Virtual
File System (<strong>VFS</strong>) design. VFS provides for a
layered architecture (file systems are <strong>stackable</strong>).
The file system component provides</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p><strong>UTF-8</strong> (Unicode)
support</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>increased performance over previous versions of Mac OS.</p></li></ul>
<p>More information may be found in the chapter <span class="content_text"><a href="../Filesystem/Filesystem.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000905-CH215-BABEEHFF">“File Systems Overview.”</a></span></p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000905-CH1g-TPXREF105" title="I/O Kit"></a><h3>I/O Kit</h3>
<p>The I/O Kit provides a framework for simplified driver development,
supporting many categories of devices.The I/O Kit features an object-oriented
I/O architecture implemented in a restricted subset of C++. The
I/O Kit framework is both modular and extensible. The I/O Kit component
provides</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>true plug
and play</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>dynamic device management</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>dynamic (“on-demand”) loading of drivers</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>power management for desktop systems as well as portables</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>multiprocessor capabilities</p></li></ul>
<p>The I/O Kit is described in greater detail in the chapter <span class="content_text"><a href="../IOKit/IOKit.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000905-CH213-BEHJDFCA">“I/O Kit Overview.”</a></span></p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000905-CH1g-TPXREF108" title="Kernel Extensions"></a><h2>Kernel Extensions</h2>
<p>Mac OS X provides a kernel extension mechanism as a means
of allowing dynamic loading of pieces of code into kernel space,
without the need to recompile. These pieces of code are known generically
as <strong>plug-ins</strong> or, in the Mac OS X kernel environment,
as <strong>kernel extensions</strong> or <strong>KEXTs</strong>. </p>
<p>Because KEXTs provide both modularity and dynamic loadability,
they are a natural choice for any relatively self-contained service
that requires access to interfaces that are not exported to user
space. Many of the components of the kernel environment support
this extension mechanism, though they do so in different ways.</p>
<p>For example, some of the new networking features involve the
use of network kernel extensions (<strong>NKEs</strong>). These
are discussed in the chapter <span class="content_text"><a href="../Networking/Networking.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000905-CH216-BABHCHFC">“Network Architecture.”</a></span></p>
<p>The ability to dynamically add a new file-system implementation
is based on VFS KEXTs. Device drivers and device families in the
I/O Kit are implemented using KEXTs. KEXTs make development much
easier for developers writing drivers or those writing code to support
a new volume format or networking protocol. KEXTs are discussed
in more detail in the chapter <span class="content_text"><a href="../Extend/Extend.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000905-CH220-BEBDGFHI">“Kernel Extension Overview.”</a></span></p>
