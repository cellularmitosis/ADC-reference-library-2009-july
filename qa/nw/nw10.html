How can I mount an icon onthe desktop that is associated with a remote file system? Is it possible to usethe System 7 Pro catalog to do this in a way that would allow the catalog to bedynamic and to reflect my database of objects?</p><p id=p4>A:  What you are really saying is that you want your virtual jukebox to be anetwork file system. You have two options, and which one you choose dependsprimarily on what you really want to do and how much work you want to put intoit:</p><p id=p4>The first option is to create a remote disk driver. This would probably taketwo to three months to do, and you would be limited to read-only sharedaccess.</p><p id=p4>Your other option is to create a Foreign File System. This would probablyrequire six to eight months of work, but you would have read/write access.</p><p id=p4>Since your application is a CD-ROM jukebox, there is no need to maintain anycoherency across writes, since there are no writes. There are many examples ofhow to write a RAM disk available, and you can create your driver by(basically) adding your network code to one of these (this approach also givesyou a speed advantage).</p><p id=p4>If you need to share files (not disks), and you need to have read/write accessand locking, you have no choice except to create a Foreign File System. This isa tremendous amount of work, as indicated by the following quote from the FileSystem Manager guide:</p><p id=p4>"Important Note: Even though the File System Manager provides many servicesthat simplify development of foreign file systems, developing a foreign filesystem is both a difficult and time-consuming process. A minimal foreign filesystem must implement over forty Macintosh file-system routines, while anetworked, sharable file system has to implement as many as eighty Macintoshfile-system routines."</p><p id=p4>To see the full text of this topic, see the <b>February 1995 DeveloperCD:</b></p><p id=p4><b>Feb 95:New System Software Extensions:File System Manager SDK</b></p><p id=p4>Regardless of which option you choose, you should be aware that, with versionsof the system software prior to System Update 3.0, mounting more than 20volumes on the desktop crashes the system. Also, since the file system and thedevice manager both use 68K code (even on the PPC), you should considercompiling your application in 68K code, as this will eliminate a mode switch.</p></td></tr></table></center><!-- end_content --><!-- begin_date --><H4 ALIGN=center>[June 01 1995]</H4><!-- end_date --><!-- begin_footer_information -->	<table width="680" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
