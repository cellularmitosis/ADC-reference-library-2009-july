ZSHCOMPCTL(1)                                                                                  ZSHCOMPCTL(1)



<b>NAME</b>
       zshcompctl - zsh programmable completion

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       This version of zsh has two ways of performing completion of words on the command line.  New users of
       the shell may prefer to use the newer and more powerful system based  on  shell  functions;  this  is
       described in <a href="zshcompsys.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/zshcompsys"><u>zshcompsys</u>(1)</a>, and the basic shell mechanisms which support it are described in <a href="zshcompwid.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/zshcompwid"><u>zshcomp</u></a>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">wid(1).&nbsp;zshcompwid(1).</font>
       <a href="zshcompwid.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/zshcompwid"><u>wid</u>(1)</a>.  This manual entry describes the older <b>compctl</b> command.
       <b>compctl</b> [ <b>-CDT</b> ] <u>options</u> [ <u>command</u> ... ]
       <b>compctl</b> [ <b>-CDT</b> ] <u>options</u> [ <b>-x</b> <u>pattern</u> <u>options</u> <b>-</b> ... <b>--</b> ] [ <b>+</b> <u>options</u> [ <b>-x</b> ... <b>--</b> ] ... [<b>+</b>] ]  [  <u>com</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
       <u>mand</u> ... ]
       <b>compctl</b> <b>-M</b> <u>match-specs</u> ...
       <b>compctl</b> <b>-L</b> [ <b>-CDTM</b> ] [ <u>command</u> ... ]
       <b>compctl</b> <b>+</b> <u>command</u> ...

       Control the editor's completion behavior according to the supplied set of <u>options</u>.   Various  editing
       commands,  notably  <b>expand-or-complete-word</b>,  usually  bound  to tab, will attempt to complete a word
       typed by the user, while others, notably <b>delete-char-or-list</b>, usually bound to ^D  in  EMACS  editing
       mode, list the possibilities; <b>compctl</b> controls what those possibilities are.  They may for example be
       filenames (the most common case, and hence the default), shell variables, or words from a user-speci-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fied&nbsp;user-specified</font>
       fied list.


<b>COMMAND</b> <b>FLAGS</b>
       Completion  of  the  arguments of a command may be different for each command or may use the default.
       The behavior when completing the command word itself may also be separately specified.  These  corre-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">spond&nbsp;correspond</font>
       spond  to  the  following  flags and arguments, all of which (except for <b>-L</b>) may be combined with any
       combination of the <u>options</u> described subsequently in the section `Option Flags':

       <u>command</u> ...
              controls completion for the named commands, which must be listed last on the command line.  If
              completion  is  attempted  for  a command with a pathname containing slashes and no completion
              definition is found, the search is retried with the last pathname component.  If  the  command
              starts with a <b>=</b>, completion is tried with the pathname of the command.

              Any  of the <u>command</u> strings may be patterns of the form normally used for filename generation.
              These should be be quoted to protect them from immediate expansion; for  example  the  command
              string  <b>'foo*'</b>  arranges  for completion of the words of any command beginning with <b>foo</b>.  When
              completion is attempted, all pattern completions are tried in the reverse order of their defi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nition&nbsp;definition</font>
              nition until one matches.  By default, completion then proceeds as normal, i.e. the shell will
              try to generate more matches for the specific command on the command line; this can  be  over-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ridden&nbsp;overridden</font>
              ridden by including <b>-tn</b> in the flags for the pattern completion.

              Note  that  aliases  are  expanded  before  the  command  name  is  determined unless the <b>COM</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">PLETE_ALIASES&nbsp;COMPLETE_ALIASES</font>
              <b>PLETE_ALIASES</b> option is set.  Commands may not be combined with the <b>-C</b>, <b>-D</b> or <b>-T</b> flags.

       <b>-C</b>     controls completion when the command word itself is being completed.  If no <b>compctl</b> <b>-C</b> command
              has  been issued,  the names of any executable command (whether in the path or specific to the
              shell, such as aliases or functions) are completed.

       <b>-D</b>     controls default completion behavior for the arguments of commands not  assigned  any  special
              behavior.  If no <b>compctl</b> <b>-D</b> command has been issued, filenames are completed.

       <b>-T</b>     supplies completion flags to be used before any other processing is done, even before process-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;processing</font>
              ing for <b>compctl</b>s defined for specific commands.  This is especially useful when combined  with
              extended  completion  (the  <b>-x</b> flag, see the section `Extended Completion' below).  Using this
              flag you can define default behavior which will apply to all commands  without  exception,  or
              you can alter the standard behavior for all commands.  For example, if your access to the user
              database is too slow and/or it contains too many users (so that completion after  `<b>~</b>'  is  too
              slow to be usable), you can use

                     <b>compctl</b> <b>-T</b> <b>-x</b> <b>'s[~]</b> <b>C[0,[^/]#]'</b> <b>-k</b> <b>friends</b> <b>-S/</b> <b>-tn</b>

              to complete the strings in the array <b>friends</b> after a `<b>~</b>'.  The <b>C[...]</b> argument is necessary so
              that this form of ~-completion is not tried after the directory name is finished.

       <b>-L</b>     lists the existing completion behavior in a  manner  suitable  for  putting  into  a  start-up
              script;  the  existing behavior is not changed.  Any combination of the above forms, or the <b>-M</b>
              flag (which must follow the <b>-L</b> flag), may be specified, otherwise all defined completions  are
              listed.  Any other flags supplied are ignored.

       <u>no</u> <u>argument</u>
              If no argument is given, <b>compctl</b> lists all defined completions in an abbreviated form;  with a
              list of <u>options</u>, all completions with those flags set (not counting extended  completion)  are
              listed.

       If  the <b>+</b> flag is alone and followed immediately by the <u>command</u> list, the completion behavior for all
       the commands in the list is reset to the default.  In other words, completion will  subsequently  use
       the options specified by the <b>-D</b> flag.

       The  form  with  <b>-M</b> as the first and only option defines global matching specifications (see zshcomp-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">wid).&nbsp;zshcompwid).</font>
       wid). The match specifications given will be used for every completion attempt (only when using  <b>com</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pctl,&nbsp;compctl,</font>
       <b>pctl</b>,  not with the new completion system) and are tried in the order in which they are defined until
       one generates at least one match. E.g.:

              <b>compctl</b> <b>-M</b> <b>''</b> <b>'m:{a-zA-Z}={A-Za-z}'</b>

       This will first try completion without any global match specifications (the  empty  string)  and,  if
       that generates no matches, will try case insensitive completion.

       bination of these flags may be specified; the result is a sorted list of all the possibilities.   The
       options are as follows.


   <b>Simple</b> <b>Flags</b>
       These produce completion lists made up by the shell itself:

       <b>-f</b>     Filenames and filesystem paths.

       <b>-/</b>     Just filesystem paths.

       <b>-c</b>     Command names, including aliases, shell functions, builtins and reserved words.

       <b>-F</b>     Function names.

       <b>-B</b>     Names of builtin commands.

       <b>-m</b>     Names of external commands.

       <b>-w</b>     Reserved words.

       <b>-a</b>     Alias names.

       <b>-R</b>     Names of regular (non-global) aliases.

       <b>-G</b>     Names of global aliases.

       <b>-d</b>     This  can  be  combined  with  <b>-F</b>,  <b>-B</b>,  <b>-w</b>, <b>-a</b>, <b>-R</b> and <b>-G</b> to get names of disabled functions,
              builtins, reserved words or aliases.

       <b>-e</b>     This option (to show enabled commands) is in effect by default, but may be combined  with  <b>-d</b>;
              <b>-de</b>  in combination with <b>-F</b>, <b>-B</b>, <b>-w</b>, <b>-a</b>, <b>-R</b> and <b>-G</b> will complete names of functions, builtins,
              reserved words or aliases whether or not they are disabled.

       <b>-o</b>     Names of shell options (see <a href="zshoptions.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/zshoptions"><u>zshoptions</u>(1)</a>).

       <b>-v</b>     Names of any variable defined in the shell.

       <b>-N</b>     Names of scalar (non-array) parameters.

       <b>-A</b>     Array names.

       <b>-I</b>     Names of integer variables.

       <b>-O</b>     Names of read-only variables.

       <b>-p</b>     Names of parameters used by the shell (including special parameters).

       <b>-Z</b>     Names of shell special parameters.

       <b>-E</b>     Names of environment variables.

       <b>-n</b>     Named directories.

       <b>-b</b>     Key binding names.

       <b>-j</b>     Job names:  the first word of the job leader's command line.  This is  useful  with  the  <b>kill</b>
              builtin.

       <b>-r</b>     Names of running jobs.

       <b>-z</b>     Names of suspended jobs.

       <b>-u</b>     User names.


   <b>Flags</b> <b>with</b> <b>Arguments</b>
       These have user supplied arguments to determine how the list of completions is to be made up:

       <b>-k</b> <u>array</u>
              Names  taken  from  the  elements  of <b>$</b><u>array</u> (note that the `<b>$</b>' does not appear on the command
              line).  Alternatively, the argument <u>array</u> itself may be a set  of  space-  or  comma-separated
              values  in  parentheses,  in which any delimiter may be escaped with a backslash; in this case
              the argument should be quoted.  For example,

                     <b>compctl</b> <b>-k</b> <b>"(cputime</b> <b>filesize</b> <b>datasize</b> <b>stacksize</b>
                                 <b>coredumpsize</b> <b>resident</b> <b>descriptors)"</b> <b>limit</b>

       <b>-g</b> <u>globstring</u>
              The <u>globstring</u> is expanded using filename globbing; it should be quoted  to  protect  it  from
              immediate  expansion.  The  resulting  filenames  are  taken as the possible completions.  Use
              `<b>*(/)</b>' instead of `<b>*/</b>' for directories.  The <b>fignore</b> special parameter is not applied  to  the
              resulting  files.   More  than  one pattern may be given separated by blanks. (Note that brace
              expansion is <u>not</u> part of globbing.  Use the syntax `<b>(either|or)</b>' to match alternatives.)

       <b>-s</b> <u>subststring</u>
              The <u>subststring</u> is split into words and these words are than expanded using all  shell  expan-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion&nbsp;expansion</font>
              sion mechanisms (see <a href="zshexpn.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/zshexpn"><u>zshexpn</u>(1)</a>).  The resulting words are taken as possible completions.  The
              <b>fignore</b> special parameter is not applied to the resulting files.  Note that <b>-g</b> is  faster  for
              filenames.

       <b>-K</b> <u>function</u>
              Call  the  given  function to get the completions.  Unless the name starts with an underscore,
              the function is passed two arguments: the prefix and the suffix of the word on  which  comple-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;completion</font>
              tion is to be attempted, in other words those characters before the cursor position, and those
              from the cursor position onwards.  The whole command line can be accessed with the <b>-c</b>  and  <b>-l</b>
              flags  of  the <b>read</b> builtin. The function should set the variable <b>reply</b> to an array containing
              the completions (one completion per element); note that <b>reply</b> should not be made local to  the
              function.   From  such a function the command line can be accessed with the <b>-c</b> and <b>-l</b> flags to
              the <b>read</b> builtin.  For example,

                     <b>function</b> <b>whoson</b> <b>{</b> <b>reply=(`users`);</b> <b>}</b>
                     <b>compctl</b> <b>-K</b> <b>whoson</b> <b>talk</b>

              completes only logged-on users after `<b>talk</b>'.  Note that `<b>whoson</b>'  must  return  an  array,  so
              `<b>reply=`users`</b>' would be incorrect.

       <b>-H</b> <u>num</u> <u>pattern</u>
              The  possible completions are taken from the last <u>num</u> history lines.  Only words matching <u>pat</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tern&nbsp;pattern</font>
              <u>tern</u> are taken.  If <u>num</u> is zero or negative the whole history is searched and  if  <u>pattern</u>  is
              the empty string all words are taken (as with `<b>*</b>').  A typical use is

                     <b>compctl</b> <b>-D</b> <b>-f</b> <b>+</b> <b>-H</b> <b>0</b> <b>''</b>

              which forces completion to look back in the history list for a word if no filename matches.


   <b>Control</b> <b>Flags</b>
       These do not directly specify types of name to be completed, but manipulate the options that do:

       <b>-Q</b>     This  instructs  the  shell not to quote any metacharacters in the possible completions.  Nor-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mally&nbsp;Normally</font>
              mally the results of a completion are inserted into the command line with  any  metacharacters
              quoted  so  that they are interpreted as normal characters.  This is appropriate for filenames
              and ordinary strings.  However, for special effects, such as inserting a backquoted expression
              from  a  completion array (<b>-k</b>) so that the expression will not be evaluated until the complete
              line is executed, this option must be used.

       <b>-P</b> <u>prefix</u>
              The <u>prefix</u> is inserted just before the completed string; any initial part already  typed  will
              be completed and the whole <u>prefix</u> ignored for completion purposes.  For example,

                     <b>compctl</b> <b>-j</b> <b>-P</b> <b>"%"</b> <b>kill</b>

              inserts a `%' after the kill command and then completes job names.

       <b>-S</b> <u>suffix</u>
              When  a completion is found the <u>suffix</u> is inserted after the completed string.  In the case of
              menu completion the suffix is inserted immediately, but it is still possible to cycle  through
              the list of completions by repeatedly hitting the same key.

       <b>-W</b> <u>file-prefix</u>
              With directory <u>file-prefix</u>:  for command, file, directory and globbing completion (options <b>-c</b>,
              <b>-f</b>, <b>-/</b>, <b>-g</b>), the file prefix is implicitly added in front of the completion.  For example,

                     <b>compctl</b> <b>-/</b> <b>-W</b> <b>~/Mail</b> <b>maildirs</b>

              completes any subdirectories to any depth beneath the directory <b>~/Mail</b>, although  that  prefix
              does  not appear on the command line.  The <u>file-prefix</u> may also be of the form accepted by the
              <b>-k</b> flag, i.e. the name of an array or a literal list in parenthesis.  In  this  case  all  the
              directories in the list will be searched for possible completions.

       <b>-q</b>     If  used  with a suffix as specified by the <b>-S</b> option, this causes the suffix to be removed if
              the next character typed is a blank or does not insert anything or if the suffix  consists  of
              only one character and the next character typed is the same character; this the same rule used
              for the <b>AUTO_REMOVE_SLASH</b> option.  The option is  most  useful  for  list  separators  (comma,
              colon, etc.).

       <b>-l</b> <u>cmd</u> This option restricts the range of command line words that are considered to be arguments.  If
              combined with one of the extended completion patterns `<b>p[</b>...<b>]</b>', `<b>r[</b>...<b>]</b>',  or  `<b>R[</b>...<b>]</b>'   (see
              the  section  `Extended  Completion'  below) the range is restricted to the range of arguments
              specified in the brackets.  Completion is then performed as if these had been given  as  argu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ments&nbsp;arguments</font>
              ments  to  the  <u>cmd</u> supplied with the option. If the <u>cmd</u> string is empty the first word in the
              range is instead taken as the command name, and command name completion performed on the first
              word in the range.  For example,

                     <b>compctl</b> <b>-x</b> <b>'r[-exec,;]'</b> <b>-l</b> <b>''</b> <b>--</b> <b>find</b>

              completes  arguments  between `<b>-exec</b>' and the following `<b>;</b>' (or the end of the command line if
              there is no such string) as if they were a separate command line.

       <b>-h</b> <u>cmd</u> Normally zsh completes quoted strings as a whole. With this option,  completion  can  be  done
              separately  on different parts of such strings. It works like the <b>-l</b> option but makes the com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pletion&nbsp;completion</font>
              pletion code work on the parts of the current word that are separated by spaces.  These  parts
              are  completed  as  if  they  were arguments to the given <u>cmd</u>. If <u>cmd</u> is the empty string, the
              first part is completed as a command name, as with <b>-l</b>.

       <b>-U</b>     Use the whole list of possible completions, whether or not they actually match the word on the
              command  line.   The  word  typed so far will be deleted.  This is most useful with a function
              (given by the <b>-K</b> option) which can examine the word components passed to it (or via  the  <b>read</b>
              builtin's  <b>-c</b>  and  <b>-l</b> flags) and use its own criteria to decide what matches.  If there is no
              completion, the original word is retained.  Since the  produced  possible  completions  seldom
              have  interesting  common  prefixes  and  suffixes,  menu completion is started immediately if
              <b>AUTO_MENU</b> is set and this flag is used.

       <b>-y</b> <u>func-or-var</u>
              The list provided by <u>func-or-var</u> is displayed instead of the list of  completions  whenever  a
              listing  is  required; the actual completions to be inserted are not affected.  It can be pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">vided&nbsp;provided</font>
              vided in two ways. Firstly, if <u>func-or-var</u> begins with a <b>$</b> it defines a  variable,  or  if  it
              begins  with a left parenthesis a literal array, which contains the list.  A variable may have
              been set by a call to a function using the <b>-K</b> option.  Otherwise it contains  the  name  of  a
              function  which  will be executed to create the list.  The function will be passed as an argu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment&nbsp;argument</font>
              ment list all matching completions, including prefixes and  suffixes  expanded  in  full,  and
              should  set  the  array  <b>reply</b>  to  the  result.  In both cases, the display list will only be
              retrieved after a complete list of matches has been created.

              Note that the returned list does not have to correspond, even in length, to the  original  set
              of matches, and may be passed as a scalar instead of an array.  No special formatting of char-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">acters&nbsp;characters</font>
              acters is performed on the output in this case; in particular, newlines are printed  literally
              and if they appear output in columns is suppressed.

       <b>-X</b> <u>explanation</u>
              Print  <u>explanation</u> when trying completion on the current set of options. A `<b>%n</b>' in this string
              is replaced by the number of matches that were added for this explanation string.  The  expla-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nation&nbsp;explanation</font>
              nation  only  appears  if  completion was tried and there was no unique match, or when listing
              completions. Explanation strings will be listed together with the matches of the group  speci-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fied&nbsp;specified</font>
              fied  together  with the <b>-X</b> option (using the <b>-J</b> or <b>-V</b> option). If the same explanation string
              is given to multiple <b>-X</b> options, the string appears only once (for each group) and the  number
              of  matches  shown  for the `<b>%n</b>' is the total number of all matches for each of these uses. In
              any case, the explanation string will only be shown if there was at least one match added  for
              the explanation string.

              The sequences <b>%B</b>, <b>%b</b>, <b>%S</b>, <b>%s</b>, <b>%U</b>, and <b>%u</b> specify output attributes (bold, standout, and under-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">line)&nbsp;underline)</font>
              line) and <b>%{...%}</b> can be used to include literal escape sequences as in prompts.

       <b>-Y</b> <u>explanation</u>
              Identical to <b>-X</b>, except that the <u>explanation</u> first undergoes  expansion  following  the  usual
              rules for strings in double quotes.  The expansion will be carried out after any functions are
              called for the <b>-K</b> or <b>-y</b> options, allowing them to set variables.

       <b>-t</b> <u>continue</u>
              The <u>continue</u>-string contains a character that specifies which set of completion  flags  should
              be used next.  It is useful:

              (i) With <b>-T</b>, or when trying a list of pattern completions, when <b>compctl</b> would usually continue
              with ordinary processing after finding matches; this can be suppressed with `<b>-tn</b>'.

              (ii) With a list of alternatives separated by <b>+</b>, when <b>compctl</b> would normally stop when one  of
              the  alternatives generates matches.  It can be forced to consider the next set of completions
              by adding `<b>-t+</b>' to the flags of the alternative before the `<b>+</b>'.

              (iii) In an extended completion list (see below), when <b>compctl</b> would normally continue until a
              set  of conditions succeeded, then use only the immediately following flags.  With `<b>-t-</b>', <b>com</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pctl&nbsp;compctl</font>
              <b>pctl</b> will continue trying extended completions after the next `<b>-</b>'; with `<b>-tx</b>' it will  attempt
              completion with the default flags, in other words those before the `<b>-x</b>'.

       <b>-J</b> <u>name</u>
              This gives the name of the group the matches should be placed in. Groups are listed and sorted
              separately; likewise, menu completion will offer the matches in the groups  in  the  order  in
              which the groups were defined. If no group name is explicitly given, the matches are stored in
              a group named <u>default</u>. The first time a group name is encountered, a group with that  name  is
              created. After that all matches with the same group name are stored in that group.

              This can be useful with non-exclusive alternative completions.  For example, in

                     <b>compctl</b> <b>-f</b> <b>-J</b> <b>files</b> <b>-t+</b> <b>+</b> <b>-v</b> <b>-J</b> <b>variables</b> <b>foo</b>

              both files and variables are possible completions, as the <b>-t+</b> forces both sets of alternatives
              before and after the <b>+</b> to be considered at once.  Because of  the  <b>-J</b>  options,  however,  all
              files are listed before all variables.

       <b>-V</b> <u>name</u>
              Like  <b>-J</b>,  but matches within the group will not be sorted in listings nor in menu completion.
              These unsorted groups are in a different name space from the sorted ones, so groups defined as
              <b>-J</b> <b>files</b> and <b>-V</b> <b>files</b> are distinct.

       <b>-1</b>     If  given  together  with  the  <b>-V</b>  option,  makes only consecutive duplicates in the group be
              removed. Note that groups with and without this flag are in different name spaces.

       <b>-2</b>     If given together with the <b>-J</b> or <b>-V</b> option, makes all duplicates be kept. Again,  groups  with
              and without this flag are in different name spaces.

       <b>-M</b> <u>match-spec</u>
              This  defines additional matching control specifications that should be used only when testing
              words for the list of flags this flag appears in. The  format  of  the  <u>match-spec</u>  string  is
              described in zshcompwid.


<b>ALTERNATIVE</b> <b>COMPLETION</b>
       <b>compctl</b> [ <b>-CDT</b> ] <u>options</u> <b>+</b> <u>options</u> [ <b>+</b> ... ] [ <b>+</b> ] <u>command</u> ...

       The  form  with  `<b>+</b>'  specifies  alternative options. Completion is tried with the options before the
       first `<b>+</b>'. If this produces no matches completion is tried with the flags after the `<b>+</b>' and so on. If
       there  are  no flags after the last `<b>+</b>' and a match has not been found up to that point, default com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pletion&nbsp;completion</font>
       pletion is tried.  If the list of flags contains a <b>-t</b> with a <b>+</b> character, the next list of  flags  is
       used even if the current list produced matches.


       Additional  options  are available that restrict completion to some part of the command line; this is
       referred to as `extended completion'.


<b>EXTENDED</b> <b>COMPLETION</b>
       <b>compctl</b> [ <b>-CDT</b> ] <u>options</u> <b>-x</b> <u>pattern</u> <u>options</u> <b>-</b> ... <b>-</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">[&nbsp;-[</font>
                [ <u>command</u> ... ]
       <b>compctl</b> [ <b>-CDT</b> ] <u>options</u> [ <b>-x</b> <u>pattern</u> <u>options</u> <b>-</b> ... <b>--</b> ]
                [ <b>+</b> <u>options</u> [ <b>-x</b> ... <b>--</b> ] ... [<b>+</b>] ] [ <u>command</u> ... ]

       The form with `<b>-x</b>' specifies extended completion for the commands given; as shown, it may be combined
       with  alternative completion using `<b>+</b>'.  Each <u>pattern</u> is examined in turn; when a match is found, the
       corresponding <u>options</u>, as described in the section `Option Flags' above, are used to generate  possi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ble&nbsp;possible</font>
       ble completions.  If no <u>pattern</u> matches, the <u>options</u> given before the <b>-x</b> are used.

       Note that each pattern should be supplied as a single argument and should be quoted to prevent expan-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion&nbsp;expansion</font>
       sion of metacharacters by the shell.

       A <u>pattern</u> is built of sub-patterns separated by commas; it matches if at least one of these  sub-pat-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">terns&nbsp;sub-patterns</font>
       terns  matches (they are `or'ed). These sub-patterns are in turn composed of other sub-patterns sepa-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rated&nbsp;separated</font>
       rated by white spaces which match if all of the sub-patterns match (they are `and'ed).  An element of
       the  sub-patterns  is of the form `<u>c</u><b>[</b>...<b>][</b>...<b>]</b>', where the pairs of brackets may be repeated as often
       as necessary, and matches if any of the sets of brackets match (an `or').  The  example  below  makes
       this clearer.

       The elements may be any of the following:

       <b>s[</b><u>string</u><b>]</b>...
              Matches if the current word on the command line starts with one of the strings given in brack-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ets.&nbsp;brackets.</font>
              ets.  The <u>string</u> is not removed and is not part of the completion.

       <b>S[</b><u>string</u><b>]</b>...
              Like <b>s[</b><u>string</u><b>]</b> except that the <u>string</u> is part of the completion.

       <b>p[</b><u>from</u><b>,</b><u>to</u><b>]</b>...
              Matches if the number of the current word is between one of the <u>from</u> and <u>to</u>  pairs  inclusive.
              The comma and <u>to</u> are optional; <u>to</u> defaults to the same value as <u>from</u>.  The numbers may be neg-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ative:&nbsp;negative:</font>
              ative: <b>-</b><u>n</u> refers to the <u>n</u>'th last word on the line.

       <b>c[</b><u>offset</u><b>,</b><u>string</u><b>]</b>...
              Matches if the <u>string</u> matches the word offset by <u>offset</u> from the current word position.   Usu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ally&nbsp;Usually</font>
              ally <u>offset</u> will be negative.

       <b>C[</b><u>offset</u><b>,</b><u>pattern</u><b>]</b>...
              Like <b>c</b> but using pattern matching instead.

       <b>w[</b><u>index</u><b>,</b><u>string</u><b>]</b>...
              Matches  if  the  word  in position <u>index</u> is equal to the corresponding <u>string</u>.  Note that the
              word count is made after any alias expansion.

       <b>W[</b><u>index</u><b>,</b><u>pattern</u><b>]</b>...
              Like <b>w</b> but using pattern matching instead.

       <b>n[</b><u>index</u><b>,</b><u>string</u><b>]</b>...
              Matches if the current word contains <u>string</u>.  Anything up to and including the <u>index</u>th  occur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rence&nbsp;occurrence</font>
              rence  of this string will not be considered part of the completion, but the rest will.  <u>index</u>
              may be negative to count from the end: in most cases, <u>index</u> will be 1 or -1.  For example,

                     <b>compctl</b> <b>-s</b> <b>'`users`'</b> <b>-x</b> <b>'n[1,@]'</b> <b>-k</b> <b>hosts</b> <b>--</b> <b>talk</b>

              will usually complete usernames, but if you insert an <b>@</b> after the name, names from  the  array
              <u>hosts</u>  (assumed  to  contain  hostnames, though you must make the array yourself) will be com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pleted.&nbsp;completed.</font>
              pleted.  Other commands such as <b>rcp</b> can be handled similarly.

       <b>N[</b><u>index</u><b>,</b><u>string</u><b>]</b>...
              Like <b>n</b> except that the string will be taken as a character class.  Anything up to and  includ-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;including</font>
              ing  the  <u>index</u>th occurrence of any of the characters in <u>string</u> will not be considered part of
              the completion.

       <b>m[</b><u>min</u><b>,</b><u>max</u><b>]</b>...
              Matches if the total number of words lies between <u>min</u> and <u>max</u> inclusive.

       <b>r[</b><u>str1</u><b>,</b><u>str2</u><b>]</b>...
              Matches if the cursor is after a word with prefix <u>str1</u>.  If there is also a word  with  prefix
              <u>str2</u> on the command line after the one matched by <u>str1</u> it matches only if the cursor is before
              this word. If the comma and <u>str2</u> are omitted, it matches if the cursor is after  a  word  with
              prefix <u>str1</u>.

       <b>R[</b><u>str1</u><b>,</b><u>str2</u><b>]</b>...
              Like <b>r</b> but using pattern matching instead.

       <b>q[</b><u>str</u><b>]</b>...
              Matches  the  word  currently  being completed is in single quotes and the <u>str</u> begins with the
              letter `s', or if completion is done in double quotes and <u>str</u> starts with the letter  `d',  or
              if completion is done in backticks and <u>str</u> starts with a `b'.


<b>EXAMPLE</b>
              <b>compctl</b> <b>-u</b> <b>-x</b> <b>'s[+]</b> <b>c[-1,-f],s[-f+]'</b> <b>\</b>
                <b>-g</b> <b>'~/Mail/*(:t)'</b> <b>-</b> <b>'s[-f],c[-1,-f]'</b> <b>-f</b> <b>--</b> <b>mail</b>

       This is to be interpreted as follows:

       If the current command is <b>mail</b>, then


              if ((the current word begins with <b>+</b> and the previous word is <b>-f</b>)
              or (the current word begins with <b>-f+</b>)), then complete the
              non-directory part (the `<b>:t</b>' glob modifier) of files in the directory
              <b>~/Mail</b>; else

              if the current word begins with <b>-f</b> or the previous word was <b>-f</b>, then
              complete any file; else

              complete user names.
