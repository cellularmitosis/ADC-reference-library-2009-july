<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       "Net::Server" is an extensible, generic Perl server engine.  "Net::Server" combines the good
       properties from "Net::Daemon" (0.34), "NetServer::Generic" (1.03), and "Net::FTPServer" (1.0), and
       also from various concepts in the Apache Webserver.

       "Net::Server" attempts to be a generic server as in "Net::Daemon" and "NetServer::Generic".  It
       includes with it the ability to run as an inetd process ("Net::Server::INET"), a single connection
       server ("Net::Server" or "Net::Server::Single"), a forking server ("Net::Server::Fork"), a preforking
       server which maintains a constant number of preforked children ("Net::Server::PreForkSimple"), or as
       a managed preforking server which maintains the number of children based on server load
       ("Net::Server::PreFork").  In all but the inetd type, the server provides the ability to connect to
       one or to multiple server ports.

       "Net::Server" uses ideologies of "Net::FTPServer" in order to provide extensibility.  The additional
       server types are made possible via "personalities" or sub classes of the "Net::Server".  By moving
       the multiple types of servers out of the main "Net::Server" class, the "Net::Server" concept is
       easily extended to other types (in the near future, we would like to add a "Thread" personality).

       "Net::Server" borrows several concepts from the Apache Webserver.  "Net::Server" uses "hooks" to
       allow custom servers such as SMTP, HTTP, POP3, etc. to be layered over the base "Net::Server" class.
       In addition the "Net::Server::PreFork" class borrows concepts of min_start_servers, max_servers, and
       min_waiting servers.  "Net::Server::PreFork" also uses the concept of an flock serialized accept when
       accepting on multiple ports (PreFork can choose between flock, IPC::Semaphore, and pipe to control
       serialization).

<b>PERSONALITIES</b>
       "Net::Server" is built around a common class (Net::Server) and is extended using sub classes, or
       "personalities".  Each personality inherits, overrides, or enhances the base methods of the base
       class.

       Included with the Net::Server package are several basic personalities, each of which has their own
       use.

       Fork
           Found in the module Net/Server/Fork.pm (see Net::Server::Fork).  This server binds to one or more
           ports and then waits for a connection.  When a client request is received, the parent forks a
           child, which then handles the client and exits.  This is good for moderately hit services.

       INET
           Found in the module Net/Server/INET.pm (see Net::Server::INET).  This server is designed to be
           used with inetd.  The "pre_bind", "bind", "accept", and "post_accept" are all overridden as these
           services are taken care of by the INET daemon.

       MultiType
           Found in the module Net/Server/MultiType.pm (see Net::Server::MultiType).  This server has no
           server functionality of its own.  It is designed for servers which need a simple way to easily
           switch between different personalities.  Multiple "server_type" parameters may be given and
           Net::Server::MultiType will cycle through until it finds a class that it can use.

       Multiplex
           Found in the module Net/Server/Multiplex.pm (see Net::Server::Multiplex).  This server binds to
           one or more ports.  It uses IO::Multiplex to multiplex between waiting for new connections and
           waiting for input on currently established connections.  This personality is designed to run as
           one process without forking.  The "process_request" method is never used but the "mux_input"
           callback is used instead (see also IO::Multiplex).  See examples/samplechat.pl for an example
           using most of the features of Net::Server::Multiplex.

       PreForkSimple
           Found in the module Net/Server/PreFork.pm (see Net::Server::PreFork).  This server binds to one
           or more ports and then forks "max_servers" child process.  The server will make sure that at any
           given time there are always "max_servers" available to receive a client request.  Each of these
           children will process up to "max_requests" client connections.  This type is good for a heavily
           hit site that can dedicate max_server processes no matter what the load.  It should scale well
           for most applications.  Multi port accept is accomplished using either flock, IPC::Semaphore, or
           pipe to serialize the children.  Serialization may also be switched on for single port in order
           to get around an OS that does not allow multiple children to accept at the same time.  For a
           further discussion of serialization see Net::Server::PreFork.

       PreFork
           Found in the module Net/Server/PreFork.pm (see Net::Server::PreFork).  This server binds to one
           or more ports and then forks "min_servers" child process.  The server will make sure that at any
           given time there are at least "min_spare_servers" but not more than "max_spare_servers" available
           to receive a client request, up to "max_servers".  Each of these children will process up to
           "max_requests" client connections.  This type is good for a heavily hit site, and should scale
           well for most applications.  Multi port accept is accomplished using either flock,
           IPC::Semaphore, or pipe to serialize the children.  Serialization may also be switched on for
           single port in order to get around an OS that does not allow multiple children to accept at the
           same time.  For a further discussion of serialization see Net::Server::PreFork.

       Single
           All methods fall back to Net::Server.  This personality is provided only as parallelism for
           Net::Server::MultiType.

       "Net::Server" was partially written to make it easy to add new personalities.  Using separate modules
       built upon an open architecture allows for easy addition of new features, a separate development
       process, and reduced code bloat in the core module.

<b>SOCKET</b> <b>ACCESS</b>
       Once started, the Net::Server will take care of binding to port and waiting for connections.  Once a
       connection is received, the Net::Server will accept on the socket and will store the result (the
       client connection) in $self-&gt;{server}-&gt;{client}.  This property is a Socket blessed into the the
       IO::Socket classes.  UDP servers are slightly different in that they will perform a <b>recv</b> instead of
       an <b>accept</b>.

       To make programming easier, during the post_accept phase, STDIN and STDOUT are opened to the client
       connection.  This allows for programs to be written using &lt;STDIN&gt; and print "out\n" to print to the
       client connection.  UDP will require using a -&gt;send call.

<b>SAMPLE</b> <b>CODE</b>
       The following is a very simple server.  The main functionality occurs in the process_request method
       call as shown below.  Notice the use of timeouts to prevent Denial of Service while reading.  (Other
       examples of using "Net::Server" can, or will, be included with this distribution).

         #!/usr/bin/perl -w -T
         #--------------- file test.pl ---------------

         package MyPackage;

         use strict;
         use vars qw(@ISA);
         use Net::Server::PreFork; # any personality will do

         @ISA = qw(Net::Server::PreFork);

         MyPackage-&gt;run();
         exit;

         ### over-ridden subs below

         sub process_request {
           my $self = shift;
           eval {

             local $SIG{ALRM} = sub { die "Timed Out!\n" };
             my $timeout = 30; # give the user 30 seconds to type a line

             my $previous_alarm = alarm($timeout);
             while( &lt;STDIN&gt; ){
               s/\r?\n$//;
               print "You said \"$_\"\r\n";
               alarm($timeout);
             }
             alarm($previous_alarm);

           };

           if( $@=~/timed out/i ){
             print STDOUT "Timed Out.\r\n";
             return;
           }

         }

         1;

         #--------------- file test.pl ---------------

       Playing this file from the command line will invoke a Net::Server using the PreFork personality.
       When building a server layer over the Net::Server, it is important to use features such as timeouts
       to prevent Denial of Service attacks.

<b>ARGUMENTS</b>
       There are four possible ways to pass arguments to Net::Server.  They are <u>passing</u> <u>on</u> <u>command</u> <u>line</u>,
       <u>using</u> <u>a</u> <u>conf</u> <u>file</u>, <u>passing</u> <u>parameters</u> <u>to</u> <u>run</u>, or <u>using</u> <u>a</u> <u>pre-built</u> <u>object</u> <u>to</u> <u>call</u> <u>the</u> <u>run</u> <u>method</u>.

       Arguments consist of key value pairs.  On the commandline these pairs follow the POSIX fashion of
       "--key value" or "--key=value", and also "key=value".  In the conf file the parameter passing can
       best be shown by the following regular expression: ($key,$val)=~/^(\w+)\s+(\S+?)\s+$/.  Passing
       arguments to the run method is done as follows: "Net::Server-"run(key1 =&gt; 'val1')&gt;.  Passing
       arguments via a prebuilt object can best be shown in the following code:

         #!/usr/bin/perl -w -T
         #--------------- file test2.pl ---------------
         package MyPackage;
         use strict;
         use vars (@ISA);
         use Net::Server;
         @ISA = qw(Net::Server);

         my $server = bless {
           key1 =&gt; 'val1',
           }, 'MyPackage';

         $server-&gt;run();
         #--------------- file test.pl ---------------

       All five methods for passing arguments may be used at the same time.  Once an argument has been set,
       it is not over written if another method passes the same argument.  "Net::Server" will look for
       arguments in the following order:

         1) Arguments contained in the prebuilt object.
         2) Arguments passed on command line.
         3) Arguments passed to the run method.
         4) Arguments passed via a conf file.
         5) Arguments set in the configure_hook.

       Key/value pairs used by the server are removed by the configuration process so that server layers on
       top of "Net::Server" can pass and read their own parameters.  Currently, Getopt::Long is not used.
       The following arguments are available in the default "Net::Server" or "Net::Server::Single" modules.
       (Other personalities may use additional parameters and may optionally not use parameters from the
       base class.)

         ## See Net::Server::Proto::(TCP|UDP|UNIX|etc)
         ## for more sample parameters.

       conf_file
           Filename from which to read additional key value pair arguments for starting the server.  Default
           is undef.

       log_level
           Ranges from 0 to 4 in level.  Specifies what level of error will be logged.  "O" means logging is
           off.  "4" means very verbose.  These levels should be able to correlate to syslog levels.
           Default is 2.  These levels correlate to syslog levels as defined by the following key/value
           pairs: 0=&gt;'err', 1=&gt;'warning', 2=&gt;'notice', 3=&gt;'info', 4=&gt;'debug'.

       log_file
           Name of log file to be written to.  If no name is given and hook is not overridden, log goes to
           STDERR.  Default is undef.  If the magic name "Sys::Syslog" is used, all logging will take place
           via the Sys::Syslog module.  If syslog is used the parameters "syslog_logsock", "syslog_ident",
           and "syslog_logopt",and "syslog_facility" may also be defined.  If a "log_file" is given or if
           "setsid" is set, STDIN and STDOUT will automatically be opened to /dev/null and STDERR will be
           opened to STDOUT.  This will prevent any output from ending up at the terminal.

       pid_file
           Filename to store pid of parent process.  Generally applies only to forking servers.  Default is
           none (undef).

       syslog_logsock
           Only available if "log_file" is equal to "Sys::Syslog".  May be either "unix" of "inet".  Default
           is "unix".  See Sys::Syslog.

       syslog_ident
           Only available if "log_file" is equal to "Sys::Syslog".  Id to prepend on syslog entries.
           Default is "net_server".  See Sys::Syslog.

       syslog_logopt
           Only available if "log_file" is equal to "Sys::Syslog".  May be either zero or more of
           "pid","cons","ndelay","nowait".  Default is "pid".  See Sys::Syslog.

       syslog_facility
           Only available if "log_file" is equal to "Sys::Syslog".  See Sys::Syslog and syslog.  Default is
           "daemon".

       port
           See Net::Server::Proto.  Local port/socket on which to bind.  If low port, process must start as
           root.  If multiple ports are given, all will be bound at server startup.  May be of the form
           "host:port/proto", "host:port", "port/proto", or "port", where <u>host</u> represents a hostname
           residing on the local box, where <u>port</u> represents either the number of the port (eg. "80") or the
           service designation (eg.  "http"), and where <u>proto</u> represents the protocol to be used.  See
           Net::Server::Proto.  If you are working with unix sockets, you may also specify
           "socket_file|unix" or "socket_file|type|unix" where type is SOCK_DGRAM or SOCK_STREAM.  If the
           protocol is not specified, <u>proto</u> will default to the "proto" specified in the arguments.  If
           "proto" is not specified there it will default to "tcp".  If <u>host</u> is not specified, <u>host</u> will
           default to "host" specified in the arguments.  If "host" is not specified there it will default
           to "*".  Default port is 20203.

       host
           Local host or addr upon which to bind port.  If a value of '*' is given, the server will bind
           that port on all available addresses on the box.  See Net::Server::Proto. See IO::Socket.

       proto
           See Net::Server::Proto.  Protocol to use when binding ports.  See IO::Socket.  As of release
           0.70, Net::Server supports tcp, udp, and unix.  Other types will need to be added later (or
           custom modules extending the Net::Server::Proto class may be used).

       listen
             See L&lt;IO::Socket&gt;.  Not used with udp protocol (or UNIX SOCK_DGRAM).

       reverse_lookups
           Specify whether to lookup the hostname of the connected IP.  Information is cached in server
           object under "peerhost" property.  Default is to not use reverse_lookups (undef).

       allow/deny
           May be specified multiple times.  Contains regex to compare to incoming peeraddr or peerhost (if
           reverse_lookups has been enabled).  If allow or deny options are given, the incoming client must
           match an allow and not match a deny or the client connection will be closed.  Defaults to empty
           array refs.

       chroot
           Directory to chroot to after bind process has taken place and the server is still running as
           root.  Defaults to undef.

       user
           Userid or username to become after the bind process has occured.  Defaults to "nobody."  If you
           would like the server to run as root, you will have to specify "user" equal to "root".

       group
           Groupid or groupname to become after the bind process has occured.  Defaults to "nobody."  If you
           would like the server to run as root, you will have to specify "group" equal to "root".

       background
           Specifies whether or not the server should fork after the bind method to release itself from the
           command line.  Defaults to undef.  Process will also background if "setsid" is set.

       setsid
           Specifies whether or not the server should fork after the bind method to release itself from the
           command line and then run the "POSIX::setsid()" command to truly daemonize.  Defaults to undef.
           If a "log_file" is given or if "setsid" is set, STDIN and STDOUT will automatically be opened to
           /dev/null and STDERR will be opened to STDOUT.  This will prevent any output from ending up at
           the terminal.

       no_close_by_child
           Specifies whether or not a forked child process has permission or not to shutdown the entire
           server process.  If set to 1, the child may NOT signal the parent to shutdown all children.
           Default is undef (not set).

<b>PROPERTIES</b>
       All of the "ARGUMENTS" listed above become properties of the server object under the same name.
       These properties, as well as other internal properties, are available during hooks and other method
       calls.

       The structure of a Net::Server object is shown below:

         $self = bless( {
                          'server' =&gt; {
                                        'key1' =&gt; 'val1',
                                        # more key/vals
                                      }
                        }, 'Net::Server' );

       This structure was chosen so that all server related properties are grouped under a single key of the
       object hashref.  This is so that other objects could layer on top of the Net::Server object class and
       still have a fairly clean namespace in the hashref.

       You may get and set properties in two ways.  The suggested way is to access properties directly via

        my $val = $self-&gt;{server}-&gt;{key1};

       Accessing the properties directly will speed the server process.  A second way has been provided for
       object oriented types who believe in methods.  The second way consists of the following methods:

         my $val = $self-&gt;get_property( 'key1' );
         my $self-&gt;set_property( key1 =&gt; 'val1' );

       Properties are allowed to be changed at any time with caution (please do not undef the sock property
       or you will close the client connection).

<b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b>
       "Net::Server" allows for the use of a configuration file to read in server parameters.  The format of
       this conf file is simple key value pairs.  Comments and white space are ignored.

         #-------------- file test.conf --------------

         ### user and group to become
         user        somebody
         group       everybody

         ### logging ?
         log_file    /var/log/server.log
         log_level   3
         pid_file    /tmp/server.pid

         ### optional syslog directive
         ### used in place of log_file above
         #log_file       Sys::Syslog
         #syslog_logsock unix
         #syslog_ident   myserver
         #syslog_logopt  pid|cons

         ### access control
         allow       .+\.(net|com)
         allow       domain\.com
         deny        a.+

         ### background the process?
         background  1

         ### ports to bind (this should bind
         ### 127.0.0.1:20205 and localhost:20204)
         ### See Net::Server::Proto
         host        127.0.0.1
         port        localhost:20204
         port        20205

         ### reverse lookups ?
         # reverse_lookups on

         #-------------- file test.conf --------------

<b>PROCESS</b> <b>FLOW</b>
       The process flow is written in an open, easy to override, easy to hook, fashion.  The basic flow is
       shown below.

         $self-&gt;configure_hook;

         $self-&gt;configure(@_);

         $self-&gt;post_configure;

         $self-&gt;post_configure_hook;

         $self-&gt;pre_bind;

         $self-&gt;bind;

         $self-&gt;post_bind_hook;

         $self-&gt;post_bind;

         $self-&gt;pre_loop_hook;

         $self-&gt;loop;

         ### routines inside a standard $self-&gt;loop
         # $self-&gt;accept;
         # $self-&gt;run_client_connection;
         # $self-&gt;done;

         $self-&gt;pre_server_close_hook;

         $self-&gt;server_close;

       The server then exits.

       During the client processing phase ("$self-&gt;run_client_connection"), the following represents the
       program flow:

         $self-&gt;post_accept;

         $self-&gt;get_client_info;

         $self-&gt;post_accept_hook;

         if( $self-&gt;allow_deny

             &amp;&amp; $self-&gt;allow_deny_hook ){

           $self-&gt;process_request;

         }else{

           $self-&gt;request_denied_hook;

         }

         $self-&gt;post_process_request_hook;

         $self-&gt;post_process_request;

       The process then loops and waits for the next connection.  For a more in depth discussion, please
       read the code.

       During the server shutdown phase ("$self-&gt;server_close"), the following represents the program flow:

         $self-&gt;close_children;  # if any

         $self-&gt;post_child_cleanup_hook;

         if( Restarting server ){
            $self-&gt;restart_close_hook();
            $self-&gt;hup_server;
         }

         exit;

<b>HOOKS</b>
       "Net::Server" provides a number of "hooks" allowing for servers layered on top of "Net::Server" to
       respond at different levels of execution.

       "$self-&gt;configure_hook()"
           This hook takes place immediately after the "-&gt;run()" method is called.  This hook allows for
           setting up the object before any built in configuration takes place.  This allows for custom
           configurability.

       "$self-&gt;post_configure_hook()"
           This hook occurs just after the reading of configuration parameters and initiation of logging and
           pid_file creation.  It also occurs before the "-&gt;pre_bind()" and "-&gt;bind()" methods are called.
           This hook allows for verifying configuration parameters.

       "$self-&gt;post_bind_hook()"
           This hook occurs just after the bind process and just before any chrooting, change of user, or
           change of group occurs.  At this point the process will still be running as the user who started
           the server.

       "$self-&gt;pre_loop_hook()"
           This hook occurs after chroot, change of user, and change of group has occured.  It allows for
           preparation before looping begins.

       "$self-&gt;post_accept_hook()"
           This hook occurs after a client has connected to the server.  At this point STDIN and STDOUT are
           mapped to the client socket.  This hook occurs before the processing of the request.

       "$self-&gt;allow_deny_hook()"
           This hook allows for the checking of ip and host information beyond the "$self-&gt;allow_deny()"
           routine.  If this hook returns 1, the client request will be processed, otherwise, the request
           will be denied processing.

       "$self-&gt;request_denied_hook()"
           This hook occurs if either the "$self-&gt;allow_deny()" or "$self-&gt;allow_deny_hook()" have taken
           place.

       "$self-&gt;post_process_request_hook()"
           This hook occurs after the processing of the request, but before the client connection has been
           closed.

       "$self-&gt;pre_server_close_hook()"
           This hook occurs before the server begins shutting down.

       "$self-&gt;write_to_log_hook"
           This hook handles writing to log files.  The default hook is to write to STDERR, or to the
           filename contained in the parameter "log_file".  The arguments passed are a log level of 0 to 4
           (4 being very verbose), and a log line.  If log_file is equal to "Sys::Syslog", then logging will
           go to Sys::Syslog and will bypass the write_to_log_hook.

       "$self-&gt;fatal_hook"
           This hook occurs when the server has encountered an unrecoverable error.  Arguments passed are
           the error message, the package, file, and line number.  The hook may close the server, but it is
           suggested that it simply return and use the built in shut down features.

       "$self-&gt;post_child_cleanup_hook"
           This hook occurs in the parent server process after all children have been shut down and just
           before the server either restarts or exits.  It is intended for additional cleanup of
           information.  At this point pid_files and lockfiles still exist.

       "$self-&gt;restart_open_hook"
           This hook occurs if a server has been HUPed (restarted via the HUP signal.  It occurs just before
           reopening to the filenos of the sockets that were already opened.

       "$self-&gt;restart_close_hook"
           This hook occurs if a server has been HUPed (restarted via the HUP signal.  It occurs just before
           restarting the server via exec.

<b>RESTARTING</b>
       Each of the server personalities (except for INET), support restarting via a HUP signal (see "kill
       -l").  When a HUP is received, the server will close children (if any), make sure that sockets are
       left open, and re-exec using the same commandline parameters that initially started the server.
       (Note: for this reason it is important that @ARGV is not modified until "-&gt;run" is called.

<b>TO</b> <b>DO</b>
       There are several tasks to perform before the alpha label can be removed from this software:

       Use It
           The best way to further the status of this project is to use it.  There are immediate plans to
           use this as a base class in implementing some mail servers and banner servers on a high hit site.

       Other Personalities
           Explore any other personalities

       Net::Server::HTTP, etc
           Create various types of servers.  Possibly, port exising servers to user Net::Server as a base
           layer.

<b>AUTHOR</b>
       Paul T. Seamons &lt;paul at seamons.com&gt;

<b>THANKS</b>
       Thanks to Rob Brown (bbb at cpan.org) for help with miscellaneous concepts such as tracking down the
       serialized select via flock ala Apache and the reference to IO::Select making multiport servers
       possible.  And for researching into allowing sockets to remain open upon exec (making HUP possible).
       Rob Brown is also the maintainer for Net::Server.

       Thanks to Jonathan J. Miner &lt;miner at doit.wisc.edu&gt; for patching a blatant problem in the reverse
       lookups.

       Thanks to Bennett Todd &lt;bet at rahul.net&gt; for pointing out a problem in Solaris 2.5.1 which does not
       allow multiple children to accept on the same port at the same time.  Also for showing some sample
       code from Viktor Duchovni which now represents the semaphore option of the serialize argument in the
       PreFork server.

       Thanks to <u>traveler</u> and <u>merlyn</u> from <a href="http://perlmonks.org">http://perlmonks.org</a> for pointing me in the right direction for
       determining the protocol used on a socket connection.

       Thanks to Jeremy Howard &lt;j+daemonize at howard.fm&gt; for numerous suggestions and for work on
       Net::Server::Daemonize.

       Thanks to Vadim &lt;vadim at hardison.net&gt; for patches to implement parent/child communication on
       PreFork.pm.
