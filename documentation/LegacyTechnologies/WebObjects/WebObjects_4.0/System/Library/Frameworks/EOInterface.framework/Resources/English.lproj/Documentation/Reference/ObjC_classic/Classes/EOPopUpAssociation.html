<h2>Class Description </h2>
</a>An EOPopUpAssociation object displays an attribute or to-one relationship value in an NSPopUpButton (Application Kit). The items in the NSPopUpButton can be entered manually, or for a relationship, constructed dynamically from values supplied by the destination entity's EODisplayGroup. The value displayed by the NSPopUpButton can be bound by one of three aspects: <code>selectedTitle</code>, which is useful for values representable as strings; <code>selectedTag</code>, for integer values; and <code>selectedObject</code>, for the destination object of a relationship.<p>

<h2> Examples</h2>
</a>There are several basic ways to configure a combo box and it's association. They are described below.<p>
<a name="1066">
<hr width=25% align=left>
<h3> Selecting a String from a Static List</h3>
</a>Suppose you have a Movie display group and you want to provide a pop-up list for setting the rating from a static list of strings. In this example, a Movie object's rating is a string property rather than a relationship to a Rating object. To do this, in Interface Builder, type the list of ratings into the pop-up list. Control-drag a connection from the pop-up list to the Movie display group. Choose EOPopUpAssociation in the Connections inspector, and bind the <B>selectedTitle </B> aspect to the "rating" key. With this configuration, if an object's string attribute value isn't in the pop-up list, it's temporarily added while the object is selected.<p>
<a name="1068">
<hr width=25% align=left>
<h3> Selecting a String from a Dynamic List</h3>
</a>This example is similar to the previous one, except in this example, a Movie object's rating is chosen from strings in a Rating database table. There's a Rating EODisplayGroup that fetches the ratings into Rating objects, and the pop-up list is filled from the "ratingString" property of the rating display group's Rating objects. To do this, in Interface Builder, control-drag a connection from the pop-up list to the Ratings display group. Choose EOPopUpAssociation in the Connections inspector, and bind the <B>titles </B> aspect to the "ratingString" key. Similarly, control-drag a connection from the pop-up list to the Movie display group. Again choose EOComboBoxAssociation in the Connections inspector, and bind the <B>selectedTitle </B> aspect to the "rating" key.<p>
<a name="1160">
<hr width=25% align=left>
<h3> Selecting an Integer Tag from a Static List</h3>
</a>Suppose you have a Customer enterprise object whose credit card type (Visa, MasterCard, and so on) is indicated by an integer tag. You want a user to be able to choose a customer's card type from a pop-up list. To do this, in Interface Builder, set the credit card names and tags for the pop-up list. Control-drag a connection from the pop-up list to the Customer display group. Choose EOPopUpAssociation in the Connections inspector, and bind the <B>selectedTag </B> aspect to the "cardType" key. You can also allow for a general "other" value by defining a special tag and setting it in the EOPopUpAssociation using <code><a href="EOPopUpAssociation.html#100">setTagValueForOther:</a></code>. Credit card tags from the database not matching any in the pop-up list are then displayed as the "other" value. (It would also make sense to disable the pop-up list in this case, to avoid writing the meaningless tag back to the database.)<p>

<hr width=25% align=left>
<h3> Selecting the Destination of a To-One Relationship</h3>
</a>Suppose you have a list of employees and want to assign each employee a department. In terms of the object model, you want to assign a Department object as the destination of an Employee object's <code>department</code> relationship. To do this, in Interface Builder, control-drag a connection from the pop-up list to a Department display group. Choose EOComboBoxAssociation in the Connections inspector, and bind the <B>titles </B> aspect to the "name" key. Similarly, control-drag a connection from the pop-up list to the Employee display group. Again choose EOComboBoxAssociation in the Connections inspector, and bind the <B>selectedObject </B> to the "department" key. This fills the pop-up list with the names of departments, and causes the name of the selected Employee's Department to be selected in the pop-up list.<p>

<h2>Instance Methods </h2>
</a><a name="100">
<hr width=25% align=left>
<h3> <a name="//apple_ref/occ/instm/EOPopUpAssociation/setTagValueForOther:">setTagValueForOther:</a></h3>
</a>- (void)<code>setTagValueForOther:</code>(int)<em>tag</em><p>
Records <em>tag</em> as the "unknown" tag. When a property value doesn't match any other tag in the pop-up list, the EOPopUpAssociation automatically selects the item for this tag. If there's no item for this tag, the pop-up list's selection isn't changed. This tag value is by default -1.<p>
<a name="103">
<hr width=25% align=left>
<h3> <a name="//apple_ref/occ/instm/EOPopUpAssociation/tagValueForOther">tagValueForOther</a></h3>
</a>- (int)<code>tagValueForOther</code><p>
Returns the "unknown" tag.<p>
