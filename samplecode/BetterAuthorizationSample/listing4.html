================================================================
16 Nov 2007

Introduction
------------
This document describes some of the design and implementation decisions taken
while implementing BetterAuthorizationSampleLib (BAS).  If you just want to
perform privileged operations and don't care about how it works, you can safely
ignore this document.  On the other hand, if you want to know how
BetterAuthorizationSampleLib works and why it was designed the way it is, this
documentation is for you.


Goals and Non-Goals 
-------------------
The primary motivation for creating BetterAuthorizationSampleLib was to improve
security compared to MoreAuthSample (and the earlier AuthSample). 
MoreAuthSample uses a setuid root helper tool.  While that approach was
reasonable given the constraints of the time, we knew we could do better on
current systems.

Because that primary goal would require a completely new code base, we decide
to take the opportunity to improve other aspects of the design.  The final set
of goals for BetterAuthorizationSampleLib is:

1. Security
   - eliminate the setuid root helper tool
   - integrate with Authorization Services
   - defend against relatively sophisticated attacks, like malformed input, 
     denial of service attacks, and resource leaks
2. Easy developer adoption
   - supports goal 1: no point having new tools if no one uses them
3. Simplicity
   - supports goal 1: simple code is easier to audit for security
   - supports goal 2: simple code is easier for developers to understand 
     and adopt
4. On demand
   - MoreAuthSample is &quot;on demand&quot;, in the sense that the privileged helper 
     tool only runs while it's needed; BAS needs to maintain this feature; 
     we can't have a gazillion helper tools running all the time
5. &quot;Try, then handle failure&quot; model
   - supports goal 1: once a BAS privileged helper tool is installed, 
     the system admin can tweak the setup without tripping any 
     preflight checks
   - supports goal 3: no need for BAS to do version checking
   - supports goal 3: preflighting is hard

BAS also has some non-goals:

1. Line-for-line compatibility with MoreAuthSample
   - not possible given goal 1

2. More than one tool per bundle
   - contradicts goal 3: we considered this to be unnecessarily complex

3. Security at install time (that is, no code signing)
   - In current versions of Mac OS X there is no way to truly protect 
     yourself from malicious code running on the system at the time you  
     enter the admin password (which is what the user is going to do 
     at install time).  Thus, our goal is to protect the system from 
     attacks once everything has been installed.  Attackers that are 
     running at install time can still compromise the system.

4. Versioning
   - contradicts goal 3
   - contradicts goal 5
   - We leave it up to the developer to figure out if the installed version 
     of their helper tool is adequate for their needs.  We do, however, 
     provide features that make it easy for the developer to do this 
     (for example, kBASFailNeedsUpdate).


launchd and IPC Choice
----------------------
The first step in the design of BetterAuthorizationSampleLib (BAS) was to
choose a mechanism to launch the helper tool that avoids the need for a setuid
binary.  It turns out that there is really only one choice,
&lt;x-man-page://8/launchd&gt;.  A launchd daemon that publishes a UNIX domain socket
is the only non-networking, launch-on-demand daemon that's supported for third
party development.

    Note:
    Earlier versions of Mac OS X supported launch-on-demand TCP/IP daemons 
    via inetd (and, later, &lt;x-man-page://8/xinetd&gt;).  However, we didn't 
    want to use a TCP/IP daemon because of the possibility that it might 
    be vulnerable to attacks over the network.  While it is possible to 
    prevent these attacks by binding your listening socket to the 
    loopback address (on 10.4.x, both NetInfo and CUPS use this 
    technique), it's still worrisome.

One issue with launchd is that its UNIX domain sockets support has only
recently started working.  Specifically, the UNIX domain socket support is not
useful without support for the &quot;SockPathMode&quot; key, and that only works on
Intel-based Macintosh computers, and on PowerPC-based computers since Mac OS X
10.4.6.  However, these requirements were not prohibitive for BAS.

One nice feature of UNIX domain sockets is that it's possible to pass a file
descriptor across a socket.  This is helpful if, say, the privileged operation
is networking related.  Rather than put all of the networking code into the
helper tool, you can just have the tool open and configure the relevant socket
and pass the descriptor back to the application.

The only serious competitor to UNIX domain sockets was Mach messaging.  The
main interest in Mach messaging is its (relatively) nice RPC generator
(&quot;/usr/bin/mig&quot;).  However, this advantage was outweighed by the following
disadvantages:

o While Mach messaging is used extensively in the implementation of Mac OS X,
Apple recommends against its use by third party developers.

o There's no launch-on-demand mechanism that's supported for third party
development on Mac OS X 10.4.  Specifically, things like
&quot;/etc/mach_init[_per_user].d&quot; are not supported for third party development. 
See DTS Technote 2083 &quot;Daemons and Agents&quot; for more details on this.

&lt;http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2005/tn2083.html&gt;

Using a launchd daemon does present some interesting complications.  Firstly,
the daemon runs in the daemon context.  Thus, the developer must not do things
that rely on the user's context (like use GUI frameworks).  This typically isn't
a problem because most developers are creating a privileged helper tool to
bypass a system restriction on a privileged operation, and these operations are
generally implemented at the lowest levels within the system.  For example, if
the reason you need a privileged helper tool is to open a low-numbered TCP port,
running in the daemon context isn't a problem.

Another interesting issue with running as a launchd daemon is that the daemon
is shared between all users.  There's no specific gotcha here, just a general
concern that it might be possible for one user to deny service to another user
by interfering with the daemon.

Both of these launchd issues could be resolved by using a launchd agent, but
that's not possible because launchd agents don't work properly on Mac OS X
10.4.x &lt;rdar://problem/4255854&gt;.  Even when that's fixed, launchd agents won't
be appropriate because, by definition, the agent runs on behalf of a specific
user, and thus is not privileged.


Logging
-------
When you're using a setuid root helper tool, it makes sense to log error
information to stderr.  This is inherited from the program that invoked your
tool, and typically ends up on the console.

When using launchd, printing to stderr no longer makes sense; by default a
launchd daemon's stderr goes to /dev/null.  BAS could have worked around this,
but we decided that it was better to anticipate the future by integrating
support for the Apple system log (ASL) facility.  ASL is rather rudimentary on
current systems, but it's Apple's preferred logging facility and it will be the
subject of significant future enhancements.  Thus, BAS makes it easy for
developers to log information from their privileged helper tool to ASL.


File System Notes
-----------------
There's some concern that &quot;/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/&quot; is not secure
because of the permissions of &quot;/Library&quot;.  Specifically, because &quot;/Library&quot; is
owned by the &quot;admin&quot; group, an admin user can move and rename items in the
directory.  However, it isn't possible because &quot;/Library&quot; is sticky, and
&quot;/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/&quot; is owned by root, and thus only root can
delete or rename it.  Also, as &quot;/Library/LaunchDaemons/&quot; is protected by the
same mechanism, there's no point trying to apply greater security to
&quot;/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/&quot;.

When setting the permissions for &quot;/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/&quot;, we left &quot;w&quot;
on for root because, if you're running as root, not being able to write to a
file is /not/ going to stop you (-:  Also, this mirrors
&quot;/Library/LaunchDaemons&quot;.

We fail if standard directories (like &quot;/Library/LaunchDaemons&quot; and &quot;/var/run&quot;)
are not present.  This is probably safer, in the long term, that trying to
recreate them.  In contrast, we create our custom directory
(&quot;/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/&quot;) if it's not present.

We do not check whether standard directories have the 'right' permissions.  The
main reason for this is that we don't want to fail unnecessarily as the system's
default permissions evolve.

An alternative file system layout that we considered was:

  /Library/LaunchDaemons/&lt;bundleID&gt;.plist    rw-r--r-- root:wheel
  /Library/LaunchDaemons/&lt;bundleID&gt;          rwxr-xr-x root:wheel
  /var/run/&lt;bundleID&gt;.socket                 rw-rw-rw- root:daemon

The nice feature of this approach is that all of the directories already exist,
so we don't need to worry about creating any directories (and their associated
permissions).  However, after consulting launchd engineering, we decided that
mixing the tools in with the plists is a bad idea.

Another option we considered was to put the sockets in their own directory:

  /var/run/PrivilegedHelperTools/                    rwxr-xr-x root:daemon
  /var/run/PrivilegedHelperTools/&lt;bundleID&gt;.socket   rw-rw-rw- root:daemon

We decided that this wasn't really worth the effort.  It seems unlikely that
even an advanced user is going to have more than, say, 100 helper tools, and
&quot;/var/run&quot; can handle that just fine.


Protocol
--------
There were some concerns about using CFDictionaries for the request/response
protocol because it requires that you bring CF into the privileged helper tool
(and, by definition, the less code in the helper tool the better).  However, we
used CF because a) it makes it easy to define a BAS interface that's arbitrarily
extensible, b) it naturally supports different architectures in the application
and the tool, c) it's an easy upgrade path for MoreAuthSample users (and thus
supports goal 2), and d) chances are the helper tool will be using CF anyway.

Each special key is special for a reason:

o kBASCommandKey -- We define a command key so that BAS can automatically
integrate with Authorization Services, as described in the &quot;Common Data
Structures&quot; section below.

o kBASErrorKey -- We want to clearly separate IPC errors from errors in the
command itself.  The easiest way to do this is to place the error result from
the helper tool callback routine into the response dictionary.  If that
dictionary makes it back to the application, there was no IPC error and the
error code is significant.  On the other hand, if there's an IPC error then, by
definition, you don't get a response dictionary and you don't have to worry
about its value.

o kBASDescriptorArray -- This allows the privileged helper tool to create
descriptors on behalf of the client.  This is a common approach to code
factoring for privilege separation, so we want to support it directly in BAS. 
We couldn't think of a reason for the client to pass descriptors to the
privileged helper tool, so we don't currently support that.  This avoids the
need for us to check whether incoming commands have descriptors when they're not
supposed to.  Failing to check this would result in a descriptor leak within the
privileged helper tool, which could cause security problems.


Coding Conventions
------------------
The privileged code in BAS only needs to link with the CoreFoundation and
Security frameworks.  We deliberately restricted our framework use to these very
low-level frameworks in order to make the code easier to audit for security
(part of goal 3).

If you look carefully at the code, you'll see that it #includes CoreServices. 
We need to include CoreServices at compile time to get access to the error codes
in &quot;MacErrors.h&quot;.  However, we don't use anything in that umbrella framework at
runtime.

Finally, we chose to use OSStatus error codes (rather than errno-style error
codes) because they're more expressive.  Specifically, there is a defined way to
represent an errno-style error in an OSStatus, but not the other way around.


Common Data Structures
----------------------
We want to actively promote the use of Authorization Services.  That is, a
developer who adopts BAS should be using Authorization Services by default; all
they need to do is decide on the names of the custom rights that they want to
use and the default specification for those rights.

So, we need a way to a) tell the application-side code what authorization right
specifications to create, and b) tell the helper tool what commands map to what
authorization rights.  That's what the BASCommandSpec array is all about.

We specifically allow for commands with no associated authorization right so
that a developer can do the following:

o Implement a &quot;get version&quot; command, as described in the &quot;Versioning&quot; section
of the &quot;Performing Privileged Operations With BetterAuthorizationSampleLib&quot;
document.  This gets us out of the business of version management, which
directly supports goals 3 and 5.

o Implement a &quot;no operation&quot; command, as described in the &quot;Preflighting&quot;
section of the &quot;Performing Privileged Operations With
BetterAuthorizationSampleLib&quot; document.  This directly supports goal 5.

o Implement commands with custom authorization -- In this case the developer's
callback routine can do its own authorization checks.  Because we want
developers to use Authorization Services, we don't provide any specific
infrastructure for this (for example, there's no easy way to access the
per-session socket so that they can use the LOCAL_PEERCRED socket option to get
the EUID of the client process).

The command callback routines aren't in this data structure because the
commands array is shared, at a source level, between the application and the
helper tool, and the functions that implement the commands should only be in the
helper tool.  Thus, we have to supply a separate parallel array of callbacks to
BASHelperToolMain.  This is less than ideal, but better than numerous other
alternatives that I considered.

The rightDefaultRule field of the BASCommandSpec structure represents an
interesting design choice.  It must be a rule name (that is, a string), whereas
the underlying Authorization Services routine (AuthorizationRightSet) lets you
pass in either a rule name (a CFString) or a CFDictionary that specifies the
right in more detail.  We decided to just go with a string it satisfies the
majority of needs and there's no easy way to include a dictionary in a static
const data structure.


Helper Tool Structure
---------------------
The overall structure of the helper tool is follows:

on BASHelperToolMain(...)
  disable SIGPIPE
  check in with launchd
  get listening socket
  loop [3]
      accept connection on socket
      exit if accept timed out

      read authorization ref external form
      internalize
      read request [1]
      authorize request [2]
      create empty response
      call client callback with auth, request, and response
      write response
      close connection
  end loop
end BASHelperToolMain

Notes:

[1] We must limit the amount of data that we can read to prevent clients using
us to exhaust system resources.  See the definition and use of
kBASMaxNumberOfKBytes in &quot;BetterAuthorizationSample.c&quot;.

[2] Get the command name from the request; look for it in the command array; if
it's present, call AuthorizationCopyRights to get the associated right.

[3] We originally contemplated only supporting a single request per loop; but
if we run for less than 60 seconds, launchd will think that we're failing and
throttle the rate that it launches us.

This design is single threaded.  This makes things a lot simpler, but it could
cause problems.  For example, consider what happens if you run the same app in
the context of two different users (via fast user switching) and user A issues a
command that requires authorization, then you switch to user B, and run another
command that requires authorization.  Because we're blocked processing user A's
authorization request (in AuthorizationCopyRights), user B's request won't even
get started.  But user B won't know what the problem is because there's no
indication of user A's authorization visible on their screen.

Ultimately the solution to this may lie in launchd itself.  If we could launch
a privileged process once per login session (much like an launchd agent, but
privileged), this wouldn't be a problem.  Pending that solution, we don't intend
to complicate this code unnecessarily by trying to handle concurrent requests. 
However, we do ameliorate the problem by pre-authorizing the authorization
rights in the client-side code.  This means that, most times, you get blocked in
the client-side call to AuthorizationCopyRights rather than in the server.

MoreAuthSample runs the command proc with EUID == RUID and SUID == 0.  This
means that the developer has to explicitly switch EUID == 0 to do privileged
stuff.  That's a good design.  However, we can't replicate it in BAS because our
RUID will always be 0 (we're launched by launchd after all) and there's no
obvious alternative value to set it to.


Signals and Timeouts
--------------------
BAS uses three different types of signals:

o SIGPIPE -- In the helper tool BAS disables SIGPIPE so that writing to a
closed socket returns an error rather than quitting the process.  On the client
side we don't want to disable SIGIPE because our host application might be using
it for something.  So, we use the SO_NOSIGPIPE socket option to disable SIGPIPE
on just our socket.

o SIGTERM -- When launchd wants the helper tool to quit, it sends it a SIGTERM.
 For the sake of simplicity BAS ignores the signal and the default behavior
occurs (the process terminates asynchronously).  This won't cause any problems
for the reusable BAS code; it's quite happy to let the system clean up.  OTOH,
if the developer's callback does bad things under asynchronous termination,
they'll have to handle it themselves (perhaps temporarily disabling SIGTERM).

o SIGALRM -- BAS uses SIGALRM as its watchdog timer, as described below. 
Again, because BAS can handle asynchronous termination just fine, it doesn't
need to explicitly handle SIGALRM.  The default behavior of the signal, to
terminate the process, is a fine response to the watchdog expiring.

BAS has to deal with two kinds of timeouts:

o There's an idle timeout (kIdleTimeoutInSeconds, currently 2 minutes).  If BAS
hasn't received a request within that timeout, the tool quits with an exit
status of EXIT_SUCCESS.  This ensures that, once the tool starts, it doesn't run
forever.

BAS implements this timeout by waiting for connections using a kqueue.  It then
uses the timeout on the waiting function (&lt;x-man-page://2/kevent&gt;) as the idle
timeout.

Note that it's possible for a connection to come in between the point that BAS
decides to quit and the time that it actually does manage to quit.  This will
work just fine.  launchd will notice that the tool has quit with pending
connections and relaunch it.

o The second timeout is the timeout for a specific request
(kWatchdogTimeoutInSeconds, currently 65 seconds).  The tool should be able to
receive a request and send a response in a timely fashion.  If not, that's a
problem that should cause the request to fail.

This timeout plays an important part in our protection from denial of service
attacks.  Without it, malicious code could open a connection to the tool, send
it half a request, and then just leave the connection open.  BAS would be stuck
in a system call reading data.  And because BAS is single threaded, this would
deny service to all other clients.  The watchdog timer prevents this by
terminating the process if it's been stuck for too long.

Ideally we would prefer a short watchdog timeout but kWatchdogTimeoutInSeconds
must be greater than 60 seconds: otherwise a persistent attacker could cause us
to fail 10 times, each in less than 60 seconds, which would cause launchd to
remove our job.  Future versions of launchd will allow you to configure its job
removal timeout, but we can't avail ourselves of that currently.

We could have implemented the watchdog by doing asynchronous reads, but that
makes the code a lot more complex.  For example, the code currently has
functions that abstract away certain complexities (like reading a dictionary),
and a switch to asynchronous reads would undermine those abstractions.  Also,
the tool could get stuck somewhere that we didn't expect (perhaps in the
developer's callback routine) and we need to handle that as well.

We should stress that this is not a perfect solution to denial of service
attacks.  If a malicious client repeatedly creates connections to the server and
leaves them to time out, it will significantly slow down the progress of other
clients.  This is hard to fix while keeping the code simple, and we judged that
it wasn't worth the complexity and the risk that that entails.


Client-Side Structure
---------------------
We adopted the &quot;try, then handle failure&quot; approach for the following reasons:

o Preflighting is hard.

o You have to implement recovery anyway, so you might as well just try it and
then handle the failure.

o It allows the admin to tweak the configuration.  For example, the admin could
move the helper tools to a new location and, as long as they update the plist
file appropriately, everything will work.  That wouldn't be the case if we
carefully checked everything before trying to talk to the helper tool.

o It gets us out of the business of versioning.  If the developer wants a
version check, they can add a custom command to do that check.  However, a
better approach is for the developer to implement new functionality as a new
command.  If that command fails because the tool doesn't recognize it, the
helper tool is too old and the developer can force an update.

If the developer doesn't like our model, but would rather preflight, they can
do it by implementing a &quot;no operation&quot; command in the helper tool.

We separate BASDiagnoseFailure and BASFixFailure because BASFixFailure will
request AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges (AEWP) authorization, and we want to
give the client the opportunity to prepare the user for that dialog.  That's
also the purpose of the BASFailCode; it allows the client to customize the UI
they present before presenting the user with an AEWP dialog.

We had the choice of passing in a bundle identifier or a CFBundleRef.  We chose
to use a bundle identifier because it's a string, and that maps well to the path
names that the library uses.  In cases where we need resources from the bundle,
we call CFBundleGetBundleWithIdentifier.  It's this decision that makes it
impossible to support more than one tool per bundle.

We originally had BASExecuteRequestInHelperTool call BASSetDefaultRules.  We
switched away from the design because a) we didn't want each request paying the
cost of the BASSetDefaultRules, and b) having BASExecuteRequestInHelperTool also
include the parameters for BASSetDefaultRules made the parameter list unwieldy.

The overall structure of BASSetDefaultRules is shown below.

on BASSetDefaultRules(...)
  for each command
      AuthorizationRightGet
      if no right then
          AuthorizationRightSet
      end if
  end for
end

The overall structure of BASExecuteRequestInHelperTool is shown below.

on BASExecuteRequestInHelperTool(...)
  if command has associated right
    authorize request
  end if
  open socket
  connect to /var/run/&lt;bundleID&gt;.socket
  externalize auth
  write auth to socket
  write request to socket
  read response from socket
  close socket
end BASExecuteRequestInHelperTool

The overall structure of BASDiagnoseFailure is shown below.

on BASDiagnoseFailure(...)
  hasPlist = file /Library/LaunchDaemons/&lt;bundleID&gt;.plist exists
  hasTool  = file /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/&lt;bundleID&gt; exists
  if hasPlist and hasTool then
    try to connect to /var/run/&lt;bundleID&gt;.socket
    if that fails with ECONNREFUSED
      failCode = kBASFailDisabled
    else
      failCode = kBASFailUnknown;
    end if
  else
    if hasPlist or hasTool then
      failCode = kBASFailPartiallyInstalled
    else
      failCode = kBASFailNotInstalled
    end if
  end if
end BASDiagnoseFailure

This could probably be improved.  We're interested in learning about what sorts
of failures folks see in the field.

We contemplated having the developer pass the IPC error that they got back from
BASExecuteRequestInHelperTool into BASDiagnoseFailure.  However, we decided
against this because error codes are notoriously unrelated to the actual cause
of the problem.


Installation
------------
After thinking about it for a long time, we decided to use a custom installer
tool to install the privileged helper tool.  As we were thinking about coming up
with a possible solution to the installation procedure we basically had two
methods in mind: 

1. Roll a separate installer tool into BAS to handle everything properly via
AEWP.

2. Run Apple's standard installer tool.

3. Embed an installer shell script in the source code and invoke '/bin/sh' via
AEWP and pipe the shell script to it.

Option 2 would have been ideal, but it present certain process issues for the
developer.  Specifically, on current versions of Mac OS X (10.4.x), it's not
possible to create an installer package that installs root-owned files without
actually setting up root-owned files on the file system.  You can't do that from
an Xcode project without running Xcode as root.  This just made the whole
approach too clumsy for us to use (that is, it contradicted goal 2).

Our final choice (between options 1 and 3) was based primarily on erring in
favor of following the long established security paradigm of keeping a user-land
invoked privileged context as small as possible.  History has shown that running
shell scripts as root is an exercise fraught with security concerns.  Shells
tend to pull in a very large environment foot-print, thus, clearly running
orthogonal to this security base case.  However, we did take into account our
own criticisms in using a separate helper tool to possibly mitigate the
downsides in using this approach.

The most commonly used privilege escalation mechanism on Mac OS X is the
AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges (AEWP) routine.  Given an admin user name and
password, this routine will run arbitrary code as root.  Now consider what
happens if you have two tools in your bundle, one being your privileged helper
tool template and the other your installer tool that's run by AEWP to actually
install the helper tool in a privileged context.  If you have malicious code
running on the system, it's possible for it to switch out either the installer
tool or the helper tool template between the point where AEWP is called (which
is the last time point you can check the validity of the tools) and the point
where the user types their password.  Thus, even with an installer tool, there's
a window where malicious code can hijack the installation process.

That is, if you have malicious code running on your system at the point where
you install non-privileged software in a privileged context, there's nothing you
can do to maintain system security.

Our conclusion, therefore, was that BAS cannot protect the system at
installation time.  Therefore, we decided to instead follow the existing
paradigm (option 1) instead of doing something which may be have a negligible
gain in security for this case but is a very /huge/ faux pas in just about every
other security domain (option 3).  This is why we chose to include a separate
installer tool.

A superficial downfall to this approach is that it's less convenient.  The
developer now has to add /two/ targets to their project, one for the helper tool
and another for a separate installer tool.

Finally, here's a quick summary of the installation procedure.


on RunLaunchCtl(junkStdIO, command, plistPath)
  load or unload (command) job at path (via plistPath) launchctl
  fail if error
end RunLaunchCtl

on installCommand(bundleID, toolSourcePath, plistSourcePath)
  // running in installer tool
  // called by main
  unmask 022
  
  Build plist path from bundleID
  
  RunLaunchCtl(true, &quot;unload&quot;, &lt;path to plist&gt;);

  mkdir -p /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools
  fail if error
  chown root:wheel /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools
  fail if error
  chmod 755 /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools
  fail if error

  rm -f /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/&lt;bundleID&gt;
  copy-overwrite toolSourcePath /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/&lt;bundleID&gt;
  fail if error

  copy-overwrite plistSourcePath /Library/LaunchDaemons/&lt;bundleID&gt;.plist
  fail if error

  runLaunchCtl(false, &quot;load&quot;, &lt;path to plist&gt;);
  fail if error
end installCommand

on enableCommand(bundleID)
  // running in installer tool
  // called by main
  build plist path from bundleID
  runLaunchCtl(false, &quot;load&quot;, &lt;path to plist&gt;);
  fail if error
end enableCommand

on main(...)
  // running in installer tool via AEWP
  dup stdout to stderr
  fail if error
  
  print pid
  fail if error
  
  check and fix UID
  fail if error
  
  if command is kBASInstallToolInstallCommand
    installCommand(...);
  else if command is kBASInstallToolEnableCommand
    enableCommand(...)
  end if
  
  print &quot;oK&quot;
  fail if error
end main


on RunInstallToolAsRoot(...)
  // running in application
  // called by BASInstall
  Count the number of arguments passed in
  Allocate and build argument array
  fail if error
  
  AEWP InstallTool passing in built argument array
  fail if error
  
  loop until error or &quot;oK&quot;
    read AEWP'ed child's piped output
  end loop
  fail if error
end RunInstallToolAsRoot

on BASInstall(...)
  // running in application
  access plist from the embedded string
  fail if error
  
  create plist file using mkstemps() in /tmp
  fail if error
  
  write string to temp file
  fail if error
  
  call RunInstallToolAsRoot with the path to the temp file
  fail if error
end BASInstall

on BASFixFailure(...)
  // running in application
  find helper tool in bundle
  find install tool in bundle
  if failCode is kBASFailDisabled
    RunInstallToolAsRoot( enable command );
  else
    generate disabled plistText in memory from template in memory
    BASInstall( install command );
  end if
end BASFixFailure


Miscellaneous Notes
-------------------
It would have been nice to have an &quot;Uninstall&quot; command in the sample
application.  We chose not to do this because it would require us to expose the
RunInstallToolAsRoot routine to external calls and, even then, there's no easy
way to remove the custom authorization rights.

The bundle identifier for the sample application is
&quot;com.example.BetterAuthorizationSample&quot; rather than
&quot;com.apple.dts.BetterAuthorizationSample&quot; because the authorization policy
database (&quot;/etc/authorization&quot; on current systems) has a wildcard rule for
&quot;com.apple.&quot;.  If we use a bundle identifier starting with &quot;com.apple.&quot; then our
attempt to add a custom right would be treated as an an attempt to modify the
policy database.  Such modifications require that you authenticate as an admin
user.  The end result is that BASSetDefaultRules puts up an authentication
dialog when you first run the application.  This isn't what we want, and it
isn't what a typical developer would get.  Thus, we went with
&quot;com.example.BetterAuthorizationSample&quot;.

On the helper tool side of things, we directly call the callback associated
with the command.  This has two advantages.  Firstly, it's less work for the
developer.  Secondly, it ensures that we always executes the command that we
authorized.  If we had a single callback, the callback would have to do its own
dispatching.  If it used a different string comparison algorithm from the core
code, it might be possible for a malicious client to authorize one command but
execute another (perhaps be embedding null characters in the command string). 
Also, if the developer wants to handle multiple commands in a single callback,
there's nothing stopping them; they can use the userData parameter to
distinguish the commands.
