Will it respond with /CBACK? Will it do the burstcorrectly?</p><p>A burst will occur in the designed RAM address range 0-$4000 0000. It'sprobably implemented this way because trying to burst outside that range mightconfuse other system components and produce unpredictable results.</p><h2>Macintosh Portable 68000 Direct Slot connector documentation fix</h2><P>Date written:  6/26/92</p><P>Last reviewed:  11/1/92</p><P>The Macintosh Portable 68000 Direct Slot connector on pages 280 and 325 of the2nd edition of <i>Designing Cards and Drivers</i> doesn't match what I see inmy Macintosh Portable. Is the notch on the wrong side of the connector in thediagrams?</p><p>You're correct, the notches should be on the opposite side of the connector,not as shown in the 2nd edition. The "Macintosh SE 68000 Direct Slot connectorpinout" figure has been fixed for the 3rd edition (page 284). However, thenotches on the Direct Slot expansion connector in the "Expansion connectorlocation on Macintosh Portable main logic board" figure in the 3rd edition(page 393) are still shown incorrectly.</p><h2>Macintosh Quadra Processor Direct Slot performance</h2><P>Date Written:  11/26/91</p><P>Last reviewed:  6/14/93</p><P>Do you have performance specs on the Macintosh Quadra's 040 Processor DirectSlot (PDS)? If it's a direct connection to the 040's processor bus, the maximumdata transfer rate should depend on the speed of the RAM. Do you have a maximumtransfer rate to RAM? Are there any known bugs in the Quadra's PDS?</p><p>The maximum data transfer rate of the Quadra PDS depends on your mixture ofreads and writes. The theoretical maximum is:</p><p>    26 MB/sec for reads<br>    36 MB/sec for writes</p><p>This maximum would be reached if all bus transfers were to/from DRAM, werebursts, and there was no arbitration for alternate bus masters going on.</p><p>We measured the bus activity when the bus was saturated, with data andinstruction caches turned off. Since the caches were turned off, there were noburst transfers, and 93 percent of the accesses were reads. The observed busthroughput was 16 MB/sec. Why is this so much below 26 to 36 MB/sec? Becausenonburst reads are 6-clock cycles and nonburst writes are 5 clock cycles. AlsoROM accesses are slower than DRAM, as Apple uses 150 nS ROM, compared to 80 nSDRAM. Typically half the instruction read accesses are to the ROM.</p><p>There are no known problems with the Quadra PDS.</p><h2>Macintosh Classic II expansion connector pinouts</h2><P>Date Written:  12/11/91</p><P>Last reviewed:  8/1/92</p><P>Where can I find documentation on the Macintosh Classic II expansion connectorpinouts?</p><p>The schematics and specifications for the Classic II are documented in the"Macintosh Classic II, Macintosh PowerBook Family, and Macintosh Quadra FamilyDevelopers Notes." You can order this document from APDA for approximately $25.The order number is #R0143LL/A. You can contact APDA at:</p><p>Apple Computer, Inc.<br>20525 Mariani Avenue, Mail Stop 33-G<br>Cupertino, CA 95014<br>(800) 282-2732<br>AppleLink: APDA</p><p>A notable difference between the Classic and previous compact Macintosh modelsis the new FPU/ROM connector, which replaces the earlier Processor Direct Slot.Full details about this connector are available in the Developer Notes.</p><h2>Dynamic bus sizing on the Macintosh IIfx PDS</h2><P>Date Written:  4/22/91</p><P>Last reviewed:  8/1/92</p><P>Referring to pages 312-313 of the second edition of <i>Designing Cards andDrivers for the Macintosh Family,</i> it seems the Macintosh IIfx handles PDSPseudo NuBus differently between read and write cycles, and therefore does notsupport true 68030-style dynamic bus sizing. Could you please explain?</p><p>To clarify <i>Designing Cards and Drivers,</i> the paragraph with the wordingabout "cycles incoming to the Macintosh IIfx memory" on page 313 really refersto MASTER cycles incoming to the Macintosh IIfx memory. The memory controllerwill respond to masters reading IIfx memory with STERM (and only STERM) as a32-bit port.</p><p>PDS slaves can use either DSACK or STERM--it's your choice. DSACK is passeddirectly to the processor in this case. So the right thing should happenbecause the Macintosh IIfx circuitry is not altering your DSACK signals.</p><p>While there are buffers on the Macintosh IIfx connected to the PDS, they areonly bidirectional buffers that flip one way or the other, depending on whethera read or write is happening. There is no byte-swapping.</p><p>The only differences between a Macintosh SE/30 card and the Macintosh IIfx arethat the IIfx uses slot E and the PDS is a 20 MHz rather than a 16 MHz slot.</p><p>The only way to get on D0-D15 would be if a 16-bit cycle was made on a 32-bitport. Again, the Macintosh IIfx PDS doesn't do anything funny with regard toslave accesses.</p><h2>Don't exceed Macintosh LC expansion card size specifications</h2><P>Date Written:  3/8/91</p><P>Last reviewed:  6/14/93</p><P>The Macintosh LC class machines expansion card specifications are clear, butI'm wondering why a larger expansion card cannot be developed. It seems that acard with an "L" shape could be used to increase the size of the board. Theredon't seem to be any restrictive components other than a large electrolyticcapacitor which could be avoided. Are the restrictions due to heat or powerconsiderations? What would Apple think about a card that was larger than thespecifications if it was within the power budget?</p><p>Making a larger or oddly-shaped expansion board for the Macintosh LC classmachines is not a viable alternative. Besides physical size limitations,blocking ventilation and air flow patterns, increasing the heat dissipation,and exceeding the power budget all become more acute because the Macintosh LCis designed with even less tolerance for "bending the rules" than any modelbefore. Also, in designing upgrades to any Macintosh model, our engineers knownot to violate the documented expansion space reserved for you. Likewise, yourstaying out of areas not defined for your use will eliminate conflicts withApple's upgrades.</p><p>The guidelines were set up to protect you and your product from an expensiveexercise in incompatibility. Apple very much wants to see your product be asuccess in the marketplace.</p><h2>Macintosh Portable 68000 Direct Slot connector documentation fix</h2><P>Date Written:  6/26/92</p><P>Last reviewed:  10/11/92</p><P>The Macintosh Portable 68000 Direct Slot connector on pages 280 and 325 of the2nd edition of <i>Designing Cards and Drivers</i> doesn't match what I see inmy Macintosh Portable.
