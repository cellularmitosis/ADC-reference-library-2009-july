ATSUI also provides more extensive ancillary support for text-drawing, such as word- and line-breaking functions.

In addition to providing support for low-end Unicode drawing, ATSUI also provides access to advanced typography features. It enables font designers to build stylistic sophistication like swash variants and arbitrary ligatures.";

The ‘Home’ button moves the caret to the start of the text without any selection. The ‘Previous Word’ and ‘Next Word’ buttons move the selection by one ATSUI Word (see note below). The ‘Next 30’ button moves the selection by 30 characters.

Note: an ATSUI word is a common word made of letters (ie. ABC) as well as a sequence of punctuation (ie. ,;:.'?!@#$%&*()-_=+[]{}|/<>~) or spaces (ie.          ).";
