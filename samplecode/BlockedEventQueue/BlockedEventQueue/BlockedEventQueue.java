File: BlockedEventQueue.java

Abstract:  
	This is an example which INCORRECTLY handles actionEvents.
	It is designed as a simple example of a java tool which
	will lock up and show the spinning cursor, providing a case
	where developers can use practice with our debugging tools 
	to identify and isolate a problem.
	
	This example consists of two main parts: 
	
	1) a Panel which counts the number of times that it
	 is asked to paint itself
	 
	2) a Button which, when triggered, waits for the next
	 paint event on the Panel, and then changes its name.
