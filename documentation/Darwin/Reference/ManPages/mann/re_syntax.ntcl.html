____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

<b>NAME</b>
       re_syntax - Syntax of Tcl regular expressions.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________


<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       A  <u>regular</u>  <u>expression</u>  describes strings of characters.  It's a pattern that matches certain strings
       and doesn't match others.


<b>DIFFERENT</b> <b>FLAVORS</b> <b>OF</b> <b>REs</b>
       Regular expressions (``RE''s), as defined by POSIX, come in two flavors: <u>extended</u> REs (``EREs'')  and
       <u>basic</u>  REs (``BREs'').  EREs are roughly those of the traditional <u>egrep</u>, while BREs are roughly those
       of the traditional <u>ed</u>.  This implementation adds a third flavor, <u>advanced</u> REs  (``AREs''),  basically
       EREs with some significant extensions.

       This  manual page primarily describes AREs.  BREs mostly exist for backward compatibility in some old
       programs; they will be discussed at the end.  POSIX EREs are almost an exact subset  of  AREs.   Fea-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tures&nbsp;Features</font>
       tures of AREs that are not present in EREs will be indicated.


<b>REGULAR</b> <b>EXPRESSION</b> <b>SYNTAX</b>
       Tcl  regular  expressions  are  implemented  using the package written by Henry Spencer, based on the
       1003.2 spec and some (not quite all) of the Perl5 extensions (thanks, Henry!).  Much of the  descrip-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;description</font>
       tion of regular expressions below is copied verbatim from his manual entry.

       An ARE is one or more <u>branches</u>, separated by `<b>|</b>', matching anything that matches any of the branches.

       A branch is zero or more <u>constraints</u> or <u>quantified</u> <u>atoms</u>, concatenated.  It matches a match  for  the
       first, followed by a match for the second, etc; an empty branch matches the empty string.

       A  quantified  atom  is  an  <u>atom</u> possibly followed by a single <u>quantifier</u>.  Without a quantifier, it
       matches a match for the atom.  The quantifiers, and what a so-quantified atom matches, are:

         <b>*</b>     a sequence of 0 or more matches of the atom

         <b>+</b>     a sequence of 1 or more matches of the atom

         <b>?</b>     a sequence of 0 or 1 matches of the atom

         <b>{</b><u>m</u><b>}</b>   a sequence of exactly <u>m</u> matches of the atom

         <b>{</b><u>m</u><b>,}</b>  a sequence of <u>m</u> or more matches of the atom

         <b>{</b><u>m</u><b>,</b><u>n</u><b>}</b> a sequence of <u>m</u> through <u>n</u> (inclusive) matches of the atom; <u>m</u> may not exceed <u>n</u>

         <b>*?</b>  <b>+?</b>  <b>??</b>  <b>{</b><u>m</u><b>}?</b>  <b>{</b><u>m</u><b>,}?</b>  <b>{</b><u>m</u><b>,</b><u>n</u><b>}?</b>
               <u>non-greedy</u> quantifiers, which match the same possibilities, but prefer  the  smallest  number
               rather than the largest number of matches (see MATCHING)

       The  forms using <b>{</b> and <b>}</b> are known as <u>bound</u>s.  The numbers <u>m</u> and <u>n</u> are unsigned decimal integers with
       permissible values from 0 to 255 inclusive.

       An atom is one of:

         <b>(</b><u>re</u><b>)</b>  (where <u>re</u> is any regular expression) matches a match for <u>re</u>, with the match noted for  possi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ble&nbsp;possible</font>
               ble reporting

         <b>(?:</b><u>re</u><b>)</b>
               as previous, but does no reporting (a ``non-capturing'' set of parentheses)

         <b>()</b>    matches an empty string, noted for possible reporting

         <b>(?:)</b>  matches an empty string, without reporting

         <b>[</b><u>chars</u><b>]</b>
               a <u>bracket</u> <u>expression</u>, matching any one of the <u>chars</u> (see BRACKET EXPRESSIONS for more detail)

          <b>.</b>    matches any single character

         <b>\</b><u>k</u>    (where <u>k</u> is a non-alphanumeric character) matches that character taken as an ordinary charac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ter,&nbsp;character,</font>
               ter, e.g. \\ matches a backslash character

         <b>\</b><u>c</u>    where  <u>c</u>  is alphanumeric (possibly followed by other characters), an <u>escape</u> (AREs only), see
               ESCAPES below

         <b>{</b>     when followed by a character other than a digit, matches the left-brace character  `<b>{</b>';  when
               followed by a digit, it is the beginning of a <u>bound</u> (see above)

         <u>x</u>     where <u>x</u> is a single character with no other significance, matches that character.

       A  <u>constraint</u> matches an empty string when specific conditions are met.  A constraint may not be fol-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lowed&nbsp;followed</font>
       lowed by a quantifier.  The simple constraints are as follows; some more  constraints  are  described
       later, under ESCAPES.

         <b>^</b>       matches at the beginning of a line

         <b>$</b>       matches at the end of a line

         <b>(?=</b><u>re</u><b>)</b>  <u>positive</u> <u>lookahead</u> (AREs only), matches at any point where a substring matching <u>re</u> begins

         <b>(?!</b><u>re</u><b>)</b>  <u>negative</u> <u>lookahead</u> (AREs only), matches at any point where no substring matching <u>re</u> begins

       The  lookahead  constraints  may  not contain back references (see later), and all parentheses within
       them are considered non-capturing.

       An RE may not end with `<b>\</b>'.


<b>BRACKET</b> <b>EXPRESSIONS</b>
       A <u>bracket</u> <u>expression</u> is a list of characters enclosed in `<b>[]</b>'.  It normally matches any single  char-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">acter&nbsp;character</font>
       acter  from  the  list (but see below).  If the list begins with `<b>^</b>', it matches any single character
       (but see below) <u>not</u> from the rest of the list.

       If two characters in the list are separated by `<b>-</b>', this is shorthand for the full <u>range</u>  of  charac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ters&nbsp;characters</font>
       ters  between those two (inclusive) in the collating sequence, e.g.  <b>[0-9]</b> in ASCII matches any deci-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mal&nbsp;decimal</font>
       mal digit.  Two ranges may not share an endpoint, so e.g.  <b>a-c-e</b> is illegal.  Ranges are very collat-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing-sequence-dependent,&nbsp;collating-sequence-dependent,</font>
       ing-sequence-dependent, and portable programs should avoid relying on them.

       To  include  a literal <b>]</b> or <b>-</b> in the list, the simplest method is to enclose it in <b>[.</b> and <b>.]</b>  to make
       it a collating element (see below).  Alternatively, make it the first character (following a possible
       `<b>^</b>'), or (AREs only) precede it with `<b>\</b>'.  Alternatively, for `<b>-</b>', make it the last character, or the
       second endpoint of a range.  To use a literal <b>-</b> as the first endpoint of a range, make it a collating
       element  or  (AREs only) precede it with `<b>\</b>'.  With the exception of these, some combinations using <b>[</b>
       (see next paragraphs), and escapes, all other special  characters  lose  their  special  significance
       within a bracket expression.

       Within  a  bracket expression, a collating element (a character, a multi-character sequence that col-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lates&nbsp;collates</font>
       lates as if it were a single character, or a collating-sequence name for either) enclosed in  <b>[.</b>  and
       <b>.]</b>   stands  for the sequence of characters of that collating element.  The sequence is a single ele-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment&nbsp;element</font>
       ment of the bracket expression's list.  A bracket expression in a  locale  that  has  multi-character
       collating  elements  can  thus match more than one character.  So (insidiously), a bracket expression |
       that starts with <b>^</b> can match multi-character collating elements even if none of them  appear  in  the |
       bracket  expression!   (<u>Note:</u> Tcl currently has no multi-character collating elements.  This informa- |
       tion is only for illustration.)                                                                       |

       For example, assume the collating sequence includes a <b>ch</b> multi-character collating element.  Then the |
       RE <b>[[.ch.]]*c</b> (zero or more <b>ch</b>'s followed by <b>c</b>) matches the first five characters of `<b>chchcc</b>'.  Also, |
       the RE <b>[^c]b</b> matches all of `<b>chb</b>' (because <b>[^c]</b> matches the multi-character <b>ch</b>).

       Within a bracket expression, a collating element enclosed in <b>[=</b>  and  <b>=]</b>  is  an  equivalence  class,
       standing  for the sequences of characters of all collating elements equivalent to that one, including
       itself.  (If there are no other equivalent collating elements, the treatment is as if  the  enclosing
       delimiters  were  `<b>[.</b>'  and  `<b>.]</b>'.)  For example, if <b>o</b> and <b></b><b><u>^^</u></b> are the members of an equivalence class,
       then `<b>[[=o=]]</b>', `<b>[[=</b><b><u>^^</u></b><b>=]]</b>', and `<b>[o</b><b><u>^^</u></b><b>]</b>' are all synonymous.  An equivalence class may not  be  an  end-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">point&nbsp;endpoint</font>
       point  of  a  range.  (<u>Note:</u> Tcl currently implements only the Unicode locale.  It doesn't define any |
       equivalence classes.  The examples above are just illustrations.)

       Within a bracket expression, the name of a <u>character</u> <u>class</u> enclosed in <b>[:</b> and <b>:]</b> stands for the  list
       of all characters (not all collating elements!)  belonging to that class.  Standard character classes
       are:

              <b>alpha</b>       A letter.
              <b>upper</b>       An upper-case letter.
              <b>lower</b>       A lower-case letter.
              <b>digit</b>       A decimal digit.
              <b>xdigit</b>      A hexadecimal digit.
              <b>alnum</b>       An alphanumeric (letter or digit).
              <b>print</b>       An alphanumeric (same as alnum).
              <b>blank</b>       A space or tab character.
              <b>space</b>       A character producing white space in displayed text.
              <b>punct</b>       A punctuation character.
              <b>graph</b>       A character with a visible representation.
              <b>cntrl</b>       A control character.

       A locale may provide others.  (Note that the current Tcl implementation has only one locale: the Uni- |
       code locale.)  A character class may not be used as an endpoint of a range.

       There  are  two special cases of bracket expressions: the bracket expressions <b>[[:&lt;:]]</b> and <b>[[:&gt;:]]</b> are
       constraints, matching empty strings at the beginning and end of  a  word  respectively.   A  word  is
       defined as a sequence of word characters that is neither preceded nor followed by word characters.  A
       word character is an <u>alnum</u> character or an underscore (<b>_</b>).  These  special  bracket  expressions  are
       deprecated; users of AREs should use constraint escapes instead (see below).

<b>ESCAPES</b>
       Escapes  (AREs  only),  which  begin  with a <b>\</b> followed by an alphanumeric character, come in several
       varieties: character entry, class shorthands, constraint escapes, and back references.  A <b>\</b>  followed
       by  an alphanumeric character but not constituting a valid escape is illegal in AREs.  In EREs, there
       are no escapes: outside a bracket expression, a <b>\</b> followed by an alphanumeric character merely stands
       for  that character as an ordinary character, and inside a bracket expression, <b>\</b> is an ordinary char-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">acter.&nbsp;character.</font>
       acter.  (The latter is the one actual incompatibility between EREs and AREs.)

       Character-entry escapes (AREs only) exist to make it easier to  specify  non-printing  and  otherwise
       inconvenient characters in REs:

         <b>\a</b>   alert (bell) character, as in C

         <b>\b</b>   backspace, as in C

         <b>\B</b>   synonym  for <b>\</b> to help reduce backslash doubling in some applications where there are multiple
              levels of backslash processing

         <b>\c</b><u>X</u>  (where X is any character) the character whose low-order 5 bits are the same as  those  of  <u>X</u>,
              and whose other bits are all zero

         <b>\e</b>   the  character  whose  collating-sequence  name  is `<b>ESC</b>', or failing that, the character with
              octal value 033

         <b>\f</b>   formfeed, as in C

         <b>\n</b>   newline, as in C

         <b>\r</b>   carriage return, as in C

         <b>\t</b>   horizontal tab, as in C

         <b>\u</b><u>wxyz</u>
              (where <u>wxyz</u> is exactly four hexadecimal digits) the Unicode character <b>U+</b><u>wxyz</u> in the local byte
              ordering

         <b>\U</b><u>stuvwxyz</u>
              (where <u>stuvwxyz</u> is exactly eight hexadecimal digits) reserved for a somewhat-hypothetical Uni-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">code&nbsp;Unicode</font>
              code extension to 32 bits

         <b>\v</b>   vertical tab, as in C are all available.

         <b>\x</b><u>hhh</u>
              (where <u>hhh</u> is any sequence of hexadecimal digits) the character  whose  hexadecimal  value  is
              <b>0x</b><u>hhh</u> (a single character no matter how many hexadecimal digits are used).

         <b>\0</b>   the character whose value is <b>0</b>

         <b>\</b><u>xy</u>  (where  <u>xy</u> is exactly two octal digits, and is not a <u>back</u> <u>reference</u> (see below)) the character
              whose octal value is <b>0</b><u>xy</u>

         <b>\</b><u>xyz</u> (where <u>xyz</u> is exactly three octal digits, and is not a back reference (see below)) the charac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ter&nbsp;character</font>
              ter whose octal value is <b>0</b><u>xyz</u>

       Hexadecimal digits are `<b>0</b>'-`<b>9</b>', `<b>a</b>'-`<b>f</b>', and `<b>A</b>'-`<b>F</b>'.  Octal digits are `<b>0</b>'-`<b>7</b>'.

       The  character-entry  escapes  are  always  taken  as ordinary characters.  For example, <b>\135</b> is <b>]</b> in
       ASCII, but <b>\135</b> does not terminate a bracket expression.  Beware,  however,  that  some  applications
       (e.g., C compilers) interpret such sequences themselves before the regular-expression package gets to
       see them, which may require doubling (quadrupling, etc.) the `<b>\</b>'.

       Class-shorthand escapes (AREs only) provide shorthands for certain commonly-used character classes:

         <b>\d</b>        <b>[[:digit:]]</b>

         <b>\s</b>        <b>[[:space:]]</b>

         <b>\w</b>        <b>[[:alnum:]_]</b> (note underscore)

         <b>\D</b>        <b>[^[:digit:]]</b>

         <b>\S</b>        <b>[^[:space:]]</b>

         <b>\W</b>        <b>[^[:alnum:]_]</b> (note underscore)

       Within bracket expressions, `<b>\d</b>', `<b>\s</b>', and `<b>\w</b>' lose their outer brackets, and `<b>\D</b>', `<b>\S</b>', and  `<b>\W</b>'
       are  illegal.   (So,  for  example, <b>[a-c\d]</b> is equivalent to <b>[a-c[:digit:]]</b>.  Also, <b>[a-c\D]</b>, which is |
       equivalent to <b>[a-c^[:digit:]]</b>, is illegal.)

       A constraint escape (AREs only) is a constraint, matching the empty string if specific conditions are
       met, written as an escape:

         <b>\A</b>    matches  only  at the beginning of the string (see MATCHING, below, for how this differs from
               `<b>^</b>')

         <b>\m</b>    matches only at the beginning of a word

         <b>\M</b>    matches only at the end of a word

         <b>\y</b>    matches only at the beginning or end of a word

         <b>\Y</b>    matches only at a point that is not the beginning or end of a word

         <b>\Z</b>    matches only at the end of the string (see MATCHING, below, for how this differs from `<b>$</b>')

         <b>\</b><u>m</u>    (where <u>m</u> is a nonzero digit) a <u>back</u> <u>reference</u>, see below

         <b>\</b><u>mnn</u>  (where <u>m</u> is a nonzero digit, and <u>nn</u> is some more digits, and the decimal  value  <u>mnn</u>  is  not
               greater  than  the number of closing capturing parentheses seen so far) a <u>back</u> <u>reference</u>, see
               below

       A word is defined as in the specification of <b>[[:&lt;:]]</b> and <b>[[:&gt;:]]</b> above.  Constraint escapes are ille-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">gal&nbsp;illegal</font>
       gal within bracket expressions.

       A back reference (AREs only) matches the same string matched by the parenthesized subexpression spec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ified&nbsp;specified</font>
       ified by the number, so that (e.g.)  <b>([bc])\1</b> matches <b>bb</b> or <b>cc</b> but not `<b>bc</b>'.  The subexpression  must
       entirely  precede  the  back  reference in the RE.  Subexpressions are numbered in the order of their
       leading parentheses.  Non-capturing parentheses do not define subexpressions.

       There is an inherent historical ambiguity between octal character-entry escapes and back  references,
       which  is  resolved  by  heuristics,  as  hinted  at above.  A leading zero always indicates an octal
       escape.  A single non-zero digit, not followed by another digit, is always taken as a back reference.
       A  multi-digit  sequence  not  starting  with a zero is taken as a back reference if it comes after a
       suitable subexpression (i.e. the number is in the legal range for a back reference), and otherwise is
       taken as octal.

<b>METASYNTAX</b>
       In  addition  to the main syntax described above, there are some special forms and miscellaneous syn-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tactic&nbsp;syntactic</font>
       tactic facilities available.

       Normally the flavor of RE being used is specified by application-dependent means.  However, this  can
       be  overridden  by  a  <u>director</u>.  If an RE of any flavor begins with `<b>***:</b>', the rest of the RE is an
       ARE.  If an RE of any flavor begins with `<b>***=</b>', the rest of the RE is taken to be a literal  string,
       with all characters considered ordinary characters.

       An  ARE may begin with <u>embedded</u> <u>options</u>: a sequence <b>(?</b><u>xyz</u><b>)</b> (where <u>xyz</u> is one or more alphabetic char-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">acters)&nbsp;characters)</font>
       acters) specifies options affecting the rest of the RE.  These  supplement,  and  can  override,  any
       options specified by the application.  The available option letters are:

         <b>b</b>  rest of RE is a BRE

         <b>c</b>  case-sensitive matching (usual default)

         <b>e</b>  rest of RE is an ERE

         <b>i</b>  case-insensitive matching (see MATCHING, below)

         <b>m</b>  historical synonym for <b>n</b>

         <b>n</b>  newline-sensitive matching (see MATCHING, below)

         <b>p</b>  partial newline-sensitive matching (see MATCHING, below)

         <b>q</b>  rest of RE is a literal (``quoted'') string, all ordinary characters

         <b>s</b>  non-newline-sensitive matching (usual default)

         <b>t</b>  tight syntax (usual default; see below)

         <b>w</b>  inverse partial newline-sensitive (``weird'') matching (see MATCHING, below)

         <b>x</b>  expanded syntax (see below)

       Embedded options take effect at the <b>)</b> terminating the sequence.  They are available only at the start
       of an ARE, and may not be used later within it.

       In addition to the usual (<u>tight</u>) RE syntax, in which all characters  are  significant,  there  is  an
       <u>expanded</u> syntax, available in all flavors of RE with the <b>-expanded</b> switch, or in AREs with the embed-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ded&nbsp;embedded</font>
       ded x option.  In the expanded syntax, white-space characters are ignored and all characters  between
       a  <b>#</b>  and  the following newline (or the end of the RE) are ignored, permitting paragraphing and com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">menting&nbsp;commenting</font>
       menting a complex RE.  There are three exceptions to that basic rule:

         a white-space character or `<b>#</b>' preceded by `<b>\</b>' is retained

         white space or `<b>#</b>' within a bracket expression is retained

         white space and comments are illegal within multi-character symbols like the ARE `<b>(?:</b>' or  the  BRE
         `<b>\(</b>'

       Expanded-syntax white-space characters are blank, tab, newline, and any character that belongs to the |
       <u>space</u> character class.

       Finally, in an ARE, outside bracket expressions, the sequence `<b>(?#</b><u>ttt</u><b>)</b>' (where <u>ttt</u> is  any  text  not
       containing  a  `<b>)</b>') is a comment, completely ignored.  Again, this is not allowed between the charac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ters&nbsp;characters</font>
       ters of multi-character symbols like `<b>(?:</b>'.  Such comments are more a historical artifact than a use-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ful&nbsp;useful</font>
       ful facility, and their use is deprecated; use the expanded syntax instead.

       <u>None</u> of these metasyntax extensions is available if the application (or an initial <b>***=</b> director) has
       specified that the user's input be treated as a literal string rather than as an RE.

<b>MATCHING</b>
       In the event that an RE could match more than one substring of a given string, the RE matches the one
       starting  earliest  in  the  string.   If the RE could match more than one substring starting at that
       point, its choice is determined by its <u>preference</u>: either the longest substring, or the shortest.

       Most atoms, and all constraints, have no preference.  A parenthesized  RE  has  the  same  preference
       (possibly  none)  as  the RE.  A quantified atom with quantifier <b>{</b><u>m</u><b>}</b> or <b>{</b><u>m</u><b>}?</b>  has the same preference
       (possibly none) as the atom itself.  A quantified atom with other normal quantifiers (including <b>{</b><u>m</u><b>,</b><u>n</u><b>}</b>
       with  <u>m</u>  equal  to  <u>n</u>)  prefers  longest  match.  A quantified atom with other non-greedy quantifiers
       (including <b>{</b><u>m</u><b>,</b><u>n</u><b>}?</b>  with <u>m</u> equal to <u>n</u>) prefers shortest match.  A branch has the  same  preference  as
       the  first  quantified  atom  in it which has a preference.  An RE consisting of two or more branches
       connected by the <b>|</b> operator prefers longest match.

       Subject to the constraints imposed by the rules for matching the whole RE, subexpressions also  match
       the longest or shortest possible substrings, based on their preferences, with subexpressions starting
       earlier in the RE taking priority over ones starting later.  Note that outer subexpressions thus take
       priority over their component subexpressions.

       Note  that  the  quantifiers  <b>{1,1}</b> and <b>{1,1}?</b>  can be used to force longest and shortest preference,
       respectively, on a subexpression or a whole RE.

       Match lengths are measured in characters, not collating elements.   An  empty  string  is  considered
       longer  than  no  match  at  all.   For  example, <b>bb*</b> matches the three middle characters of `<b>abbbc</b>',
       <b>(week|wee)(night|knights)</b> matches all ten characters of `<b>weeknights</b>', when <b>(.*).*</b>  is matched against
       <b>abc</b>  the  parenthesized subexpression matches all three characters, and when <b>(a*)*</b> is matched against
       <b>bc</b> both the whole RE and the parenthesized subexpression match an empty string.

       If case-independent matching is specified, the effect is much as if all case  distinctions  had  van-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ished&nbsp;vanished</font>
       ished  from  the  alphabet.   When an alphabetic that exists in multiple cases appears as an ordinary
       character outside a bracket expression, it is effectively transformed into a bracket expression  con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">taining&nbsp;containing</font>
       taining  both cases, so that <b>x</b> becomes `<b>[xX]</b>'.  When it appears inside a bracket expression, all case
       counterparts of it are added to the bracket expression, so that <b>[x]</b> becomes  <b>[xX]</b>  and  <b>[^x]</b>  becomes
       `<b>[^xX]</b>'.

       If  newline-sensitive  matching is specified, <b>.</b>  and bracket expressions using <b>^</b> will never match the
       newline character (so that matches will never cross newlines unless the RE  explicitly  arranges  it)
       and  <b>^</b>  and  <b>$</b>  will  match  the empty string after and before a newline respectively, in addition to
       matching at beginning and end of string respectively.  ARE <b>\A</b> and <b>\Z</b> continue to match  beginning  or
       end of string <u>only</u>.

       If  partial  newline-sensitive matching is specified, this affects <b>.</b>  and bracket expressions as with
       newline-sensitive matching, but not <b>^</b> and `<b>$</b>'.

       If inverse partial newline-sensitive matching is specified, this affects <b>^</b> and <b>$</b> as with newline-sen-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sitive&nbsp;newline-sensitive</font>
       sitive matching, but not <b>.</b>  and bracket expressions.  This isn't very useful but is provided for sym-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">metry.&nbsp;symmetry.</font>
       metry.

<b>LIMITS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>COMPATIBILITY</b>
       No particular limit is imposed on the length of REs.  Programs intended to be highly portable  should
       not  employ  REs longer than 256 bytes, as a POSIX-compliant implementation can refuse to accept such
       REs.

       The only feature of AREs that is actually incompatible with POSIX EREs is that <b>\</b> does  not  lose  its
       special  significance inside bracket expressions.  All other ARE features use syntax which is illegal
       or has undefined or unspecified effects in POSIX EREs; the <b>***</b> syntax of directors likewise  is  out-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">side&nbsp;outside</font>
       side the POSIX syntax for both BREs and EREs.

       Many of the ARE extensions are borrowed from Perl, but some have been changed to clean them up, and a
       few Perl extensions are not present.  Incompatibilities of note include `<b>\b</b>', `<b>\B</b>', the lack of  spe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cial&nbsp;special</font>
       cial treatment for a trailing newline, the addition of complemented bracket expressions to the things
       affected by newline-sensitive matching, the restrictions on parentheses and back references in looka-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">head&nbsp;lookahead</font>
       head constraints, and the longest/shortest-match (rather than first-match) matching semantics.

       The matching rules for REs containing both normal and non-greedy quantifiers have changed since early
       beta-test versions of this package.  (The new rules are much simpler and cleaner, but don't  work  as
       hard at guessing the user's real intentions.)

       Henry  Spencer's  original 1986 <u>regexp</u> package, still in widespread use (e.g., in pre-8.1 releases of
       Tcl), implemented an early version of today's EREs.  There are four  incompatibilities  between  <u>reg</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">exp's&nbsp;regexp's</font>
       <u>exp</u>'s near-EREs (`RREs' for short) and AREs.  In roughly increasing order of significance:

              In  AREs,  <b>\</b>  followed  by an alphanumeric character is either an escape or an error, while in
              RREs, it was just another way of writing the alphanumeric.   This  should  not  be  a  problem
              because there was no reason to write such a sequence in RREs.

              <b>{</b>  followed  by  a digit in an ARE is the beginning of a bound, while in RREs, <b>{</b> was always an
              ordinary character.  Such sequences should be rare, and will often result in an error  because
              following characters will not look like a valid bound.

              In  AREs,  <b>\</b> remains a special character within `<b>[]</b>', so a literal <b>\</b> within <b>[]</b> must be written
              `<b>\\</b>'.  <b>\\</b> also gives a literal <b>\</b> within <b>[]</b> in RREs, but only truly paranoid  programmers  rou-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tinely&nbsp;routinely</font>
              tinely doubled the backslash.

              AREs  report the longest/shortest match for the RE, rather than the first found in a specified
              search order.  This may affect some RREs which were written in the expectation that the  first
              match  would be reported.  (The careful crafting of RREs to optimize the search order for fast
              matching is obsolete (AREs examine all possible matches in parallel, and their performance  is
              largely  insensitive  to  their  complexity) but cases where the search order was exploited to
              deliberately find a match which was <u>not</u> the longest/shortest will need rewriting.)


<b>BASIC</b> <b>REGULAR</b> <b>EXPRESSIONS</b>
       BREs differ from EREs in several respects.  `<b>|</b>', `<b>+</b>', and <b>?</b>  are ordinary characters and there is  no
       equivalent for their functionality.  The delimiters for bounds are <b>\{</b> and `<b>\}</b>', with <b>{</b> and <b>}</b> by them-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">selves&nbsp;themselves</font>
       selves ordinary characters.  The parentheses for nested subexpressions are <b>\(</b> and `<b>\)</b>', with <b>(</b> and  <b>)</b>
       by  themselves  ordinary characters.  <b>^</b> is an ordinary character except at the beginning of the RE or
       the beginning of a parenthesized subexpression, <b>$</b> is an ordinary character except at the end  of  the
       RE  or  the end of a parenthesized subexpression, and <b>*</b> is an ordinary character if it appears at the
       beginning of the RE or the beginning of a parenthesized subexpression (after a possible leading `<b>^</b>').
       Finally,  single-digit  back  references  are  available,  and <b>\&lt;</b> and <b>\&gt;</b> are synonyms for <b>[[:&lt;:]]</b> and
       <b>[[:&gt;:]]</b> respectively; no other escapes are available.
