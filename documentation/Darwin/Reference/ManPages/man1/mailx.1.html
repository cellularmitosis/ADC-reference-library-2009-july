<b>NAME</b>
     <b>mail</b>, <b>mailx</b> -- send and receive mail

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
     <b>mail</b> [<b>-EiInv</b>] [<b>-s</b> <u>subject</u>] [<b>-c</b> <u>cc-addr</u>] [<b>-b</b> <u>bcc-addr</u>] [<b>-F</b>] <u>to-addr</u> <u>...</u> [<b>-</b><u>sendmail-option</u> <u>...</u>]
     <b>mail</b> [<b>-EHiInNv</b>] [<b>-F</b>] <b>-f</b> [<u>name</u>]
     <b>mail</b> [<b>-EHiInNv</b>] [<b>-F</b>] [<b>-u</b> <u>user</u>]
     <b>mail</b> <b>-e</b> [<b>-f</b> <u>name</u>]
     <b>mail</b> [<b>-H</b>]

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
     The <b>mail</b> utility is an intelligent mail processing system, which has a command syntax reminiscent of
     <a href="ed.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ed">ed(1)</a> with lines replaced by messages.

     The following options are available:

     <b>-v</b>      Verbose mode.  The details of delivery are displayed on the user's terminal.

     <b>-e</b>      Test for the presence of mail in the (by default, system) mailbox.  An exit status of 0 is
             returned if it has mail; otherwise, an exit status of 1 is returned.

     <b>-H</b>      Write a header summary only.

     <b>-E</b>      Do not send messages with an empty body.  This is useful for piping errors from <a href="../man8/cron.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/cron">cron(8)</a>
             scripts.

     <b>-i</b>      Ignore tty interrupt signals.  This is particularly useful when using <b>mail</b> on noisy phone
             lines.

     <b>-I</b>      Force <b>mail</b> to run in interactive mode even when input is not a terminal.  In particular, the
             `~' special character when sending mail is only active in interactive mode.

     <b>-n</b>      Inhibit reading the system-wide <u>mail.rc</u> files upon startup.

     <b>-N</b>      Inhibit the initial display of message headers when reading mail or editing a mail folder.

     <b>-s</b> <u>subject</u>
             Specify <u>subject</u> on command line.  (Only the first argument after the <b>-s</b> flag is used as a sub-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ject;&nbsp;subject;</font>
             ject; be careful to quote subjects containing spaces.)

     <b>-c</b> <u>cc-addr</u>
             Send carbon copies to <u>cc-addr</u> list of users.  The <u>cc-addr</u> argument should be a comma-separated
             list of names.

     <b>-b</b> <u>bcc-addr</u>
             Send blind carbon copies to <u>bcc-addr</u> list of users.  The <u>bcc-addr</u> argument should be a comma-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">separated&nbsp;commaseparated</font>
             separated list of names.

     <b>-f</b> [<u>mbox</u>]
             Read in the contents of your <u>mbox</u> (or the specified file) for processing; when you <b>quit</b>, <b>mail</b>
             writes undeleted messages back to this file.

     <b>-F</b>      Record the message in a file named after the first recipient.  The name is the login-name por-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;portion</font>
             tion of the address found first on the ``To:'' line in the mail header.  Overrides the <u>record</u>
             variable, if set.

     <b>-u</b>      Is equivalent to:

                   mail -f /var/mail/user

   <b>Startup</b> <b>Actions</b>
     At startup time <b>mail</b> will execute commands in the system command files <u>/usr/share/misc/mail.rc</u>,
     <u>/usr/local/etc/mail.rc</u> and <u>/etc/mail.rc</u> in order, unless explicitly told not to by the use of the <b>-n</b>
     option.  Next, the commands in the user's personal command file <u>~/.mailrc</u> are executed.  The <b>mail</b> util-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ity&nbsp;utility</font>
     ity then examines its command line options to determine whether a new message is to be sent, or whether
     an existing mailbox is to be read.

   <b>Sending</b> <b>Mail</b>
     To send a message to one or more people, <b>mail</b> can be invoked with arguments which are the names of peo-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ple&nbsp;people</font>
     ple to whom the mail will be sent.  You are then expected to type in your message, followed by a
     &lt;control-D&gt; at the beginning of a line.  The section below <u>Replying</u> <u>To</u> <u>or</u> <u>Originating</u> <u>Mail</u>, describes
     some features of <b>mail</b> available to help you compose your letter.

   <b>Reading</b> <b>Mail</b>
     In normal usage <b>mail</b> is given no arguments and checks your mail out of the post office, then prints out
     a one line header of each message found.  The current message is initially the first message (numbered
     1) and can be printed using the <b>print</b> command (which can be abbreviated <b>p</b>).  You can move among the
     messages much as you move between lines in <a href="ed.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ed">ed(1)</a>, with the commands <b>+</b> and <b>-</b> moving backwards and for-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">wards,&nbsp;forwards,</font>
     wards, and simple numbers.

   <b>Disposing</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mail</b>
     After examining a message you can <b>delete</b> (<b>d</b>) the message or <b>reply</b> (<b>r</b>) to it.  Deletion causes the <b>mail</b>
     program to forget about the message.  This is not irreversible; the message can be <b>undeleted</b> (<b>u</b>) by
     giving its number, or the <b>mail</b> session can be aborted by giving the <b>exit</b> (<b>x</b>) command.  Deleted messages
     will, however, usually disappear never to be seen again.

   <b>Specifying</b> <b>Messages</b>
     Commands such as <b>print</b> and <b>delete</b> can be given a list of message numbers as arguments to apply to a
     number of messages at once.  Thus ``delete 1 2'' deletes messages 1 and 2, while ``delete 1-5'' deletes
     messages 1 through 5.  The special name `*' addresses all messages, and `$' addresses the last message;
     thus the command <b>top</b> which prints the first few lines of a message could be used in ``top *'' to print
     the first few lines of all messages.

   <b>Replying</b> <b>To</b> <b>or</b> <b>Originating</b> <b>Mail</b>
     You can use the <b>reply</b> command to set up a response to a message, sending it back to the person who it
     was from.  Text you then type in, up to an end-of-file, defines the contents of the message.  While you
     are composing a message, <b>mail</b> treats lines beginning with the character `~' specially.  For instance,
     typing <b>~m</b> (alone on a line) will place a copy of the current message into the response right shifting
     it by a tabstop (see <u>indentprefix</u> variable, below).  Other escapes will set up subject fields, add and
     delete recipients to the message and allow you to escape to an editor to revise the message or to a
     shell to run some commands.  (These options are given in the summary below.)

   <b>Ending</b> <b>a</b> <b>Mail</b> <b>Processing</b> <b>Session</b>
     You can end a <b>mail</b> session with the <b>quit</b> (<b>q</b>) command.  Messages which have been examined go to your
     <u>mbox</u> file unless they have been deleted in which case they are discarded.  Unexamined messages go back
     to the post office.  (See the <b>-f</b> option above).

   <b>Personal</b> <b>and</b> <b>System</b> <b>Wide</b> <b>Distribution</b> <b>Lists</b>
     It is also possible to create a personal distribution lists so that, for instance, you can send mail to
     ``cohorts'' and have it go to a group of people.  Such lists can be defined by placing a line like

           alias cohorts bill ozalp jkf mark kridle@ucbcory

     in the file <u>.mailrc</u> in your home directory.  The current list of such aliases can be displayed with the
     <b>alias</b> command in <b>mail</b>.  System wide distribution lists can be created by editing <u>/etc/mail/aliases</u>, see
     <a href="../man5/aliases.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/aliases">aliases(5)</a> and <!-- a -->sendmail(8)<!-- /a -->; these are kept in a different syntax.  In mail you send, personal aliases
     will be expanded in mail sent to others so that they will be able to <b>reply</b> to the recipients.  System
     wide aliases are not expanded when the mail is sent, but any reply returned to the machine will have
     the system wide alias expanded as all mail goes through <!-- a -->sendmail(8)<!-- /a -->.

   <b>Network</b> <b>Mail</b> <b>(ARPA,</b> <b>UUCP,</b> <b>Berknet)</b>
     See <a href="../man7/mailaddr.7.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/7/mailaddr">mailaddr(7)</a> for a description of network addresses.

     The <b>mail</b> utility has a number of options which can be set in the <u>.mailrc</u> file to alter its behavior;
     thus ``set askcc'' enables the <u>askcc</u> feature.  (These options are summarized below.)

<b>SUMMARY</b>
     (Adapted from the <u>Mail</u> <u>Reference</u> <u>Manual</u>.)

     Each command is typed on a line by itself, and may take arguments following the command word.  The com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
     mand need not be typed in its entirety -- the first command which matches the typed prefix is used.
     For commands which take message lists as arguments, if no message list is given, then the next message
     forward which satisfies the command's requirements is used.  If there are no messages forward of the
     current message, the search proceeds backwards, and if there are no good messages at all, <b>mail</b> types
     ``No applicable messages'' and aborts the command.

     <b>-</b>       Print out the preceding message.  If given a numeric argument <u>n</u>, goes to the <u>n</u>'th previous mes-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sage&nbsp;message</font>
             sage and prints it.

     <b>#</b>       ignore the remainder of the line as a comment.

     <b>?</b>       Prints a brief summary of commands.

     <b>!</b>       Executes the shell (see <a href="sh.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/sh">sh(1)</a> and <a href="csh.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/csh">csh(1)</a>) command which follows.

     <b>Print</b>   (<b>P</b>) Like <b>print</b> but also prints out ignored header fields.  See also <b>print</b>, <b>ignore</b> and <b>retain</b>.

     <b>Reply</b>   (<b>R</b>) Reply to originator.  Does not reply to other recipients of the original message.

     <b>Type</b>    (<b>T</b>) Identical to the <b>Print</b> command.

     <b>alias</b>   (<b>a</b>) With no arguments, prints out all currently-defined aliases.  With one argument, prints out
             that alias.  With more than one argument, creates a new alias or changes an old one.

     <b>alternates</b>
             (<b>alt</b>) The <b>alternates</b> command is useful if you have accounts on several machines.  It can be
             used to inform <b>mail</b> that the listed addresses are really you.  When you <b>reply</b> to messages, <b>mail</b>
             will not send a copy of the message to any of the addresses listed on the <b>alternates</b> list.  If
             the <b>alternates</b> command is given with no argument, the current set of alternative names is dis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">played.&nbsp;displayed.</font>
             played.

     <b>chdir</b>   (<b>c</b>) Changes the user's working directory to that specified, if given.  If no directory is
             given, then changes to the user's login directory.

     <b>copy</b>    (<b>co</b>) The <b>copy</b> command does the same thing that <b>save</b> does, except that it does not mark the mes-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sages&nbsp;messages</font>
             sages it is used on for deletion when you <b>quit</b>.

     <b>delete</b>  (<b>d</b>) Takes a list of messages as argument and marks them all as deleted.  Deleted messages will
             not be saved in <u>mbox</u>, nor will they be available for most other commands.

     <b>dp</b>      (also <b>dt</b>) Deletes the current message and prints the next message.  If there is no next mes-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sage,&nbsp;message,</font>
             sage, <b>mail</b> says ``at EOF''.

     <b>edit</b>    (<b>e</b>) Takes a list of messages and points the text editor at each one in turn.  On return from
             the editor, the message is read back in.

     <b>exit</b>    (<b>ex</b> or <b>x</b>) Effects an immediate return to the shell without modifying the user's system mailbox,
             his <u>mbox</u> file, or his edit file in <b>-f</b>.

     <b>file</b>    (<b>fi</b>) The same as <b>folder</b>.

     <b>folders</b>
             List the names of the folders in your folder directory.

     <b>folder</b>  (<b>fo</b>) The <b>folder</b> command switches to a new mail file or folder.  With no arguments, it tells you
             which file you are currently reading.  If you give it an argument, it will write out changes
             (such as deletions) you have made in the current file and read in the new file.  Some special
             conventions are recognized for the name.  `#' means the previous file, `%' means your system
             mailbox, ``%<u>user</u>'' means user's system mailbox, `&amp;' means your <u>mbox</u> file, and ``+<u>folder</u>'' means
             a file in your folder directory.

     <b>from</b>    (<b>f</b>) Takes a list of messages and prints their message headers.

     <b>headers</b>
             (<b>h</b>) Lists the current range of headers, which is an 18-message group.  If a `+' argument is
             given, then the next 18-message group is printed, and if a `-' argument is given, the previous
             18-message group is printed.

     <b>help</b>    A synonym for <b>?</b>.

     <b>hold</b>    (<b>ho</b>, also <b>preserve</b>) Takes a message list and marks each message therein to be saved in the
             user's system mailbox instead of in <u>mbox</u>.  Does not override the <b>delete</b> command.

     <b>ignore</b>  Add the list of header fields named to the <u>ignored</u> <u>list</u>.  Header fields in the ignore list are
             not printed on your terminal when you print a message.  This command is very handy for suppres-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion&nbsp;suppression</font>
             sion of certain machine-generated header fields.  The <b>Type</b> and <b>Print</b> commands can be used to
             print a message in its entirety, including ignored fields.  If <b>ignore</b> is executed with no argu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ments,&nbsp;arguments,</font>
             ments, it lists the current set of ignored fields.

     <b>inc</b>     Incorporate any new messages that have arrived while mail is being read.  The new messages are
             added to the end of the message list, and the current message is reset to be the first new mail
             message.  This does not renumber the existing message list, nor does it cause any changes made
             so far to be saved.

     <b>mail</b>    (<b>m</b>) Takes as argument login names and distribution group names and sends mail to those people.

     <b>mbox</b>    Indicate that a list of messages be sent to <u>mbox</u> in your home directory when you quit.  This is
             the default action for messages if you do <u>not</u> have the <b>hold</b> option set.

     <b>more</b>    (<b>mo</b>) Takes a list of messages and invokes the pager on that list.

     <b>next</b>    (<b>n</b>, like <b>+</b> or CR) Goes to the next message in sequence and types it.  With an argument list,
             types the next matching message.

     <b>preserve</b>
             (<b>pre</b>) A synonym for <b>hold</b>.

     <b>print</b>   (<b>p</b>) Takes a message list and types out each message on the user's terminal.

     <b>quit</b>    (<b>q</b>) Terminates the session, saving all undeleted, unsaved messages in the user's <u>mbox</u> file in
             his login directory, preserving all messages marked with <b>hold</b> or <b>preserve</b> or never referenced
             in his system mailbox, and removing all other messages from his system mailbox.  If new mail
             has arrived during the session, the message ``You have new mail'' is given.  If given while
             editing a mailbox file with the <b>-f</b> flag, then the edit file is rewritten.  A return to the
             shell is effected, unless the rewrite of edit file fails, in which case the user can escape
             with the <b>exit</b> command.

     <b>reply</b>   (<b>r</b>) Takes a message list and sends mail to the sender and all recipients of the specified mes-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sage.&nbsp;message.</font>
             sage.  The default message must not be deleted.

     <b>respond</b>
             A synonym for <b>reply</b>.

     <b>retain</b>  Add the list of header fields named to the <u>retained</u> <u>list</u>.  Only the header fields in the
             retained list are shown on your terminal when you print a message.  All other header fields are
             suppressed.  The <b>type</b> and <b>print</b> commands can be used to print a message in its entirety.  If
             <b>retain</b> is executed with no arguments, it lists the current set of retained fields.

     <b>save</b>    (<b>s</b>) Takes a message list and a filename and appends each message in turn to the end of the
             file.  The filename in quotes, followed by the line count and character count is echoed on the
             user's terminal.

     <b>set</b>     (<b>se</b>) With no arguments, prints all variable values.  Otherwise, sets option.  Arguments are of
             the form <u>option</u>=<u>value</u> (no space before or after `=') or <u>option</u>.  Quotation marks may be placed
             around any part of the assignment statement to quote blanks or tabs, i.e. ``set
             indentprefix="-&gt;"''

     <b>saveignore</b>
             <b>Saveignore</b> is to <b>save</b> what <b>ignore</b> is to <b>print</b> and <b>type</b>.  Header fields thus marked are filtered
             out when saving a message by <b>save</b> or when automatically saving to <u>mbox</u>.

     <b>saveretain</b>
             <b>Saveretain</b> is to <b>save</b> what <b>retain</b> is to <b>print</b> and <b>type</b>.  Header fields thus marked are the only
             ones saved with a message when saving by <b>save</b> or when automatically saving to <u>mbox</u>.  <b>Saveretain</b>
             overrides <b>saveignore</b>.

     <b>shell</b>   (<b>sh</b>) Invokes an interactive version of the shell.

     <b>size</b>    Takes a message list and prints out the size in characters of each message.

     <b>source</b>  The <b>source</b> command reads commands from a file.

     <b>top</b>     Takes a message list and prints the top few lines of each.  The number of lines printed is con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">trolled&nbsp;controlled</font>
             trolled by the variable <u>toplines</u> and defaults to 5.

     <b>type</b>    (<b>t</b>) A synonym for <b>print</b>.

     <b>unalias</b>
             Takes a list of names defined by <b>alias</b> commands and discards the remembered groups of users.
             The group names no longer have any significance.

     <b>undelete</b>
             (<b>u</b>) Takes a message list and marks each message as <u>not</u> being deleted.

     <b>unread</b>  (<b>U</b>) Takes a message list and marks each message as <u>not</u> having been read.

     <b>unset</b>   Takes a list of option names and discards their remembered values; the inverse of <b>set</b>.

     <b>visual</b>  (<b>v</b>) Takes a message list and invokes the display editor on each message.

     <b>write</b>   (<b>w</b>) Similar to <b>save</b>, except that <u>only</u> the message body (<u>without</u> the header) is saved.
             Extremely useful for such tasks as sending and receiving source program text over the message
             system.

     <b>xit</b>     (<b>x</b>) A synonym for <b>exit</b>.

     <b>z</b>       The <b>mail</b> utility presents message headers in windowfuls as described under the <b>headers</b> command.
             You can move <b>mail</b>'s attention forward to the next window with the <b>z</b> command.  Also, you can
             move to the previous window by using <b>z-</b>.

   <b>Tilde/Escapes</b>
     Here is a summary of the tilde escapes, which are used when composing messages to perform special func-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tions.&nbsp;functions.</font>
     tions.  Tilde escapes are only recognized at the beginning of lines.  The name ``tilde escape'' is
     somewhat of a misnomer since the actual escape character can be set by the option <u>escape</u>.

     <b>~a</b>      Inserts the autograph string from the sign= option into the message.

     <b>~A</b>      Inserts the autograph string from the Sign= option into the message.

     <b>~b</b> <u>name</u> <u>...</u>
             Add the given names to the list of carbon copy recipients but do not make the names visible in
             the Cc: line (``blind'' carbon copy).

     <b>~c</b> <u>name</u> <u>...</u>
             Add the given names to the list of carbon copy recipients.

     <b>~d</b>      Read the file <u>dead.letter</u> from your home directory into the message.

     <b>~e</b>      Invoke the text editor on the message collected so far.  After the editing session is finished,
             you may continue appending text to the message.

     <b>~f</b> <u>messages</u>
             Read the named messages into the message being sent.  If no messages are specified, read in the
             current message.  Message headers currently being ignored (by the <b>ignore</b> or <b>retain</b> command) are
             not included.

     <b>~F</b> <u>messages</u>
             Identical to <b>~f</b>, except all message headers are included.

     <b>~h</b>      Edit the message header fields by typing each one in turn and allowing the user to append text
             to the end or modify the field by using the current terminal erase and kill characters.

     <b>~i</b> <u>string</u>
             Inserts the value of the named option into the text of the message.

     <b>~m</b> <u>messages</u>
             Read the named messages into the message being sent, indented by a tab or by the value of
             <u>indentprefix</u>.  If no messages are specified, read the current message.  Message headers cur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rently&nbsp;currently</font>
             rently being ignored (by the <b>ignore</b> or <b>retain</b> command) are not included.

     <b>~M</b> <u>messages</u>
             Identical to <b>~m</b>, except all message headers are included.

     <b>~p</b>      Print out the message collected so far, prefaced by the message header fields.

     <b>~q</b>      Abort the message being sent, copying the message to <u>dead.letter</u> in your home directory if <u>save</u>
             is set.

     <b>~r</b> <u>filename</u>, <b>~r</b> !<u>command</u>

     <b>~&lt;</b> <u>filename</u>, <b>~&lt;</b> !<u>command</u>
             Read the named file into the message.  If the argument begins with a `!', the rest of the
             string is taken as an arbitrary system command and is executed, with the standard output
             inserted into the message.

     <b>~R</b> <u>string</u>
             Use <u>string</u> as the Reply-To field.

     <b>~s</b> <u>string</u>
             Cause the named string to become the current subject field.

     <b>~t</b> <u>name</u> <u>...</u>
             Add the given names to the direct recipient list.

     <b>~v</b>      Invoke an alternative editor (defined by the VISUAL environment variable) on the message col-
             lected so far.  Usually, the alternative editor will be a screen editor.  After you quit the
             editor, you may resume appending text to the end of your message.

     <b>~w</b> <u>filename</u>
             Write the message onto the named file.

     <b>~x</b>      Exits as with <b>~q</b>, except the message is not saved in <u>dead.letter</u>.

     <b>~!</b> <u>command</u>
             Execute the indicated shell command, then return to the message.

     <b>~|</b> <u>command</u>, <b>~^</b> <u>command</u>
             Pipe the message through the command as a filter.  If the command gives no output or terminates
             abnormally, retain the original text of the message.  The command <a href="fmt.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/fmt">fmt(1)</a> is often used as
             <u>command</u> to rejustify the message.

     <b>~:</b> <u>mail-command</u>, <b>~_</b> <u>mail-command</u>
             Execute the given <b>mail</b> command.  Not all commands, however, are allowed.

     <b>~.</b>      Simulate end-of-file on input.

     <b>~?</b>      Print a summary of the available command escapes.

     <b>~~</b> <u>string</u>
             Insert the string of text in the message prefaced by a single `~'.  If you have changed the
             escape character, then you should double that character in order to send it.

   <b>Mail</b> <b>Options</b>
     Options can be set with the <b>set</b> command and can be disabled with the <b>unset</b> or <b>set</b> <b>no</b><u>name</u> commands.
     Options may be either binary, in which case it is only significant to see whether they are set or not;
     or string, in which case the actual value is of interest.  If an option is not set, <b>mail</b> will look for
     an environment variable of the same name.  The available options include the following:

     <u>append</u>  Causes messages saved in <u>mbox</u> to be appended to the end rather than prepended.  This should
             always be set (preferably in one of the system-wide <u>mail.rc</u> files).  Default is <u>noappend</u>.

     <u>ask</u>, <u>asksub</u>
             Causes <b>mail</b> to prompt you for the subject of each message you send.  If you respond with simply
             a newline, no subject field will be sent.  Default is <u>asksub</u>.

     <u>askbcc</u>  Causes you to be prompted for additional blind carbon copy recipients at the end of each mes-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sage.&nbsp;message.</font>
             sage.  Responding with a newline indicates your satisfaction with the current list.  Default is
             <u>noaskbcc</u>.

     <u>askcc</u>   Causes you to be prompted for additional carbon copy recipients at the end of each message.
             Responding with a newline indicates your satisfaction with the current list.  Default is
             <u>noaskcc</u>.

     <u>autoinc</u>
             Causes new mail to be automatically incorporated when it arrives.  Setting this is similar to
             issuing the <b>inc</b> command at each prompt, except that the current message is not reset when new
             mail arrives.  Default is <u>noautoinc</u>.

     <u>autoprint</u>
             Causes the <b>delete</b> command to behave like <b>dp</b>; thus, after deleting a message, the next one will
             be typed automatically.  Default is <u>noautoprint</u>.

     <u>crt</u>     The valued option <u>crt</u> is used as a threshold to determine how long a message must be before
             PAGER is used to read it.  If <u>crt</u> is set without a value, then the height of the terminal
             screen stored in the system is used to compute the threshold (see <a href="stty.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/stty">stty(1)</a>).  Default is <u>nocrt</u>.

     <u>debug</u>   Setting the binary option <u>debug</u> is the same as specifying <b>-d</b> on the command line and causes
             <b>mail</b> to output all sorts of information useful for debugging <b>mail</b>.  Default is <u>nodebug</u>.

     <u>dot</u>     The binary option <u>dot</u> causes <b>mail</b> to interpret a period alone on a line as the terminator of a
             message you are sending.  Default is <u>nodot</u>.

     <u>escape</u>  If defined, the first character of this option gives the character to use in place of `~' to
             denote escapes.

     <u>flipr</u>   Reverses the sense of <b>reply</b> and <b>Reply</b> commands.  Default is <u>noflipr</u>.

     <u>folder</u>  The name of the directory to use for storing folders of messages.  If this name begins with a
             `/', <b>mail</b> considers it to be an absolute pathname; otherwise, the folder directory is found
             relative to your home directory.

     <u>header</u>  If defined, initially display message headers when reading mail or editing a mail folder.
             Default is <u>header</u>.  This option can be disabled by giving the <b>-N</b> flag on the command line.

     <u>hold</u>    This option is used to hold messages in the system mailbox by default.  Default is <u>nohold</u>.

     <u>ignore</u>  Causes interrupt signals from your terminal to be ignored and echoed as @'s. Default is
             <u>noignore</u>.

     <u>ignoreeof</u>
             An option related to <u>dot</u> is <u>ignoreeof</u> which makes <b>mail</b> refuse to accept a &lt;control-D&gt; as the
             end of a message.  <u>Ignoreeof</u> also applies to <b>mail</b> command mode.  Default is <u>noignoreeof</u>.

     <u>indentprefix</u>
             String used by the <b>~m</b> tilde escape for indenting messages, in place of the normal tab character
             (^I).  Be sure to quote the value if it contains spaces or tabs.

     <u>metoo</u>   Usually, when a group is expanded that contains the sender, the sender is removed from the
             expansion.  Setting this option causes the sender to be included in the group.  Default is
             <u>nometoo</u>.

     <u>quiet</u>   Suppresses the printing of the version when first invoked.  Default is <u>noquiet</u>.

     <u>record</u>  If defined, gives the pathname of the file used to record all outgoing mail.  If not defined,
             outgoing mail is not saved.  Default is <u>norecord</u>.

     <u>Replyall</u>
             Reverses the sense of <b>reply</b> and <b>Reply</b> commands.  Default is <u>noReplyall</u>.

     <u>save</u>    If this option is set, and you abort a message with two RUBOUT (erase or delete), <b>mail</b> will
             copy the partial letter to the file <u>dead.letter</u> in your home directory.  Default is <u>save</u>.

     <u>searchheaders</u>
             If this option is set, then a message-list specifier in the form ``/<u>x</u>:<u>y</u>'' will expand to all
             messages containing the substring <u>y</u> in the header field <u>x</u>.  The string search is case insensi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tive.&nbsp;insensitive.</font>
             tive.  If <u>x</u> is omitted, it will default to the ``Subject'' header field.  The form ``/to:<u>y</u>'' is
             a special case, and will expand to all messages containing the substring <u>y</u> in the ``To'',
             ``Cc'' or ``Bcc'' header fields.  The check for "to" is case sensitive, so that ``/To:<u>y</u>'' can
             be used to limit the search for <u>y</u> to just the ``To:'' field.  Default is <u>nosearchheaders</u>.

     <u>toplines</u>
             If defined, gives the number of lines of a message to be printed out with the <b>top</b> command; nor-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mally,&nbsp;normally,</font>
             mally, the first five lines are printed.

     <u>verbose</u>
             Setting the option <u>verbose</u> is the same as using the <b>-v</b> flag on the command line.  When <b>mail</b>
             runs in verbose mode, the actual delivery of messages is displayed on the user's terminal.
             Default is <u>noverbose</u>.

<b>ENVIRONMENT</b>
     DEAD     Pathname of the file to save partial messages to in case of interrupts or delivery errors.
              Default is <u>~/dead.letter</u>.

     EDITOR   Pathname of the text editor to use in the <b>edit</b> command and <b>~e</b> escape.  If not defined, then a
              default editor is used.

     HOME     Pathname of the user's home directory.

     LISTER   Pathname of the directory lister to use in the <b>folders</b> command.  Default is <u>/bin/ls</u>.

     MAIL     Location of the user's mailbox.  Default is <u>/var/mail</u>.

     MAILRC   Pathname of file containing initial <b>mail</b> commands.  Default is <u>~/.mailrc</u>.

     MBOX     The name of the mailbox file.  It can be the name of a folder.  The default is <u>mbox</u> in the
              user's home directory.

     PAGER    Pathname of the program to use in the <b>more</b> command or when <u>crt</u> variable is set.  The default
              paginator <a href="more.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/more">more(1)</a> is used if this option is not defined.

     REPLYTO  If set, will be used to initialize the Reply-To field for outgoing messages.

     SHELL    Pathname of the shell to use in the <b>!</b> command and the <b>~!</b> escape.  A default shell is used if
              this option is not defined.

     VISUAL   Pathname of the text editor to use in the <b>visual</b> command and <b>~v</b> escape.

     USER     Login name of the user executing mail.

<b>FILES</b>
     /var/mail/*                 Post office.
     ~/mbox                      User's old mail.
     ~/.mailrc                   File giving initial <b>mail</b> commands.  This can be overridden by setting the
                                 MAILRC environment variable.
     /tmp/R*                     Temporary files.
     /usr/share/misc/mail.*help  Help files.

     /usr/share/misc/mail.rc
     /usr/local/etc/mail.rc
     /etc/mail.rc                System-wide initialization files.  Each file will be sourced, in order, if
                                 it exists.

     <u>The</u> <u>Mail</u> <u>Reference</u> <u>Manual</u>.

<b>HISTORY</b>
     A <b>mail</b> command appeared in Version 1 AT&amp;T UNIX.  This man page is derived from <u>The</u> <u>Mail</u> <u>Reference</u>
     <u>Manual</u> originally written by Kurt Shoens.

<b>BUGS</b>
     There are some flags that are not documented here.  Most are not useful to the general user.

     Usually, <b>mail</b> is just a link to <b>Mail</b> and <b>mailx</b>, which can be confusing.

     The name of the <b>alternates</b> list is incorrect English (it should be ``alternatives''), but is retained
     for compatibility.
