README - QTMovieFromProcsQuickTime 3.0 provides functions that allow you to create a movie using data supplied by one  or more application-defined procedures. In particular, you use the function MovieExportAddDataSource to add a track-generating procedure and you use the function MovieExportFromProceduresToDataRef to do the actual movie exporting.In this example, we will create a QuickTime movie with a video track and an audio track; we generate the video track by drawing a series of individual frames, and we generate the audio track by generating 10 seconds of silence.Enjoy,QuickTime Team
