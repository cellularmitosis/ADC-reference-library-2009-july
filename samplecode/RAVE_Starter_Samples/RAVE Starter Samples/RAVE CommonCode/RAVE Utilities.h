/*	File:		RAVE Utilities.h	Contains:	RAVE Utilities defines a number of useful functions for working with RAVE,				including functions to find the deepest GDevice, loading textures from a PICT				resource, and so on. Essentially, it defines a number of pieces of common code				that were useful to many of my projects.	Written by: Timothy Carroll		Copyright:	Copyright © 1998-1999 by Apple Computer, Inc., All Rights Reserved.				You may incorporate this Apple sample source code into your program(s) without				restriction.

Most of the3D math routines use these lookups to generate matrices.*****************************************************************************/extern float gSinArray[721]; // [720] = [0]extern float gCosArray[721]; // [720] = [0]OSStatus InitializeLookups(void);/*****************************************************************************RAVE ENGINE FUNCTIONS	FindTextureMappingEngine walks the list of available engines and returnsthe first engine capable of Texture Mapping.GetListOfEngines creates a handle filled with references to all enginesavailable to the application.	*****************************************************************************/TQAEngine	*FindTextureMappingEngine (TQADevice *device);OSStatus	GetListOfEngines (GDHandle screen, Handle *list, long *number);/*****************************************************************************TEXTURESLoadTextureFromPictResource loads a PICT resource, draws it into an offscreenGWorld, creates a RAVE texture, and then detaches it so that the engine isresponsible for managing it.  Complete texture management code would probablywant to make sure that the textures are also available as a GWorld, so thatthey can be quickly loaded and unloaded from the card.*****************************************************************************/TQATexture	*LoadTextureFromPictResource (TQAEngine *engine, short pictID);#endif _RAVEUTILITIES_
