AEObject-Edition SampleThe Edition Manager sample has been subsumed for the greater good into thisAEObject-Edition sample.¥ What's this sample for?This sample demonstrates how to use the Edition Manager and the Apple Event Manager,as well as some features of the AE Object Model and the AE Object Support Library.¥ What does this sample include?This sample incorporates some basic AppleEvent Object Model functionality, at this time the GetData and SetData Core AppleEvent using the AppleEvent Object Model for specifying and transfering the data.Besides accepting the Get and Set events, this sample will alsosend these events to other applications, I've tested it primarily with the AEQuill sample, so you can bounce it off your samples.The objects are not fully modifiable by this sample, I have reduced functionality in some cases to maintain clarity.  As always, please use this sample as a starting point.You can publish and subscribe to PICT and TEXT data from this sample.This sample also includes code that implements the CreatePublisher event.¥ How does it work?This is a very simple multi-window object drawing and text editing sample.Use the tools menu to select objects, and create them in the windows.Use the selections under the AppleEvents menu to specify AE objects, and send events to yourself and other applications.Use the selection tool to select graphic areas to publish, or the arrowcursor to select text to publish.¥ What else will there be?Future growth will include more of the Core events, and more object classes.Also, I will be adding a custom Edition Opener at some time.¥ Where do I send comments?Send any comments on this sample to me at AppleLink C.K.HAUN.  Send your specific questions about AppleEvents and the Edition Managerto MacDTS.¥ Who is Fred, anyway?If you have to ask, you'll never know.
