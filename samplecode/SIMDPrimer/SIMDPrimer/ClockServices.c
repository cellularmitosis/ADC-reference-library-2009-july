/*  ConsumeCPUCycles keeps the CPU busy for a while.  The intent is to
    execute a loop that consumes a known number of CPU cycles, so the
    time taken can be compared to time reported by other time-measuring
    facilities, such as the time-base registers.

    For example, something like the following might happen if the time-base
    registers are being used:

        Call this routine with 1 for iterations so that all instructions
        and data are loaded into cache.
        
        Call this routine with 2 for iterations and record the time-base
        registers before and after that call.  Let m0 be the difference.

        Call this routine with 1002 for iterations and record the time-base
        registers before and after that call.  Let m1 be the difference.

        m1-m0 is the number of ticks of the time base registers that 1000
        iterations takes.  Suppose, for example only, this is 296.

        This routine returns a value in *CPUCyclesPerIteration.  1000 times
        that value is the number of CPU cycles that 1000 iterations takes.
        Suppose this is 16,000.

        In this example, the measurements would show there are about 54
        (16,000 / 296) CPU cycles per tick of the time-base registers.

    Input:

        unsigned int iterations
            The number of iterations to execute.

        unsigned int *CPUCyclesPerIteration
            Address of one unsigned int to be used for output.

    Output:

        None.

    When measuring, this routine should be called three times:

        Once with a small number of iterations to load all instructions
        and data into cache.  (One iteration might be sufficient.)

        Once with a small number of iterations to measure overhead.  (Two
        iterations is might be a good choice to allow for the first time
        the loop branches back being different from subsequent times.)

        Once with a large number of iterations to measure the loop.

    The difference between execution times of the last two calls should be
    used.

    Interrupts should be disabled while the three calls are performed.  If
    that is not possible, the sequence of three calls should be restarted
    if an interrupt occurs.
