/*	File:		ScaleAndRotate.c		Description: This example uses graphics importers to draw an image then demonstrates	             how to perform scaling, rotation and perspective manipulation using matrix	             operations.	             Test Sample Image : Sample 1-Snowgum.jpg	Author:		QuickTime Engineering, DTS	Copyright: 	© Copyright 1999 - 2002 Apple Computer, Inc.
