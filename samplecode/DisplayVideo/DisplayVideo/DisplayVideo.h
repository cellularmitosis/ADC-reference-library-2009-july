/*	File:		DisplayVideo.h		Description:DisplayVideo will display all info about all video modes supported				by each installed video card with their attached monitor. The purpose				of this code is to provide a sample of how developers can discover the				bit depths and timings of multisync displays.	Author:		EWA	Copyright: 	Copyright: © 1995-1999 by Apple Computer, Inc.				all rights reserved.		Disclaimer:	You may incorporate this sample code into your applications without				restriction, though the sample code has been provided "AS IS" and the				responsibility for its operation is 100% yours.
