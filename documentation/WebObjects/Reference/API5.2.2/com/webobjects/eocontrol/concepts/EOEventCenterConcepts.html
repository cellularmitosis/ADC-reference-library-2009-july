  <h2>WOEventSetup page</h2><hr>
  The page used to set up the logging properties is accessed through a
  direct action named "WOEventSetup". So for example, WOEventSetup page
  can be accessed for an application named "MyApp" with a URL such as the
  following:<p>
  http://myhost:aPort/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MyApp.woa/wa/WOEventSetup<P>
  On the WOEventSetup page, you can see all families of events that are
  registered for the application. Since the event classes are registered
  dynamically as the program executes, it is a good idea to "warm up" an
  application before accessing WOEventSetup.<P>
  The page lists the registered event classes, their subcategories, and a
  description of the kinds of events that can be logged. For instance, the
  EOEditingContext event class logs events for the <b>saveChanges</b> and
  <b>objectsWithFetchSpecification</b> methods. Logging for each class can
  be enabled and disabled with the corresponding check box; it isn't
  possible to disable individual subcategories of an event class.<P>
  The logging mechanism is extremely fast and memory efficient. A standard
  300MHz G3 can log more than 300,000 events per second, so event logging
  overhead is negligible compared to the time required to generate dynamic
  web pages.<P>
  <B>User Defaults</B><hr>
  In addition to the configuration you can do on the WOEventSetup page, the
  event logging system uses user defaults to additionally configure event
  logging behavior. The user defaults are:<P>
  <ul>
  <li><b>EOEventLoggingEnabled</b>,a boolean value that specifies whether
  or not to log registered event classes by default.</li>
  <li><b>EOEventLoggingLimit</b>,an integer value that specifies the number
  of events to log before suspending logging.</li>
  </ul><p>
  <b>WOEventDisplay page</b><hr>
  The page that displays collected events, WOEventDisplay, is also accessed
  through a direct action. For example, WOEventSetup page can be  accessed
  for an application named "MyApp" with a URL such as the following:<P>
  http://myhost:aPort/cgi bin/WebObjects/MyApp.woa/wa/WOEventDisplay<P>
  On this page, events can be viewed in four different ways:<P>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Raw root events</B>. In this view, all events at the root level
  (events without an encompassing event) are displayed. WOEventDisplay shows
  each event individually, which means that it's possible for an event to
  appear multiple times if the thread of execution crossed its point more
  than once.</li>
  <li><b>Aggregated root events</b>. This view is similar to the raw root
  event view, except that multiple identical events are aggregated, and
  their combined time is displayed. In addition, the "Calls" column shows
  how many times an event was executed (in other words, how many events
  contributed to the displayed aggregate event).</li>
  <li><b>Events grouped by page and component</b>. In this view, the first
  level of display shows only page names. By expanding a page, you can get a
  list of components in that page. Expanding a component shows all the
  events within that component. This means that even events which were
  collected "deep" within a component are shown immediately below the
  component name. All identical events are aggregated as in the aggregated
  root event view for easier reading. It's possible to traverse the
  component event hierarchy by expanding the hyperlinks within a component.
  <P>
  Note that since a page is also a component, a page with no dynamic
  subcomponents seems as if it's nested one level too deep. This is the
  correct behavior.</li>
  <li><b>Events grouped by page only</b>. This display is similar to the
  grouped by page and component view, except the events do not have a
  by component subgrouping.</li>
  </ul><P>
  In any of these displays, if an event or event group has subevents, it can
  be expanded by clicking the hyperlink or triangle image.<P>
  Each view orders events by duration (in milliseconds) from the longest to
  the shortest. Aggregation induces rounding errors, which are a maximum of
  1ms per event. In other words, an aggregate event consisting of ten events
  has at most 1 ms deviation from the actual run time; however, manually
  adding ten individual events as displayed in the table might have up to a
  10 ms deviation. Therefore, any displayed sum is always more accurate than
  adding up the durations of individual events. Also note that the sub
  events of an event branch doesn't necessarily add up to the duration of
  the branch event the branch event's duration might be larger. This because
  the parent event generally consists of more than just calling the methods
  causing the sub events.<P>
  <b>Custom Event Logging</B><hr>
  To define and log custom events, an event class can be created, event's
  categories and subcategories can be defined, the event class can be
  registered with the WOEvent center, and you can instrument the portions
  of code you wants to log. This section describes these steps.<P>
  To create a custom event:<P>
  <ol>
  <li>Create a subclass of EOEvent or an appropriate subclass.<p>
  For example, to log events for a custom adaptor , say
  MyAdaptor, create an EOEvent subclass named MyAdaptorEvent.  subclass
  doesn't usually have to override any of the inherited methods, but you can
  customize the default behavior.</li>
  <li>Create a description file for the event and add it to project's
  Resources folder.<P>
  An event's description file defines the event categories and subcategories
  used in the WOEventDisplay page. The file's contents is a dictionary in
  plist format. For the MyAdaptorEvent class, the file's name is
  <code>MyAdaptorEvent.description</code> , and it might look like the following:<P>
  <code>
  <blockquote><pre>
  {
  EOEventGroupName ="MyAdaptor Event ";
  connect ="Connect ";
  openChannel ="Open Channel ";
  evaluateExpression ="Evaluate Expression ";
  fetchRow ="Fetch Row ";
  commitTransaction ="Commit Transaction ";
  }
  </pre></blockquote>
  </code></li>
  <li>Register the event class with the EOEventCenter.<p>
  Typically you can register an event class in the <em>static</em> constructor
  of the class whose code you are instrumenting MyAdaptor in this example.<p>
  <code>
  <blockquote><pre>
   public static class MyAdaptorEvent extends EOEvent {

        protected static final String Connect = "connect";
        protected static final String OpenChannel = "openChannel";
        // etc.

        public CustomEvent() {
            super();
        }

        public CustomEvent(String type) {
            super();
            setType(type);
        }
    }

    public static class MyAdaptorEventLoggingEnabler extends Object implements EOEventCenter.EventRecordingHandler {
        public void setLoggingEnabled(boolean isLogging, Class aClass) {
            _IsEventLoggingEnabled = isLogging;
        }
    }

  
  static {
	EOEventCenter.registerEventClass(MyAdaptorEvent.class, new MyAdaptorEventLoggingEnabler());
  }
  
  </pre></blockquote>
  </code><p>
  As in this example, you might want to define string constants for the keys
  in the event's description dictionary.</li><p>
  <li>Instrument the methods.<p>
  In any method you want to instrument, following code to be added,
  substituting the appropriate event key. This code instruments the
  "connect" event of MyAdaptorEvent.<p>
  <code>
  <blockquote><pre>
	EOEvent e = null;

  //Setup and start logging
	if (_IsEventLoggingEnabled) {
		e = new MyAdaptorEvent(MyAdaptorEvent.OpenChannel);
		EOEventCenter.markStartOfEvent(e, "openChannel()");
	}


  //Code to be timed goes here.
  
  //Finish logging.
	if (e != null) {
		EOEventCenter.markEndOfEvent(e);
	}

  </pre></blockquote>
  </code><p>
  The second argument to <b>newEventOfClass</b> is an event key
  corresponding with an entry in the <code>.description</code> file. The
  corresponding value is used in the Title column of the WOEventDisplay page.
  If the argument isn't a key in the description dictionary,
  <b>newEventOfClass</b> uses the argument instead.<p></li>
  </ol>
