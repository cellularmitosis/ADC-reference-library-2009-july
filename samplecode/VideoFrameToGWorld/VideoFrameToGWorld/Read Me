Sample: VideoFrameToGWorldDescription: This easy to follow example shows how a single frame from a video track can be drawn into a GWorld. The procedure shows how a GWorld can contain the frame pixels ready for custom manipulation by the application developer. A simple rotate is also performed for each subsequent frame to show how a transformation can be performed before drawing to the GWorld. Pressing the mouse button will advance the movie to the next frame.Version: 1.0Date: April 1, 2000Requirements: Mac OS 8.5+, QuickTime 4.0+, Universal Interfaces 3.3.1+ or QuickTime 4.1+ SDK.IDE Requirements: This project was built with CodeWarrior Pro 5 (IDE 4.0.4) and Universal Interfaces 3.3.1.Note: If you have the latest Universal Interfaces (3.3.1 or greater) you should not need to modify the project at all.
