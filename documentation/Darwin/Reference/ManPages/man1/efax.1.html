EFAX(1)                                                                                              EFAX(1)



<b>NAME</b>
       efax - send/receive faxes with Class 1, 2 or 2.0 fax modem

                                       (Please read the <b>fax</b> man page first.)

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>efax</b> [ <u>options</u> ] [ <b>-t</b> <u>num</u> [ <u>file</u>... ] ]


<b>OPTIONS</b>
       Where <u>options</u> are:


       <b>-a</b> <u>cmd</u>   use the command <b>ATcmd</b> when answering the phone.  The default is "A".


       <b>-c</b> <u>caps</u>  set  the local modem capabilities.  See the section on capabilities below for the format and
                meaning of <u>caps</u>.  For Class 1 the default is 1,n,0,2,0,0,0,0 where n is  the  highest  speed
                supported by the modem.  For Class 2 the default is determined by the modem.


       <b>-d</b> <u>dev</u>   use the fax modem connected to device <u>dev</u>.  The default is <b>/dev/modem</b>.


       <b>-f</b> <u>fnt</u>   use  font file <u>fnt</u> for generating the header.  The default is a built-in 8x16 font.  See the
                <a href="efix.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/efix">efix(1)</a> -f option for the font file format.


       <b>-g</b> <u>cmd</u>   if a <b>CONNECT</b> (or <b>DATA</b>) response indicates a data call, the shell <b>/bin/sh</b> is <!-- a -->exec(2)<!-- /a -->'ed  with
                <u>cmd</u> as its command.  <u>cmd</u> is a <a href="../man3/printf.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/printf">printf(3)</a> format that may contain up to 6 %d escapes which are
                replaced by the baud rate following the most recent <b>CONNECT</b> message.  <u>cmd</u>  typically  exec's
                <a href="../man8/getty.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/getty">getty(8)</a>.


       <b>-h</b> <u>hdr</u>   put  string  `hdr'  at  the top of each page.  The first %d in `hdr' is replaced by the page
                number and the second, if any, is replaced by the number of pages being sent.


       <b>-i</b> <u>str</u>

       <b>-j</b> <u>str</u>

       <b>-k</b> <u>str</u>   send the command <b>AT</b><u>str</u> to the modem to initialize it.  -i commands are sent before the modem
                is  put  into  fax  mode,  -j  commands after the modem is in fax mode, and -k commands just
                before efax exits.  The only default is a hang-up (ATH) command that is sent before  exiting
                only if no other -k options are given.  Multiple options may be used.


       <b>-l</b> <u>id</u>    set  the  local  identification  string  to  <u>id</u>.  <u>id</u> should be the local telephone number in
                international format (for example "+1 800 555-1212").  This is  passed  to  the  remote  fax
                machine.  Some fax machines may not accept characters other than numbers, space, and '+'.


       <b>-o</b> <u>opt</u>   use option <u>opt</u> to accommodate a non-standard fax modem protocol.  See the MODEM REQUIREMENTS
                section below for more details.  The <u>opt</u>ions are:


           <b>0</b>    Force use of Class 2.0 fax modem commands.  The modem must support Class 2.0.


           <b>2</b>    Force use of Class 2 fax modem commands.  The modem must support Class 2.


           <b>1</b>    Force use of Class 1 fax modem commands. The modem must support Class 1.   By  default  efax
                queries  the  modem  and uses the first of the three above classes which is supported by the
                modem.


           <b>a</b>    use software adaptive answer method.  If the first attempt  to  answer  the  call  does  not
                result  in  a data connection within 8 seconds the phone is hung up temporarily and answered
                again in fax mode (see "Accepting both fax and data calls" below).


           <b>e</b>    ignore errors in modem initialization commands.


           <b>f</b>    use "virtual flow control".  efax tries to estimate the  number  of  bytes  in  the  modem's
                transmit  buffer and pauses as necessary to avoid filling it.  The modem's buffer is assumed
                to hold at least 96 bytes.  This feature does not work properly with Class 2 modems that add
                redundant padding to scan lines.  Use this option only if you have problems configuring flow
                control.


           <b>h</b>    use hardware (RTS/CTS) in addition to software (XON/XOFF) flow control.   Many  modems  will
                stop  responding  if this option is used.  See the section `Resolving Problems' before using
                this option.


           <b>l</b>    halve the time between testing lock files when waiting for other programs to  complete.   By
                default this is 8 seconds. For example -olll sets the interval to 1 second.


           <b>n</b>    ignore  requests  for pages to be retransmitted. Use this option if you don't care about the
                quality of the received fax or if the receiving machine is too fussy.  Otherwise  each  page
                may be retransmitted up to 3 times.


           <b>r</b>    do  not  reverse  bit order during data reception for Class 2 modems.  Only Multitech modems
                require this option. Not normally required since efax detects these modems.


           <b>x</b>    send XON (DC1) instead of DC2 to start data reception.  Applies to a very few Class 2 modems
                only.


           <b>z</b>    delay an additional 100 milliseconds before each modem initialization or reset command.  The
                initial delay is 100 ms. For example, -ozzz produces a 400 ms delay.  Use with  modems  that
                get confused when commands arrive too quickly.



       <b>-q</b> <u>n</u>     ask for retransmission of pages received with more than <u>n</u> errors.  Default is 10.


       <b>-r</b> <u>pat</u>   each  received fax page is stored in a separate file.  The file name is created using <u>pat</u> as
                a <a href="../man3/strftime.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/strftime">strftime(3)</a> format string.  A page number of the form .001, .002, ...  is appended to  the
                file  name.   If <u>pat</u> is blank ("") or no -r option is given a default string of "%m%d%H%M%S"
                is used.



       <b>-s</b>       remove lock <!-- a -->file(s)<!-- /a --> after initializing the modem.  This allows  outgoing  calls  to  proceed
                when  efax  is waiting for an incoming call.  If efax detects modem activity it will attempt
                to re-lock the device.  If the modem has been locked by the other program efax will exit and
                return  1  (``busy'').   Normally  a new efax process is then started by <a href="../man8/launchd.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/launchd">launchd(8)</a>. The new
                efax process will then check periodically until the lock file disappears  and  then  re-ini-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tialize&nbsp;re-initialize</font>
                tialize the modem.


       <b>-t</b> <u>num</u> <u>[file</u><b>...]</b>
                dial  telephone  number <u>num</u> and send the fax image files <u>file</u>....  If used, this must be the
                last argument on the command line.  The telephone number <u>num</u> is a string  that  may  contain
                any dial modifiers that the modem supports such as a T prefix for tone dialing or commas for
                delays.  If no file names are given the remote fax machine will be polled. If no -t argument
                is given efax will answer the phone and attempt to receive a fax.


       <b>-v</b> <u>strng</u> select types of messages to be printed.  Each <u>lower-case</u> letter in <u>strng</u> enables one type of
                message:

                   <b>e</b> <b>-</b> errors
                   <b>w</b> <b>-</b> warnings
                   <b>i</b> <b>-</b> session progress information
                   <b>n</b> <b>-</b> capability negotiation information
                   <b>c</b> <b>-</b> modem (AT) commands and responses
                   <b>h</b> <b>-</b> HDLC frame data (Class 1 only)
                   <b>m</b> <b>-</b> modem output
                   <b>a</b> <b>-</b> program arguments
                   <b>r</b> <b>-</b> reception error details
                   <b>t</b> <b>-</b> transmission details
                   <b>f</b> <b>-</b> image file details
                   <b>x</b> <b>-</b> lock file processing

                Up to two -v options may be used.  The first is for messages printed to the  standard  error
                and the second is for messages to the standard output. The default is "ewin" to the standard
                error only.


       <b>-w</b>       wait for an OK or CONNECT prompt instead of issuing an answer (<b>ATA</b>)  command  to  receive  a
                fax.   Use  this option when the modem is set to auto-answer (using S0=<u>n</u>) or if another pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">gram&nbsp;program</font>
                gram has already answered the call.


       <b>-x</b> <u>lkf</u>   use a UUCP-style lock file <u>lkf</u> to lock the modem device before opening it.  If the device is
                locked,  efax  checks every 15 seconds until it is free.  Up to 16 -x options may be used if
                there are several names for the same device.  A `#' prefix  on  the  file  name  creates  an
                binary rather than text (HDB-style) lock file.  This is the reverse of what was used by pre-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">vious&nbsp;previous</font>
                vious efax versions.


<b>FAX</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>FORMATS</b>
       efax can read the same types of files as <a href="efix.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/efix"><b>efix(1)</b></a><b></b> including text, T.4  (Group  3),  PBM,  single-  and
       multi-page  TIFF (G3 and uncompressed).  efax automatically determines the type of file from its con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tents.&nbsp;contents.</font>
       tents.  TIFF files are recommended as they contain information about the image size and resolution.

       Each page to be sent should be converted to a separate TIFF format file with Group  3  (G3)  compres-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion.&nbsp;compression.</font>
       sion.   Received files are also stored in this format.  The EXAMPLES section below shows how efix and
       other programs can be used to create, view and print these files.


<b>OPERATING</b> <b>SYSTEM</b> <b>REQUIREMENTS</b>
       The operating system must provide short response times to avoid protocol timeouts.  For Class  2  and
       2.0 modems the delay should not exceed 1 or 2 seconds.

       When  using Class 1 modems the program must respond to certain events within 55 milliseconds.  Longer
       delays may cause the fax protocol to fail in certain places (between DCS and TCF or between  RTC  and
       MPS).   Class 1 modems should therefore not be used on systems that cannot guarantee that the program
       will respond to incoming data in less than 55 milliseconds.  In particular, some  intelligent  serial
       cards and terminal servers may introduce enough delay to cause problems with Class 1 operation.

       The operating system must also provide sufficient low-level buffering to allow uninterrupted transfer
       of data between the modem and a disk file at the selected baud rate, typically 9600 bps.   Since  the
       fax protocol does not provide end-to-end flow control the effectiveness of flow control while receiv-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;receiving</font>
       ing is limited by the size of the modem's buffer. This can be less than 100 bytes.  Efax does not use
       flow control during reception.


<b>MODEM</b> <b>REQUIREMENTS</b>
       The  "Group" is the protocol used to send faxes between fax machines.  Efax supports the Group 3 pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tocol&nbsp;protocol</font>
       tocol used over the public telephone network.

       The "Class" is the protocol used by computers to control fax modems.  Efax supports Class  1,  2  and
       2.0 fax modems.

       Most fax modems use XON/XOFF flow control when in fax mode.  This type of flow control adds very lit-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tle&nbsp;little</font>
       tle overhead for fax use. Many modems have unreliable hardware (RTS/CTS) flow control  in  fax  mode.
       By  default  efax  enables only XON/XOFF flow control and the -oh option must be used to add hardware
       flow control.

       While some modems have serial buffers of about 1k bytes, many  inexpensive  modems  have  buffers  of
       about one hundred bytes and are thus more likely to suffer overruns when sending faxes.

       A few older modems may need a delay between commands of more than the default value used by efax (100
       milliseconds).  If the delay is too short, commands may not echo properly, may time out, or may  give
       inconsistent  responses.  Use one or more <b>-oz</b> options to increase the delay between modem initializa-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;initialization</font>
       tion commands and use the E0 modem initialization command to disable echoing of modem commands.

       By default efax sends DC2 to start the data flow from the modem when receiving  faxes  from  Class  2
       modems.   A  few older modems require XON instead.  Use of DC2 would cause the modem to give an error
       message and/or the program to time out.  The <b>-ox</b> option should be used in this case.

       A few older Class 2 modems (e.g. some Intel models) don't send DC2 or XON to start the data  flow  to
       the  modem  when  sending faxes.  After waiting 2 seconds efax will print a warning and start sending
       anyways.

       A very few Class 2 modems do not reverse the bit order (MSB to LSB)  by  default  on  receive.   This
       might cause errors when trying to display or print the received files.  The <b>-or</b> option can be used in
       this case.

       Some inexpensive "9600 bps" fax modems only <u>transmit</u> at 9600 bps and reception  is  limited  to  4800
       bps.

<b>MODEM</b> <b>INITIALIZATION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       The required modem initialization commands are generated by efax.  Additional commands  may  be  sup-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">plied&nbsp;supplied</font>
       plied  as command-line arguments.  The modem must be set up to issue verbose(text) result codes.  The
       following command does this and is sent by efax before trying to initialize the modem.


       <b>Q0V1</b>     respond to commands with verbose result codes


       The following commands may be useful for special purposes:


       <b>X3</b>       don't wait for dial tone before dialing.  This may be used to send a fax when the  call  has
                already  been  dialed manually.  In this case use an empty string ("") as the first argument
                to the <b>-t</b> command.  Use <b>X4</b> (usual default) to enable all result codes.


       <b>M2</b>       leave the monitor speaker turned on for the duration of the call (use <b>M0</b> to leave it off).


       <b>L0</b>       turn monitor speaker volume to minimum (use <b>L3</b> for maximum).


       <b>E0</b>       disable echoing of modem commands.  See the Resolving Problems section below.


       <b>&amp;D2</b>      returns the modem to command mode when DTR is dropped.  The program drops DTR at  the  start
                and end of the call if it can't get a response to a modem command.  You can use <b>&amp;D3</b> to reset
                the modem when DTR is dropped.


       <b>S7=120</b>   wait up to two minutes (120 seconds) for carrier.  This may be useful if the  answering  fax
                machine  takes a long time to start the handshaking operation (e.g. a combined fax/answering
                machine with a long announcement).


<b>CAPABILITIES</b>
       The capabilities of the local hardware and software can be set using a string of 8  digits  separated
       by commas:

       <u>vr</u><b>,</b><u>br</u><b>,</b><u>wd</u><b>,</b><u>ln</u><b>,</b><u>df</u><b>,</b><u>ec</u><b>,</b><u>bf</u><b>,</b><u>st</u>

                7 for 40 ms per line



       When  <u>receiving</u> a fax the <u>vr</u>, <u>wd</u>, and <u>ln</u> fields of the capability string should be set to the maximum
       values that your display software supports.  The default is 196 lpi, standard (8.5"/21.5cm) width and
       unlimited length.

       When <u>sending</u> a fax efax will determine <u>vr</u> and <u>ln</u> from the image file and set <u>wd</u> to the default.

       If the receiving fax machine does not support high resolution (<u>vr</u>=1) mode, efax will reduce the reso-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lution&nbsp;resolution</font>
       lution by combining pairs of scan lines.  If the receiving fax machine does not support  the  image's
       width  then  efax  will  truncate  or pad as required. Most fax machines can receive <u>ln</u> up to 2.  Few
       machines support values of <u>wd</u> other than 0.



<b>HEADERS</b>
       efax adds blank scan lines at the top of each image when it is sent.  This allows room for  the  page
       header  but  increases  the  length  of  the  image (by default about 0.1" or 2.5mm of blank space is
       added).

       The header placed in this area typically includes the date and time, identifies the,  and  shows  the
       page  number and total pages.  Headers cannot be disabled but the header string can be set to a blank
       line.

       The default font for generating the headers is the built-in 8x16 pixel font scaled  to  12x24  pixels
       (about 9 point size).

       Note  that  both  efax  and efix have -f options to specify the font.  efIx uses the font to generate
       text when doing text-to-fax conversions (during "fax make") while efAx uses the font to generate  the
       header (during "fax send").


<b>SESSION</b> <b>LOG</b>
       A session log is written to the standard error stream.  This log gives status and error messages from
       the program as selected by the <b>-v</b> option. A time stamp showing the full time or just minutes and sec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">onds&nbsp;seconds</font>
       onds  is  printed  before each message.  Times printed along with modem responses also show millisec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">onds.&nbsp;milliseconds.</font>
       onds.


<b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b>
       The program returns an error code as follows:


       0        The fax was successfully sent or received.


       1        The dialed number was busy or the modem device was in use.  Try again later.


       2        Something failed (e.g. file not found or disk full). Don't retry.  Check the session log for
                more details.


       3        Modem  protocol  error.   The  program did not receive the expected response from the modem.
                The modem may not have been properly initialized, the correct <b>-o</b> options were not used, or a
                bug report may be in order.  Check the session log for more details.


       4        The  modem  is  not  responding.   Operator  attention is required.  Check that the modem is
                turned on and connected to the correct port.


       5        The program was terminated by a signal.


       6        The program was terminated due to a system power  event  (i.e.  the  computer  is  about  to
                sleep).


       7        The operator canceled the call.


<b>EXAMPLES</b>
       <b>Creating</b> <b>fax</b> <b>(G3)</b> <b>files</b>

       The  efix  program  can  be used to convert text files to TIFF-G3 format.  For example, the following
       command will convert the text file <b>letter</b> to the files <b>letter.001</b>, <b>letter.002</b>, etc,:


              efix -nletter.%03d letter


       Ghostscript's <b>tiffg3</b> driver can generate fax files in TIFF-G3  format  from  postscript  files.   For
       example, the command:


               gs -q -sDEVICE=tiffg3 -dNOPAUSE \
                   -sOutputFile=letter.%03d letter.ps &lt;/dev/null


       will convert the Postscript file <b>letter.ps</b> into high-resolution (<u>vr</u>=1) G3 fax image files <b>letter.001,</b>
       <b>letter.002,</b> ...

       The images should have margins of at least 1/2 inch (1 cm) since the fax standard only requires  that
       fax  machines print a central portion of the image 196.6mm (7.7 inches) wide by 281.5mm (11.1 inches)
       high.

       The efix program can also insert bitmaps in images to create letterhead, signatures, etc.

       <b>Printing</b> <b>fax</b> <b>files</b>

       On CUPS based systems you can use <a href="lpr.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/lpr">lpr(1)</a> to print faxes. For example, to print the received fax  file
       <b>reply.001</b> use the command:


              lpr reply.001


       On  lpd  based systems you can use the efix program to print faxes on Postscript or HP-PCL (LaserJet)
       printers.  For example, to print the received fax file <b>reply.001</b> on a Postscript printer use the com-
       mand:


              efix -ops reply.001 | lpr


       <b>Sending</b> <b>fax</b> <b>files</b>

       The  following  command will dial the number 222-2222 using tone dialing and send a two-page fax from
       the TIFF-G3 files letter.001 and letter.002 using the fax modem connected to device /dev/cua1.


              efax -d /dev/cua1 \
                   -t T222-2222 letter.001 letter.002


       <b>Manual</b> <b>answer</b>

       You can use efax to answer the phone immediately and start fax reception.  Use this mode if you  need
       to answer calls manually to see if they are fax or voice.

       For  example, the following command will make the fax modem on device <b>/dev/ttyS1</b> answer the phone and
       attempt to receive a fax.  The received fax will be stored in the files <b>reply.001</b>, <b>reply.002</b>, and  so
       on.  The modem will identify itself as "555-1212" and receive faxes at high or low resolution (<u>vr</u>=1),
       at up to 14.4 kbps (<u>br</u>=5).


              efax -d /dev/ttyS1 -l "555-1212" \
                 -c 1,5 -r reply


       <b>Automatic</b> <b>answer</b>

       The <b>-w</b> option makes efax wait for characters to become available from the modem (indicating an incom-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;incoming</font>
       ing  call)  before starting fax reception.  Use the <b>-w</b> option and a <b>-i</b>S0=<u>n</u> option to answer the phone
       after <u>n</u> rings.  The example below will make the modem answer incoming calls in fax mode on the fourth
       ring and save the received faxes using files names corresponding to the reception date and time.


              efax -d /dev/ttyb -w -iS0=4 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt;&gt; fax.log


       <b>Sharing</b> <b>the</b> <b>modem</b> <b>with</b> <b>outgoing</b> <b>calls</b>

       The  modem device can be shared by programs that use the UUCP device locking protocol.  This includes
       pppd, chat, minicom, kermit, uucico, efax, cu, and many others others.  However,  locking  will  only
       work if all programs use the same lock file.

       efax  will lock the modem device before opening it if one or more UUCP lock file names are given with
       <b>-x</b> options.  Most programs place their lock files in the /usr/spool/uucp or /var/lock directories and
       use  the  name  LCK..<u>dev</u> where <u>dev</u> is the name of the device file in the /dev directory that is to be
       locked.

       If the <b>-s</b> (share) option is used, the lock file is removed while waiting for incoming calls so  other
       programs can use the same device.

       If efax detects another program using the modem while it is waiting to receive a fax, efax exits with
       a termination code of 1.  A subsequent efax process using this device will wait until the other  pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">gram&nbsp;program</font>
       gram is finished before re-initializing the modem and starting to wait for incoming calls again.

       Programs  that  try  to lock the modem device by using device locking facilities other than UUCP lock
       files not be able to use this arbitration mechanism because the device will still be open to the efax
       process.   In  this case you will need to kill the efax process (e.g. "fax stop") before starting the
       other program.

       When efax is waiting for a fax it leaves the modem ready to receive in fax mode but removes the  lock
       file.  When a slip or PPP program takes over the modem port by setting up its own lock file efax can-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">not&nbsp;cannot</font>
       not send any more commands to the modem -- not even to reset it.  Therefore the other program has  to
       set  the  modem  back to data mode when it starts up.  To do this add a modem reset command (send ATZ
       expect OK) to the beginning of your slip or PPP chat script.

       <b>Accepting</b> <b>both</b> <b>fax</b> <b>and</b> <b>data</b> <b>calls</b>

       Many modems have an adaptive data/fax answer mode that can be enabled using the <b>-j+FAE=1</b>  (for  Class
       1)  or  <b>-jFAA=1</b>  (for Class 2[.0]) initialization string.  The type of call (data or fax) can then be
       deduced from the modem's responses.

       Some modems have limited adaptive answer features (e.g. only working properly at certain  baud  rates
       or only in Class 2) or none at all.  In this case use the initialization string <b>-i+FCLASS=0</b> to answer
       in data mode first and the <b>-oa</b> option to then hang up and try again in fax mode if the  first  answer
       attempt  was  not  successful.   This  method only works if your telephone system waits a few seconds
       after you hang up before disconnecting incoming calls.

       If the <b>-g</b> option is used then the option's argument will be run as a shell command when  an  incoming
       data  call  is  detected.   Typically this command will exec <a href="../man8/getty.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/getty"><b>getty</b>(8)</a>.  This program should expect to
       find the modem already off-hook and a lock file present so it should not try to hang up the  line  or
       create a lock file.  Note that the modem should be set up to report the DCE-DTE (modem-computer, e.g.
       CONNECT 38400) speed, not the DCE-DCE (modem-modem, e.g. CONNECT 14400) speed.  For many  modems  the
       initialization option -iW0 will set this.

       The  following  command  will  make efax answer incoming calls on <b>/dev/cua1</b> on the second ring.  This
       device will be locked using two different lock files but these lock files will be removed while wait-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;waiting</font>
       ing for incoming calls (<b>-s</b>).  If a data call is detected, the <b>getty</b> program will be run to initialize
       the terminal driver and start a <a href="login.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/login"><b>login</b>(1)</a> process.  Received fax files will be stored using names like
       <b>Dec02-12.32.33.001</b>,  in  the  <b>/usr/spool/fax/incoming</b>  directory and the log file will be appended to
       <b>/usr/spool/fax/faxlog.cua1</b>.


              efax -d /dev/cua1  -j '+FAA=1' \
                 -x /usr/spool/uucp/LCK..cua1 \
                 -x /usr/spool/uucp/LCK..ttyS1 \
                 -g "exec /sbin/getty -h /dev/cua1 %d" \
                 -iS0=2 -w -s \
                 -r "/usr/spool/fax/incoming/%b%d-%H.%I.%S" \
                 &gt;&gt; /usr/spool/fax/faxlog.cua1 2&gt;&amp;1


       Note that adaptive answer of either type will not work for all callers.   For  some  data  calls  the
       duration of the initial data-mode answer may be too short for data handshaking to complete.  In other
       cases this duration may be so long that incoming fax calls will time out before efax switches to  fax
       mode.  In addition, some calling fax modems mistake data-mode answering tones for fax signaling tones
       and initiate fax negotiation too soon.  If you use software adaptive answer you can reduce the  value
       of  the  initial data-mode answer (set by TO_DATAF in efax.c) to get more reliable fax handshaking or
       increase it for more reliable data handshaking.  However, if you need to  provide  reliable  fax  and
       data service to all callers you should use separate phone numbers for the two types of calls.

       When  a  call  is  answered  the modem goes on-line with the computer-to-modem baud rate fixed at the
       speed used for the most recent AT command.  When efax is waiting for a fax or data call it  sets  the
       interface  speed to 19200 bps since this is the speed required for fax operation.  This prevents full
       use of 28.8kbps modem capabilities.



<b>USING</b> <b>LAUNCHD</b> <b>TO</b> <b>RUN</b> <b>EFAX</b>
       efax can answer all incoming calls if you create a <a href="../man5/launchd.plist.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/launchd.plist">launchd.plist(5)</a> file  in  <b>/System/Library/Launch</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">Daemons.&nbsp;/System/Library/LaunchDaemons.</font>
       <b>Daemons</b>. The <a href="../man8/launchd.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/launchd">launchd(8)</a> process will run a new copy of efax when the system boots up and whenever the
       previous efax process terminates.  The configuration file should  invoke  efax  by  running  the  <b>fax</b>
       script with an <b>answer</b> argument.

       For example, the following XML Property List keeps efax running continuously:


                &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
                &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "<a href="http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd</a>"&gt;
                &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;
                &lt;dict&gt;
                     &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;
                     &lt;string&gt;com.cce.efax&lt;/string&gt;
                     &lt;key&gt;OnDemand&lt;/key&gt;
                     &lt;false/&gt;
                     &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;
                     &lt;array&gt;
                          &lt;string&gt;/usr/bin/fax&lt;/string&gt;
                          &lt;string&gt;answer&lt;/string&gt;
                     &lt;/array&gt;
                &lt;/dict&gt;
                &lt;/plist&gt;


       You  should  protect the fax script and configuration files against tampering since launchd will exe-
       cute them as a privileged (root) process.  If you will be allowing data calls via getty and login you
       should  ensure that your system is reasonably secure (e.g. that all user id's have secure passwords).

       If efax exec()'s getty properly but you get a garbled login prompt then there is probably a baud rate
       mismatch between the modem and the computer.  First, check the efax log file to make sure the modem's
       CONNECT response reported the serial port speed (e.g. 19200), <b>not</b> the modem-modem speed (e.g. 14400).
       Next,  check  the  getty options and/or configuration files (e.g. /etc/gettydefs) for that particular
       baud rate.  Then run getty manually with the same arguments and verify the port settings using ``stty
       &lt;/dev/XXX''.  Note that you'll probably want to enable hardware flow control for data connections (-h
       for agetty, CRTSCTS for getty_ps).

       A few programs won't work properly when efax is set up to answer calls because they don't create lock
       files.   You  can put the shell script ``wrapper'' below around such programs to make them work prop-
       erly.  Change BIN and LOCKF to suit.


              #!/bin/sh
              BIN=/bin/badprogram
              LOCKF=/var/spool/uucp/LCK..cua1
              if [ -f $LOCKF ]
              then
                      echo lock file $LOCKF exists
                      exit 1
              else
                      printf "%10d0 $$ &gt;$LOCKF
                      $BIN $*
                      rm $LOCKF
              fi




<b>DELIVERING</b> <b>RECEIVED</b> <b>FAXES</b> <b>BY</b> <b>E-MAIL</b>
       The "fax answer" script described above can be configured to e-mail the fax  files  received  by  the
       previous fax answer process to a "fax manager" who can then forward the fax to the correct recipient.
       The received fax files are send as MIME attachments, one file per page,  using  the  ``base64''  text
       encoding and the ``image/tiff'' file format.

       To  view the fax images directly from your e-mail reader you will have to configure it with an appli-
       cation that can display files of type image/tiff.  Typically this is specified in a ``mailcap'' file.
       For  example,  placing  the  following line in /etc/mailcap will cause the fax file attachments to be
       displayed using the ``fax view'' command.

       image/tiff; fax view %s


<b>SENDING</b> <b>FAXES</b> <b>USING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>PRINT</b> <b>SPOOLER</b>
       You can configure a "fax" printer into the lpr print spooler that will fax a document out using  efax
       instead of printing it. To set up a fax printer do the following:

       lpadmin   -p  fax  -E  -P  /System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework/Frameworks/Print-
       Core.framework/Resources/English.lproj/Fax.ppd -v fax://dev/cu.modem


       You should now be able to send a fax using the lpr interface by using a command such as:


              lpr -P fax -ophone="555-1212" file.ps


       You can use <a href="lpq.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/lpq">lpq(1)</a> to check the fax queue, <a href="lprm.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/lprm">lprm(1)</a> to remove fax  jobs  and  <a href="../man8/lpc.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/lpc">lpc(8)</a>  to  control  the
       spooler.  In each case use the -Pfax option to specify the fax ``printer.'' A log file will be mailed
       to the user when the fax is sent.

       See the <a href="lpr.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/lpr">lpr(1)</a> man page for information on the print spooler.


<b>RESOLVING</b> <b>PROBLEMS</b>
       Double check the configuration setup in the first part of the  fax  script,  particularly  the  modem
       device name and the lock file names.

       If  efax  hangs  when  trying  to  open  the modem device (typically /dev/ttyX), the device is either
       already in use by another process (e.g. pppd) or it requires the  carrier  detect  line  to  be  true
       before  it  can be opened.  Many systems define an alternate device name for the same physical device
       (typically cuaX) that can be opened even if carrier is not present  or  other  programs  are  already
       using it.

       If  responses  to  modem  initialization commands are being lost or generated at random, another pro-
       cesses (e.g. getty or an efax auto-answer process) may be trying to use the modem at the  same  time.
       Try  running  efax while this other program is running.  If efax does not report "/dev/ttyX locked or
       busy. waiting."  then the lock files names are not specified correctly.

       Attempt to send a fax. Check that the modem starts making the calling signal (CNG, a 0.5 second  beep
       every  3  seconds)  as  soon as it's finished dialing.  This shows the modem is in fax mode.  You may
       need to set the SPKR variable to -iM2L3 to monitor the phone line to do this.

       Listen for the answering fax machine and check that it sends the answer signal (CED, a 3 second beep)
       followed by "warbling" sounds (DIS frames) every 3 seconds.  If you hear a continuous sound (tones or
       noise) instead, then you've connected to a data modem instead.

       Your modem should send back its own warble (DCS frame) in response to DIS immediately followed by 1.5
       seconds  of noise (a channel check).  If everything is OK, the receiving end will send another warble
       (CFR frame) and your modem will start to send data.  If you have an external modem, check  its  LEDs.
       If  flow  control is working properly the modem's send data (SD) LED will turn off periodically while
       the fax data is sent.

       Check the message showing the line count and the average bit rate when the page transmission is done.
       Low  line  counts  (under  1000  for a letter size image) or the warning "fax output buffer overflow"
       while sending indicate that the image data format is incorrect. Check the file being sent  using  the
       "fax view" command.

       If  you  get  the error message ``flow control did not work'' then flow control was not active.  This
       usually results in a garbled transmission and the receiving machine may reject the  page,  abort  the
       call, print a distorted or blank image and/or hang up.

       The  warning "characters received while sending" or an &lt;XOFF&gt; character appearing after the transmis-
       sion means that the operating system ignored the modem's XOFF flow control  character.   Ensure  that
       you  are  not  running  other programs such as getty or pppd at the same time as efax since they will
       turn off xon/xoff flow control.

       If you cannot get flow control to work properly then enable ``virtual flow  control''  with  the  <b>-of</b>
       option or hardware flow control with the <b>-oh</b> option.

       Check  that  the  remote machine confirms reception with a +FPTS:1 response (Class 2) or an MCF frame
       (Class 1).

       For Class 2 modems, the error message "abnormal call termination (code <u>nn</u>)" indicates that the  modem
       detected an error and hung up.

       Many  companies  advertise  services  that will fax back information on their products.  These can be
       useful for testing fax reception.

       The message "run length buffer overflow" when receiving indicates an error with the image  data  for-
       mat.  You may need to use the <b>-or</b> option with certain Class 2 modems.

       If efax displays the message "can't happen (&lt;details&gt;)" please send a bug report to the author.

       Finally, don't play "option bingo," if you can't resolve the problem send a verbose log of the failed
       session (the output from <b>fax</b> <b>-v</b> <b>...</b>) to the address below.

<b>RELATED</b> <b>SOFTWARE</b>
       For Linux Systems

       Independent packages provide more user-friendly interfaces to efax (xfax, tefax) and  provide  an  e-
       mail-to-fax  (Qfax)  gateway  using  efax. All are available by anonymous FTP from metalab.unc.edu in
       /pub/Linux/apps/serialcomm/fax/.

       For Amiga Systems

       A port of an early version of efax for the Amiga is available as a component  of  a  shareware  voice
       mail package, AVM, distributed by Al Villarica (rvillari@cat.syr.edu).

       Other Ports

       efax is relatively easy to port.  All system-dependent code is in <b>efaxos.c</b>.  An early version of efax
       was ported to VMS.  Version 0.8a was ported to Win32 by Luigi Capriotti.  Contact the author  if  you
       would like to integrate the Win32 code into the current version.

<b>BUG</b> <b>REPORTS</b>
       Bug  reports  should include the operating system, the type of the modem and a copy of a verbose ses-
       sion log that demonstrates the problem.  It's usually impossible  to  help  without  a  verbose  log.

<b>BUGS</b>
       Can't read TIFF files with more than 1 strip

       Class 1 operation may fail if the program can't respond to  certain  data  received  from  the  modem
       within 55 milliseconds.

       May  fail  if  multitasking  delays  cause the received data to overflow the computer's serial device
       buffer or if an under-run of transmit data exceeds 5 seconds.

       Polling does not work.

       Does not support 2-D coding, ECM, or BFT.
