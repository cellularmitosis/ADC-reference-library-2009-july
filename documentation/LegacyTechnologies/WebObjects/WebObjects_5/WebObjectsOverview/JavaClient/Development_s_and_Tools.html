The major differences are the way you designyour enterprise object classes and the way you create your application'suser interface.</font></p><a name = "TPXREF110"></a><h3><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande">DesigningEnterprise Objects for Java Client</font></h3><p><font face="Times">Java Client allows you to specify two enterprise object classesfor each entity: one for the server and one for the client. Theclient and server classes can have different sets of propertiesand business logic. This means that programming a Java Client WebObjects applicationrequires a specific design technique that isn't necessary in HTML-based development:object partitioning. Simply put, you have to determine whether youneed different enterprise object classes for the client and theserver and also what data and business logic to put in each class.</font></p><p><font face="Times">Usually, client objects have the more restricted set of dataand behaviors, but it is really up to you to decide based on therequirements of the application and your business. As noted earlier,the primary criteria for partitioning are performance and security.</font></p><a name = "TPXREF104"></a><h3><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande">Creatingthe User Interface</font></h3><p><font face="Times">A Java Client WebObjects application gives you considerableflexibility in how you compose its user interface. Ideally you providean application's entire user interface in a single Java applicationthat runs on the client. But you can also combine Java Client applets andstatic and dynamic (WebObjects) HTML elements in various ways. Youcan have pages with or without Java Client applets or pages withmultiple Java Client applets. For example, you could have a loginpage that takes the user to one of many Java Client pages basedon some piece of account data. In addition, Java Client appletsare not limited to the downloaded JFC components; as with any applet,they can create dialogs and secondary windows on the fly.</font></p><p><font face="Times">If your application's user interface uses static and dynamicallygenerated HTML, you create those parts of the user interface inthe normal way with WebObjects Builder (as described in  <a sector="mod" href="../WOHTML/iHTML_Based_Applications.html" target="_top">"HTML-Based Applications" (page 37)</a>).The process is different for creating a Java Client applicationor applet. Instead of using WebObjects Builder to create the user interface,you use an application called Interface Builder.</font></p><br><table border = "0" BGCOLOR="#E6E6E6"><tr><td scope="row"><p><b>Note: </b>Ifyou're familiar with Cocoa development, the process for creatinga Java Client user interface is nearly the same as the one for creatinga Cocoa user interface for Mac OS X applications.</p></td></tr></table><br><p><font face="Times">In Interface Builder, you typically construct a user interfaceby dragging widgets from a palette and dropping them into a window,as shown in  <a href="#BAJJFJDF">Figure 6-5</a>. It does more, however, than simple user interfacelayout. Interface Builder also lets you create, edit, and connect objectsso they can communicate with one another at runtime.</font></p><a name = "BAJJFJDF"></a><p><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande"><b>Figure6-5 Composing a user interface with InterfaceBuilder</b></font></p> <img src = "../Art/IB.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/IB.gif]">    <br><a href="Other_Architectures.html" target="_right"><img src="../Images/previous.gif" border="0" alt="Previous"></a><a href="Advantages__nt_Approach.html" target="_right"><img src="../Images/next.gif" border="0" alt="Next"></a>&nbsp;<p><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="1">&#169; 2001 Apple Computer, Inc.</font></p><!-- start of footer --><!--#include virtual="/includes/framesetfooter" --><!-- end of footer --></body></html>
