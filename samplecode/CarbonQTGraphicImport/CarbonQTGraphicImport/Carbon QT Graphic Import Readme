This sample shows how to use the QuickTime GraphicImporter components to display all thekinds of pictures that QuickTime is capable of displaying.  It's rather fast too.It shows how to use offscreen GWorlds, and how to fall back to not using them if memoryis low.  It also demonstrates how to use the new Carbon printing manager calls to print,either from a GWorld or by having the GraphicImporter component draw directly into theprinting port.It only requires QuickTime 3.0 or later, it does not use any of the QuickTime 4.xGraphicImporter calls.
