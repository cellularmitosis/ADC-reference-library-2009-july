FinderDragProÊA sample application illustrating drag and drop techniques for use with file system objects.  This file illustrates how applications can use drag and drop commands in a way compatible with current and past versions of the Finder.Drag and drop techniques illustrated include:¥ translucent drag and drop for icons,¥ drag and drop of hfs objects,¥ creating and providing promised files in drags,¥ installing fake apple event handlers for drag and drop compatibility with past versions of the Finder.Other interesting techniques illustrated include:¥ retrieving icons for files,¥ graying out a section of a window,¥ converting icons to pixmaps for translucent dragging,¥ resolving alias files while avoiding user interaction alerts that may pop up,By John Montbriand.Written in part by Pete Gontier.Copyright © 1999 by Apple Computer, Inc.All rights reserved worldwide.	Disclaimer:You may incorporate this sample code into your applications without restriction, though the sample code has been provided "AS IS" and the responsibility for its operation is 100% yours.
