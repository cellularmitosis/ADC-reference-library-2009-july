If your program requires a specific	version of Mac OS and your program checks for that version before	calling MoreFiles routines, then you can remove a lot of compatibility	code by defining one of the following to 1:			__MACOSSEVENFIVEONEORLATER	// assume Mac OS 7.5.1 or later		__MACOSSEVENFIVEORLATER		// assume Mac OS 7.5 or later		__MACOSSEVENORLATER			// assume Mac OS 7.0 or later		If you're compiling 68K code, the default is to include all compatibility code.	If you're compiling PowerPC code (TARGET_RT_MAC_CFM), the default is __MACOSSEVENORLATER	If you're compiling for Carbon code (TARGET_API_MAC_CARBON), the default is __MACOSSEVENFIVEONEORLATER		2 -- You may disable Pascal calling conventions in all MoreFiles routines	except for system callbacks that require Pascal calling conventions.	This will make 68K C programs both smaller and faster. 	(PowerPC compilers ignore pascal calling conventions.)	Just define __WANTPASCALELIMINATION to be 1 to turn this optimization on	when building MoreFiles for use from C programs (you'll need to keep	Pascal calling conventions when linking MoreFiles routines with Pascal	programs).		3 -- If Metrowerks compiler is used, "#pragma internal on" may help produce	better code. However, this option can also cause problems if you're	trying to build MoreFiles as a shared library, so it is by default not used.	Just define __USEPRAGMAINTERNAL to be 1 to turn this optimization on.		Original changes supplied by Fabrizio Oddone*/#include <ConditionalMacros.h>/* if we're compiling for Carbon, then we're running on Mac OS 8.1 or later */#ifndef __MACOSSEVENFIVEONEORLATER	#define __MACOSSEVENFIVEONEORLATER TARGET_API_MAC_CARBON#endif#ifndef __MACOSSEVENFIVEORLATER	#define __MACOSSEVENFIVEORLATER __MACOSSEVENFIVEONEORLATER#endif#ifndef __MACOSSEVENORLATER	#if TARGET_RT_MAC_CFM		#define __MACOSSEVENORLATER 1	#else		#define __MACOSSEVENORLATER __MACOSSEVENFIVEORLATER	#endif#endif#ifndef	__WANTPASCALELIMINATION	#define	__WANTPASCALELIMINATION	0#endif#if	__WANTPASCALELIMINATION	#define pascal	#endif#ifndef __USEPRAGMAINTERNAL	#define	__USEPRAGMAINTERNAL	0#endif#if	__USEPRAGMAINTERNAL	#if defined(__MWERKS__)		#pragma internal on	#endif#endif
