/*	File:		MacCalendarCommon.h	Contains:	Definitions common to the application and control strip module.	Written by:	Martin Minow	Copyright:	© 1994-1997 by Apple Computer, Inc., all rights reserved.	Change History (most recent first):	You may incorporate this sample code into your applications without	restriction, though the sample code has been provided "AS IS" and the	responsibility for its operation is 100% yours.  However, what you are	not permitted to do is to redistribute the source as "DSC Sample Code"	after having made changes. If you're going to re-distribute the source,	we require that you make it clear in the source that the code was	descended from Apple Sample Code, but that you've made changes.	Edit History:		1.0d0	MM	First "public" distribution.		1.0d1	MM	Added the setup application.		1.0d2	MM	Added balloon help to the setup dialog. Added a "can't					find preference file alert." No substantive changes.		1.0d3	MM	Some small fixes from the Status Bar author. Now hiliting					the days of the week and today's date if shown.		1.0d4	MM	Revised to use the current ControlStrip header file. Removed					references to a local copy of Icons.h as the Universal Header					distribution has this information. Shrunk next/last month buttons.					Make a copy of the intlHdl so we don't change the system info.		1.0d5	MM	Bug displaying October 1994 - blank first line.		1.0d6	MM	Redid drawing routine.*/#ifndef __MACCALENDARCOMMON__#define __MACCALENDARCOMMON__#define  SystemSevenFiveOrLater	1#define  OLDROUTINELOCATIONS	0#define  OLDROUTINENAMES		0#define  DEBUG					1#define kSetupAppCreator		'SCCF'#define kControlStripCreator	'SCAL'#define kVersionMajor		1#define kVersionMinor		0x10		// minor and bugfix share a single byte as BCD#define kVersionStage		beta#define kVersionRelease		1#define kVersionIdent		"1.1b1"#define kVersionString		"1.1b1 © 1994-97 Apple Computer, Inc."#define kFirstIsSunday		1#define kFirstIsMonday		2#define	kDefaultFontStr		"Geneva"#define kDefaultSizeStr		"9"#define kDefaultFirstDayStr	"1"#define kDefaultDayNamesStr	"\001S\001M\002Tu\001W\002Th\001F\001S\000"#ifndef REZ#include <Types.h>#ifndef FALSE#define FALSE				0#define TRUE				1#endif// Some macros that I just couldn't get rid of -- Quinn#define width(rect)			((rect).right - (rect).left)#define height(rect)		((rect).bottom - (rect).top)#define PicFrame(what)		((**(*globalPtr).what).picFrame)	/* The picture frame rectangle	*/#define pstrcpy(dst, src)	(BlockMoveData((src), (dst), (src)[0] + 1))#if DEBUG	#define QAssert(mustBeTrue)	if (mustBeTrue) { } else { Debugger(); }#else	#define QAssert#endif/* * This is saved across restarts - it is set from "factory settings" if no * preference resource is found in the Status Bar preference file, and can * be changed by the MacCalendarSetup application. * * This structure is also published via Gestalt by the control strip module. * Because it's shared between 68K code (the module) and PPC code (the * PPC version of the setup application), this structure must be declared * using a standard alignment, in this case 68K. */#if PRAGMA_ALIGN_SUPPORTED#pragma options align=mac68k#endiftypedef struct SavedSettings {	OSType			signature;					/* Our signature					*/	OSType			prefVersion;				/* Preference revision level		*/					UInt32			modCount;					/* Change this to force module to notice changes in the remaining fields */					Str255			dayNameString;				/* Current date label string		*/	Str255			fontName;					/* Requested display font			*/	short			fontSize;					/* Display font size				*/	short			firstDayOfWeek;				/* Sunday == 1						*/} SavedSettings, **SavedSettingsHandle;#if PRAGMA_ALIGN_SUPPORTED#pragma options align=reset#endif/* * The value of kPrefVersion has no special significance.
