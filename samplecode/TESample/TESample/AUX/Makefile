The fundamental TextEdit #	toolbox calls and TextEdit autoscroll are demonstrated. It #	also shows how to create and maintain scrollbar controls.##	It does not by any means demonstrate all the techniques you #	need for a large application. In particular, Sample does not #	cover exception handling, multiple windows/documents, #	sophisticated memory management, printing, or undo. All of #	these are vital parts of a normal full-sized application.##	This application is an example of the form of a Macintosh #	application; it is NOT a template. It is NOT intended to be #	used as a foundation for the next world-class, best-selling, #	600K application. A stick figure drawing of the human body may #	be a good example of the form for a painting, but that does not #	mean it should be used as the basis for the next Mona Lisa.##	We recommend that you review this program or Sample before #	beginning a new application. Sample is a simple app. which doesn't #	use TextEdit or the Control Manager.#SHELL =		/bin/shCFLAGS =	-I/usr/include/mac -B /usr/lib/big/REZ =		/mac/bin/rez -i /:mac:lib:rincludes -d AUX# The next entry builds the "TESample" program.
