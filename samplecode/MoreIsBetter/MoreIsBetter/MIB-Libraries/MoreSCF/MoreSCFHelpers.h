$Log: MoreSCFHelpers.h,v $
Revision 1.4  2003/02/26 12:42:22         
Added a new routine, MoreSCMakeNewPPPoESet, and exported some of the sub-routines used by the MoreSCMakeNewXxxSet routines so that you can more create custom high-level routines without modifying MoreSCF itself.

Revision 1.3  2002/12/12 15:25:06         
Correct file name in header comment.

Revision 1.2  2002/11/09 00:01:06         
Added compile time environment check. When using framework includes, explicitly include the frameworks we need. Convert nil to NULL.

Revision 1.1  2002/01/16 22:52:34         
First checked in.

// TCP/IP Will Dial

// You no longer need a helper function to ask the "will this connection

// high-level APIs to answer this question, to wit:
//
// SCNetworkCheckReachabilityByAddress
// SCNetworkCheckReachabilityByName

// AppleTalk On/Off

// Note that you can't really save and restore the state of AppleTalk 
// using these routines because AppleTalk could be enabled on one, but 
// not all, of the AppleTalk capable interfaces.  I need to introduce 
// new routines that return an array of Booleans.

extern pascal OSStatus MoreSCIsAppleTalkActive(CFStringRef setID, Boolean *active);
	// Sets *active to true if the AppleTalk stack is active 
	// on any active interface in the set denoted by setID
	// (pass NULL to work on the current set).  This tests the 
	// configured value in the preferences, not the current state 
	// (AppleTalk might be configured active but inactive 
	// because, say, the Ethernet cable isn't connected).
