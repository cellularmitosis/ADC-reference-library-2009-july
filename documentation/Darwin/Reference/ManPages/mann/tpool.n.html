<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       This  package  creates  and  manages  pools  of  worker threads. It allows you to post jobs to worker
       threads and wait for their completion. The threadpool implementation is Tcl  event-loop  aware.  That
       means  that  any time a caller is forced to wait for an event (job being completed or a worker thread
       becoming idle or initialized), the implementation will enter the event loop and allow  for  servicing
       of other pending file or timer (or any other supported) events.

<b>COMMANDS</b>
       <b>tpool::create</b> ?options?
              This  command  creates  new threadpool. It accepts several options as key-value pairs. Options
              are used to tune some threadpool parameters.  The command returns the ID of the newly  created
              threadpool.

              Following options are supported:

              -minthreads number
                     Minimum  number of threads needed for this threadpool instance.  During threadpool cre-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ation,&nbsp;creation,</font>
                     ation, the implementation will create somany worker threads upfront and  will  keep  at
                     least  number  of  them  alive during the lifetime of the threadpool instance.  Default
                     value of this parameter is 0 (zero). which means that a newly threadpool will  have  no
                     worker  threads  initialy. All worker threads will be started on demand by callers run-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ning&nbsp;running</font>
                     ning <b>tpool::post</b> command and posting jobs to the job queue.

              -maxthreads number
                     Maximum number of threads allowed for this threadpool instance.  If a new job is  pend-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;pending</font>
                     ing and there are no idle worker threads available, the implementation will try to cre-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ate&nbsp;create</font>
                     ate new worker thread. If the number of available worker  threads  is  lower  than  the
                     given  number,  new  worker  thread will start. The caller will automatically enter the
                     event loop and wait until the worker thread has initialized. If. however, the number of
                     available  worker threads is equal to the given number, the caller will enter the event
                     loop and wait for the first worker thread to get idle,  thus  ready  to  run  the  job.
                     Default  value  of this parameter is 4 (four), which means that the threadpool instance
                     will allow maximum of 4 worker threads running jobs or being idle waiting for new  jobs
                     to get posted to the job queue.

              -idletime seconds
                     Time in seconds an idle worker thread waits for the job to get posted to the job queue.
                     If no job arrives during this interval and the time expires,  the  worker  thread  will
                     check the number of currently available worker threads and if the number is higher than
                     the number set by the <b>minthreads</b> option, it will  exit.   If  an  <b>exitscript</b>  has  been
                     defined, the exiting worker thread will first run the script and then exit. Errors from
                     the exit script, if any, are ignored.

                     The idle worker thread is not servicing the event loop. If you, however, put the worker
                     thread  into the event loop, by evaluating the <b>vwait</b> or other related Tcl commands, the
                     worker thread will not be in the idle state, hence the idle timer  will  not  be  taken
                     into account.  Default value for this option is unspecified, hence, the Tcl interpreter
                     of the worker thread will contain just the initial set of Tcl commands.

              -initcmd script
                     Sets a Tcl script used to initialize new worker thread. This is usually  used  to  load
                     packages  and  commands  in  the  worker, set default variables, create namespaces, and
                     such. If the passed script runs into a Tcl error, the worker will not  be  created  and
                     the  initiating  command  (either  the  <b>tpool::create</b> or <b>tpool::post</b>) will throw error.
                     Default value for this option is unspecified, hence, the Tcl interpreter of the  worker
                     thread will contain just the initial set of Tcl commands.

              -exitcmd script
                     Sets  a  Tcl  script  run  when  the  idle worker thread exits. This is normaly used to
                     cleanup the state of the worker thread, release reserved resources, cleanup memory  and
                     such.  Default value for this option is unspecified, thus no Tcl script will run on the
                     worker thread exit.

       <b>tpool::names</b>
              This command returns a list of IDs of threadpools created with the <b>tpool::create</b>  command.  If
              no threadpools were found, the command will return empty list.

       <b>tpool::post</b> ?-detached? ?-nowait? <u>tpool</u> <u>script</u>
              This  command  sends a <u>script</u> to the target <u>tpool</u> threadpool for execution. The script will be
              executed in the first available idle worker thread. If there are no idle worker threads avail-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able,&nbsp;available,</font>
              able, the command will create new one, enter the event loop and service events until the newly
              created thread is initialized. If the current number of worker threads is equal to the maximum
              number  of  worker  threads, as defined during the threadpool creation, the command will enter
              the event loop and service events while waiting for one of the worker threads to become  idle.
              If the optional ?-nowait? argument is given, the command will not wait for one idle worker. It
              will just place the job in the pool's job queue and return immediately.

              The command returns the ID of the posted job. This ID  is  used  for  subsequent  <b>tpool::wait</b>,
              <b>tpool::get</b> and <b>tpool::cancel</b> commands to wait for and retrieve result of the posted script, or
              cancel the posted job respectively. If the optional ?-detached?  argument  is  specified,  the
              command  will  post  a detached job. A detached job can not be cancelled or waited upon and is
              not identified by the job ID.

              If the threadpool <u>tpool</u> is not found in the list of active  thread  pools,  the  command  will
              throw error. The error will also be triggered if the newly created worker thread fails to ini-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tialize.&nbsp;initialize.</font>
              tialize.

       <b>tpool::wait</b> <u>tpool</u> <u>joblist</u> ?varname?
              This command waits for one or many jobs, whose job IDs are given in the <u>joblist</u>  to  get  pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cessed&nbsp;processed</font>
              cessed  by  the  worker  <!-- a -->thread(s)<!-- /a -->.  If none of the specified jobs are ready, the command will
              enter the event loop, service events and wait for the first job to get ready.

              The command returns the list of completed job IDs.  If  the  optional  variable  ?varname?  is
              given,  it  will  be  set  to  the list of jobs in the <u>joblist</u> which are still pending. If the
              threadpool <u>tpool</u> is not found in the list of active  thread  pools,  the  command  will  throw
              error.

       <b>tpool::cancel</b> <u>tpool</u> <u>joblist</u> ?varname?
              This  command  cancels  the previously posted jobs given by the <u>joblist</u> to the pool <u>tpool</u>. Job
              cancellation succeeds only for job still waiting to be processed. If the job is already  being
              executed by one of the worker threads, the job will not be cancelled.  The command returns the
              list of cancelled job IDs. If the optional variable ?varname? is given, it will be set to  the
              list  of jobs in the <u>joblist</u> which were not cancelled. If the threadpool <u>tpool</u> is not found in
              the list of active thread pools, the command will throw error.

       <b>tpool::get</b> <u>tpool</u> <u>job</u>
              This command retrieves the result of the previously posted <u>job</u>.  Only results of  jobs  waited
              upon with the <b>tpool::wait</b> command can be retrieved. If the execution of the script resulted in
              error, the command will throw the error and update the <b>errorInfo</b> and <b>errorCode</b> variables  cor-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">respondingly.&nbsp;correspondingly.</font>
              respondingly.  If  the  pool  <u>tpool</u>  is not found in the list of threadpools, the command will
              throw error.  If the job <u>job</u> is not ready for retrieval, because it is  currently  being  exe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cuted&nbsp;executed</font>
              cuted by the worker thread, the command will throw error.

       <b>tpool::preserve</b> <u>tpool</u>
              Each call to this command increments the reference counter of the threadpool <u>tpool</u> by one (1).
              Command returns the value of the reference counter after the increment.  By  incrementing  the
              reference  counter,  the caller signalizes that he/she wishes to use the resource for a longer
              period of time.

       <b>tpool::release</b> <u>tpool</u>
              Each call to this command decrements the reference counter of  the  threadpool  <u>tpool</u>  by  one
              (1).Command  returns  the value of the reference counter after the decrement.  When the refer-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ence&nbsp;reference</font>
              ence counter reaches zero (0), the threadpool <u>tpool</u> is marked for termination. You should  not
              reference  the threadpool after the <b>tpool::release</b> command returns zero. The <u>tpool</u> handle goes
              out of scope and should not be used any more. Any following reference to the  same  threadpool
              handle will result in Tcl error.

<b>DISCUSSION</b>
       Threadpool is one of the most common threading paradigm when it comes to server applications handling
       a large number of relatively small tasks.  A very simplistic model for building a server  application
       would  be  to  create  a  new  thread  each time a request arrives and service the request in the new
       thread. One of the disadvantages of this approach is that the overhead of creating a new  thread  for
       each  request  is  significant;  a server that created a new thread for each request would spend more
       time and consume more system resources in creating and destroying threads than in  processing  actual
       user requests. In addition to the overhead of creating and destroying threads, active threads consume
       system resources.  Creating too many threads can cause the system to run out of memory or  trash  due
       to excessive memory consumption.

       A  thread pool offers a solution to both the problem of thread life-cycle overhead and the problem of
       resource trashing. By reusing threads for multiple tasks, the thread-creation overhead is spread over
       many  tasks.   As a bonus, because the thread already exists when a request arrives, the delay intro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">duced&nbsp;introduced</font>
       duced by thread creation is eliminated. Thus, the request can be serviced  immediately.  Furthermore,
       by  properly  tuning  the number of threads in the thread pool, resource thrashing may also be elimi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nated&nbsp;eliminated</font>
       nated by forcing any request to wait until a thread is available to process it.
