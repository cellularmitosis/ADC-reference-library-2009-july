Module 2- Playing a movieAbout this Code Sample----------------------This sample code accompanies the Intro to QuickTime for Java Tutorial located on the Apple Develeloper Connection pages at:http://developer.apple.com/java/qtjtutorial/index.htmlThis module expands upon module 1 and adds a movie that plays in the upper left hand corner of the window. Also in this module, we will learn about movie-related classes such as MoviePlayers and Compositors. We will also learn how to control the playback rate of the movie, start and stop the movie, and present controls to the user. At the end of this module, you will understand how QuickTime handles time-based media and understand how to present a movie in a window.What's Included---------------This package includes all media files required for completing this tutorial section. There is a pre-built application that you can run to see what the completed module will look like, and a data folder that contains media used by the project. Additionally, there is a completed source folder that you can use to compare your java files to in case you run into a compilation error. Finally, there are two directories, a source directory where you should save all of your source files and an output directory where you should put your built class files. For convenience, we have provided a properties file you can use with the MRJ App Builder.Requirements------------To build this sample, you will need Sun's JDK tools (Part of the MRJ SDK on the Macintosh), QuickTime 4.0 or later (4.1 highly recommended), and a Java VM installed.
