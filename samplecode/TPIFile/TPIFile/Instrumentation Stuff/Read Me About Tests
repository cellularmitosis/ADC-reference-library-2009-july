Read Me Abouts TestsThe “Close Tests” and “Async I/O Tests” folders contain the results of some of the traces of TPIFile I’ve done with the Instrumentation SDK.  Inside each folder there is a “Viewer” document that I’ve created to show the traces I’m interested in, and one or more trace documents that contain the raw data.To view the data, double click the “Viewer” document.  This should launch the “Instrumentation Viewer” application and automatically open one of the trace data documents.  If you want to see one of the other traces, drag and drop it on to the application and then choose the trace from the popup menu in the “Viewer” document.You may need to use the application’s time controller to scroll around to see the traces.For those of you without the Instrumentation SDK, the “Async I/O Tests” folder contains a picture of one of the traces as displayed by the application.Share and EnjoyQuinn “The Eskimo!”Apple Developer Technical SupportNetworking, Communications, Hardware9 Apr 1997
