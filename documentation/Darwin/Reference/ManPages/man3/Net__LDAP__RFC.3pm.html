Net::LDAP::RFC(3)                    User Contributed Perl Documentation                   Net::LDAP::RFC(3)



<b>NAME</b>
       Net::LDAP::RFC - List of related RFC's

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
         none

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The LDAP protocol is defined in the following RFC's

<b>Core</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Specification</b>
       <b>RFC-2251</b> <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>(v3)</b>

       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2251.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2251.txt</a>

       The protocol described in this document is designed to provide access to directories supporting the
       X.500 models, while not incurring the resource requirements of the X.500 Directory Access Protocol
       (DAP). This protocol is specifically targeted at management applications and browser applications
       that provide read/write interactive access to directories. When used with a directory supporting the
       X.500 protocols, it is intended to be a complement to the X.500 DAP.

       <b>RFC-2252</b> <b>LDAPv3</b> <b>Attribute</b> <b>Syntax</b> <b>Definitions</b>

       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2252.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2252.txt</a>

       The LDAP requires that the contents of AttributeValue fields in protocol elements be octet strings.
       This document defines a set of syntaxes for LDAPv3, and the rules by which attribute values of these
       syntaxes are represented as octet strings for transmission in the LDAP protocol. The syntaxes defined
       in this document are referenced by this and other documents that define attribute types. This
       document also defines the set of attribute types which LDAP servers should support.

       <b>RFC-2253</b> <b>UTF-8</b> <b>String</b> <b>Representation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Distinguished</b> <b>Names</b>

       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2253.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2253.txt</a>

       The X.500 Directory uses distinguished names as the primary keys to entries in the directory.
       Distinguished Names are encoded in ASN.1 in the X.500 Directory protocols. In the LDAP, a string
       representation of distinguished names is transferred.  This specification defines the string format
       for representing names, which is designed to give a clean representation of commonly used
       distinguished names, while being able to represent any distinguished name.

       <b>RFC-2254</b> <b>The</b> <b>String</b> <b>Representation</b> <b>of</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Search</b> <b>Filters</b>

       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2254.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2254.txt</a>

       The LDAP defines a network representation of a search filter transmitted to an LDAP server. Some
       applications may find it useful to have a common way of representing these search filters in a human-
       readable form. This document defines a human-readable string format for representing LDAP search
       filters. This document replaces RFC 1960, extending the string LDAP filter definition to include
       support for LDAPv3 extended match filters.

       <b>RFC-2255</b> <b>The</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>URL</b> <b>Format</b>

       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2255.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2255.txt</a>

       This document describes a format for an LDAP Uniform Resource Locator, and describes an LDAP search
       operation performed to retrieve information from an LDAP directory. It updates the LDAP URL format
       for LDAPv3. This document also defines a second URL scheme prefix for LDAP running over the TLS
       protocol.

       <b>RFC-2256</b> <b>A</b> <b>Summary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <!-- a --><b>X.500(96)</b><!-- /a --><b></b> <b>User</b> <b>Schema</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> <b>with</b> <b>LDAPv3</b>

       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2256.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2256.txt</a>

       This document provides an overview of the attribute types and object classes defined by the ISO and
       ITU-T committees in the X.500 documents, in particular those intended for use by directory clients.
       This is the most widely used schema for LDAP/X.500 directories, and many other schema definitions for
       white pages objects use it as a basis. This document does not cover attributes used for the
       administration of X.500 directory servers, nor does it include attributes defined by other ISO/ITU-T
       documents.

<b>Other</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Related</b> <b>RFCs</b>
       <b>RFC-1823</b> <b>The</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Application</b> <b>Program</b> <b>Interface</b>

       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1823.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1823.txt</a>

       This document defines a C language application program interface to LDAP, which is designed to be
       powerful, yet simple to use. It defines compatible synchronous and asynchronous interfaces to LDAP to
       suit a wide variety of applications. This document gives a brief overview of the LDAP model, then an
       overview of how the API is used by an application program to obtain LDAP information. The API calls
       are described in detail, followed by an appendix that provides some example code demonstrating the
       use of the API.

       <b>RFC-2079</b> <b>Definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>X.500</b> <b>Attribute</b> <b>Type</b> <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>Object</b> <b>Class</b> <b>to</b> <b>Hold</b> <b>Uniform</b> <b>Resource</b>
       <b>Identifiers</b>

       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2079.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2079.txt</a>

       URLs are being widely used to specify the location of Internet resources. There is an urgent need to
       be able to include URLs in directories that conform to the LDAP and X.500 information models, and a
       desire to include other types of URIs as they are defined. A number of independent groups are already
       experimenting with the inclusion of URLs in LDAP and X.500 directories. This document builds on the
       experimentation to date and defines a new attribute type and an auxiliary object class to allow URIs,
       including URLs, to be stored in directory entries in a standard way.

       <b>RFC-2164</b> <b>Use</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>X.500/LDAP</b> <b>directory</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>MIXER</b> <b>address</b> <b>mapping</b>

       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2164.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2164.txt</a>

       MIXER (RFC 2156) defines an algorithm for use of a set of global mapping between X.400 and RFC 822
       addresses. This specification defines how to represent and maintain these mappings (MIXER Conformant
       Global Address Mappings of MCGAMs) in an X.500 or LDAP directory. Mechanisms for representing OR
       Address and Domain hierarchies within the DIT. These techniques are used to define two independent
       subtrees in the DIT, which contain the mapping information.

       <b>RFC-2218</b> <b>A</b> <b>Common</b> <b>Schema</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>White</b> <b>Pages</b> <b>Service</b>

       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2218.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2218.txt</a>

       This IETF Integrated Directory Services(IDS) Working Group proposes a standard specification for a
       simple Internet White Pages service by defining a common schema for use by the various White Pages
       servers. This schema is independent of specific implementations of the White Pages service. This
       document specifies the minimum set of core attributes of a White Pages entry for an individual and
       describes how new objects with those attributes can be defined and published. It does not describe
       how to represent other objects in the White Pages service. Further, it does not address the search
       sort expectations within a particular service.

       <b>RFC-2222</b> <b>Simple</b> <b>Authentication</b> <b>and</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Layer</b> <b>(SASL)</b>

       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2222.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2222.txt</a>

       This document describes a method for adding authentication support to connection-based protocols. To
       use this specification, a protocol includes a command for identifying and authenticating a user to a
       server and for optionally negotiating protection of subsequent protocol interactions. If its use is
       negotiated, a security layer is inserted between the protocol and the connection. This document
       describes how a protocol specifies such a command, defines several mechanisms for use by the command,
       and defines the protocol used for carrying a negotiated security layer over the connection.

       <b>RFC-2247</b> <b>Using</b> <b>Domains</b> <b>in</b> <b>LDAP/X.500</b> <b>Distinguished</b> <b>Names</b>

       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2247.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2247.txt</a>

       LDAP uses X.500-compatible distinguished names for providing unique identification of entries. This
       document defines an algorithm by which a name registered with the Internet Domain Name Service can be
       represented as an LDAP distinguished name.

       <b>RFC-2307</b> <b>An</b> <b>Approach</b> <b>for</b> <b>Using</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Network</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Service</b>

       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2307.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2307.txt</a>

       This document describes an experimental mechanism for mapping entities related to TCP/IP and the UNIX
       system into X.500 entries so that they may be resolved with the LDAP. A set of attribute types and
       object classes are proposed, along with specific guidelines for interpreting them. The intention is
       to assist the deployment of LDAP as an organizational nameservice.  No proposed solutions are
       intended as standards for the Internet. Rather, it is hoped that a general consensus will emerge as
       to the appropriate solution to such problems, leading eventually to the adoption of standards. The
       proposed mechanism has already been implemented with some success.

       <b>RFC-2559</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>X.509</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Key</b> <b>Infrastructure</b> <b>Operational</b> <b>Protocols</b> <b>-</b> <b>LDAPv2</b>

       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2559.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2559.txt</a>

       The protocol described in this document is designed to satisfy some of the operational requirements
       within the Internet X.509 PKI. Specifically, this document addresses requirements to provide access
       to PKI repositories for the purposes of retrieving PKI information and managing that same
       information.  The mechanism described in this document is based on the LDAPv2, defined in RFC 1777,
       defining a profile of that protocol for use within the PKIX and updates encodings for certificates
       and revocation lists from RFC 1778. Additional mechanisms addressing PKIX operational requirements
       are specified in separate documents.

       <b>RFC-2587</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>X.509</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Key</b> <b>Infrastructure</b> <b>LDAPv2</b> <b>Schema</b>

       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2587.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2587.txt</a>

       The schema defined in this document is a minimal schema to support PKIX in an LDAPv2 environment, as
       defined in RFC 2559.  Only PKIX-specific components are specified here. LDAP servers, acting as PKIX
       repositories should support the auxiliary object classes defined in this specification and integrate
       this schema specification with the generic and other application-specific schemas as appropriate,
       depending on the services to be supplied by that server.

       <b>RFC-2589</b> <b>Extensions</b> <b>for</b> <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Services</b>

       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2589.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2589.txt</a>

       LDAP supports lightweight access to static directory services, allowing relatively fast search and
       update access. Static directory services store information about people that persists in its accuracy
       and value over a long period of time. Dynamic directory services are different in that they store
       information about people that only persists in its accuracy and value while people are online. Though
       the protocol operations and attributes used by dynamic directory services are similar to the ones
       used for static directory services, clients that are bound to a dynamic directory service need to
       periodically refresh their presence at the server to keep directory entries from getting stale in the
       presence of client application crashes. A flow control mechanism from the server is also described
       that allows a server to inform clients how often they should refresh their presence.

       <b>RFC-2596</b> <b>Use</b> <b>of</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Codes</b> <b>in</b> <b>LDAP</b>

       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2596.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2596.txt</a>

       LDAP provides a means for clients to interrogate and modify information stored in a distributed
       directory system. The information in the directory is maintained as attributes of entries. Most of
       these attributes have syntaxes which are human-readable strings, and it is desirable to be able to
       indicate the natural language associated with attribute values.  This document describes how language
       codes are carried in LDAP and are to be interpreted by LDAP servers. All implementations MUST be
       prepared to accept language codes in the LDAP protocols. Servers may or may not be capable of storing
       attributes with language codes in the directory.

       <b>RFC-2649</b> <b>Signed</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Operations</b> <b>Using</b> <b>S/MIME</b>

       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2649.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2649.txt</a>

       This document defines an LDAPv3 based mechanism for signing directory operations in order to create a
       secure journal of changes that have been made to each directory entry. Both client and server based
       signatures are supported. An object class for subsequent retrieval are 'journal entries' is also
       defined. This document specifies LDAPv3 controls that enable this functionality. It also defines an
       LDAPv3 schema that allows for subsequent browsing of the journal information.

       <b>RFC-2657</b> <b>LDAPv2</b> <b>Client</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>the</b> <b>Index</b> <b>Mesh</b>

       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2657.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2657.txt</a>

       LDAPv2 clients as implemented according to RFC 1777 have no notion of referral. The integration
       between such a client and an Index Mesh, as defined by the Common Indexing Protocol, heavily depends
       on referrals and therefore needs to be handled in a special way. This document defines one possible
       way of doing this.

       <b>RFC-2696</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Extension</b> <b>for</b> <b>Simple</b> <b>Paged</b> <b>Results</b> <b>Manipulation</b>

       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2696.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2696.txt</a>

       This document describes an LDAPv3 control extension for simple paging of search results. This control
       extension allows a client to control the rate at which an LDAP server returns the results of an LDAP
       search operation. This control may be useful when the LDAP client has limited resources and may not
       be able to process the entire result set from a given LDAP query, or when the LDAP client is
       connected over a low-bandwidth connection. Other operations on the result set are not defined in this
       extension. This extension is not designed to provide more sophisticated result set management.

       <b>RFC-2713</b> <b>Schema</b> <b>for</b> <b>Representing</b> <b>Java</b> <b>Objects</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Directory</b>

       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2713.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2713.txt</a>

       This document defines the schema for representing Java objects in an LDAP directory. It defines
       schema elements to represent a Java serialized object, a Java marshalled object, a Java remote
       object, and a JNDI reference.

       <b>RFC-2714</b> <b>Schema</b> <b>for</b> <b>Representing</b> <b>CORBA</b> <b>Objects</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Directory</b>

       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2714.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2714.txt</a>

       CORBA is the Common Object Request Broker Architecture defined by the Object Management Group. This
       document defines the schema for representing CORBA object references in an LDAP directory.

       <b>RFC-2739</b> <b>Calendar</b> <b>Attributes</b> <b>for</b> <b>vCard</b> <b>and</b> <b>LDAP</b>

       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2739.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2739.txt</a>

       When scheduling a calendar entity, such as an event, it is a prerequisite that an organizer has the
       calendar address of each attendee that will be invited to the event. Additionally, access to an
       attendee's current "busy time" provides an a priori indication of whether the attendee will be free
       to participate in the event. In order to meet these challenges, a calendar user agent (CUA) needs a
       mechanism to locate individual user's calendar and free/busy time. This memo defines three mechanisms
       for obtaining a URI to a user's calendar and free/busy time. These include:

       <b>RFC-2798</b> <b>Definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inetOrgPerson</b> <b>Object</b> <b>Class</b>

       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2798.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2798.txt</a>

       While the X.500 standards define many useful attribute types [X520] and object classes [X521], they
       do not define a person object class that meets the requirements found in today's Internet and
       Intranet directory service deployments. We define a new object class called inetOrgPerson for use in
       LDAP and X.500 directory services that extends the X.521 standard organizationalPerson class to meet
       these needs.

       <b>RFC-2820</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>LDAP</b>

       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2820.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2820.txt</a>

       This document describes the fundamental requirements of an access control list (ACL) model for the
       LDAP directory service.  It is intended to be a gathering place for access control requirements
       needed to provide authorized access to and interoperability between directories.

       <b>RFC-2829</b> <b>Authentication</b> <b>Methods</b> <b>for</b> <b>LDAP</b>

       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2829.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2829.txt</a>

       This document specifies particular combinations of SASL mechanisms and extensions which are required
       and recommended in LDAP implementations.

       <b>RFC-2831</b> <b>Using</b> <b>Digest</b> <b>Authentication</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>SASL</b> <b>Mechanism</b>

       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2831.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2831.txt</a>

       This specification defines how HTTP Digest Authentication can be used as a SASL [RFC 2222] mechanism
       for any protocol that has a SASL profile. It is intended both as an improvement over CRAM-MD5 [RFC
       2195] and as a convenient way to support a single authentication mechanism for web, mail, LDAP, and
       other protocols.

       <b>RFC-2891</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Extension</b> <b>for</b> <b>Server</b> <b>Side</b> <b>Sorting</b> <b>of</b> <b>Search</b> <b>Results</b>

       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2891.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2891.txt</a>

       This document describes two LDAPv3 control extensions for server side sorting of search results.
       These controls allows a client to specify the attribute types and matching rules a server should use
       when returning the results to an LDAP search request. The controls may be useful when the LDAP client
       has limited functionality or for some other reason cannot sort the results but still needs them
       sorted. Other permissible controls on search operations are not defined in this extension.

       <b>RFC-2849</b> <b>The</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Interchange</b> <b>Format</b> <b>(LDIF)</b> <b>-</b> <b>Technical</b> <b>Specification</b>

       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2849.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2849.txt</a>

       This document describes a file format suitable for describing directory information or modifications
       made to directory information. The file format, known as LDIF, for LDAP Data Interchange Format, is
       typically used to import and export directory information between LDAP-based directory servers, or to
       describe a set of changes which are to be applied to a directory.

       <b>draft-armijo-ldap-control-error</b> <b>--</b> <b>Result</b> <b>Message</b> <b>for</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Controls</b>

       LDAPv3 allows for the extension of the protocol through the use of controls. These controls allow
       existing operations to be enhanced to provide additional functionality for directory operations.
       Complex controls are being established that are bringing up error conditions not anticipated in the
       LDAPv3 specifications. The purpose of this draft is to create new result codes specific to LDAP
       controls and to define guidelines for the use of these result codes.

       <b>draft-armijo-ldap-treedelete</b> <b>--</b> <b>Tree</b> <b>Delete</b> <b>Control</b>

       This document defines an LDAPv3 control that deletes an entire subtree of a container entry. This
       control extends the scope of the LDAPv3 delete operation as defined in RFC 2251. This control is
       beneficial in extending the functionality of the LDAP protocol and may be useful in administration in
       an LDAP environment.

       <b>draft-behera-ldap-password-policy</b> <b>--</b> <b>Password</b> <b>Policy</b> <b>for</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Directories</b>

       Password policy is a set of rules that controls how passwords are used in LDAP directories. In order
       to improve the security of LDAP directories and make it difficult for password cracking programs to
       break into directories, it is desirable to enforce a set of rules on password usage. These rules are
       made to ensure that users change their passwords periodically, passwords meet construction
       requirements, the re-use of old password is restricted, and users are locked out after a certain
       number of failed attempts.

       <b>draft-daigle-tisdag</b> <b>--</b> <b>Technical</b> <b>Infrastructure</b> <b>for</b> <b>Swedish</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Gateways</b> <b>(TISDAG)</b>

       The strength of the TISDAG project's DAG proposal is that it defines the necessary technical
       infrastructure to provide a single-access-point service for information on Swedish Internet users.
       The resulting service will provide uniform access for all information -- the same level of access to
       information (7x24 service), and the same information made available, irrespective of the service
       provider responsible for maintaining that information, their directory service protocols, or the end-
       user's client access protocol.

       <b>draft-good-ldap-changelog</b> <b>--</b> <b>Definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>Object</b> <b>Class</b> <b>to</b> <b>Hold</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Change</b> <b>Records</b>

       In  order to  support more flexible  replication methods, it  is desirable  to specify  some manner
       in  which an LDAP client  may retrieve  a set  of changes which have  been applied to an  LDAP
       server's  database.  The  client,  which  may  be  another  LDAP server,  may then  choose to update
       its own replicated copy  of the  data. This document specifies an object class which  may be used  to
       represent  changes applied to  an LDAP server. It  also specifies   a  method  for  discovering  the
       location   of  the container  object  which  holds these  change records,  so  that clients  and
       servers  have a  common rendezvous  point for  this information.

       <b>draft-greenblatt-ldapext-sos</b> <b>--</b> <b>Simple</b> <b>Operations</b> <b>on</b> <b>Subtrees</b> <b>(for</b> <b>LDAP)</b>

       This draft defines several new LDAP extensions, which are operations that can manipulate an entire
       portion of Directory Information Tree (DIT) at once. This draft does not presume any specific DIT
       structure or schema modifications.

       <b>draft-greenblatt-ldapextstyle</b> <b>--</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Extension</b> <b>Style</b> <b>Guide</b>

       LDAPv3 provides a base set of services. Additionally, LDAP provides several mechanisms by which the
       base set of services may be enhanced to provide additional services. This document describes the
       different ways that LDAP may be enhanced, and how developers can decide which enhancement mechanism
       is best suited for their environment. It also discusses the positives and negatives for each LDAP
       enhancement mechanism

       <b>draft-haripriya-ldapext-entryselect</b> <b>--</b> <b>EntrySelection</b> <b>Control</b> <b>for</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Modify</b> <b>and</b> <b>Delete</b> <b>Operations</b>
       <b>on</b> <b>Multiple</b> <b>Entries</b>

       This document defines an LDAPv3 control that can select multiple entries in a subtree of a container
       entry for modification or deletion. This control extends the scope of the LDAPv3 modify and delete
       operations as defined in [RFC 2251].  This control is useful for modifying or deleting multiple
       entries on the basis of a single selection criterion. This may be useful for maintenance of an LDAP
       directory having a large number of objects.

       <b>draft-hodges-ldapv3-as</b> <b>--</b> <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>(v3):</b> <b>Applicability</b> <b>Statement</b>

       The specification for LDAPv3 nominally comprises eight separte RFCs which were issued in two distinct
       subsets at separate times (RFCs 2251..2256 first, then RFCs 2229 and 2830 following later), but this
       has never been formally stated. Additionally, RFCs 2251 .. 2256 each are embellished with an "IESG
       Note" warning implementors and deployers of potential interoperability problems due to the lack of a
       specification of mandatory-to-implement authentication <!-- a -->mechanism(s)<!-- /a -->. This document corrects both
       situations by explicitly specifying the set of RFCs comprising LDAPv3 and rescinding the "IESG Note"
       due to the specification of mandatory-to-implement authentication mechanisms in RFC 2829.

       <b>draft-ietf-ldapext-acl-model</b> <b>--</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Model</b> <b>for</b> <b>LDAP</b>

       This document describes the access control list (ACL) model for an LDAP directory service. It
       includes a description of the model, the LDAP controls, and the extended operations to the LDAP
       protocol. A separate document defines the corresponding APIs.

       <b>draft-ietf-ldapext-cldap</b> <b>--</b> <b>Connection-less</b> <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Protocol</b>

       This memo describes modifications to LDAPv3 to allow transport of a subset of the LDAP protocol over
       connection-less transport. The case of UDP/IP is covered in detail in this memo but other transport
       layers are possible.

       <b>draft-ietf-ldapext-ldap-c-api</b> <b>--</b> <b>The</b> <b>C</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Application</b> <b>Program</b> <b>Interface</b>

       This document defines a C language application program interface to LDAP, and replaces the previous
       definition of this API, defined in RFC 1823, updating it to include support for features found in
       LDAPv3, as well as other changes to support information hiding and thread safety.

       <b>draft-ietf-ldapext-ldap-java-api</b> <b>--</b> <b>The</b> <b>Java</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Application</b> <b>Program</b> <b>Interface</b>

       This document defines a java language application program interface to the LDAP, in the form of a
       class library. It complements but does not replace the C language API. This version adds support for
       SASL authentication.

       <b>draft-ietf-ldapext-ldap-taxonomy</b> <b>--</b> <b>A</b> <b>Taxonomy</b> <b>of</b> <b>Methods</b> <b>for</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Clients</b> <b>Finding</b> <b>Servers</b>

       There  are several different methods for a LDAP client to find a LDAP  server. This  draft discusses
       these methods and  provides pointers   for   interested   parties  to   learn   more   about
       implementing a particular method.

       <b>draft-ietf-ldapext-ldapv3-dupent</b> <b>--</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Control</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>Duplicate</b> <b>Entry</b> <b>Representation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Search</b>
       <b>Results</b>

       This document describes a Duplicate Entry Representation control extension for the LDAP Search
       operation. By using the control with an LDAP search, a client requests that the server return
       separate entries for each value held in the specified attributes. For instance, if a specified
       attribute of an entry holds multiple values, the search operation will return multiple instances of
       that entry, each instance holding a separate single value in that attribute.

       <b>draft-ietf-ldapext-ldapv3-vlv</b> <b>--</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Extensions</b> <b>for</b> <b>Scrolling</b> <b>View</b> <b>Browsing</b> <b>of</b> <b>Search</b> <b>Results</b>

       This  document describes a  Virtual List View control  extension for  the  LDAP Search  operation.
       This control  is designed  to allow  the  ''virtual  list box''  feature, common  in  existing
       commercial  e-mail address  book applications,  to be  supported efficiently  by LDAP servers. LDAP
       servers' inability to support this   client  feature  is  a  significant  impediment  to  LDAP
       replacing  proprietary protocols  in commercial e-mail  systems.

       <b>draft-ietf-ldapext-locate</b> <b>--</b> <b>Discovering</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Services</b> <b>with</b> <b>DNS</b>

       An  LDAP request must be  directed to an appropriate  server for processing.  This document
       specifies a  method for  discovering such  servers  using  information  in the  Domain  Name  System.

       <b>draft-ietf-ldapext-matchedval</b> <b>--</b> <b>Returning</b> <b>Matched</b> <b>Values</b> <b>with</b> <b>LDAPv3</b>

       This document describes a control for the LDAPv3 that is used to return a subset of attribute values
       from an entry, specifically, only those values that contributed to the search filter evaluating to
       TRUE. Without support for this control, a client must retrieve all of an attribute's values and
       search for specific values locally.

       <b>draft-ietf-ldapext-psearch</b> <b>--</b> <b>Persistent</b> <b>Search:</b> <b>A</b> <b>Simple</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Change</b> <b>Notification</b> <b>Mechanism</b>

       This document defines two controls that extend the LDAPv3 search operation to provide a simple
       mechanism by which an LDAP client can receive notification of changes that occur in an LDAP server.
       The mechanism is designed to be very flexible yet easy for clients and servers to implement.

       <b>draft-ietf-ldapext-refer</b> <b>--</b> <b>Referrals</b> <b>in</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Directories</b>

       This document defines two reference attributes and associated "referral" object class for
       representing generic knowledge information in LDAP directories. The attribute uses URIs to represent
       knowledge, enabling LDAP and non-LDAP services alike to be referenced. The object class can be used
       to construct entries in an LDAP directory containing references to other directories or services.
       This document also defines procedures directory servers should follow when supporting these schema
       elements and when responding to requests for which the directory server does not contain the
       requested object but may contain some knowledge of the location of the requested object.

       <b>draft-ietf-ldapext-x509-sasl</b> <b>--</b> <b>X.509</b> <b>Authentication</b> <b>SASL</b> <b>Mechanism</b>

       This document defines a SASL [RFC 2222] authentication mechanism based on X.509 strong
       authentication, providing two way authentication. This mechanism is only for authentication, and has
       no effect on the protocol encodings and is not designed to provide integrity or confidentiality
       services.

       <b>draft-ietf-ldup-framing</b> <b>--</b> <b>Extended</b> <b>Operations</b> <b>for</b> <b>Framing</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Operations</b>

       Certain types of LDAP applications can benefit from the ability to specify the beginning and end of a
       related group of operations. For example, the LDUP multimaster update protocol requires that two
       servers agree to begin a session to transfer pending replication updates. This document provides a
       framework for constructing protocols that feature a framed set of related operations. It defines a
       pair of LDAPv3 extended operations that provide begin-end framing, and a pair of extended operations
       used to respond the begin-end framing operations.  The nature of the actual LDAP operations carried
       inside these framing operations is not specified in this document.

       <b>draft-ietf-ldup-infomod</b> <b>--</b> <b>LDUP</b> <b>Replication</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Model</b>

       draft-merrells-ldup-model (v1) describes the architectural approach to replication of LDAP directory
       contents. This document describes the information model and schema elements which support LDAP
       Replication Services

       <b>draft-ietf-ldup-model</b> <b>--</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Replication</b> <b>Architecture</b>

       This  architectural  document  outlines a  suite of  schema  and protocol   extensions  to   LDAPv3
       that  enables  the   robust, reliable,  server-to-server  exchange of  directory content  and
       changes.

       <b>draft-ietf-ldup-protocol</b> <b>--</b> <b>The</b> <b>LDUP</b> <b>Replication</b> <b>Update</b> <b>Protocol</b>

       The protocol described in this document is designed to allow one LDAP server to replicate its
       directory content to another LDAP server. The protocol is designed to be used in a replication
       configuration where multiple updatable servers are present. Provisions are made in the protocol to
       carry information that allows the server receiving updates to apply a total ordering to all updates
       in the replicated system. This total ordering allows all replicas to correctly resolve conflicts that
       arise when LDAP clients submit changes to different servers that later replicate to one another.

       <b>draft-ietf-ldup-replica-req</b> <b>--</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>V3</b> <b>Replication</b> <b>Requirements</b>

       This   document  discusses  the  fundamental   requirements  for replication  of data accessible via
       the LDAPv3 protocol. It  is intended  to  be  a  gathering  place  for  general  replication
       requirements   needed   to  provide   interoperability   between informational directories.

       <b>draft-ietf-ldup-subentry</b> <b>--</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Subentry</b> <b>Schema</b>

       This  document  describes an  object  class called  ldapSubEntry which  MAY be used to indicate
       operations and management related entries  in the directory, called LDAP Subentries.  This version of
       this  document  is updated  with  an  assigned OID  for  the ldapSubEntry object class.

       <b>draft-ietf-ldup-urp</b> <b>--</b> <b>LDUP</b> <b>Update</b> <b>Reconciliation</b> <b>Procedures</b>

       This document describes the procedures used by directory servers to reconcile updates performed by
       autonomously operating directory servers in a distributed, replicated directory service.

       <b>draft-ietf-pkix-ldap-schema</b> <b>--</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>X.509</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Key</b> <b>Infrastructure</b> <b>Additional</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Schema</b> <b>for</b>
       <b>PKIs</b> <b>and</b> <b>PMIs</b>

       This document describes LDAP schema features in addition to RFC 2587 that are needed to support a
       Privilege Management Infrastructure and a Public Key Infrastructure. RFC2587 describes some of the
       subschema applicable to LDAPv2 servers, specifically the public key certificate related attribute
       types and object classes that MUST or MAY be supported. This document does not revoke any of the
       contents of RFC2587, but supplements them. RFC2587 is equally applicable to LDAPv3 servers as to
       LDAPv2 servers and MUST be supported by LDAPv3 servers. Neither RFC2587 nor the user schema for
       LDAPv3 (RFC2256) nor the attribute syntax definitions for LDAPv3 (RFC2252) describe in detail the
       matching rules that should be supported by LDAP servers, nor do they describe how attribute value
       assertions for each matching rule should be encoded in filter items.  Finally none of these documents
       mention attributeCertificates or any schema to support privilege management, since these concepts
       superseded the publishing of the RFCs.

       <b>draft-just-ldapv3-rescodes</b> <b>--</b> <b>LDAPv3</b> <b>Result</b> <b>Codes:</b> <b>Definitions</b> <b>and</b> <b>Appropriate</b> <b>Use</b>

       The purpose of this document is to describe, in some detail, the meaning and use of the result codes
       used with the LDAPv3 protocol. Of particular importance are the error codes, which represent the
       majority of the result codes. This document provides definitions for each result code, and outlines
       the expected behaviour of the various operations with respect to how result codes and in particular,
       error conditions should be handled and which specific error code should be returned. It is hoped that
       this document will facilitate interoperability between clients and servers and the development of
       intelligent LDAP clients capable of acting upon the results received from the server.

       <b>draft-mmeredith-rootdse-vendor-info</b> <b>--</b> <b>Storing</b> <b>Vendor</b> <b>Information</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>root</b> <b>DSE</b>

       This document specifies two LDAP attributes, vendorName and vendorVersion that MAY be included in the
       root DSE to advertise vendor-specific information. These two attributes supplement the attributes
       defined in section 3.4 of RFC 2251. The information held in these attributes MAY be used for display
       and informational purposes and MUST NOT be used for feature advertisement or discovery.

       This draft presents a LDAPv3 schema for the DMTF CIM Core model. Associations are mapped using a
       combination of auxiliary classes and DIT structure rules. All attribute, object class, and name form
       OIDs are place holders, and syntax OIDs in definitions have been replaced by names for clarity.
       Further, structure rule identifiers are place holders and should be replaced as dictated by local
       implementations. (This document is a product of the DMTF LDAP WG.)

       <b>draft-moats-ldap-dereference-match</b> <b>--</b> <b>Extensible</b> <b>Match</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>to</b> <b>Dereference</b> <b>Pointers</b>

       This document defines a LDAPv3 extensible matching rule that allows a server to dereference pointers
       stored in an object's attribute and apply a LDAPv3 search filter to the resulting objects. This rule
       allows schema definitions to capture richer association models without requiring extra protocol
       exchanges or special client code.

       <b>draft-natarajan-ldapext-cachedresults</b> <b>--</b> <b>The</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Caching</b> <b>model</b>

       Seeking entries from a directory is a process involving network resources. It is assumed that a
       directory is accessed for reading and searching data more than for modification purposes.  Under such
       assumptions, for performance reasons, a mechanism for caching as a proxy which caches all entries is
       desirable.  This document describes a mechanism for caching directory entries. This document also
       defines one operational attribute and two controls required to be implemented for the caching model.

       <b>draft-natkovich-ldap-lcup</b> <b>--</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Client</b> <b>Update</b> <b>Protocol</b>

       This document defines the LDAP Client Update Protocol (LCUP).  The protocol is intended to allow an
       LDAP client to synchronize with the content of a directory information tree (DIT) stored by an LDAP
       server and to be notified about the changes to that content.

       <b>draft-rharrison-lburp</b> <b>--</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Bulk</b> <b>Update/Replication</b> <b>Protocol</b>

       The LDAP Bulk Update/Replication Protocol (LBURP) described in this document allows an LDAP client (a
       genuine client or an LDAP server acting as a client) to perform a bulk update to a replica on an LDAP
       server. The protocol groups a set of update operations using the LDAP framed protocol requests
       defined in [FRAMING] to notify the client that the update operations in the framed set are related.
       The update operations within the framed set are LDAPv3 extended operations each encapsulating a
       sequence number and one or more LDAPv3 update operations. The sequence number allows the server to
       process the update operations in the proper order even when they are sent asynchronously by the
       client, and the update operations can be grouped within the extended request to maximize the
       efficiency of client-server communication.

       <b>draft-rharrison-ldap-extpartresp</b> <b>--</b> <b>Extended</b> <b>Partial</b> <b>Response</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>Enhancement</b> <b>to</b> <b>LDAPv3</b>

       This document describes the ExtendedPartialResponse, an element of LDAP v3 protocol which allows
       multiple responses to LDAPv3 extended requests. Extended partial responses are backward compatible
       with the existing LDAPv3 Extended Operation defined in LDAPv3..

       <b>draft-salzr-ldap-repsig</b> <b>--</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Controls</b> <b>for</b> <b>Reply</b> <b>Signatures</b>

       In many environments the final step of certificate issuance is publishing the certificate to a
       repository. Unfortunately, there is no way for a Certification Authority (CA) to have a secure
       application-level acknowledgement that the proper repository did, in fact, receive the certificate.
       This issue is of greater concern when considering the publication of Certificate Revocation Lists
       (CRLs) -- if an adversary manages to interpose itself between the CA and its intended repository,
       then clients could end up relying on outdated revocation lists.

       <b>draft-smith-ldap-c-api-ext-lderrno</b> <b>--</b> <b>C</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>API</b> <b>LDERRNO</b> <b>Extension</b>

       This document defines an extension to the C LDAP API to support reporting of specific errors for
       functions in the API that do not provide a way to access detailed information about failures. Three
       new functions are defined: <u>ldap</u><b>_</b><u>get</u><b>_</b><u>lderrno()</u>, <u>ldap</u><b>_</b><u>set</u><b>_</b><u>lderrno()</u>, and <u>ldap</u><b>_</b><u>dup</u><b>_</b><u>string()</u>.

       <b>draft-smith-ldap-c-api-ext-vlv</b> <b>--</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>C</b> <b>API</b> <b>Virtual</b> <b>List</b> <b>View</b> <b>Extension</b> <b>(VLV)</b>

       This document defines a virtual list view extension for the LDAP C API to support the LDAP protocol
       extensions for scrolling view browsing of search results. More specifically, this document defines
       functions to create virtual list view request controls and to parse virtual list view response
       controls.

       <b>draft-smith-ldapv3-filter-update</b> <b>--</b> <b>The</b> <b>String</b> <b>Representation</b> <b>of</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Search</b> <b>Filters</b>

       LDAP defines a network representation of a search filter transmitted to an LDAP server. Some
       applications may find it useful to have a common way of representing these search filters in a human-
       readable form. This document defines a human-readable string format for representing the full range
       of possible LDAPv3 search filters, including extended match filters.

       <b>draft-wahl-ldap-adminaddr</b> <b>--</b> <b>Administrator</b> <b>Address</b> <b>Attribute</b>

       Organizations running multiple directory servers need an ability for administrators to determine who
       is responsible for a particular server. This is conceptually similar to the 'sysContact' object of
       SNMP. The administratorsAddress attribute allows a server administrator to provide the contact
       information of the responsible party for an LDAP server. This can be used by management clients which
       are, for example, checking the state of a replication or referral topology, to provide a way for the
       user of the management client to send email to manager of a particular server.

       <b>draft-wahl-ldap-digest-example</b> <b>--</b> <b>An</b> <b>Example</b> <b>of</b> <b>DIGEST-MD5</b> <b>Authentication</b> <b>within</b> <b>an</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>server</b>

       HTTP Digest Authentication as a SASL mechanism is required to be supported in LDAP servers for
       password-based authentication (see Authentication Methods for LDAP). This specification describes one
       approach to implement DIGEST-MD5 authentication in an LDAP server. It does not specify a standard of
       any kind.

       <b>draft-weltman-java-sasl</b> <b>--</b> <b>The</b> <b>Java</b> <b>SASL</b> <b>Application</b> <b>Program</b> <b>Interface</b>

       This document defines a client-side and a server-side Java language interface for using the Simple
       Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) mechanisms for adding authentication support to connection-
       based protocols. The interface promotes sharing of SASL mechanism drivers and security layers between
       applications using different protocols. It complements but does not replace [SASL], which defines and
       exemplifies use of the SASL protocol in a language-independent way.

       <b>draft-weltman-ldap-java-controls</b> <b>--</b> <b>Java</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Controls</b>

       This   document  defines  support  for  the  Preferred  Language Control,  the  Server  Sorting
       Control, and  the  Virtual  List Control  in the Java LDAP API. Controls are an LDAPv3 extension, to
       allow  passing arbitrary  control information  along with  a standard   request  to  a  server,  and
       to   receive  arbitrary information back with a standard result.

       <b>draft-weltman-ldapv3-auth-response</b> <b>--</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Authentication</b> <b>Response</b> <b>Control</b>

       This document defines support for the Authentication Response Control. Controls are an LDAPv3
       extension, to allow passing arbitrary control information along with a standard request to a server,
       and to receive arbitrary information back with a standard result. The Authentication Response Control
       may be returned by an LDAP server in a bind response to a client authenticating with LDAPv3. The
       control contains the identity assumed by the client. This is useful when there is a mapping step or
       other indirection during the bind, so that the client can be told what LDAP identity was granted.
       Client authentication with certificates is the primary situation where this applies. Also, some SASL
       authentication mechanisms may not involve the client explicitly providing a DN.

       <b>draft-weltman-ldapv3-proxy</b> <b>--</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Proxied</b> <b>Authorization</b> <b>Control</b>

       This document defines support for the Proxied Authorization Control. Controls are an LDAPv3
       extension, to allow passing arbitrary control information along with a standard request to a server,
       and to receive arbitrary information back with a standard result. The Proxied Authorization Control
       allows a connection with sufficient privileges to assume the identity of another entry for the
       duration of an LDAP request.

       <b>draft-zeilenga-ldap-authpasswd</b> <b>--</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Authentication</b> <b>Password</b> <b>Attribute</b>

       This document describes schema for storing authentication passwords in an LDAP directory. The
       document provides schema definitions for authPassword and related schema definitions.  The
       authPassword is intended to used instead of clear text password storage mechanisms such as
       userPassword [RFC2256] to support simple bind operations. The attribute may be used to store SASL
       authentication passwords in entries of a directory.

       <b>draft-zeilenga-ldap-c-api-concurrency</b> <b>--</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>C</b> <b>API</b> <b>Concurrency</b> <b>Extensions</b>

       This document defines extensions to the LDAP C API to support use in concurrent execution
       environments. The document describes and defines requirements for multiple concurrency levels: thread
       safe, session thread safe, and operation thread safe.

       <b>draft-zeilenga-ldap-c-api-errno</b> <b>--</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>C</b> <b>API</b> <b>Error</b> <b>Reporting</b> <b>Extension</b>

       This document defines a mandatory extension to the LDAP C API to provide error reporting for all API
       calls. The mechanism is non-intrusive and can, optionally, support concurrent execution environments.

       <b>draft-zeilenga-ldap-grouping</b> <b>--</b> <b>LDAPv3:</b> <b>Grouping</b> <b>of</b> <b>Related</b> <b>Operations</b>

       This document provides a general mechanisms for grouping related LDAP operations, which may be used
       to support replication, proxies, and higher level operations such as transactions. This document
       describes a set of LDAP extended operations and other protocol and schema elements to support
       grouping of related operations.

       <b>draft-zeilenga-ldap-namedref</b> <b>--</b> <b>Named</b> <b>References</b> <b>in</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Directories</b>

       This document defines schema and protocol elements for representing and manipulating generic
       knowledge information in LDAP directories. An attribute type "ref" is used to store URIs which may
       refer to LDAP and non-LDAP services. An object class "referral" is used to construct entries in an
       LDAP directory which references to other directories or services. A control, ManageDsaIT, is defined
       to allow clients to manipulate referral objects as normal entries. The document describes procedures
       directory servers should follow when supporting these elements.

       <b>draft-zeilenga-ldap-passwd-exop</b> <b>--</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Password</b> <b>Modify</b> <b>Extended</b> <b>Operation</b>

       The integration of LDAP and external authentication services has introducted non-DN authentication
       identities and allowed for non-directory storage of passwords. As such, mechanisms which update the
       directory, such as Modify operation, cannot be used to change a user's password. This document
       describes an LDAP extended operation to allow modification of user passwords which is not dependent
       upon the form of the authentication identity nor the password storage mechanism used.

       <b>draft-zeilenga-ldap-txn</b> <b>--</b> <b>LDAPv3</b> <b>Transactions</b>

       LDAP update operations have atomic properties upon individual entries. However, it is often desirable
       to update two or more entries as one atomic action, a transaction. Transactions are necessary to
       support a number of applications including resource provisioning and information replication. This
       document defines an LDAP extension to support transactions.

       <b>draft-zeilenga-ldapv3bis-opattrs</b> <b>--</b> <b>LDAPv3:</b> <b>All</b> <b>Operational</b> <b>Attributes</b>

       X.500 provides a mechanism for clients to request all operational attributes be returned with entries
       provided in response to a search operation. LDAP [RFC2251] does not provide a similar mechanism to
       clients to request the return of operational attributes. The lack of such a mechanisms hinders
       discovery of operational attributes present in an entry.
