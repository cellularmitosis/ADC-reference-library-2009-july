ZIC(8)                    BSD System Manager's Manual                   ZIC(8)

<b>NAME</b>
     <b>zic</b> -- timezone compiler

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
     <b>zic</b> [<b>--version</b>] [<b>-Dsv</b>] [<b>-d</b> <u>directory</u>] [<b>-g</b> <u>group</u>] [<b>-L</b> <u>leapsecondfilename</u>] [<b>-l</b> <u>localtime</u>] [<b>-m</b> <u>mode</u>]
         [<b>-p</b> <u>posixrules</u>] [<b>-u</b> <u>user</u>] [<b>-y</b> <u>command</u>] [<u>filename</u> <u>...</u>]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
     The <b>zic</b> utility reads text from the <!-- a -->file(s)<!-- /a --> named on the command line and creates the time conversion
     information files specified in this input.  If a <u>filename</u> is <u>-</u>, the standard input is read.

     The following options are available:

     <b>-D</b>      Do not automatically create directories.  If the input <!-- a -->file(s)<!-- /a --> specify an output file in a
             directory which does not already exist, the default behavior is to attempt to create the direc-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tory.&nbsp;directory.</font>
             tory.  If <b>-D</b> is specified, <b>zic</b> will instead error out immediately.

     <b>-d</b> <u>directory</u>
             Create time conversion information files in the named directory rather than in the standard
             directory named below.

     <b>-g</b> <u>group</u>
             After creating each output file, change its group ownership to the specified <u>group</u> (which can
             be either a name or a numeric group ID).

     <b>-L</b> <u>leapsecondfilename</u>
             Read leap second information from the file with the given name.  If this option is not used, no
             leap second information appears in output files.

     <b>-l</b> <u>timezone</u>
             Use the given <u>time</u> <u>zone</u> as local time.  The <b>zic</b> utility will act as if the input contained a
             link line of the form

                   Link    timezone                localtime
             (Note that this action has no effect on FreeBSD, since the local time zone is specified in
             <u>/etc/localtime</u> and not <u>/usr/share/zoneinfo/localtime</u>.)

     <b>-m</b> <u>mode</u>
             After creating each output file, change its access mode to <u>mode</u>.  Both numeric and alphabetic
             modes are accepted (see <a href="../man1/chmod.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/chmod">chmod(1)</a>).

     <b>-p</b> <u>timezone</u>
             Use the given <u>time</u> <u>zone</u>'s rules when handling POSIX-format time zone environment variables.
             The <b>zic</b> utility will act as if the input contained a link line of the form

                   Link    timezone                posixrules

     <b>-s</b>      Limit time values stored in output files to values that are the same whether they're taken to
             be signed or unsigned.  You can use this option to generate SVVS-compatible files.

     <b>-u</b> <u>user</u>
             After creating each output file, change its owner to <u>user</u> (which can be either a name or a
             numeric user ID).

     <b>-v</b>      Complain if a year that appears in a data file is outside the range of years representable by
             <a href="../man3/time.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/time">time(3)</a> values.

     <b>--version</b>
             Output version information and exit.

     <b>-y</b> <u>command</u>
             Use the given <u>command</u> rather than <u>yearistype</u> when checking year types (see below).

     Input lines are made up of fields.  Fields are separated from one another by any number of white space
     characters.  Leading and trailing white space on input lines is ignored.  An unquoted sharp character
     (#) in the input introduces a comment which extends to the end of the line the sharp character appears
     on.  White space characters and sharp characters may be enclosed in double quotes (") if they're to be
     used as part of a field.  Any line that is blank (after comment stripping) is ignored.  Non-blank lines
     are expected to be of one of three types: rule lines, zone lines, and link lines.

     A rule line has the form:
           Rule NAME FROM TO   TYPE IN   ON        AT   SAVE LETTER/S
     For example:
           Rule US   1967 1973 -    Apr  lastSun   2:00 1:00 D

     The fields that make up a rule line are:

           NAME      Give the (arbitrary) name of the set of rules this rule is part of.

           FROM      Give the first year in which the rule applies.  Any integer year can be supplied; the
                     Gregorian calendar is assumed.  The word <u>minimum</u> (or an abbreviation) means the minimum
                     year representable as an integer.  The word <u>maximum</u> (or an abbreviation) means the max-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">imum&nbsp;maximum</font>
                     imum year representable as an integer.  Rules can describe times that are not repre-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sentable&nbsp;representable</font>
                     sentable as time values, with the unrepresentable times ignored; this allows rules to
                     be portable among hosts with differing time value types.

           TO        Give the final year in which the rule applies.  In addition to <u>minimum</u> and <u>maximum</u> (as
                     above), the word <u>only</u> (or an abbreviation) may be used to repeat the value of the <u>FROM</u>
                     field.

           TYPE      Give the type of year in which the rule applies.  If <u>TYPE</u> is <u>-</u> then the rule applies in
                     all years between <u>FROM</u> and <u>TO</u> inclusive.  If <u>TYPE</u> is something else, then <b>zic</b> executes
                     the command yearistype <u>year</u> <u>type</u> to check the type of a year: an exit status of zero is
                     taken to mean that the year is of the given type; an exit status of one is taken to
                     mean that the year is not of the given type.

           IN        Name the month in which the rule takes effect.  Month names may be abbreviated.

           ON        Give the day on which the rule takes effect.  Recognized forms include:

                           5        the fifth of the month
                           lastSun  the last Sunday in the month
                           lastMon  the last Monday in the month
                           Sun&gt;=8   first Sunday on or after the eighth
                           Sun&lt;=25  last Sunday on or before the 25th

                     Names of days of the week may be abbreviated or spelled out in full.  Note that there
                     must be no spaces within the <u>ON</u> field.

           AT        Give the time of day at which the rule takes effect.  Recognized forms include:

                           2        time in hours
                           2:00     time in hours and minutes
                           15:00    24-hour format time (for times after noon)
                           1:28:14  time in hours, minutes, and seconds

                     where hour 0 is midnight at the start of the day, and hour 24 is midnight at the end of
                     the day.  Any of these forms may be followed by the letter `w' if the given time is
                     local ``wall clock'' time, `s' if the given time is local ``standard'' time, or `u' (or
                     `g' or `z') if the given time is universal time; in the absence of an indicator, wall
                     clock time is assumed.

           SAVE      Give the amount of time to be added to local standard time when the rule is in effect.
                     This field has the same format as the <u>AT</u> field (although, of course, the `w' and `s'
                     suffixes are not used).

           LETTER/S  Give the ``variable part'' (for example, the ``S'' or ``D'' in ``EST'' or ``EDT'') of
                     time zone abbreviations to be used when this rule is in effect.  If this field is <u>-</u>,
                     the variable part is null.

     A zone line has the form:
           Zone NAME GMTOFF    RULES/SAVE     FORMAT    [UNTIL]
     For example:
           Zone Australia/Adelaide  9:30 Aus  CST  1971 Oct 31 2:00
     The fields that make up a zone line are:

     NAME    The name of the time zone.  This is the name used in creating the time conversion information
             file for the zone.

     GMTOFF  The amount of time to add to UTC to get standard time in this zone.  This field has the same
             format as the <u>AT</u> and <u>SAVE</u> fields of rule lines; begin the field with a minus sign if time must
             be subtracted from UTC.

     RULES/SAVE
             The name of the <!-- a -->rule(s)<!-- /a --> that apply in the time zone or, alternately, an amount of time to add
             to local standard time.  If this field is <u>-</u> then standard time always applies in the time zone.

     FORMAT  The format for time zone abbreviations in this time zone.  The pair of characters <u>%s</u> is used to
             show where the ``variable part'' of the time zone abbreviation goes.  Alternately, a slash (/)
             separates standard and daylight abbreviations.

     UNTIL   The time at which the UTC offset or the <!-- a -->rule(s)<!-- /a --> change for a location.  It is specified as a
             year, a month, a day, and a time of day.  If this is specified, the time zone information is
             generated from the given UTC offset and rule change until the time specified.  The month, day,
             and time of day have the same format as the IN, ON, and AT columns of a rule; trailing columns
             can be omitted, and default to the earliest possible value for the missing columns.

             The next line must be a ``continuation'' line; this has the same form as a zone line except
             that the string ``Zone'' and the name are omitted, as the continuation line will place informa-
             tion starting at the time specified as the <u>UNTIL</u> field in the previous line in the file used by
             the previous line.  Continuation lines may contain an <u>UNTIL</u> field, just as zone lines do, indi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cating&nbsp;indicating</font>
             cating that the next line is a further continuation.

     A link line has the form
           Link LINK-FROM LINK-TO
     For example:
           Link Europe/Istanbul     Asia/Istanbul
     The <u>LINK-FROM</u> field should appear as the <u>NAME</u> field in some zone line; the <u>LINK-TO</u> field is used as an
     alternate name for that zone.

     Except for continuation lines, lines may appear in any order in the input.

     Lines in the file that describes leap seconds have the following form:
           Leap YEAR MONTH     DAY  HH:MM:SS  CORR R/S
     For example:
           Leap 1974 Dec  31   23:59:60  +    S
     The <u>YEAR</u>, <u>MONTH</u>, <u>DAY</u>, and <u>HH:MM:SS</u> fields tell when the leap second happened.  The <u>CORR</u> field should be
     ``+'' if a second was added or ``-'' if a second was skipped.  The <u>R/S</u> field should be (an abbreviation
     of) ``Stationary'' if the leap second time given by the other fields should be interpreted as UTC or
     (an abbreviation of) ``Rolling'' if the leap second time given by the other fields should be inter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">preted&nbsp;interpreted</font>
     preted as local wall clock time.

<b>NOTE</b>
     For areas with more than two types of local time, you may need to use local standard time in the <u>AT</u>
     field of the earliest transition time's rule to ensure that the earliest transition time recorded in
     the compiled file is correct.
