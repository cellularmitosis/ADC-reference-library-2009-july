README - QTLiveSplicerQTLiveSplicer is sample code that shows how to splice a still picture onto the front of a live streaming movie. Select "Splice Image Onto Stream..." from the Splice menu, then select (first) an image file and (second) a streaming movie file; then select the desired options in the dialog box that is displayed and click "Splice!". You are then prompted for a location to save the spliced file into.QTLiveSplicer also allows you to splice a still picture over an audio-only streaming movie. Select "Splice Image Over Stream..." from the Splice menu, then select (first) an image file and (second) an audio-only streaming movie file; then select the desired options in the dialog box that is displayed and click "Splice!". You are then prompted for a location to save the spliced file into.The source code is extremely straightforward; it illustrates how to create a movie that contains a track from another movie. It also shows how to save the new movie as self-contained (without any references to the media in the source movie).Enjoy!QuickTime team04 June 1999
