ZSHOPTIONS(1)                                                                                  ZSHOPTIONS(1)



<b>NAME</b>
       zshoptions - zsh options

<b>SPECIFYING</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       Options  are  primarily  referred  to  by name.  These names are case insensitive and underscores are
       ignored.  For example, `<b>allexport</b>' is equivalent to `<b>A__lleXP_ort</b>'.

       The sense of an option name may be inverted by preceding it with `<b>no</b>', so `<b>setopt</b> <b>No_Beep</b>' is equiva-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lent&nbsp;equivalent</font>
       lent  to  `<b>unsetopt</b>  <b>beep</b>'.  This inversion can only be done once, so `<b>nonobeep</b>' is <u>not</u> a synonym for
       `<b>beep</b>'.  Similarly, `<b>tify</b>' is not a synonym for `<b>nonotify</b>' (the inversion of `<b>notify</b>').

       Some options also have one or more single letter names.  There are two sets of single letter options:
       one  used  by  default, and another used to emulate <b>sh</b>/<b>ksh</b> (used when the <b>SH_OPTION_LETTERS</b> option is
       set).  The single letter options can be used on the shell command line, or with the <b>set</b>,  <b>setopt</b>  and
       <b>unsetopt</b> builtins, as normal Unix options preceded by `<b>-</b>'.

       The sense of the single letter options may be inverted by using `<b>+</b>' instead of `<b>-</b>'.  Some of the sin-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">gle&nbsp;single</font>
       gle letter option names refer to an option being off, in which case the inversion of that name refers
       to the option being on.  For example, `<b>+n</b>' is the short name of `<b>exec</b>', and `<b>-n</b>' is the short name of
       its inversion, `<b>noexec</b>'.

       In strings of single letter options supplied to the shell at startup,  trailing  whitespace  will  be
       ignored;  for  example  the string `<b>-f</b>    ' will be treated just as `<b>-f</b>', but the string `<b>-f</b> <b>i</b>' is an
       error.  This is because many systems which implement the `<b>#!</b>' mechanism for calling  scripts  do  not
       strip trailing whitespace.


<b>DESCRIPTION</b> <b>OF</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       In  the following list, options set by default in all emulations are marked &lt;D&gt;; those set by default
       only in csh, ksh, sh, or zsh emulations are marked &lt;C&gt;, &lt;K&gt;, &lt;S&gt;, &lt;Z&gt; as appropriate.   When  listing
       options  (by  `<b>setopt</b>',  `<b>unsetopt</b>',  `<b>set</b> <b>-o</b>' or `<b>set</b> <b>+o</b>'), those turned on by default appear in the
       list prefixed with `<b>no</b>'.  Hence (unless <b>KSH_OPTION_PRINT</b> is set), `<b>setopt</b>' shows  all  options  whose
       settings are changed from the default.


   <b>Changing</b> <b>Directories</b>
       <b>AUTO_CD</b> (<b>-J</b>)
              If a command is issued that can't be executed as a normal command, and the command is the name
              of a directory, perform the <b>cd</b> command to that directory.

       <b>AUTO_PUSHD</b> (<b>-N</b>)
              Make <b>cd</b> push the old directory onto the directory stack.

       <b>CDABLE_VARS</b> (<b>-T</b>)
              If the argument to a <b>cd</b> command (or an implied <b>cd</b> with the <b>AUTO_CD</b> option set) is not a direc-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tory,&nbsp;directory,</font>
              tory,  and does not begin with a slash, try to expand the expression as if it were preceded by
              a `<b>~</b>' (see the section `Filename Expansion').

       <b>CHASE_DOTS</b>
              When changing to a directory containing a path segment `<b>..</b>' which would otherwise  be  treated
              as  canceling the previous segment in the path (in other words, `<b>foo/..</b>' would be removed from
              the path, or if `<b>..</b>' is the first part of the path, the last part of <b>$PWD</b> would  be  deleted),
              instead resolve the path to the physical directory.  This option is overridden by <b>CHASE_LINKS</b>.

              For example, suppose <b>/foo/bar</b> is a link to the directory <b>/alt/rod</b>.  Without this  option  set,
              `<b>cd</b>  <b>/foo/bar/..</b>'  changes  to <b>/foo</b>; with it set, it changes to <b>/alt</b>.  The same applies if the
              current directory is <b>/foo/bar</b> and `<b>cd</b> <b>..</b>' is used.  Note that all other symbolic links in  the
              path will also be resolved.

       <b>CHASE_LINKS</b> (<b>-w</b>)
              Resolve symbolic links to their true values when changing directory.  This also has the effect
              of <b>CHASE_DOTS</b>, i.e. a `<b>..</b>' path segment will be treated as referring to the  physical  parent,
              even if the preceding path segment is a symbolic link.

       <b>PUSHD_IGNORE_DUPS</b>
              Don't push multiple copies of the same directory onto the directory stack.

       <b>PUSHD_MINUS</b>
              Exchanges  the  meanings  of `<b>+</b>' and `<b>-</b>' when used with a number to specify a directory in the
              stack.

       <b>PUSHD_SILENT</b> (<b>-E</b>)
              Do not print the directory stack after <b>pushd</b> or <b>popd</b>.

       <b>PUSHD_TO_HOME</b> (<b>-D</b>)
              Have <b>pushd</b> with no arguments act like `<b>pushd</b> <b>$HOME</b>'.


   <b>Completion</b>
       <b>ALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT</b> &lt;D&gt;
              If unset, key functions that list completions try to return to the  last  prompt  if  given  a
              numeric  argument. If set these functions try to return to the last prompt if given <u>no</u> numeric
              argument.

       <b>ALWAYS_TO_END</b>
              If a completion is performed with the cursor within a word, and a full completion is inserted,
              the  cursor  is  moved to the end of the word.  That is, the cursor is moved to the end of the
              word if either a single match is inserted or menu completion is performed.

       <b>AUTO_LIST</b> (<b>-9</b>) &lt;D&gt;
              Automatically list choices on an ambiguous completion.

       <b>AUTO_MENU</b> &lt;D&gt;
              Automatically use menu completion after the second consecutive  request  for  completion,  for
              example by pressing the tab key repeatedly. This option is overridden by <b>MENU_COMPLETE</b>.

       <b>AUTO_NAME_DIRS</b>
              Any  parameter  that is set to the absolute name of a directory immediately becomes a name for
              that directory, that will be used by the `<b>%~</b>' and related prompt sequences, and will be avail-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able&nbsp;available</font>
              able when completion is performed on a word starting with `<b>~</b>'.  (Otherwise, the parameter must
              be used in the form `<b>~</b><u>param</u>' first.)

       <b>AUTO_PARAM_KEYS</b> &lt;D&gt;
              If a parameter name was completed and a following character (normally a  space)  automatically
              inserted,  and  the  next character typed is one of those that have to come directly after the
              name (like `<b>}</b>', `<b>:</b>', etc.), the automatically added character is deleted, so that the  charac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ter&nbsp;character</font>
              ter  typed  comes  immediately  after  the parameter name.  Completion in a brace expansion is
              affected similarly: the added character is a `<b>,</b>', which will be removed if `<b>}</b>' is typed  next.

       <b>AUTO_PARAM_SLASH</b> &lt;D&gt;
              If  a  parameter  is  completed  whose content is the name of a directory, then add a trailing
              slash instead of a space.

       <b>AUTO_REMOVE_SLASH</b> &lt;D&gt;
              When the last character resulting from a completion is a slash and the next character typed is
              a  word  delimiter,  a  slash,  or  a character that ends a command (such as a semicolon or an
              ampersand), remove the slash.

       <b>BASH_AUTO_LIST</b>
              On an ambiguous completion, automatically list choices when the completion function is  called
              twice  in succession.  This takes precedence over <b>AUTO_LIST</b>.  The setting of <b>LIST_AMBIGUOUS</b> is
              respected.  If <b>AUTO_MENU</b> is set, the menu behaviour will then  start  with  the  third  press.
              Note  that  this will not work with <b>MENU_COMPLETE</b>, since repeated completion calls immediately
              cycle through the list in that case.

       <b>COMPLETE_ALIASES</b>
              Prevents aliases on the command line from being internally substituted  before  completion  is
              attempted.  The effect is to make the alias a distinct command for completion purposes.

       <b>COMPLETE_IN_WORD</b>
              If  unset,  the  cursor  is  set to the end of the word if completion is started. Otherwise it
              stays there and completion is done from both ends.

       <b>GLOB_COMPLETE</b>
              When the current word has a glob pattern, do not insert  all  the  words  resulting  from  the
              expansion  but  generate  matches as for completion and cycle through them like <b>MENU_COMPLETE</b>.
              The matches are generated as if a `<b>*</b>' was added to the end of the word,  or  inserted  at  the
              cursor when <b>COMPLETE_IN_WORD</b> is set.  This actually uses pattern matching, not globbing, so it
              works not only for files but for any completion, such as options, user names, etc.

              Note that when the pattern matcher is used, matching control (for example, case-insensitive or
              anchored  matching)  cannot  be used.  This limitation only applies when the current word con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tains&nbsp;contains</font>
              tains a pattern; simply turning on the <b>GLOB_COMPLETE</b> option does not have this effect.

       <b>HASH_LIST_ALL</b> &lt;D&gt;
              Whenever a command completion is attempted, make sure the entire command path is hashed first.
              This makes the first completion slower.

       <b>LIST_AMBIGUOUS</b> &lt;D&gt;
              This  option  works  when <b>AUTO_LIST</b> or <b>BASH_AUTO_LIST</b> is also set.  If there is an unambiguous
              prefix to insert on the command line, that is done without a completion list being  displayed;
              in  other  words,  auto-listing behaviour only takes place when nothing would be inserted.  In
              the case of <b>BASH_AUTO_LIST</b>, this means that the list will be delayed to the third call of  the
              function.

       <b>LIST_BEEP</b> &lt;D&gt;
              Beep  on  an  ambiguous  completion.   More  accurately, this forces the completion widgets to
              return status 1 on an ambiguous completion, which causes the shell to beep if the option  <b>BEEP</b>
              is also set; this may be modified if completion is called from a user-defined widget.

       <b>LIST_PACKED</b>
              Try to make the completion list smaller (occupying less lines) by printing the matches in col-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">umns&nbsp;columns</font>
              umns with different widths.

       <b>LIST_ROWS_FIRST</b>
              Lay out the matches in completion lists sorted horizontally, that is, the second match  is  to
              the right of the first one, not under it as usual.

       <b>LIST_TYPES</b> (<b>-X</b>) &lt;D&gt;
              When  listing  files that are possible completions, show the type of each file with a trailing
              identifying mark.

       <b>MENU_COMPLETE</b> (<b>-Y</b>)
              On an ambiguous completion, instead of listing possibilities  or  beeping,  insert  the  first
              match immediately.  Then when completion is requested again, remove the first match and insert
              the second match, etc.  When there are no more matches,  go  back  to  the  first  one  again.
              <b>reverse-menu-complete</b> may be used to loop through the list in the other direction. This option
              overrides <b>AUTO_MENU</b>.

       <b>REC_EXACT</b> (<b>-S</b>)
              In completion, recognize exact matches even if they are ambiguous.


   <b>Expansion</b> <b>and</b> <b>Globbing</b>
       <b>BAD_PATTERN</b> (<b>+2</b>) &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
              If a pattern for filename generation is badly formed, print an error message.  (If this option
              is unset, the pattern will be left unchanged.)

       <b>BARE_GLOB_QUAL</b> &lt;Z&gt;
              In  a glob pattern, treat a trailing set of parentheses as a qualifier list, if it contains no
              `<b>|</b>', `<b>(</b>' or (if special) `<b>~</b>' characters.  See the section `Filename Generation'.

       <b>BRACE_CCL</b>
              Expand expressions in braces which would not otherwise undergo brace expansion to a  lexically
              ordered list of all the characters.  See the section `Brace Expansion'.

       <b>CASE_GLOB</b> &lt;D&gt;
              Make  globbing  (filename generation) sensitive to case.  Note that other uses of patterns are
              always sensitive to case.  If the option is unset, the presence of any character which is spe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cial&nbsp;special</font>
              cial  to  filename  generation  will cause case-insensitive matching.  For example, <b>cvs(/)</b> can
              match the directory <b>CVS</b> owing to  the  presence  of  the  globbing  flag  (unless  the  option
              <b>BARE_GLOB_QUAL</b> is unset).

       <b>CSH_NULL_GLOB</b> &lt;C&gt;
              If  a  pattern  for  filename  generation has no matches, delete the pattern from the argument
              list; do not report an error unless all the patterns in a command have no matches.   Overrides
              <b>NOMATCH</b>.

       <b>EQUALS</b> &lt;Z&gt;
              Perform <b>=</b> filename expansion.  (See the section `Filename Expansion'.)

       <b>EXTENDED_GLOB</b>
              Treat  the  `<b>#</b>', `<b>~</b>' and `<b>^</b>' characters as part of patterns for filename generation, etc.  (An
              initial unquoted `<b>~</b>' always produces named directory expansion.)

       <b>GLOB</b> (<b>+F</b>, ksh: <b>+f</b>) &lt;D&gt;
              Perform filename generation (globbing).  (See the section `Filename Generation'.)

       <b>GLOB_ASSIGN</b> &lt;C&gt;
              If this option is set, filename generation (globbing) is performed on the right hand  side  of
              scalar parameter assignments of the form `<u>name</u><b>=</b><u>pattern</u> (e.g. `<b>foo=*</b>').  If the result has more
              than one word the parameter will become an array with those words as arguments. This option is
              provided for backwards compatibility only: globbing is always performed on the right hand side
              of array assignments of the form `<u>name</u><b>=(</b><u>value</u><b>)</b>' (e.g. `<b>foo=(*)</b>') and this form is  recommended
              for clarity; with this option set, it is not possible to predict whether the result will be an
              array or a scalar.

       <b>GLOB_DOTS</b> (<b>-4</b>)
              Do not require a leading `<b>.</b>' in a filename to be matched explicitly.

       <b>GLOB_SUBST</b> &lt;C&gt; &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
              Treat any characters resulting from parameter expansion as being eligible for  file  expansion
              and  filename generation, and any characters resulting from command substitution as being eli-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">gible&nbsp;eligible</font>
              gible for filename generation.  Braces (and commas in between)  do  not  become  eligible  for
              expansion.

       <b>HIST_SUBST_PATTERN</b>
              Substitutions  using  the  <b>:s</b>  and  <b>:&amp;</b>  history  modifiers are performed with pattern matching
              instead of string matching.  This occurs wherever history modifiers are valid, including  glob
              qualifiers and parameters.  See the section Modifiers in <!-- a --><u>zshexp</u>(1)<!-- /a -->.

       <b>IGNORE_BRACES</b> (<b>-I</b>) &lt;S&gt;
              Do not perform brace expansion.

       <b>KSH_GLOB</b> &lt;K&gt;
              In  pattern  matching,  the interpretation of parentheses is affected by a preceding `<b>@</b>', `<b>*</b>',
              `<b>+</b>', `<b>?</b>' or `<b>!</b>'.  See the section `Filename Generation'.

       <b>MAGIC_EQUAL_SUBST</b>
              All unquoted arguments of the form `<u>anything</u><b>=</b><u>expression</u>' appearing after the command name have
              filename  expansion  (that is, where <u>expression</u> has a leading `<b>~</b>' or `<b>=</b>') performed on <u>expres</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion&nbsp;expression</font>
              <u>sion</u> as if it were a parameter assignment.  The argument is not otherwise  treated  specially;
              it  is passed to the command as a single argument, and not used as an actual parameter assign-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment.&nbsp;assignment.</font>
              ment.  For example, in <b>echo</b> <b>foo=~/bar:~/rod</b>, both occurrences of <b>~</b> would  be  replaced.   Note
              that this happens anyway with <b>typeset</b> and similar statements.

              This  option  respects the setting of the <b>KSH_TYPESET</b> option.  In other words, if both options
              are in effect, arguments looking like assignments will not undergo wordsplitting.

       <b>MARK_DIRS</b> (<b>-8</b>, ksh: <b>-X</b>)
              Append a trailing `<b>/</b>' to all directory names resulting from filename generation (globbing).

       <b>MULTIBYTE</b>
              Respect multibyte characters when found in strings.  When this  option  is  set,  strings  are
              examined  using  the system library to determine how many bytes form a character, depending on
              the current locale.  This affects the way characters are counted in pattern matching,  parame-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ter&nbsp;parameter</font>
              ter values and various delimiters.

              The  option is on by default if the shell was compiled with <b>MULTIBYTE_SUPPORT</b>; otherwise it is
              off by default and has no effect if turned on.

              If the option is off a single byte is always treated as a single character.  This  setting  is
              designed  purely for examining strings known to contain raw bytes or other values that may not
              be characters in the current locale.  It is not necessary to unset the option  merely  because
              the character set for the current locale does not contain multibyte characters.

              The  option  does  not  affect  the shell's editor,  which always uses the locale to determine
              multibyte characters.  This is because the character set displayed by the terminal emulator is
              independent of shell settings.

       <b>NOMATCH</b> (<b>+3</b>) &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
              If  a  pattern  for  filename generation has no matches, print an error, instead of leaving it
              unchanged in the argument list.  This also applies to file expansion of an initial `<b>~</b>' or `<b>=</b>'.

       <b>NULL_GLOB</b> (<b>-G</b>)
              If a pattern for filename generation has no matches, delete the pattern from the argument list
              instead of reporting an error.  Overrides <b>NOMATCH</b>.

       <b>NUMERIC_GLOB_SORT</b>
              If numeric filenames are matched by a filename generation pattern, sort the filenames  numeri-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cally&nbsp;numerically</font>
              cally rather than lexicographically.

       <b>RC_EXPAND_PARAM</b> (<b>-P</b>)
              Array expansions of the form `<u>foo</u><b>${</b><u>xx</u><b>}</b><u>bar</u>', where the parameter <u>xx</u> is set to <b>(</b><u>a</u> <u>b</u> <u>c</u><b>)</b>, are sub-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">stituted&nbsp;substituted</font>
              stituted with `<u>fooabar</u> <u>foobbar</u> <u>foocbar</u>' instead of the default `<u>fooa</u> <u>b</u> <u>cbar</u>'.

       <b>SH_GLOB</b> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
              Disables the special meaning of `<b>(</b>', `<b>|</b>', `<b>)</b>' and '<b>&lt;</b>' for globbing the result of parameter and
              command substitutions, and in some other places where the shell accepts patterns.  This option
              is set by default if zsh is invoked as <b>sh</b> or <b>ksh</b>.

       <b>UNSET</b> (<b>+u</b>, ksh: <b>+u</b>) &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
              Treat unset parameters as if they were empty when substituting.  Otherwise they are treated as
              an error.

       <b>WARN_CREATE_GLOBAL</b>
              Print  a  warning  message  when a global parameter is created in a function by an assignment.
              This often indicates that a parameter has not been declared local when it  should  have  been.
              Parameters  explicitly  declared global from within a function using <b>typeset</b> <b>-g</b> do not cause a
              warning.  Note that there is no warning when a local parameter is  assigned  to  in  a  nested
              function, which may also indicate an error.


   <b>History</b>
       <b>APPEND_HISTORY</b> &lt;D&gt;
              If  this  is set, zsh sessions will append their history list to the history file, rather than
              replace it. Thus, multiple parallel zsh sessions will all have the new entries from their his-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tory&nbsp;history</font>
              tory  lists  added  to  the history file, in the order that they exit.  The file will still be
              periodically re-written to trim it when the number of lines grows 20% beyond the value  speci-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fied&nbsp;specified</font>
              fied by <b>$SAVEHIST</b> (see also the HIST_SAVE_BY_COPY option).

       <b>BANG_HIST</b> (<b>+K</b>) &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
              Perform textual history expansion, <b>csh</b>-style, treating the character `<b>!</b>' specially.

       <b>EXTENDED_HISTORY</b> &lt;C&gt;
              Save each command's beginning timestamp (in seconds since the epoch) and the duration (in sec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">onds)&nbsp;seconds)</font>
              onds) to the history file.  The format of this prefixed data is:

              `<b>:</b><u>&lt;beginning</u> <u>time&gt;</u><b>:</b><u>&lt;elapsed</u> <u>seconds&gt;</u><b>:</b><u>&lt;command&gt;</u>'.

       <b>HIST_ALLOW_CLOBBER</b>
              Add `<b>|</b>' to output redirections in the history.  This  allows  history  references  to  clobber
              files even when <b>CLOBBER</b> is unset.

       <b>HIST_BEEP</b> &lt;D&gt;
              Beep when an attempt is made to access a history entry which isn't there.

       <b>HIST_EXPIRE_DUPS_FIRST</b>
              If  the  internal  history  needs  to be trimmed to add the current command line, setting this
              option will cause the oldest history event that has a duplicate to be  lost  before  losing  a
              unique  event from the list.  You should be sure to set the value of <b>HISTSIZE</b> to a larger num-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ber&nbsp;number</font>
              ber than <b>SAVEHIST</b> in order to give you some room for the  duplicated  events,  otherwise  this
              option  will  behave  just  like  <b>HIST_IGNORE_ALL_DUPS</b>  once  the history fills up with unique
              events.

       <b>HIST_FIND_NO_DUPS</b>
              When searching for history entries in the line editor, do not display  duplicates  of  a  line
              previously found, even if the duplicates are not contiguous.

       <b>HIST_IGNORE_ALL_DUPS</b>
              If  a new command line being added to the history list duplicates an older one, the older com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
              mand is removed from the list (even if it is not the previous event).

       <b>HIST_IGNORE_DUPS</b> (<b>-h</b>)
              Do not enter command lines into the history list if they are duplicates of the previous event.

       <b>HIST_IGNORE_SPACE</b> (<b>-g</b>)
              Remove command lines from the history list when the first character on the line is a space, or
              when one of the expanded aliases contains a leading space.  Note that the command  lingers  in
              the  internal  history  until  the next command is entered before it vanishes, allowing you to
              briefly reuse or edit the line.  If you want to make it vanish  right  away  without  entering
              another command, type a space and press return.

       <b>HIST_NO_FUNCTIONS</b>
              Remove  function  definitions  from  the  history list.  Note that the function lingers in the
              internal history until the next command is entered before it vanishes, allowing you to briefly
              reuse or edit the definition.

       <b>HIST_NO_STORE</b>
              Remove  the <b>history</b> (<b>fc</b> <b>-l</b>) command from the history list when invoked.  Note that the command
              lingers in the internal history until the next command is entered before it vanishes, allowing
              you to briefly reuse or edit the line.

       <b>HIST_REDUCE_BLANKS</b>
              Remove superfluous blanks from each command line being added to the history list.

       <b>HIST_SAVE_BY_COPY</b> &lt;D&gt;
              When  the  history  file  is re-written, we normally write out a copy of the file named $HIST-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">FILE.new&nbsp;$HISTFILE.new</font>
              FILE.new and then rename it over the old one.  However, if this option is  unset,  we  instead
              truncate  the  old  history  file  and write out the new version in-place.  If one of the his-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tory-appending&nbsp;history-appending</font>
              tory-appending options is enabled, this option only has an effect when  the  enlarged  history
              file  needs  to  be re-written to trim it down to size.  Disable this only if you have special
              needs, as doing so makes it possible to lose history entries if zsh  gets  interrupted  during
              the save.

              When  writing  out  a  copy  of the history file, zsh preserves the old file's permissions and
              group information, but will refuse to write out a new file if  it  would  change  the  history
              file's owner.

       <b>HIST_SAVE_NO_DUPS</b>
              When writing out the history file, older commands that duplicate newer ones are omitted.

       <b>HIST_VERIFY</b>
              Whenever  the  user  enters  a  line  with history expansion, don't execute the line directly;
              instead, perform history expansion and reload the line into the editing buffer.

       <b>INC_APPEND_HISTORY</b>
              This options works like <b>APPEND_HISTORY</b> except that new history lines are added to  the  <b>$HIST</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">FILE&nbsp;$HISTFILE</font>
              <b>FILE</b>  incrementally  (as soon as they are entered), rather than waiting until the shell exits.
              The file will still be periodically re-written to trim it when the number of lines  grows  20%
              beyond the value specified by <b>$SAVEHIST</b> (see also the HIST_SAVE_BY_COPY option).

       <b>SHARE_HISTORY</b> &lt;K&gt;

              This  option  both imports new commands from the history file, and also causes your typed com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mands&nbsp;commands</font>
              mands to be appended to the history file (the latter is like  specifying  <b>INC_APPEND_HISTORY</b>).
              The  history lines are also output with timestamps ala <b>EXTENDED_HISTORY</b> (which makes it easier
              to find the spot where we left off reading the file after it gets re-written).

              By default, history movement commands visit the imported lines as well as the local lines, but
              you can toggle this on and off with the set-local-history zle binding.  It is also possible to
              create a zle widget that will make some commands ignore imported commands,  and  some  include
              them.

              If  you  find that you want more control over when commands get imported, you may wish to turn
              <b>SHARE_HISTORY</b> off, <b>INC_APPEND_HISTORY</b> on, and then manually import commands whenever you  need
              them using `<b>fc</b> <b>-RI</b>'.


   <b>Initialisation</b>
       <b>ALL_EXPORT</b> (<b>-a</b>, ksh: <b>-a</b>)
              All parameters subsequently defined are automatically exported.

       <b>GLOBAL_EXPORT</b> (<b>&lt;Z&gt;</b>)
              If  this  option is set, passing the <b>-x</b> flag to the builtins <b>declare</b>, <b>float</b>, <b>integer</b>, <b>readonly</b>
              and <b>typeset</b> (but not <b>local</b>) will also set the <b>-g</b> flag;  hence parameters exported to the envi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ronment&nbsp;environment</font>
              ronment will not be made local to the enclosing function, unless they were already or the flag
              <b>+g</b> is given explicitly.  If the option is unset, exported parameters will  be  made  local  in
              just the same way as any other parameter.

              This  option  is set by default for backward compatibility; it is not recommended that its be-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">haviour&nbsp;behaviour</font>
              haviour be relied upon.  Note that the builtin <b>export</b> always sets both the <b>-x</b>  and  <b>-g</b>  flags,
              and hence its effect extends beyond the scope of the enclosing function; this is the most por-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">table&nbsp;portable</font>
              table way to achieve this behaviour.

       <b>GLOBAL_RCS</b> (<b>-d</b>) &lt;D&gt;
              If this option  is  unset,  the  startup  files  <b>/etc/zprofile</b>,  <b>/etc/zshrc</b>,  <b>/etc/zlogin</b>  and
              <b>/etc/zlogout</b> will not be run.  It can be disabled and re-enabled at any time, including inside
              local startup files (<b>.zshrc</b>, etc.).

       <b>RCS</b> (<b>+f</b>) &lt;D&gt;
              After <b>/etc/zshenv</b> is  sourced  on  startup,  source  the  <b>.zshenv</b>,  <b>/etc/zprofile</b>,  <b>.zprofile</b>,
              <b>/etc/zshrc</b>,  <b>.zshrc</b>,  <b>/etc/zlogin</b>,  <b>.zlogin</b>,  and  <b>.zlogout</b> files, as described in the section
              `Files'.  If this option is unset, the <b>/etc/zshenv</b> file is still sourced, but any of the  oth-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ers&nbsp;others</font>
              ers  will  not  be; it can be set at any time to prevent the remaining startup files after the
              currently executing one from being sourced.


   <b>Input/Output</b>
       <b>ALIASES</b> &lt;D&gt;
              Expand aliases.

       <b>CLOBBER</b> (<b>+C</b>, ksh: <b>+C</b>) &lt;D&gt;
              Allows `<b>&gt;</b>' redirection to truncate existing files, and `<b>&gt;&gt;</b>' to create files.   Otherwise  `<b>&gt;!</b>'
              or `<b>&gt;|</b>' must be used to truncate a file, and `<b>&gt;&gt;!</b>' or `<b>&gt;&gt;|</b>' to create a file.

       <b>CORRECT</b> (<b>-0</b>)
              Try  to correct the spelling of commands.  Note that, when the <b>HASH_LIST_ALL</b> option is not set
              or when some directories in the path are not readable, this may falsely report spelling errors
              the first time some commands are used.

       <b>CORRECT_ALL</b> (<b>-O</b>)
              Try to correct the spelling of all arguments in a line.

       <b>DVORAK</b> Use  the  Dvorak  keyboard  instead  of  the standard qwerty keyboard as a basis for examining
              spelling mistakes for the <b>CORRECT</b> and <b>CORRECT_ALL</b> options and the <b>spell-word</b> editor command.

       <b>FLOW_CONTROL</b> &lt;D&gt;
              If this option is unset, output flow control via start/stop characters  (usually  assigned  to
              ^S/^Q) is disabled in the shell's editor.

       <b>IGNORE_EOF</b> (<b>-7</b>)
              Do not exit on end-of-file.  Require the use of <b>exit</b> or <b>logout</b> instead.  However, ten consecu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tive&nbsp;consecutive</font>
              tive EOFs will cause the shell to exit anyway, to avoid the shell  hanging  if  its  tty  goes
              away.

              Also,  if  this  option  is  set and the Zsh Line Editor is used, widgets implemented by shell
              functions can be bound to EOF (normally Control-D) without printing the  normal  warning  mes-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sage.&nbsp;message.</font>
              sage.  This works only for normal widgets, not for completion widgets.

       <b>INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS</b> (<b>-k</b>) &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
              Allow comments even in interactive shells.

       <b>HASH_CMDS</b> &lt;D&gt;
              Note  the  location  of each command the first time it is executed.  Subsequent invocations of
              the same command will use the saved location, avoiding a  path  search.   If  this  option  is
              unset,  no path hashing is done at all.  However, when <b>CORRECT</b> is set, commands whose names do
              not appear in the functions or aliases hash tables are hashed in order to avoid reporting them
              as spelling errors.

       <b>HASH_DIRS</b> &lt;D&gt;
              Whenever  a  command name is hashed, hash the directory containing it, as well as all directo-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ries&nbsp;directories</font>
              ries that occur earlier in the path.  Has no effect if neither <b>HASH_CMDS</b> nor <b>CORRECT</b> is set.

       <b>MAIL_WARNING</b> (<b>-U</b>)
              Print a warning message if a mail file has been accessed since the shell last checked.

       <b>PATH_DIRS</b> (<b>-Q</b>)
              Perform a path search even on command names with slashes in them.  Thus if `<b>/usr/local/bin</b>' is
              in  the  user's  path, and he or she types `<b>X11/xinit</b>', the command `<b>/usr/local/bin/X11/xinit</b>'
              will be executed (assuming it exists).  Commands explicitly beginning with `<b>/</b>', `<b>./</b>' or  `<b>../</b>'
              are not subject to the path search.  This also applies to the <b>.</b> builtin.

              Note  that  subdirectories of the current directory are always searched for executables speci-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fied&nbsp;specified</font>
              fied in this form.  This takes place before any search indicated by this option,  and  regard-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">less&nbsp;regardless</font>
              less of whether `<b>.</b>' or the current directory appear in the command search path.

       <b>PRINT_EIGHT_BIT</b>
              Print  eight  bit characters literally in completion lists, etc.  This option is not necessary
              if your system correctly returns the printability of eight bit characters (see <a href="../man3/ctype.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/ctype"><u>ctype</u>(3)</a>).

       <b>PRINT_EXIT_VALUE</b> (<b>-1</b>)
              Print the exit value of programs with non-zero exit status.

       <b>RC_QUOTES</b>
              Allow the character sequence `<b>''</b>' to signify a single  quote  within  singly  quoted  strings.
              Note this does not apply in quoted strings using the format <b>$'</b><u>...</u><b>'</b>, where a backslashed single
              quote can be used.

       <b>RM_STAR_SILENT</b> (<b>-H</b>) &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
              Do not query the user before executing `<b>rm</b> <b>*</b>' or `<b>rm</b> <b>path/*</b>'.

       <b>RM_STAR_WAIT</b>
              If querying the user before executing `<b>rm</b> <b>*</b>' or `<b>rm</b> <b>path/*</b>', first wait ten seconds and ignore
              anything  typed  in  that time.  This avoids the problem of reflexively answering `yes' to the
              query when one didn't really mean it.  The wait and query can always be avoided  by  expanding
              the `<b>*</b>' in ZLE (with tab).

       <b>SHORT_LOOPS</b> &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
              Allow the short forms of <b>for</b>, <b>repeat</b>, <b>select</b>, <b>if</b>, and <b>function</b> constructs.

       <b>SUN_KEYBOARD_HACK</b> (<b>-L</b>)
              If a line ends with a backquote, and there are an odd number of backquotes on the line, ignore
              the trailing backquote.  This is useful on some keyboards where the return key is  too  small,
              and the backquote key lies annoyingly close to it.


   <b>Job</b> <b>Control</b>
       <b>AUTO_CONTINUE</b>
              With this option set, stopped jobs that are removed from the job table with the <b>disown</b> builtin
              command are automatically sent a <b>CONT</b> signal to make them running.

       <b>AUTO_RESUME</b> (<b>-W</b>)
              Treat single word simple commands without redirection  as  candidates  for  resumption  of  an
              existing job.

       <b>BG_NICE</b> (<b>-6</b>) &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
              Run all background jobs at a lower priority.  This option is set by default.

       <b>CHECK_JOBS</b> &lt;Z&gt;
              Report  the status of background and suspended jobs before exiting a shell with job control; a
              second attempt to exit the shell will succeed.  <b>NO_CHECK_JOBS</b> is best used only in combination
              with <b>NO_HUP</b>, else such jobs will be killed automatically.

              The check is omitted if the commands run from the previous command line included a `<b>jobs</b>' com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand,&nbsp;command,</font>
              mand, since it is assumed the user is aware that there are background or  suspended  jobs.   A
              `<b>jobs</b>'  command run from one of the hook functions defined in the section SPECIAL FUNCTIONS in
              <a href="zshmisc.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/zshmisc"><u>zshmisc</u>(1)</a> is not counted for this purpose.

       <b>HUP</b> &lt;Z&gt;
              Send the <b>HUP</b> signal to running jobs when the shell exits.

       <b>LONG_LIST_JOBS</b> (<b>-R</b>)
              List jobs in the long format by default.

       <b>MONITOR</b> (<b>-m</b>, ksh: <b>-m</b>)
              Allow job control.  Set by default in interactive shells.

       <b>NOTIFY</b> (<b>-5</b>, ksh: <b>-b</b>) &lt;Z&gt;
              Report the status of background jobs immediately, rather than waiting until just before print-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;printing</font>
              ing a prompt.


   <b>Prompting</b>
       <b>PROMPT_BANG</b> &lt;K&gt;
              If set, `<b>!</b>' is treated specially in prompt expansion.  See the section `Prompt Expansion'.

       <b>PROMPT_CR</b> (<b>+V</b>) &lt;D&gt;
              Print  a  carriage  return  just  before  printing a prompt in the line editor.  This is on by
              default as multi-line editing is only possible if the editor knows where the start of the line
              appears.

       <b>PROMPT_SP</b> &lt;D&gt;
              Attempt  to  preserve  a partial line (i.e. a line that did not end with a newline) that would
              otherwise be covered up by the command prompt due to the PROMPT_CR option.  This works by out-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">putting&nbsp;outputting</font>
              putting  some  cursor-control  characters,  including a series of spaces, that should make the
              terminal wrap to the next line when a partial line is present (note that this is only success-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ful&nbsp;successful</font>
              ful if your terminal has automatic margins, which is typical).

              When  a  partial  line  is preserved, you will see an inverse+bold character at the end of the
              partial line:  a "%" for a normal user or a "#" for root.

              NOTE: if the PROMPT_CR option is not set, enabling this option  will  have  no  effect.   This
              option is on by default.

       <b>PROMPT_PERCENT</b> &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
              If set, `<b>%</b>' is treated specially in prompt expansion.  See the section `Prompt Expansion'.

       <b>PROMPT_SUBST</b> &lt;K&gt;
              If  set,  <u>parameter</u>  <u>expansion</u>, <u>command</u> <u>substitution</u> and <u>arithmetic</u> <u>expansion</u> are performed in
              prompts.  Substitutions within prompts do not affect the command status.

       <b>TRANSIENT_RPROMPT</b>
              Remove any right prompt from display when accepting a command line.  This may be  useful  with
              terminals with other cut/paste methods.


   <b>Scripts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Functions</b>
       <b>C_BASES</b>
              Output  hexadecimal  numbers in the standard C format, for example `<b>0xFF</b>' instead of the usual
              `<b>16#FF</b>'.  If the option <b>OCTAL_ZEROES</b> is also set (it is not by default), octal numbers will be
              treated  similarly  and hence appear as `<b>077</b>' instead of `<b>8#77</b>'.  This option has no effect on
              the choice of the output base, nor on the output of bases other than  hexadecimal  and  octal.
              Note that these formats will be understood on input irrespective of the setting of <b>C_BASES</b>.

       <b>DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD</b>
              Run  the <b>DEBUG</b> trap before each command; otherwise it is run after each command.  Setting this
              option mimics the behaviour of ksh 93; with the option unset the behaviour is that of ksh  88.

       <b>ERR_EXIT</b> (<b>-e</b>, ksh: <b>-e</b>)
              If  a  command  has  a non-zero exit status, execute the <b>ZERR</b> trap, if set, and exit.  This is
              disabled while running initialization scripts.

       <b>ERR_RETURN</b>
              If a command has a non-zero exit status, return immediately from the enclosing function.   The
              logic  is identical to that for <b>ERR_EXIT</b>, except that an implicit <b>return</b> statement is executed
              instead of an <b>exit</b>.  This will trigger an exit at the outermost  level  of  a  non-interactive
              script.

       <b>EVAL_LINENO</b> &lt;Z&gt;
              If set, line numbers of expressions evaluated using the builtin <b>eval</b> are tracked separately of
              the enclosing environment.  This applies both to the parameter <b>LINENO</b> and the line number out-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">put&nbsp;output</font>
              put  by  the  prompt  escape  <b>%i</b>.   If the option is set, the prompt escape <b>%N</b> will output the
              string `<b>(eval)</b>' instead of the script or function name as an  indication.    (The  two  prompt
              escapes  are  typically used in the parameter <b>PS4</b> to be output when the option <b>XTRACE</b> is set.)
              If <b>EVAL_LINENO</b> is unset, the line number of the surrounding script  or  function  is  retained
              during the evaluation.

       <b>EXEC</b> (<b>+n</b>, ksh: <b>+n</b>) &lt;D&gt;
              Do  execute  commands.   Without this option, commands are read and checked for syntax errors,
              but not executed.  This option cannot be turned off in an interactive shell, except when  `<b>-n</b>'
              is supplied to the shell at startup.

       <b>FUNCTION_ARGZERO</b> &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
              When  executing  a  shell function or sourcing a script, set <b>$0</b> temporarily to the name of the
              function/script.

       <b>LOCAL_OPTIONS</b> &lt;K&gt;
              If this option is set at the point of return from a shell function, all the options (including
              this  one)  which were in force upon entry to the function are restored.  Otherwise, only this
              option and the <b>XTRACE</b> and <b>PRINT_EXIT_VALUE</b> options are restored.  Hence if this is  explicitly
              unset by a shell function the other options in force at the point of return will remain so.  A
              shell function can also guarantee itself a known shell configuration with a  formulation  like
              `<b>emulate</b> <b>-L</b> <b>zsh</b>'; the <b>-L</b> activates <b>LOCAL_OPTIONS</b>.

       <b>LOCAL_TRAPS</b> &lt;K&gt;
              If this option is set when a signal trap is set inside a function, then the previous status of
              the trap for that signal will be restored when the function exits.  Note that this option must
              be  set <u>prior</u> to altering the trap behaviour in a function; unlike <b>LOCAL_OPTIONS</b>, the value on
              exit from the function is irrelevant.  However, it does not need to be set before  any  global
              trap for that to be correctly restored by a function.  For example,

                     <b>unsetopt</b> <b>localtraps</b>
                     <b>trap</b> <b>-</b> <b>INT</b>
                     <b>fn()</b> <b>{</b> <b>setopt</b> <b>localtraps;</b> <b>trap</b> <b>''</b> <b>INT;</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>3;</b> <b>}</b>

              will restore normally handling of <b>SIGINT</b> after the function exits.

       <b>MULTIOS</b> &lt;Z&gt;
              Perform implicit <b>tee</b>s or <b>cat</b>s when multiple redirections are attempted (see the section `Redi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rection').&nbsp;`Redirection').</font>
              rection').

       <b>OCTAL_ZEROES</b> &lt;S&gt;
              Interpret any integer constant beginning with a 0 as octal,  per  IEEE  Std  1003.2-1992  (ISO
              9945-2:1993).  This is not enabled by default as it causes problems with parsing of, for exam-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ple,&nbsp;example,</font>
              ple, date and time strings with leading zeroes.

              Sequences of digits indicating a numeric base such as the `<b>08</b>' component in `<b>08#77</b>' are always
              interpreted as decimal, regardless of leading zeroes.

       <b>TYPESET_SILENT</b>
              If this is unset, executing any of the `<b>typeset</b>' family of commands with no options and a list
              of parameters that have no values to be assigned but already exist will display the  value  of
              the  parameter.   If  the  option is set, they will only be shown when parameters are selected
              with the `<b>-m</b>' option.  The option `<b>-p</b>' is available whether or not the option is set.

       <b>VERBOSE</b> (<b>-v</b>, ksh: <b>-v</b>)
              Print shell input lines as they are read.

       <b>XTRACE</b> (<b>-x</b>, ksh: <b>-x</b>)
              Print commands and their arguments as they are executed.


   <b>Shell</b> <b>Emulation</b>
       <b>BSD_ECHO</b> &lt;S&gt;
              Make the <b>echo</b> builtin compatible with the BSD  <a href="echo.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/echo"><u>echo</u>(1)</a>  command.   This  disables  backslashed
              escape sequences in echo strings unless the <b>-e</b> option is specified.

       <b>CSH_JUNKIE_HISTORY</b> &lt;C&gt;
              A  history  reference  without  an  event specifier will always refer to the previous command.
              Without this option, such a history reference refers to the same event as the previous history
              reference, defaulting to the previous command.

       <b>CSH_JUNKIE_LOOPS</b> &lt;C&gt;
              Allow loop bodies to take the form `<u>list</u>; <b>end</b>' instead of `<b>do</b> <u>list</u>; <b>done</b>'.

       <b>CSH_JUNKIE_QUOTES</b> &lt;C&gt;
              Changes the rules for single- and double-quoted text to match that of <b>csh</b>.  These require that
              embedded newlines be preceded by a backslash; unescaped newlines will cause an error  message.
              In  double-quoted  strings, it is made impossible to escape `<b>$</b>', `<b>`</b>' or `<b>"</b>' (and `<b>\</b>' itself no
              longer needs escaping).  Command substitutions are only expanded once, and cannot be nested.

       <b>CSH_NULLCMD</b> &lt;C&gt;
              Do not use the values of <b>NULLCMD</b> and <b>READNULLCMD</b> when running redirections  with  no  command.
              This make such redirections fail (see the section `Redirection').

       <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
              Emulate  <b>ksh</b> array handling as closely as possible.  If this option is set, array elements are
              numbered from zero, an array parameter without subscript refers to the first  element  instead
              of  the  whole array, and braces are required to delimit a subscript (`<b>${path[2]}</b>' rather than
              just `<b>$path[2]</b>').

       <b>KSH_AUTOLOAD</b> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
              Emulate <b>ksh</b> function autoloading.  This means that when a function is autoloaded,  the  corre-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sponding&nbsp;corresponding</font>
              sponding file is merely executed, and must define the function itself.  (By default, the func-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;function</font>
              tion is defined to the contents of the file.  However, the most common <b>ksh</b>-style case - of the
              file  containing  only a simple definition of the function - is always handled in the <b>ksh</b>-com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">patible&nbsp;ksh-compatible</font>
              patible manner.)

       <b>KSH_OPTION_PRINT</b> &lt;K&gt;
              Alters the way options settings are printed: instead  of  separate  lists  of  set  and  unset
              options, all options are shown, marked `on' if they are in the non-default state, `off' other-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">wise.&nbsp;otherwise.</font>
              wise.

       <b>KSH_TYPESET</b> &lt;K&gt;
              Alters the way arguments to the <b>typeset</b> family of commands, including <b>declare</b>, <b>export</b>,  <b>float</b>,
              <b>integer</b>, <b>local</b> and <b>readonly</b>, are processed.  Without this option, zsh will perform normal word
              splitting after command and parameter expansion in arguments of an assignment; with  it,  word
              splitting does not take place in those cases.

       <b>POSIX_BUILTINS</b> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
              When  this  option  is  set the <b>command</b> builtin can be used to execute shell builtin commands.
              Parameter assignments specified before shell functions and special builtins are kept after the
              command  completes  unless  the special builtin is prefixed with the <b>command</b> builtin.  Special
              builtins are <b>.</b>, <b>:</b>, <b>break</b>, <b>continue</b>, <b>declare</b>, <b>eval</b>, <b>exit</b>,  <b>export</b>,  <b>integer</b>,  <b>local</b>,  <b>readonly</b>,
              <b>return</b>, <b>set</b>, <b>shift</b>, <b>source</b>, <b>times</b>, <b>trap</b> and <b>unset</b>.

       <b>POSIX_IDENTIFIERS</b> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
              When this option is set, only the ASCII characters <b>a</b> to <b>z</b>, <b>A</b> to <b>Z</b>, <b>0</b> to <b>9</b> and <b>_</b> may be used in
              identifiers (names of shell parameters and modules).

              When the option is unset and multibyte character support is enabled (i.e. it  is  compiled  in
              and  the  option <b>MULTIBYTE</b> is set), then additionally any alphanumeric characters in the local
              character set may be used in identifiers.  Note that scripts and functions written  with  this
              feature are not portable, and also that both options must be set before the script or function
              is parsed; setting them during execution is not sufficient as the  syntax  <u>variable</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>  has
              already been parsed as a command rather than an assignment.

              If  multibyte  character  support  is  not compiled into the shell this option is ignored; all
              octets with the top bit set may be used in identifiers.  This is non-standard but is the  tra-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ditional&nbsp;traditional</font>
              ditional zsh behaviour.

       <b>SH_FILE_EXPANSION</b> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
              Perform  filename  expansion (e.g., ~ expansion) <u>before</u> parameter expansion, command substitu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion,&nbsp;substitution,</font>
              tion, arithmetic expansion and brace expansion.  If this option  is  unset,  it  is  performed
              <u>after</u> brace expansion, so things like `<b>~$USERNAME</b>' and `<b>~{pfalstad,rc}</b>' will work.

       <b>SH_NULLCMD</b> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
              Do not use the values of <b>NULLCMD</b> and <b>READNULLCMD</b> when doing redirections, use `<b>:</b>' instead (see
              the section `Redirection').

       <b>SH_OPTION_LETTERS</b> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
              If this option is set the shell tries to interpret single letter options (which are used  with
              <b>set</b> and <b>setopt</b>) like <b>ksh</b> does.  This also affects the value of the <b>-</b> special parameter.

       <b>SH_WORD_SPLIT</b> (<b>-y</b>) &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
              Causes  field  splitting  to  be  performed  on unquoted parameter expansions.  Note that this
              option has nothing to do with word splitting.  (See the section `Parameter Expansion'.)

       <b>TRAPS_ASYNC</b>
              While waiting for a program to exit, handle signals and run traps immediately.  Otherwise  the
              trap  is  run  after a child process has exited.  Note this does not affect the point at which
              traps are run for any case other than when the shell is waiting for a child process.


   <b>Shell</b> <b>State</b>
       <b>INTERACTIVE</b> (<b>-i</b>, ksh: <b>-i</b>)
              This is an interactive shell.  This option is set upon initialisation if the standard input is
              a  tty  and  commands are being read from standard input.  (See the discussion of <b>SHIN_STDIN</b>.)
              This heuristic may be overridden by specifying a state for this option on  the  command  line.
              The value of this option cannot be changed anywhere other than the command line.

       <b>LOGIN</b> (<b>-l</b>, ksh: <b>-l</b>)
              This  is  a  login shell.  If this option is not explicitly set, the shell is a login shell if
              the first character of the <b>argv[0]</b> passed to the shell is a `<b>-</b>'.

       <b>PRIVILEGED</b> (<b>-p</b>, ksh: <b>-p</b>)
              Turn on privileged mode. This is enabled  automatically  on  startup  if  the  effective  user
              (group)  ID  is  not  equal  to  the real user (group) ID.  Turning this option off causes the
              effective user and group IDs to be set to the real user and group IDs.  This  option  disables
              sourcing  user  startup  files.   If  zsh  is  invoked  as `<b>sh</b>' or `<b>ksh</b>' with this option set,
              <b>/etc/suid_profile</b> is sourced (after <b>/etc/profile</b> on interactive shells).  Sourcing  <b>~/.profile</b>
              is  disabled  and  the  contents of the <b>ENV</b> variable is ignored. This option cannot be changed
              using the <b>-m</b> option of <b>setopt</b> and <b>unsetopt</b>, and changing it inside a function  always  changes
              it globally regardless of the <b>LOCAL_OPTIONS</b> option.

       <b>RESTRICTED</b> (<b>-r</b>)
              Enables  restricted mode.  This option cannot be changed using <b>unsetopt</b>, and setting it inside
              a function always changes it globally regardless of the <b>LOCAL_OPTIONS</b> option.  See the section
              `Restricted Shell'.

       <b>SHIN_STDIN</b> (<b>-s</b>, ksh: <b>-s</b>)
              Commands  are being read from the standard input.  Commands are read from standard input if no
              command is specified with <b>-c</b> and no file of commands  is  specified.   If  <b>SHIN_STDIN</b>  is  set
              explicitly on the command line, any argument that would otherwise have been taken as a file to
              run will instead be treated as a normal positional parameter.  Note that setting or  unsetting
              this  option  on  the  command line does not necessarily affect the state the option will have
              while the shell is running - that is purely an indicator of whether on not commands are  <u>actu</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ally&nbsp;actually</font>
              <u>ally</u>  being  read  from  standard  input.  The value of this option cannot be changed anywhere
              other than the command line.

       <b>SINGLE_COMMAND</b> (<b>-t</b>, ksh: <b>-t</b>)
              If the shell is reading from standard input, it exits after a single  command  has  been  exe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cuted.&nbsp;executed.</font>
              cuted.  This also makes the shell non-interactive, unless the <b>INTERACTIVE</b> option is explicitly
              set on the command line.  The value of this option cannot be changed anywhere other  than  the
              command line.


   <b>Zle</b>
       <b>BEEP</b> (<b>+B</b>) &lt;D&gt;
              Beep on error in ZLE.

       <b>EMACS</b>  If  ZLE is loaded, turning on this option has the equivalent effect of `<b>bindkey</b> <b>-e</b>'.  In addi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion,&nbsp;addition,</font>
              tion, the VI option is unset.  Turning it off has no effect.  The option setting is not  guar-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">anteed&nbsp;guaranteed</font>
              anteed  to  reflect the current keymap.  This option is provided for compatibility; <b>bindkey</b> is
              the recommended interface.

       <b>OVERSTRIKE</b>
              Start up the line editor in overstrike mode.

       <b>SINGLE_LINE_ZLE</b> (<b>-M</b>) &lt;K&gt;
              Use single-line command line editing instead of multi-line.

       <b>VI</b>     If ZLE is loaded, turning on this option has the equivalent effect of `<b>bindkey</b> <b>-v</b>'.  In  addi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion,&nbsp;addition,</font>
              tion,  the  EMACS  option  is unset.  Turning it off has no effect.  The option setting is not
              guaranteed to reflect the current keymap.  This option is provided for compatibility;  <b>bindkey</b>
              is the recommended interface.

       <b>ZLE</b> (<b>-Z</b>)
              Use the zsh line editor.  Set by default in interactive shells connected to a terminal.


<b>OPTION</b> <b>ALIASES</b>
       Some  options  have alternative names.  These aliases are never used for output, but can be used just
       like normal option names when specifying options to the shell.
