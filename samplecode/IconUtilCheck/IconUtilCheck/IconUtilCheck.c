/*	File:		IconUtilCheck.c	Contains:	According to the Tech Note OV - 16, "Inside Macintosh: More Macintosh 				Toolbox, page 5-7, specifies that the gestaltIconUtilitiesAttr - 'icon'				gestalt selector can be used to determine whether the icon utilities				are present under System 7.x.   Note that this selector is included in				the GestaltEqu files.  It turns out that this selector is not				implemented until System Software v7.1.2.  To check for the existence of				these utilities, use the TrapAvailable code to check for the 				_IconDispatch, (0xABC9) trap.  The TrapAvailable code is presented in				Inside Macintosh VI 3-8, and as sample code in many of the snippets				on the Developer CD."				This snippet shows how to determine whether the Icon Utilities				are available.	Written by: Virginia (Ginny) McCulloh		Copyright:	Copyright © 1995-1999 by Apple Computer, Inc., All Rights Reserved.				You may incorporate this Apple sample source code into your program(s) without				restriction.
