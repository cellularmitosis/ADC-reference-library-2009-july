ZSHPARAM(1)                                                                                      ZSHPARAM(1)



<b>NAME</b>
       zshparam - zsh parameters

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       A  parameter has a name, a value, and a number of attributes.  A name may be any sequence of alphanu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">meric&nbsp;alphanumeric</font>
       meric characters and underscores, or the single characters `<b>*</b>', `<b>@</b>', `<b>#</b>', `<b>?</b>', `<b>-</b>', `<b>$</b>', or `<b>!</b>'.  The
       value may be a <u>scalar</u> (a string), an integer, an array (indexed numerically), or an <u>associative</u> array
       (an unordered set of name-value pairs, indexed by name).  To declare the type of a parameter,  or  to
       assign a scalar or integer value to a parameter, use the <b>typeset</b> builtin.

       The value of a scalar or integer parameter may also be assigned by writing:

              <u>name</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>

       If  the  integer attribute, <b>-i</b>, is set for <u>name</u>, the <u>value</u> is subject to arithmetic evaluation.  Fur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">thermore,&nbsp;Furthermore,</font>
       thermore, by replacing `<b>=</b>' with `<b>+=</b>', a parameter can be added  or  appended  to.   See  the  section
       `Array Parameters' for additional forms of assignment.

       To  refer  to  the value of a parameter, write `<b>$</b><u>name</u>' or `<b>${</b><u>name</u><b>}</b>'.  See <u>Parameter</u> <u>Expansion</u> in <a href="zshexpn.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/zshexpn"><u>zsh</u></a>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">expn(1)&nbsp;zshexpn(1)</font>
       <a href="zshexpn.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/zshexpn"><u>expn</u>(1)</a> for complete details.

       In the parameter lists that follow, the mark `&lt;S&gt;' indicates that the parameter is special.   Special
       parameters  cannot  have  their type changed or their readonly attribute turned off, and if a special
       parameter is unset, then later recreated, the special properties will be retained.   `&lt;Z&gt;'  indicates
       that the parameter does not exist when the shell initializes in <b>sh</b> or <b>ksh</b> emulation mode.

<b>ARRAY</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b>
       To assign an array value, write one of:

              <b>set</b> <b>-A</b> <u>name</u> <u>value</u> ...
              <u>name</u><b>=(</b><u>value</u> ...<b>)</b>

       If  no  parameter  <u>name</u> exists, an ordinary array parameter is created.  If the parameter <u>name</u> exists
       and is a scalar, it is replaced by a new array.  Ordinary array parameters  may  also  be  explicitly
       declared with:

              <b>typeset</b> <b>-a</b> <u>name</u>

       Associative arrays <u>must</u> be declared before assignment, by using:

              <b>typeset</b> <b>-A</b> <u>name</u>

       When  <u>name</u>  refers  to  an associative array, the list in an assignment is interpreted as alternating
       keys and values:

              set -A <u>name</u> <u>key</u> <u>value</u> ...
              <u>name</u><b>=(</b><u>key</u> <u>value</u> ...<b>)</b>

       Every <u>key</u> must have a <u>value</u> in this case.  Note that this assigns to the entire array,  deleting  any
       elements that do not appear in the list.

       To create an empty array (including associative arrays), use one of:

              <b>set</b> <b>-A</b> <u>name</u>
              <u>name</u><b>=()</b>


   <b>Array</b> <b>Subscripts</b>
       Individual  elements  of an array may be selected using a subscript.  A subscript of the form `<b>[</b><u>exp</u><b>]</b>'
       selects the single element <u>exp</u>, where <u>exp</u> is an arithmetic expression which will be subject to arith-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">metic&nbsp;arithmetic</font>
       metic  expansion as if it were surrounded by `<b>$((</b>...<b>))</b>'.  The elements are numbered beginning with 1,
       unless the <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b> option is set in which case they are numbered from zero.

       Subscripts may be used inside braces used to delimit a parameter name, thus `<b>${foo[2]}</b>' is equivalent
       to `<b>$foo[2]</b>'.  If the <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b> option is set, the braced form is the only one that works, as brack-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">eted&nbsp;bracketed</font>
       eted expressions otherwise are not treated as subscripts.

       The same subscripting syntax is used for associative arrays, except that no arithmetic  expansion  is
       applied to <u>exp</u>.  However, the parsing rules for arithmetic expressions still apply, which affects the
       way that certain special characters must be protected from  interpretation.   See  <u>Subscript</u>  <u>Parsing</u>
       below for details.

       A  subscript of the form `<b>[*]</b>' or `<b>[@]</b>' evaluates to all elements of an array; there is no difference
       between the two except when they appear within double quotes.   `<b>"$foo[*]"</b>'  evaluates  to  `<b>"$foo[1]</b>
       <b>$foo[2]</b>  ...<b>"</b>',  whereas `<b>"$foo[@]"</b>' evaluates to `<b>"$foo[1]"</b> <b>"$foo[2]"</b> ...'.  For associative arrays,
       `<b>[*]</b>' or `<b>[@]</b>' evaluate to all the values, in no particular order.  Note that this does  not  substi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tute&nbsp;substitute</font>
       tute  the  keys; see the documentation for the `<b>k</b>' flag under <u>Parameter</u> <u>Expansion</u> <u>Flags</u> in <a href="zshexpn.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/zshexpn"><u>zshexpn</u>(1)</a>
       for complete details.  When an array parameter is referenced as `<b>$</b><u>name</u>' (with no subscript) it evalu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ates&nbsp;evaluates</font>
       ates  to  `<b>$</b><u>name</u><b>[*]</b>',  unless the <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b> option is set in which case it evaluates to `<b>${</b><u>name</u><b>[0]}</b>'
       (for an associative array, this means the value of the key `<b>0</b>', which may not exist even if there are
       values for other keys).

       A  subscript  of  the  form  `<b>[</b><u>exp1</u><b>,</b><u>exp2</u><b>]</b>' selects all elements in the range <u>exp1</u> to <u>exp2</u>, inclusive.
       (Associative arrays are unordered, and so do not support ranges.) If one of the subscripts  evaluates
       to  a  negative  number,  say  <b>-</b><u>n</u>,  then  the  <u>n</u>th  element  from the end of the array is used.  Thus
       `<b>$foo[-3]</b>' is the third element from the end of the array  <b>foo</b>,  and  `<b>$foo[1,-1]</b>'  is  the  same  as
       `<b>$foo[*]</b>'.

       Subscripting  may  also be performed on non-array values, in which case the subscripts specify a sub-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">string&nbsp;substring</font>
       string to be extracted.  For example, if <b>FOO</b> is set to `<b>foobar</b>', then `<b>echo</b> <b>$FOO[2,5]</b>' prints `<b>ooba</b>'.


   <b>Array</b> <b>Element</b> <b>Assignment</b>
       A subscript may be used on the left side of an assignment like so:

              <u>name</u><b>[</b><u>exp</u><b>]=</b><u>value</u>

       In this form of assignment the element or range specified by <u>exp</u> is replaced by the expression on the
       right side.  An array (but not an associative array) may be created by assignment to a range or  ele-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment.&nbsp;element.</font>
       ment.  Arrays do not nest, so assigning a parenthesized list of values to an element or range changes
       the number of elements in the array, shifting the other  elements  to  accommodate  the  new  values.
       (This is not supported for associative arrays.)

       This syntax also works as an argument to the <b>typeset</b> command:

              <b>typeset</b> <b>"</b><u>name</u><b>[</b><u>exp</u><b>]"=</b><u>value</u>

       The  <u>value</u>  may <u>not</u> be a parenthesized list in this case; only single-element assignments may be made
       with <b>typeset</b>.  Note that quotes are necessary in this case to prevent the brackets from being  inter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">preted&nbsp;interpreted</font>
       preted as filename generation operators.  The <b>noglob</b> precommand modifier could be used instead.

       To  delete  an element of an ordinary array, assign `<b>()</b>' to that element.  To delete an element of an
       associative array, use the <b>unset</b> command:

              <b>unset</b> <b>"</b><u>name</u><b>[</b><u>exp</u><b>]"</b>


   <b>Subscript</b> <b>Flags</b>
       If the opening bracket, or the comma in a range, in any subscript expression is directly followed  by
       an  opening  parenthesis,  the  string  up  to the matching closing one is considered to be a list of
       flags, as in `<u>name</u><b>[(</b><u>flags</u><b>)</b><u>exp</u><b>]</b>'.

       The flags <b>s</b>, <b>n</b> and <b>b</b> take an argument; the delimiter is shown below as `<b>:</b>', but any character, or the
       matching pairs `<b>(</b>...<b>)</b>', `<b>{</b>...<b>}</b>', `<b>[</b>...<b>]</b>', or `<b>&lt;</b>...<b>&gt;</b>', may be used.

       The flags currently understood are:

       <b>w</b>      If  the  parameter  subscripted  is  a  scalar then this flag makes subscripting work on words
              instead of characters.  The default word separator is whitespace.

       <b>s:</b><u>string</u><b>:</b>
              This gives the <u>string</u> that separates words (for use with the <b>w</b> flag).  The delimiter character
              <b>:</b> is arbitrary; see above.

       <b>p</b>      Recognize  the  same  escape sequences as the <b>print</b> builtin in the string argument of a subse-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">quent&nbsp;subsequent</font>
              quent `<b>s</b>' flag.

       <b>f</b>      If the parameter subscripted is a scalar then this  flag  makes  subscripting  work  on  lines
              instead  of  characters,  i.e.  with  elements separated by newlines.  This is a shorthand for
              `<b>pws:\n:</b>'.

       <b>r</b>      Reverse subscripting: if this flag is given, the <u>exp</u> is taken as a pattern and the  result  is
              the  first matching array element, substring or word (if the parameter is an array, if it is a
              scalar, or if it is a scalar and the `<b>w</b>' flag is given, respectively).  The subscript used  is
              the  number  of  the matching element, so that pairs of subscripts such as `<b>$foo[(r)</b><u>??</u><b>,3]</b>' and
              `<b>$foo[(r)</b><u>??</u><b>,(r)f*]</b>' are possible if the parameter is not an associative array.  If the parame-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ter&nbsp;parameter</font>
              ter  is an associative array, only the value part of each pair is compared to the pattern, and
              the result is that value.

              If a search through an ordinary array failed, the search sets the subscript to  one  past  the
              end  of  the array, and hence <b>${array[(r)pattern]}</b> will substitute the empty string.  Thus the
              success of a search can be tested by using the <b>(i)</b> flag,  for  example  (assuming  the  option
              <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b> is not in effect):

                     <b>[[</b> <b>${array[(i)pattern]}</b> <b>-le</b> <b>${#array}</b> <b>]]</b>

              If <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b> is in effect, the <b>-le</b> should be replaced by <b>-lt</b>.

              Note  that in subscripts with both `<b>r</b>' and `<b>R</b>' pattern characters are active even if they were
              substituted for a parameter (regardless of the setting of <b>GLOB_SUBST</b> which controls this  fea-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ture&nbsp;feature</font>
              ture  in  normal pattern matching).  It is therefore necessary to quote pattern characters for
              an exact string match.  Given a string in <b>$key</b>, and assuming the <b>EXTENDED_GLOB</b> option is  set,
              the  following  is  sufficient  to  match an element of an array <b>$array</b> containing exactly the
              value of <b>$key</b>:

                     <b>key2=${key//(#m)[\][()\\*?#&lt;&gt;~^]/\\$MATCH}</b>
                     <b>print</b> <b>${array[(R)$key2]}</b>

       <b>R</b>      Like `<b>r</b>', but gives the last match.  For associative arrays, gives all possible  matches.  May
              be used for assigning to ordinary array elements, but not for assigning to associative arrays.

              Note that this flag can give odd results on failure.  For an ordinary array the  item  substi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tuted&nbsp;substituted</font>
              tuted  is  that corresponding to subscript 0.  If the option <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b> is not in effect, this
              is the same as the element corresponding to subscript 1,  although  the  form  <b>${array[(I)pat</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tern]}&nbsp;${array[(I)pattern]}</font>
              <b>tern]}</b> will evaluate to 0 for a failed match.  If the option <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b> is in effect, the sub-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">script&nbsp;subscript</font>
              script is still 0 for a failed match; this cannot be distinguished  from  a  successful  match
              without testing <b>${array[0]}</b> against the pattern.

       <b>i</b>      Like  `<b>r</b>',  but  gives  the index of the match instead; this may not be combined with a second
              argument.  On the left side of an assignment, behaves like `<b>r</b>'.  For associative  arrays,  the
              key  part  of  each  pair  is compared to the pattern, and the first matching key found is the
              result.

              See `<b>r</b>' for discussion of subscripts of failed matches.

       <b>I</b>      Like `<b>i</b>', but gives the index of the last match, or all possible matching keys in an  associa-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tive&nbsp;associative</font>
              tive array.

              See `<b>R</b>' for discussion of subscripts of failed matches.

       <b>k</b>      If used in a subscript on an associative array, this flag causes the keys to be interpreted as
              patterns, and returns the value for the first key found where <u>exp</u> is matched by the key.  This
              flag does not work on the left side of an assignment to an associative array element.  If used
              on another type of parameter, this behaves like `<b>r</b>'.

       <b>K</b>      On an associative array this is like `<b>k</b>' but returns all values where <u>exp</u> is  matched  by  the
              keys.  On other types of parameters this has the same effect as `<b>R</b>'.

       <b>n:</b><u>expr</u><b>:</b>
              If  combined  with  `<b>r</b>',  `<b>R</b>',  `<b>i</b>' or `<b>I</b>', makes them give the <u>n</u>th or <u>n</u>th last match (if <u>expr</u>
              evaluates to <u>n</u>).  This flag is ignored when the array is associative.  The delimiter character
              <b>:</b> is arbitrary; see above.

       <b>b:</b><u>expr</u><b>:</b>
              If  combined with `<b>r</b>', `<b>R</b>', `<b>i</b>' or `<b>I</b>', makes them begin at the <u>n</u>th or <u>n</u>th last element, word,
              or character (if <u>expr</u> evaluates to <u>n</u>).  This flag is ignored when the  array  is  associative.
              The delimiter character <b>:</b> is arbitrary; see above.

       <b>e</b>      This  flag  has no effect and for ordinary arrays is retained for backward compatibility only.
              For associative arrays, this flag can be used to force <b>*</b> or <b>@</b> to be interpreted  as  a  single
              key  rather  than  as a reference to all values.  This flag may be used on the left side of an
              assignment.

       See <u>Parameter</u> <u>Expansion</u> <u>Flags</u> <a href="zshexpn.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/zshexpn">(<u>zshexpn</u>(1)</a>) for additional ways to manipulate  the  results  of  array
       subscripting.


   <b>Subscript</b> <b>Parsing</b>
       This discussion applies mainly to associative array key strings and to patterns used for reverse sub-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">scripting&nbsp;subscripting</font>
       scripting (the `<b>r</b>', `<b>R</b>', `<b>i</b>', etc. flags), but it may also affect parameter substitutions that appear
       as part of an arithmetic expression in an ordinary subscript.

       It  is  possible to avoid the use of subscripts in assignments to associative array elements by using
       the syntax:

                 <b>aa+=('key</b> <b>with</b> <b>"*strange*"</b> <b>characters'</b> <b>'value</b> <b>string')</b>

       This adds a new key/value pair if the key is not already present, and  replaces  the  value  for  the
       existing key if it is.

       The  basic  rule to remember when writing a subscript expression is that all text between the opening
       `<b>[</b>' and the closing `<b>]</b>' is interpreted <u>as</u> <u>if</u> it were in double  quotes  (see  <a href="zshmisc.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/zshmisc"><u>zshmisc</u>(1)</a>).   However,
       unlike  double  quotes  which  normally  cannot  nest,  subscript  expressions may appear inside dou-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ble-quoted&nbsp;double-quoted</font>
       ble-quoted strings or inside other subscript expressions (or both!), so the rules have two  important
       differences.

       The  first  difference  is  that  brackets (`<b>[</b>' and `<b>]</b>') must appear as balanced pairs in a subscript
       expression unless they are preceded by a backslash (`<b>\</b>').  Therefore, within a  subscript  expression
       (and unlike true double-quoting) the sequence `<b>\[</b>' becomes `<b>[</b>', and similarly `<b>\]</b>' becomes `<b>]</b>'.  This
       applies even in cases where a backslash is not normally required; for example, the pattern `<b>[^[]</b>' (to
       match any character other than an open bracket) should be written `<b>[^\[]</b>' in a reverse-subscript pat-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tern.&nbsp;pattern.</font>
       tern.  However, note that `<b>\[^\[\]</b>' and even `<b>\[^[]</b>' mean the <u>same</u>  thing,  because  backslashes  are
       always stripped when they appear before brackets!

       The  same rule applies to parentheses (`<b>(</b>' and `<b>)</b>') and braces (`<b>{</b>' and `<b>}</b>'): they must appear either
       in balanced pairs or preceded by a backslash, and backslashes that protect parentheses or braces  are
       removed  during parsing.  This is because parameter expansions may be surrounded balanced braces, and
       subscript flags are introduced by balanced parenthesis.

       The second difference is that a double-quote (`<b>"</b>') may appear as part of a subscript expression with-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">out&nbsp;without</font>
       out  being  preceded by a backslash, and therefore that the two characters `<b>\"</b>' remain as two charac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ters&nbsp;characters</font>
       ters in the subscript (in true double-quoting, `<b>\"</b>' becomes `<b>"</b>').  However, because of  the  standard
       shell  quoting rules, any double-quotes that appear must occur in balanced pairs unless preceded by a
       backslash.  This makes it more difficult to write a subscript expression that contains an odd  number
       of double-quote characters, but the reason for this difference is so that when a subscript expression
       appears inside true double-quotes, one can still write `<b>\"</b>' (rather than `<b>\\\"</b>') for `<b>"</b>'.

       To use an odd number of double quotes as a key in an assignment,  use  the  <b>typeset</b>  builtin  and  an
       enclosing pair of double quotes; to refer to the value of that key, again use double quotes:

              <b>typeset</b> <b>-A</b> <b>aa</b>
              <b>typeset</b> <b>"aa[one\"two\"three\"quotes]"=QQQ</b>
              <b>print</b> <b>"$aa[one\"two\"three\"quotes]"</b>

       It  is  important to note that the quoting rules do not change when a parameter expansion with a sub-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">script&nbsp;subscript</font>
       script is nested inside another subscript expression.  That is, it is not necessary to use additional
       backslashes  within  the  inner  subscript expression; they are removed only once, from the innermost
       subscript outwards.  Parameters are also expanded from the innermost subscript first, as each  expan-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion&nbsp;expansion</font>
       sion is encountered left to right in the outer expression.

       A  further  complication  arises  from  a way in which subscript parsing is <u>not</u> different from double
       quote parsing.  As in true double-quoting, the sequences `<b>\*</b>', and `<b>\@</b>' remain as two characters when
       they  appear in a subscript expression.  To use a literal `<b>*</b>' or `<b>@</b>' as an associative array key, the
       `<b>e</b>' flag must be used:

              <b>typeset</b> <b>-A</b> <b>aa</b>
              <!-- a --><b>aa[(e)</b><!-- /a --><b>*]=star</b>
              <b>print</b> <b>$aa[(e)*]</b>

       A last detail must be considered when reverse subscripting is performed.  Parameters appearing in the
       subscript expression are first expanded and then the complete expression is interpreted as a pattern.
       This has two effects: first, parameters behave as if <b>GLOB_SUBST</b> were on  (and  it  cannot  be  turned
       off); second, backslashes are interpreted twice, once when parsing the array subscript and again when
       parsing the pattern.  In a reverse subscript, it's necessary to use <u>four</u> backslashes to cause a  sin-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">gle&nbsp;single</font>
       gle backslash to match literally in the pattern.  For complex patterns, it is often easiest to assign
       the desired pattern to a parameter and then refer to that parameter in the  subscript,  because  then
       the backslashes, brackets, parentheses, etc., are seen only when the complete expression is converted
       to a pattern.  To match the value of a parameter literally in a reverse subscript, rather than  as  a
       pattern, use `<b>${(q)</b><u>name</u><b>}</b>' (see <a href="zshexpn.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/zshexpn"><u>zshexpn</u>(1)</a>) to quote the expanded value.

       Note  that  the `<b>k</b>' and `<b>K</b>' flags are reverse subscripting for an ordinary array, but are <u>not</u> reverse
       subscripting for an associative array!  (For an associative array, the keys in the array  itself  are
       interpreted as patterns by those flags; the subscript is a plain string in that case.)

       One  final  note,  not  directly  related to subscripting: the numeric names of positional parameters
       (described below) are parsed specially, so for example `<b>$2foo</b>' is equivalent  to  `<b>${2}foo</b>'.   There-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fore,&nbsp;Therefore,</font>
       fore,  to use subscript syntax to extract a substring from a positional parameter, the expansion must
       be surrounded by braces; for example, `<b>${2[3,5]}</b>' evaluates to the third through fifth characters  of
       the  second  positional parameter, but `<b>$2[3,5]</b>' is the entire second parameter concatenated with the
       filename generation pattern `<b>[3,5]</b>'.


<b>POSITIONAL</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b>
       The positional parameters provide access to the command-line arguments of  a  shell  function,  shell
       script,  or  the  shell  itself; see the section `Invocation', and also the section `Functions'.  The
       parameter <u>n</u>, where <u>n</u> is a number, is the <u>n</u>th positional parameter.  The parameters <b>*</b>, <b>@</b> and <b>argv</b>  are
       arrays containing all the positional parameters; thus `<b>$argv[</b><u>n</u><b>]</b>', etc., is equivalent to simply `<b>$</b><u>n</u>'.

       Positional parameters may be changed after the shell or function starts by using the <b>set</b> builtin,  by
       assigning  to  the <b>argv</b> array, or by direct assignment of the form `<u>n</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>' where <u>n</u> is the number of
       the positional parameter to be changed.  This also creates (with empty values) any of  the  positions
       from  1  to  <u>n</u> that do not already have values.  Note that, because the positional parameters form an
       array, an array assignment of the form `<u>n</u><b>=(</b><u>value</u> ...<b>)</b>' is allowed, and has the effect of shifting all
       the  values at positions greater than <u>n</u> by as many positions as necessary to accommodate the new val-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ues.&nbsp;values.</font>
       ues.


<b>LOCAL</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b>
       Shell function executions delimit scopes for shell parameters.  (Parameters are dynamically  scoped.)
       The <b>typeset</b> builtin, and its alternative forms <b>declare</b>, <b>integer</b>, <b>local</b> and <b>readonly</b> (but not <b>export</b>),
       can be used to declare a parameter as being local to the innermost scope.

       When a parameter is read or assigned to, the innermost existing  parameter  of  that  name  is  used.
       (That  is, the local parameter hides any less-local parameter.)  However, assigning to a non-existent
       parameter, or declaring a new parameter with <b>export</b>, causes it to be created in the <u>outer</u>most  scope.

       Local  parameters  disappear when their scope ends.  <b>unset</b> can be used to delete a parameter while it
       is still in scope; any outer parameter of the same name remains hidden.

       Special parameters may also be made local; they retain their special  attributes  unless  either  the
       existing  or  the  newly-created  parameter  has  the  <b>-h</b> (hide) attribute.  This may have unexpected
       effects: there is no default value, so if there is no assignment at the point the  variable  is  made
       local, it will be set to an empty value (or zero in the case of integers).  The following:

              <b>typeset</b> <b>PATH=/new/directory:$PATH</b>

       is  valid  for  temporarily  allowing  the shell or programmes called from it to find the programs in
       <b>/new/directory</b> inside a function.

       Note that the restriction in older versions of zsh that local parameters were never exported has been
       removed.


<b>PARAMETERS</b> <b>SET</b> <b>BY</b> <b>THE</b> <b>SHELL</b>
       The following parameters are automatically set by the shell:

       <b>!</b> &lt;S&gt;  The  process  ID  of  the last command started in the background with <b>&amp;</b>, or put into the back-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ground&nbsp;background</font>
              ground with the <b>bg</b> builtin.

       <b>#</b> &lt;S&gt;  The number of positional parameters in decimal.  Note that some confusion may occur  with  the
              syntax  <b>$#</b><u>param</u>  which  substitutes the length of <u>param</u>.  Use <b>${#}</b> to resolve ambiguities.  In
              particular, the sequence `<b>$#-</b><u>...</u>' in an arithmetic expression is interpreted as the length  of
              the parameter <b>-</b>, q.v.

       <b>ARGC</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
              Same as <b>#</b>.

       <b>$</b> &lt;S&gt;  The process ID of this shell.  Note that this indicates the original shell started by invoking
              <b>zsh</b>; all processes forked from the shells without executing a new program, such  as  subshells
              started by <b>(</b><u>...</u><b>)</b>, substitute the same value.

       <b>-</b> &lt;S&gt;  Flags supplied to the shell on invocation or by the <b>set</b> or <b>setopt</b> commands.

       <b>*</b> &lt;S&gt;  An array containing the positional parameters.

       <b>argv</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
              Same  as <b>*</b>.  Assigning to <b>argv</b> changes the local positional parameters, but <b>argv</b> is <u>not</u> itself
              a local parameter.  Deleting <b>argv</b> with <b>unset</b> in any function deletes it  everywhere,  although
              only  the  innermost positional parameter array is deleted (so <b>*</b> and <b>@</b> in other scopes are not
              affected).

       <b>@</b> &lt;S&gt;  Same as <b>argv[@]</b>, even when <b>argv</b> is not set.

       <b>?</b> &lt;S&gt;  The exit status returned by the last command.

       <b>0</b> &lt;S&gt;  The name used to invoke the current shell.  If the <b>FUNCTION_ARGZERO</b> option is set, this is set
              temporarily  within  a shell function to the name of the function, and within a sourced script
              to the name of the script.

       <b>status</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
              Same as <b>?</b>.

       <b>pipestatus</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
              An array containing the exit statuses returned by all commands in the last pipeline.

       <b>_</b> &lt;S&gt;  The last argument of the previous command.  Also, this parameter is set in the environment  of
              every command executed to the full pathname of the command.

       <b>CPUTYPE</b>
              The machine type (microprocessor class or machine model), as determined at run time.

       <b>EGID</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The  effective  group  ID  of  the  shell process.  If you have sufficient privileges, you may
              change the effective group ID of the shell process  by  assigning  to  this  parameter.   Also
              (assuming  sufficient  privileges),  you may start a single command with a different effective
              group ID by `<b>(EGID=</b><u>gid</u><b>;</b> <b>command)</b>'

       <b>EUID</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The effective user ID of the shell process.  If you have sufficient privileges, you may change
              the  effective  user  ID  of the shell process by assigning to this parameter.  Also (assuming
              sufficient privileges), you may start a single command with a different effective user  ID  by
              `<b>(EUID=</b><u>uid</u><b>;</b> <b>command)</b>'

       <b>ERRNO</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The  value of errno (see <!-- a --><u>errno</u>(3)<!-- /a -->) as set by the most recently failed system call.  This value
              is system dependent and is intended for debugging  purposes.   It  is  also  useful  with  the
              <b>zsh/system</b> module which allows the number to be turned into a name or message.

       <b>GID</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The real group ID of the shell process.  If you have sufficient privileges, you may change the
              group ID of the shell process by assigning to this parameter.  Also (assuming sufficient priv-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ileges),&nbsp;privileges),</font>
              ileges), you may start a single command under a different group ID by `<b>(GID=</b><u>gid</u><b>;</b> <b>command)</b>'

       <b>HISTCMD</b>
              The  current  history  line number in an interactive shell, in other words the line number for
              the command that caused <b>$HISTCMD</b> to be read.

       <b>HOST</b>   The current hostname.

       <b>LINENO</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The line number of the current line within the current script, sourced file, or shell function
              being executed, whichever was started most recently.  Note that in the case of shell functions
              the line number refers to the function as it appeared in the original definition,  not  neces-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sarily&nbsp;necessarily</font>
              sarily as displayed by the <b>functions</b> builtin.

       <b>LOGNAME</b>
              If the corresponding variable is not set in the environment of the shell, it is initialized to
              the login name corresponding to the current login  session.  This  parameter  is  exported  by
              default but this can be disabled using the <b>typeset</b> builtin.

       <b>MACHTYPE</b>
              The machine type (microprocessor class or machine model), as determined at compile time.

       <b>OLDPWD</b> The  previous  working  directory.   This  is  set when the shell initializes and whenever the
              directory changes.

       <b>OPTARG</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The value of the last option argument processed by the <b>getopts</b> command.

       <b>OPTIND</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The index of the last option argument processed by the <b>getopts</b> command.

       <b>OSTYPE</b> The operating system, as determined at compile time.

       <b>PPID</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The process ID of the parent of the shell.  As for <b>$$</b>, the value indicates the parent  of  the
              original shell and does not change in subshells.

       <b>PWD</b>    The present working directory.  This is set when the shell initializes and whenever the direc-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tory&nbsp;directory</font>
              tory changes.

       <b>RANDOM</b> &lt;S&gt;
              A pseudo-random integer from 0 to 32767, newly generated each time this  parameter  is  refer-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">enced.&nbsp;referenced.</font>
              enced.  The random number generator can be seeded by assigning a numeric value to <b>RANDOM</b>.

              The  values  of <b>RANDOM</b> form an intentionally-repeatable pseudo-random sequence; subshells that
              reference <b>RANDOM</b> will result in identical pseudo-random values unless the value of  <b>RANDOM</b>  is
              referenced or seeded in the parent shell in between subshell invocations.

       <b>SECONDS</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The number of seconds since shell invocation.  If this parameter is assigned a value, then the
              value returned upon reference will be the value that was assigned plus the number  of  seconds
              since the assignment.

              Unlike  other  special  parameters, the type of the <b>SECONDS</b> parameter can be changed using the
              <b>typeset</b> command.  Only integer and one of the floating point types are allowed.  For  example,
              `<b>typeset</b>  <b>-F</b>  <b>SECONDS</b>' causes the value to be reported as a floating point number.  The preci-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion&nbsp;precision</font>
              sion is six decimal places, although not all places may be useful.

       <b>SHLVL</b> &lt;S&gt;
              Incremented by one each time a new shell is started.

       <b>signals</b>
              An array containing the names of the signals.

       <b>TRY_BLOCK_ERROR</b> &lt;S&gt;
              In an <b>always</b> block, indicates whether the preceding list of code caused an error.   The  value
              is  1  to indicate an error, 0 otherwise.  It may be reset, clearing the error condition.  See
              <u>Complex</u> <u>Commands</u> in <a href="zshmisc.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/zshmisc"><u>zshmisc</u>(1)</a>

       <b>TTY</b>    The name of the tty associated with the shell, if any.

       <b>TTYIDLE</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The idle time of the tty associated with the shell in seconds or -1 if there is no such tty.

       <b>UID</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The real user ID of the shell process.  If you have sufficient privileges, you may change  the
              user  ID  of the shell by assigning to this parameter.  Also (assuming sufficient privileges),
              you may start a single command under a different user ID by `<b>(UID=</b><u>uid</u><b>;</b> <b>command)</b>'

       <b>USERNAME</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The username corresponding to the real user ID of the shell process.  If you  have  sufficient
              privileges,  you  may  change the username (and also the user ID and group ID) of the shell by
              assigning to this parameter.  Also (assuming sufficient privileges), you may  start  a  single
              command  under  a  different  username (and user ID and group ID) by `<b>(USERNAME=</b><u>username</u><b>;</b> <b>com</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand)'&nbsp;command)'</font>
              <b>mand)</b>'

       <b>VENDOR</b> The vendor, as determined at compile time.

       <b>ZSH_NAME</b>
              Expands to the basename of the command used to invoke this instance of zsh.

       <b>ZSH_VERSION</b>
              The version number of this zsh.

<b>PARAMETERS</b> <b>USED</b> <b>BY</b> <b>THE</b> <b>SHELL</b>
       The following parameters are used by the shell.

       In cases where there are two parameters with an upper- and lowercase form of the same name,  such  as
       <b>path</b> and <b>PATH</b>, the lowercase form is an array and the uppercase form is a scalar with the elements of
       the array joined together by colons.  These are similar to tied parameters created via `<b>typeset</b>  <b>-T</b>'.
       The normal use for the colon-separated form is for exporting to the environment, while the array form
       is easier to manipulate within the shell.  Note that unsetting either of  the  pair  will  unset  the
       other;  they  retain  their  special  properties  when recreated, and recreating one of the pair will
       recreate the other.

       <b>ARGV0</b>  If exported, its value is used as the <b>argv[0]</b> of external  commands.   Usually  used  in  con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">structs&nbsp;constructs</font>
              structs like `<b>ARGV0=emacs</b> <b>nethack</b>'.

       <b>BAUD</b>   The rate in bits per second at which data reaches the terminal.  The line editor will use this
              value in order to compensate for a slow terminal by delaying updates to the display until nec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">essary.&nbsp;necessary.</font>
              essary.   If  the parameter is unset or the value is zero the compensation mechanism is turned
              off.  The parameter is not set by default.

              This parameter may be profitably set in some circumstances, e.g.  for slow modems dialing into
              a communications server, or on a slow wide area network.  It should be set to the baud rate of
              the slowest part of the link for best performance.

       <b>cdpath</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (<b>CDPATH</b> &lt;S&gt;)
              An array (colon-separated list) of directories specifying the search path for the <b>cd</b>  command.

       <b>COLUMNS</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The  number  of columns for this terminal session.  Used for printing select lists and for the
              line editor.

       <b>DIRSTACKSIZE</b>
              The maximum size of the directory stack.  If the stack gets larger than this, it will be trun-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cated&nbsp;truncated</font>
              cated automatically.  This is useful with the <b>AUTO_PUSHD</b> option.

       <b>ENV</b>    If the <b>ENV</b> environment variable is set when zsh is invoked as <b>sh</b> or <b>ksh</b>, <b>$ENV</b> is sourced after
              the profile scripts.  The value of <b>ENV</b> is subjected to parameter expansion, command  substitu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion,&nbsp;substitution,</font>
              tion,  and  arithmetic expansion before being interpreted as a pathname.  Note that <b>ENV</b> is <u>not</u>
              used unless zsh is emulating <b>sh</b> or <b>ksh</b>.

       <b>FCEDIT</b> The default editor for the <b>fc</b> builtin.  If <b>FCEDIT</b> is not set, the parameter <b>EDITOR</b> is used; if
              that is not set either, a builtin default, usually <b>vi</b>, is used.

       <b>fignore</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (<b>FIGNORE</b> &lt;S&gt;)
              An array (colon separated list) containing the suffixes of files to be ignored during filename
              completion.  However, if completion only generates files with  suffixes  in  this  list,  then
              these files are completed anyway.

       <b>fpath</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (<b>FPATH</b> &lt;S&gt;)
              An array (colon separated list) of directories specifying the search path for function defini-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tions.&nbsp;definitions.</font>
              tions.  This path is searched when a function with the <b>-u</b> attribute is referenced.  If an exe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cutable&nbsp;executable</font>
              cutable file is found, then it is read and executed in the current environment.

       <b>histchars</b> &lt;S&gt;
              Three  characters used by the shell's history and lexical analysis mechanism.  The first char-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">acter&nbsp;character</font>
              acter signals the start of a history expansion (default `<b>!</b>').  The  second  character  signals
              the  start  of a quick history substitution (default `<b>^</b>').  The third character is the comment
              character (default `<b>#</b>').

              The characters must be in the ASCII character set; any attempt to set <b>histchars</b> to  characters
              with a locale-dependent meaning will be rejected with an error message.

       <b>HISTCHARS</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
              Same as <b>histchars</b>.  (Deprecated.)

       <b>HISTFILE</b>
              The file to save the history in when an interactive shell exits.  If unset, the history is not
              saved.

       <b>HISTSIZE</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The maximum  number  of  events  stored  in  the  internal  history  list.   If  you  use  the
              <b>HIST_EXPIRE_DUPS_FIRST</b>  option, setting this value larger than the <b>SAVEHIST</b> size will give you
              the difference as a cushion for saving duplicated history events.

       <b>HOME</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The default argument for the <b>cd</b> command.  This is not set automatically by the  shell  in  <b>sh</b>,
              <b>ksh</b> or <b>csh</b> emulation, but it is typically present in the environment anyway, and if it becomes
              set it has its usual special behaviour.

       <b>IFS</b> &lt;S&gt;
              Internal field separators (by default space, tab, newline and NUL), that are used to  separate
              words  which  result  from  command or parameter expansion and words read by the <b>read</b> builtin.
              Any characters from the set space, tab and newline that appear in the IFS are called <u>IFS</u> <u>white</u>
              <u>space</u>.   One  or more IFS white space characters or one non-IFS white space character together
              with any adjacent IFS white space character delimit a field.  If an IFS white space  character
              appears  twice  consecutively  in  the IFS, this character is treated as if it were not an IFS
              white space character.

       <b>KEYTIMEOUT</b>
              The time the shell waits, in hundredths of seconds, for another key to be pressed when reading
              bound multi-character sequences.

       <b>LANG</b> &lt;S&gt;
              This  variable determines the locale category for any category not specifically selected via a
              variable starting with `<b>LC_</b>'.

       <b>LC_ALL</b> &lt;S&gt;
              This variable overrides the value of the `<b>LANG</b>' variable and the value of  any  of  the  other
              variables starting with `<b>LC_</b>'.

       <b>LC_COLLATE</b> &lt;S&gt;
              This variable determines the locale category for character collation information within ranges
              in glob brackets and for sorting.

       <b>LC_CTYPE</b> &lt;S&gt;
              This variable determines the locale category for character handling functions.

       <b>LC_MESSAGES</b> &lt;S&gt;
              This variable determines the language in which messages should be written.  Note that zsh does
              not use message catalogs.

       <b>LC_NUMERIC</b> &lt;S&gt;
              This  variable  affects  the decimal point character and thousands separator character for the
              formatted input/output functions and string conversion functions.  Note that zsh ignores  this
              setting when parsing floating point mathematical expressions.

       <b>LC_TIME</b> &lt;S&gt;
              This  variable  determines  the  locale category for date and time formatting in prompt escape
              sequences.

       <b>LINES</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The number of lines for this terminal session.  Used for printing select  lists  and  for  the
              line editor.

       <b>LISTMAX</b>
              In  the line editor, the number of matches to list without asking first. If the value is nega-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tive,&nbsp;negative,</font>
              tive, the list will be shown if it spans at most as many lines as given by the absolute value.
              If set to zero, the shell asks only if the top of the listing would scroll off the screen.

       <b>LOGCHECK</b>
              The interval in seconds between checks for login/logout activity using the <b>watch</b> parameter.

       <b>MAIL</b>   If  this  parameter  is set and <b>mailpath</b> is not set, the shell looks for mail in the specified
              file.

       <b>MAILCHECK</b>
              The interval in seconds between checks for new mail.

       <b>mailpath</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (<b>MAILPATH</b> &lt;S&gt;)
              An array (colon-separated list) of filenames to check for new mail.  Each filename can be fol-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lowed&nbsp;followed</font>
              lowed  by a `<b>?</b>' and a message that will be printed.  The message will undergo parameter expan-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion,&nbsp;expansion,</font>
              sion, command substitution and arithmetic expansion with the variable <b>$_</b> defined as  the  name
              of the file that has changed.  The default message is `<b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>new</b> <b>mail</b>'.  If an element is a
              directory instead of a file the shell will recursively check every file in every  subdirectory
              of the element.

       <b>manpath</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (<b>MANPATH</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;)
              An  array  (colon-separated list) whose value is not used by the shell.  The <b>manpath</b> array can
              be useful, however, since setting it also sets <b>MANPATH</b>, and vice versa.

       <b>module_path</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (<b>MODULE_PATH</b> &lt;S&gt;)
              An array (colon-separated list) of directories that <b>zmodload</b> searches for dynamically loadable
              modules.   This  is  initialized to a standard pathname, usually `<b>/usr/local/lib/zsh/$ZSH_VER</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">SION'.&nbsp;`/usr/local/lib/zsh/$ZSH_VERSION'.</font>
              <b>SION</b>'.  (The `<b>/usr/local/lib</b>' part varies from installation to  installation.)   For  security
              reasons, any value set in the environment when the shell is started will be ignored.

              These parameters only exist if the installation supports dynamic module loading.

       <b>NULLCMD</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The  command  name  to assume if a redirection is specified with no command.  Defaults to <b>cat</b>.
              For <b>sh</b>/<b>ksh</b> behavior, change this to <b>:</b>.  For <b>csh</b>-like behavior, unset this parameter; the shell
              will print an error message if null commands are entered.

       <b>path</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (<b>PATH</b> &lt;S&gt;)
              An array (colon-separated list) of directories to search for commands.  When this parameter is
              set, each directory is scanned and all files found are put in a hash table.

       <b>POSTEDIT</b> &lt;S&gt;
              This string is output whenever the line editor exits.  It usually contains termcap strings  to
              reset the terminal.

       <b>PROMPT</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
       <b>PROMPT2</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
       <b>PROMPT3</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
       <b>PROMPT4</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
              Same as <b>PS1</b>, <b>PS2</b>, <b>PS3</b> and <b>PS4</b>, respectively.

       <b>prompt</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
              Same as <b>PS1</b>.

       <b>PS1</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The  primary  prompt  string,  printed  before a command is read.  the default is `<b>%m%#</b> '.  It
              undergoes a special form of expansion before being displayed; see the section  `Prompt  Expan-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion'.&nbsp;Expansion'.</font>
              sion'.

       <b>PS2</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The secondary prompt, printed when the shell needs more information to complete a command.  It
              is expanded in the same way as <b>PS1</b>.  The default is `<b>%_&gt;</b> ',  which  displays  any  shell  con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">structs&nbsp;constructs</font>
              structs or quotation marks which are currently being processed.

       <b>PS3</b> &lt;S&gt;
              Selection  prompt  used  within  a  <b>select</b>  loop.  It is expanded in the same way as <b>PS1</b>.  The
              default is `<b>?#</b> '.

       <b>PS4</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The execution trace prompt.  Default is `<b>+%N:%i&gt;</b> ', which displays the  name  of  the  current
              shell structure and the line number within it.  In sh or ksh emulation, the default is `<b>+</b> '.

       <b>psvar</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (<b>PSVAR</b> &lt;S&gt;)
              An  array  (colon-separated list) whose first nine values can be used in <b>PROMPT</b> strings.  Set-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ting&nbsp;Setting</font>
              ting <b>psvar</b> also sets <b>PSVAR</b>, and vice versa.

       <b>READNULLCMD</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The command name to assume if a  single  input  redirection  is  specified  with  no  command.
              Defaults to <b>more</b>.

       <b>REPORTTIME</b>
              If  nonnegative, commands whose combined user and system execution times (measured in seconds)
              are greater than this value have timing statistics printed for them.

       <b>REPLY</b>  This parameter is reserved by convention to pass string values between shell scripts and shell
              builtins  in  situations  where  a function call or redirection are impossible or undesirable.
              The <b>read</b> builtin and the <b>select</b> complex command may set <b>REPLY</b>, and  filename  generation  both
              sets  and  examines  its  value when evaluating certain expressions.  Some modules also employ
              <b>REPLY</b> for similar purposes.

       <b>reply</b>  As <b>REPLY</b>, but for array values rather than strings.

       <b>RPROMPT</b> &lt;S&gt;
       <b>RPS1</b> &lt;S&gt;
              This prompt is displayed on the right-hand side of the screen when the primary prompt is being
              displayed on the left.  This does not work if the <b>SINGLELINEZLE</b> option is set.  It is expanded
              in the same way as <b>PS1</b>.

       <b>RPROMPT2</b> &lt;S&gt;
       <b>RPS2</b> &lt;S&gt;
              This prompt is displayed on the right-hand side of the screen when  the  secondary  prompt  is
              being  displayed  on  the left.  This does not work if the <b>SINGLELINEZLE</b> option is set.  It is
              expanded in the same way as <b>PS2</b>.

       <b>SAVEHIST</b>
              The maximum number of history events to save in the history file.

       <b>SPROMPT</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The prompt used for spelling correction.  The sequence `<b>%R</b>' expands to the string  which  pre-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sumably&nbsp;presumably</font>
              sumably  needs  spelling  correction,  and `<b>%r</b>' expands to the proposed correction.  All other
              prompt escapes are also allowed.

       <b>STTY</b>   If this parameter is set in a command's environment, the shell runs the <b>stty</b> command with  the
              value of this parameter as arguments in order to set up the terminal before executing the com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand.&nbsp;command.</font>
              mand. The modes apply only to the command, and are reset when it finishes or is suspended.  If
              the  command  is  suspended  and  continued later with the <b>fg</b> or <b>wait</b> builtins it will see the
              modes specified by <b>STTY</b>, as if it were not suspended.  This (intentionally) does not apply  if
              the command is continued via `<b>kill</b> <b>-CONT</b>'.  <b>STTY</b> is ignored if the command is run in the back-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ground,&nbsp;background,</font>
              ground, or if it is in the environment of the shell but not  explicitly  assigned  to  in  the
              input  line.  This avoids running stty at every external command by accidentally exporting it.
              Also note that <b>STTY</b> should not be used for window size specifications; these will not be local
              to the command.

       <b>TERM</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The  type  of terminal in use.  This is used when looking up termcap sequences.  An assignment
              to <b>TERM</b> causes zsh to re-initialize the terminal, even if the value  does  not  change  (e.g.,
              `<b>TERM=$TERM</b>').   It  is  necessary  to make such an assignment upon any change to the terminal
              definition database or terminal type in order for the new settings to take effect.

       <b>TIMEFMT</b>
              The format of process time reports with the <b>time</b> keyword.  The default is `<b>%E</b>  <b>real</b>   <b>%U</b>  <b>user</b>
              <b>%S</b>  <b>system</b>  <b>%P</b> <b>%J</b>'.  Recognizes the following escape sequences, although not all may be avail-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able&nbsp;available</font>
              able on all systems, and some that are available may not be useful:

              <b>%%</b>     A `<b>%</b>'.
              <b>%U</b>     CPU seconds spent in user mode.
              <b>%S</b>     CPU seconds spent in kernel mode.
              <b>%E</b>     Elapsed time in seconds.
              <b>%P</b>     The CPU percentage, computed as (100*<b>%U</b>+<b>%S</b>)/<b>%E</b>.
              <b>%W</b>     Number of times the process was swapped.
              <b>%X</b>     The average amount in (shared) text space used in Kbytes.
              <b>%D</b>     The average amount in (unshared) data/stack space used in Kbytes.
              <b>%K</b>     The total space used (%X+%D) in Kbytes.
              <b>%M</b>     The  maximum memory the process had in use at any time in Kbytes.
              <b>%F</b>     The number of major page faults (page needed to be brought from disk).
              <b>%R</b>     The number of minor page faults.
              <b>%I</b>     The number of input operations.
              <b>%O</b>     The number of output operations.
              <b>%r</b>     The number of socket messages received.
              <b>%s</b>     The number of socket messages sent.
              <b>%k</b>     The number of signals received.
              <b>%w</b>     Number of voluntary context switches (waits).
              <b>%c</b>     Number of involuntary context switches.
              <b>%J</b>     The name of this job.

              A star may be inserted between the percent sign and flags printing time.  This cause the  time
              to  be  printed  in  `<u>hh</u><b>:</b><u>mm</u><b>:</b><u>ss</u><b>.</b><u>ttt</u>' format (hours and minutes are only printed if they are not
              zero).

       <b>TMOUT</b>  If this parameter is nonzero, the shell will receive an  <b>ALRM</b>  signal  if  a  command  is  not
              entered  within  the specified number of seconds after issuing a prompt. If there is a trap on
              <b>SIGALRM</b>, it will be executed and a new alarm is scheduled using the value of the <b>TMOUT</b> parame-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ter&nbsp;parameter</font>
              ter  after  executing  the  trap.  If no trap is set, and the idle time of the terminal is not
              less than the value of the <b>TMOUT</b> parameter, zsh terminates.  Otherwise a new alarm  is  sched-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">uled&nbsp;scheduled</font>
              uled to <b>TMOUT</b> seconds after the last keypress.

       <b>TMPPREFIX</b>
              A  pathname  prefix  which  the shell will use for all temporary files.  Note that this should
              include an initial part for the file name as well as any  directory  names.   The  default  is
              `<b>/tmp/zsh</b>'.

       <b>watch</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (<b>WATCH</b> &lt;S&gt;)
              An  array  (colon-separated list) of login/logout events to report.  If it contains the single
              word `<b>all</b>', then all login/logout events  are  reported.   If  it  contains  the  single  word
              `<b>notme</b>',  then  all events are reported as with `<b>all</b>' except <b>$USERNAME</b>.  An entry in this list
              may consist of a username, an `<b>@</b>' followed by a remote hostname, and a `<b>%</b>' followed by a  line
              (tty).   Any  or  all  of these components may be present in an entry; if a login/logout event
              matches all of them, it is reported.

       <b>WATCHFMT</b>
              The format of login/logout reports if the <b>watch</b> parameter is set.  Default is `<b>%n</b>  <b>has</b>  <b>%a</b>  <b>%l</b>
              <b>from</b> <b>%m</b>'.  Recognizes the following escape sequences:

              <b>%n</b>     The name of the user that logged in/out.

              <b>%a</b>     The observed action, i.e. "logged on" or "logged off".

              <b>%l</b>     The line (tty) the user is logged in on.

              <b>%M</b>     The full hostname of the remote host.

              <b>%m</b>     The  hostname  up  to  the  first `<b>.</b>'.  If only the IP address is available or the utmp
                     field contains the name of an X-windows display, the whole name is printed.

                     <u>NOTE:</u> The `<b>%m</b>' and `<b>%M</b>' escapes will work only if there is a host  name  field  in  the
                     utmp on your machine.  Otherwise they are treated as ordinary strings.

              <b>%S</b> (<b>%s</b>)
                     Start (stop) standout mode.

              <b>%U</b> (<b>%u</b>)
                     Start (stop) underline mode.

              <b>%B</b> (<b>%b</b>)
                     Start (stop) boldface mode.

              <b>%t</b>
              <b>%@</b>     The time, in 12-hour, am/pm format.

              <b>%T</b>     The time, in 24-hour format.

              <b>%w</b>     The date in `<u>day</u><b>-</b><u>dd</u>' format.

              <b>%W</b>     The date in `<u>mm</u><b>/</b><u>dd</u><b>/</b><u>yy</u>' format.

              <b>%D</b>     The date in `<u>yy</u><b>-</b><u>mm</u><b>-</b><u>dd</u>' format.

              <b>%(</b><u>x</u><b>:</b><u>true-text</u><b>:</b><u>false-text</u><b>)</b>
                     Specifies  a  ternary expression.  The character following the <u>x</u> is arbitrary; the same
                     character is used to separate the text for the "true" result from that for the  "false"
                     result.   Both the separator and the right parenthesis may be escaped with a backslash.
                     Ternary expressions may be nested.

                     The test character <u>x</u> may be any one of `<b>l</b>', `<b>n</b>', `<b>m</b>' or `<b>M</b>', which  indicate  a  `true'
                     result  if  the corresponding escape sequence would return a non-empty value; or it may
                     be `<b>a</b>', which indicates a `true' result if the watched user has logged in,  or  `false'
                     if  he has logged out.  Other characters evaluate to neither true nor false; the entire
                     expression is omitted in this case.

                     If the result is `true', then the <u>true-text</u> is formatted according to the  rules  above
                     and  printed,  and the <u>false-text</u> is skipped.  If `false', the <u>true-text</u> is skipped and
                     the <u>false-text</u> is formatted and printed.  Either or both of the branches may be  empty,
                     but both separators must be present in any case.

       <b>WORDCHARS</b> &lt;S&gt;
              A list of non-alphanumeric characters considered part of a word by the line editor.

       <b>ZBEEP</b>  If  set,  this  gives  a string of characters, which can use all the same codes as the <b>bindkey</b>
              command as described in the zsh/zle module entry in <a href="zshmodules.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/zshmodules"><u>zshmodules</u>(1)</a>, that will be output to  the
              terminal  instead of beeping.  This may have a visible instead of an audible effect; for exam-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ple,&nbsp;example,</font>
              ple, the string `<b>\e[?5h\e[?5l</b>' on a vt100 or xterm will have the effect  of  flashing  reverse
              video  on  and off (if you usually use reverse video, you should use the string `<b>\e[?5l\e[?5h</b>'
              instead).  This takes precedence over the <b>NOBEEP</b> option.

       <b>ZDOTDIR</b>
              The directory to search for shell startup files (.zshrc, etc), if not <b>$HOME</b>.
