/*	A Quick Course in ComponentDispatchHelper.c

		ComponentRangeCount
		The number (0 based) of discrete, continuous ranges of selectors that are used in the macro.  The
		'range shift' & 'range mask' determine the size of the range.

		ComponentRangeShift
		ComponentRangeMask
		The mask == 2^shift -1.  This is used to define size of the range of selectors.

		For ImageCodecs as an example, the ranges are in size of 0x100:
		
		   Range 0 = -0xFF to -0x01 	Standard Component Calls
		   Range 1 = 0x000 to 0x0FF		Generic codecs 
		   Range 2 = 0x100 to 0x1FF		Specific to QT Photo JPEG codecs
		   Range 3 = 0x200 to 0x2FF		Base Decompressor Client codecs
		   Range 4 = 0x300 to 0x3FF		Effect codecs
			
		ComponentRangeBegin & ComponentRangeEnd
		Use these macros to bracket the start/stop of each range of selectors.  First range use (0), for the Nth
		range use (N-1).

		ComponentRangeUnused
		Used to skip a range of selectors.

		ComponentSelectorOffset
		Since the 'default' selectors are negative numbers, an offset must be specified.  For example, if the first
		default selector supported was kComponentUnregisterSelect (-7), then the offset would have to be 7.

		StdComponentCall
		Used to dispatch to one of the standard compoenent routines, such as Open(), Close(), Register(), etc. that
		are implemented in the component.

		ComponentError
		Returns an error without trying to do anything.  Use this for the selectors that will NEVER be implmented
		or delegated.  Additionally, it can be used to fill in a 'blank' in a range of selectors to get the range
		continuous. For example, if there were selectors that corresponded to 10,11,12, 14, but NO 13, merely put
		ComponentError (0) between the selectors for 12 & 14.
		
		ComponentNoError
		Returns 'noErr' without trying to do anything.

		ComponentDelegate
		Delagates the call to the specified delagate component.

		ComponentCall
		This dispatches to the appropriate routine in that is implemented in the component.

		ComponentComment
		Allows comments to be placed in the big macro.
