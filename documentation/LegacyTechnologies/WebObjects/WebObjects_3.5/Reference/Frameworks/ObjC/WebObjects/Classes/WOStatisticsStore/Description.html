<P>
The WOStatisticsStore object records statistics about a WebObjects application while that application runs. All WebObjects applications have a WOStatisticsStore object, which you can access by sending <B>statisticsStore</B> to the <A HREF="../WOApplication/WOApplication.html" target=_top>WOApplication</A> object. If the application is linked to the WOExtensions framework (which occurs by default if you use Project Builder to create the application), it contains a component named WOStats, which displays the statistics recorded by WOStatisticsStore. 
To access an application's WOStats page, use a URL such as this one:
<P>
<PRE>http://localhost/cgi-bin/WebObjects/HelloWorld.woa/-/WOStats
</PRE>
<P>
or:
<PRE>http://localhost/cgi-bin/WebObjects/HelloWorld.woa/-/WOStats.wo/-/-/1/myHost
</PRE>
<P>
where the number 1 in the URL above is the application's instance number.
<P>
For more information on what the <A HREF="../../../../../DynamicElements/WOStats.html" target=_top>WOStats</A> page displays, see its description in the online book <I>WebObjects Extensions Reference</I>. 
<P>

<H3>Recording Information</H3>
<P>
The WOStatisticsStore object records the bulk of its statistics at the end of each cycle of the request-response loop. Specifically, at the end of <A HREF="../WOSession/WOSession.html" target=_top>WOSession's</A> <B>appendtoResponse:inContext:</B> method, the WOSession sends the <B>recordStatisticsForResponse:inContext:</B> message to the WOStatisticsStore. This message tells the WOStatisticsStore to begin recording statistics. Then, WOSession sends it a <B>descriptionForResponse:inContext:</B> message. This method sends the response component a <B>descriptionForResponse:inContext:</B> message. The default implementation of <B>descriptionForResponse:inContext:</B> in WOComponent returns the component's name. 
<P>
You can override <B>descriptionForResponse:inContext:</B> in each of your components if you want to record more information. For example, you might want to record the values of all of the component's variables or perhaps just one or two key variables. 
<P>
If you want to record extra information about the session, you can override WOStatisticsStore's <B>recordStatisticsForResponse:inContext:</B> method. 

<H3>Maintaining a Log File</H3>
<P>
You can maintain an application log file by sending the message <B>setLogFile:rotationFrequencyInDays:</B> to the WOStatisticsStore object. When a log file has been specified, each session records information in the log file about the pages it accessed. The log is maintained in Common Log File Format (CLFF) so that it can be analyzed by any standard CLFF-analysis tool. (For more information about the statistics recorded in the log file, see the  <B>formatDescription:forResponse:inContext:</B> method description.) If a log file has been specified, the WOSession object keeps its own statistics about which pages it has accessed. When the session terminates, it writes this information to the log file.


<H3><A NAME="StatisticsDictionary">The Statistics Dictionary</A></H3>
If you want to retrieve statistics programmatically, you can do so by sending the WOStatisticsStore a <B>statistics</B> message. This returns a dictionary object, which has the following keys:
<DL>
<P><DT>StartedAt</DT>
<DD>
The date and time at which this application instance was launched.
</DD>


<P><DT>LogFile</DT>
<DD>
The name of the CLFF-formatted log file recording session statistics. This log file does not exist unless you create it by sending <B>setLogFile:rotationFrequencyInDays:</B> to the WOStatisticsStore.
</DD>



<P><DT>Transactions</DT>
<DD>
A dictionary of statistics about the request-response loop transactions. The keys into this dictionary are:

  <DL>
  <DT>Transactions</DT>
  <DD>
  Total number of transactions processed by this application   
  instance.
  </DD>

  <DT>Avg. Idle Time</DT>
  <DD>
  Average length of time the application sat idle between 
  transactions.
  </DD>

  <DT>Moving Avg. Idle Time</DT>
  <DD>
  Average length of time the application sat idle between the 
  last <i>n</I> transactions, where <I>n</I> is the number 
  returned by <B>movingAverageSampleSize</B>. 
  </DD>

  <DT>Avg. Transaction Time</DT>
  <DD>
  Average length of time it took to process a transaction. 
  </DD>

  <DT>Moving Avg. Transaction Time</DT>

  transactions, where <I>n</I> is the number returned by 
  <B>movingAverageSampleSize</B>. 
  </DD>

  <DT>Sample Size For Moving Avg.</DT>
  <DD>
  The moving average sample size.
  </DD>
  </DL>
</DD>



<P><DT>Sessions</DT>
<DD>
A dictionary of statistics about sessions of the application. The keys into this dictionary are:
  <DL>
  <DT>Total Sessions Created</DT>
  <DD>
  The total number of sessions created by this application 
  instance.
  </DD>

  <DT>Current Active Sessions</DT>
  <DD>
  Number of the created sessions that are still active.
  </DD>

  <DT>Peak Active Sessions</DT>
  <DD>
  The maximum number of sessions that have been active at the 
  same time.
  </DD>

  <DT>Peak Active Sessions Date</DT>
  <DD>
  Date and time at which the peak number of active sessions 
  occurred.
  </DD>

  <DT>Avg. Transactions Per Session</DT>
  <DD>
  The average number of transactions each user performed in a   
  session.
  </DD>

  <DT>Avg. Session Life</DT>
  <DD>
  Average length of time a user session lasted.
  </DD>


  <DT>Avg. Memory Per Session</DT>
  <DD>A dictionary containing average session memory usage 
  statistics. The keys into this dictionary are the same as to 
  the application's Memory dictionary.
  </DD>


  <DT>Last Session's Statistics</DT>
  <DD>
  If a session has expired, a list of the pages that the last 
  session accessed, listed from first to last accessed. By 
  default, only the page names are recorded, but you may 
  override  <A HREF="../WOComponent/WOComponent.html" 
  target=_top>WOComponent's</A>  
  <B>descriptionForResponse:inContext:</B> method to provide 
  more information. 
  </DD>

  </DL>

</DD>



<P><DT>Memory</DT>
<DD>
A dictionary of memory usage statistics. The keys into this dictionary are:

  <DL>
  <DT>Committed</DT>
  <DD>
  Amount of memory committed to this application (Windows NT  
  platform only).
  </DD>

  <DT>Reserved</DT>
  <DD>
  Amount of memory reserved by the application (Windows NT  
  platform only).
  </DD>

  Solaris platforms).
  </DD>

  <DT>Virtual</DT>
  <DD>
  Amount of virtual memory the application uses (Mach platform  
  only).
  </DD>
  </DL>
</DD>



<P><DT>Pages</DT>
<DD>
A dictionary of dictionaries containing access statistics for each page in the application. The keys into this dictionary are the pages that have been accessed so far. (Pages that haven't been accessed yet aren't in the dictionary, and components that represent only a portion of the page rather than the full page aren't in the dictionary.)
<P>The keys into each 
page's dictionary are:

  <DL>
  <DT>Served</DT>
  <DD>
  The number of times a given page has been accessed. 
  </DD>

  <DT>Avg Resp. Time</DT>
  <DD>
  Average amount of time it took to receive the request for   
  this page, process the request, invoke the appropriate action 
  in the request component, and generate this page. Often, the 
  bulk of the time it takes to generate a page happens in the 
  action invocation and response generations phases of the 
  request-response loop. The initial processing of the request 
  takes a minimal amount of time.
  <P>
  For example, suppose the user clicks a button in Page A that 
  fetches items from a database and displays those items in   
  Page B. The total amount of time it takes to handle the 
  request on Page A, invoke the action, fetch items from the 
  database, and generate Page B is recorded as the amount of 
  time it took to generate Page B. 
  </DD>

  <DT>Min Resp. Time</DT>
  <DD>
  The smallest amount of time it took to generate this page.
  </DD>

  <DT>Max Resp. Time</DT>
  <DD>
  The largest amount of time it took to generate this page.
  </DD>
  </DL> 
</DD>

<P>
If log file recording is enabled, this method formats the string <I>responseDescription</I> in using Common Log File Format (CLFF). The resulting string contains:
<UL>
<LI>The host from which the HTTP request was received
<LI>The name of the user that performed the request
<LI>The current date
<LI>The request's HTTP method (GET or PUT)
<LI>The WebObjects application name
<LI>The result of the <B>descriptionForResponse:inContext:</B> method (by default, this method returns the response component's name)
<LI>The request's HTTP version 
<LI>The HTTP status of the response
<LI>The size of the response
</UL>
<P>

You enable log file recording by setting a log file using the <B>setLogFile:rotationFrequencyInDays:</B> method. 
<P>
This method is used by WOSession to record information about the current transaction when log file recording is enabled.

<P>
The number of days a log file lasts. That is, a log file's contents are flushed after a certain time interval to ensure that it does not grow too large and a new log file is started. This method returns that time interval. 
<P>
Before a new log file is started, the contents of the current log file are saved to a backup file. You can then inspect this log file and/or remove it when its data has grown stale.
