HTMLSampleÊHTMLSample is an application illustrating how to use the new HTMLRenderingLib services found in Mac OS 9. HTMLRenderingLib is Apple's light-weight HTML rendering engine capable of displaying HTML files.HTMLRendering related tasks illustrated include:¥ how to draw HTML in a window using the HTMLRenderingLib,¥ how to use the URL utilities provided by the HTMLRenderingLib,¥ how to maintain a history of visited links and provide call backs to the HTMLRenderingLib for providing information about visited links,¥ how to intercept URLs being displayed by the HTMLRenderingLib and re-direct them to other files.  In this example, we use this facility to allow you to launch applications by clicking on URLs that refer to application files.¥ Setting up the drawing environment correctly for drawing other objects in the same window when the window contains a HTML rendering object.Other interesting techniques illustrated include:¥ This is a Mac OS 9 package savy application.  Techniques for opening HTML package documents are illustrated.  These techniques include opening package documents when they are provided in open document Apple events and allowing the user to choose package documents in the Navigation Services window.¥ Graying out a part of the window when it is inactive.¥ Setting the standard window zoom state so clicking in its zoom box results in the window being zoomed to the best rectangle for viewing the HTML image being displayed.By John Montbriand.Copyright © 1999 by Apple Computer, Inc.All rights reserved worldwide.	Disclaimer:You may incorporate this sample code into your applications without restriction, though the sample code has been provided "AS IS" and the responsibility for its operation is 100% yours.
