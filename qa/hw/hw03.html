With the card installed in aQuadra 840AV, the Macintosh gets stuck in a DMA-out and needs to be rebootedafter several DMAs. We used a logic analyzer to try to determine what is goingwrong, but we could not find out what is causing this problem, as the bus isidle at the time the problem occurs.</p><p id=p4>Since the same card works properly, and has for approximately three years, inother Macintosh models (e.g., Quadra 900, Macintosh II, PowerMac 8100, Macintosh IIfx), isthere anything different about the NuBus in the Quadra 840AV?</p><p id=p4>A:  Your problem may be caused by a NuBus timing error that was uncovered by theMUNI chip. The MUNI chip was designed to perform much faster than the olderNuBus controllers, and therefore is not as tolerant of timing errors.</p><p id=p4>While the Quadra 800, and Centris 650 have the KIWI NuBUS ASIC in them, the840AV has the MUNI NuBUS ASIC. Both of these ASICs have much tighter timingmargins to support NuBUS 90 and higher-speed burst transfers. The clock dutycycle of these ASICs is tighter (it is now very close to the 75/25specification), and some developers have reported problems as a result.</p><p id=p4>Be sure to sample the correct edge of the NuBUS clock, per the NuBUS '90specification. Even if your product works properly on the KIWI chip, there maybe subtle timing and/or electrical changes in the MUNI chip that are causingyour problem.</p><p id=p4>A similar problem was reported on the Macintosh Quadra 900/950 with the YANCchip and very fast transfers. The timing is such that the YANC (Yet AnotherNuBus Controller) chip, which came before KIWI and MUNI, gets lost on theQuadra. One developer was trying to transfer four longs by holding REQ*asserted and was not using attention cycles. Because YANC lost the lastarbitration, it looked for start, but it was one clock cycle too late (afterthe start cycle). As a result, it got lost, and the system hung. Although thisproblem doesn't exhibit exactly the same symptoms as the problem you areexperiencing, there are enough similarities to indicate that both problems areprobably caused by the timing differences.</p><p id=p4>The solution provided to that developer was to use attention-lock, transfer thefour long words, and then do an attention-null to re-sync the YANC. This doesadd some overhead, but it is better than putting a dead cycle after every ACK*,which would make transfers three cycles long instead of two. This approachmight solve your problem, as well.</p><p id=p4>Here's another possible cause: The Muni chip generates a NuBus timeout error ifthe entire NuBus transaction takes more than 256 cycles (25.6 &micro;sec) after Startoccurs. For Block Transfers, the entire block must complete within 25.6 &micro;sec.Muni generates a timeout error after 25.6 &micro;sec, whether it initiated the NuBustransaction or not (e.g., if the transaction is between two NuBus cards).</p></td></tr></table></center><!-- end_content --><!-- begin_date --><H4 ALIGN=center>[May 01 1995]</H4><!-- end_date --><!-- begin_footer_information -->	<table width="680" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
