 <B>atomic operations</B>  Operations that pass extra information back to their callers by signaling exceptions but that hide internal exceptions, which might be irrelevant or misleading.<P>
 <B>bias</B>  A number added to the binary exponent of a floating-point number so that the exponent field will always be positive. The bias is subtracted when the floating-point value is evaluated.<P>
 <B>binade</B>  The collection of numbers that lie between two successive powers of 2.<P>
 <B>binary floating-point number</B>  A collection of bits representing a sign, an exponent, and a significand. Its numerical value, if any, is the signed product of the significand and 2 raised to the power of the exponent.<P>
 <B>complex expression</B>  An expression made up of more than one simple expression, that is, an expression with more than one floating-point operation.<P>
 <B>Condition Register</B>  A 32-bit PowerPC register used to summarize the states of the fixed-point and floating-point processors and to store results of comparison operations.<P>

For example, the value 3.2 requires two decimal digits of precision, and the value 3.002 requires four decimal digits. In numeric data formats, the precision is equal to the number of bits (both implicit and explicit) in the significand.<P>
 <B>quiet NaN</B>  A NaN that propagates through arithmetic operations without signaling an exception. <P>

 <B>significand</B>  The part of a binary floating-point number that indicates where the number falls between two successive powers of 2. The wider the significand field in a numeric format, the more precision the format has.<P>
 <B>simple expression</B>  An expression containing one floating-point operation.<P>
 <B>single</B> <B>format</B>  A 32-bit application data format for storing floating-point values that have a precision of up to seven or eight decimal digits. It is used by engineering applications, among others.<P>
 <B>Standard Apple Numerics Environment (SANE)</B>  The floating-point environment on 680x0-based Macintosh computers. This environment provides floating-point data formats and operations as well as some advanced numerical functions such as logarithmic and trigonometric functions.<P>
 <B>sticky</B>  Used to describe a condition in which a bit stays set until it is explicitly cleared. Floating-point exception flags in the FPSCR are sticky, so if one instruction sets an exception flag and another instruction is performed before the flag is tested, it is impossible to tell which instruction caused the exception.<P>
 <B>subnormal number</B>  A denormalized number.<P>
 <B>symmetric</B>  Used to describe a function whose graph looks the same on both sides of the y-axis; that is, <I>func</I>(<I>x</I>) = <I>func</I>(-<I>x</I>) for all <I>x</I>.<P>
 <B>tiny</B>  Used to describe a number whose magnitude is smaller than the smallest positive normalized number in the format of the number.<P>

 <B>trigonometric functions</B>  Functions that perform trigonometric operations, such as cosine, sine, and tangent.<P>
 <B>truncate</B>  To chop off the fractional part of a real number so that only the integer part remains. For example, if the real number 1.99999999999 is truncated, the truncated value is 1.<P>
 <B>underflow</B> <B>exception</B>  An exception that occurs when the result of an operation is both tiny and inexact.<P>
 <B>usual arithmetic conversions</B>  Automatic conversions performed in the C programming language. The ANSI C specification defines these conversions.<P>
 <B>widest-need evaluation</B>  An evaluation method in which the widest format of all of the operands in a complex expression is used as the format in which the expression is evaluated.<P>
