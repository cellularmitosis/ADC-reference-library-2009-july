However, an enterpriseobject class has certain characteristics that distinguish it fromother classes:</p><ul><li>It has propertiesthat map to stored or persistent data; an enterprise object instance typicallycorresponds to a single row or record in a database table. </font></li><li>It knows how to interact with other parts of WebObjects togive and receive values for its properties. This is done througha mechanism known as <b>key-value coding</b>, which enablesthe setting and getting of these properties.</font></li></ul><p>In addition to providing classes that manage a set of enterprise-objectinstances in memory, WebObjects defines an API to which enterpriseobjects must conform, as well as default implementations for thisAPI. As a result, you only need to concentrate on the parts of yourenterprise-object classes specific to your application.</p><p>To maximize the reusability and extensibility of your objects,they shouldn't embed knowledge of the user interface or databasealongside the business logic. For example, if you embed knowledgeof your user interface, you can't reuse the objects because each application'suser interface is different. Similarly, if you embed knowledge ofyour database, you'll have to update your objects every time youmodify the database's schema.</p><p>If not in the business objects, then where does this knowledgego? It's handled by WebObjects as shown in  <a href="#BABDDGHB">Figure 3-1</a>.</p><br><a name = "BABDDGHB"></a><p><b><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">Figure3-1 Connecting enterprise objects to dataand the user interface</font></b></p> <img src = "../Art/eofapproach.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/eofapproach.gif]"><p>WebObjects provides a database-to-objects mapping, calleda <b>model</b>, so your objects are independent of thedatabase. WebObjects also provides an objects-to-interface mappingso they are independent of the user interface. This approach allowsyou to create libraries of enterprise objects that can be used inas many applications as you need, with any user interface, and withany database server. Therefore, you can concentrate on coding thelogic of your business while WebObjects takes care of the rest.</p><p>For example, you could create an enterprise object calledCustomer that defines such business rules as <em>customersmust have a work or home phone number</em>, or <em> customerscannot spend more than their credit limit</em>. Without rewritingyour business logic, you could use these objects in a public, Web-basedapplication and an internal customer service application. You couldalso switch the database that serves the customer data.</p><br>    <br><a href="Enterprise_Objects.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/previous.gif" border="0"></a><a href="Enterprise__er_Paradigm.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/next.gif" border="0"></a>&nbsp;<br><br><p><hr><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">&#169; 2002 Apple Computer, Inc.
