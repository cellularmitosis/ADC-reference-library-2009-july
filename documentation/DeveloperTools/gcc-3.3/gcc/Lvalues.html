<h3 class="section">5.7 Generalized Lvalues</h3>

<p><a name="index-compound-expressions-as-lvalues-874"></a><a name="index-expressions_002c-compound_002c-as-lvalues-875"></a><a name="index-conditional-expressions-as-lvalues-876"></a><a name="index-expressions_002c-conditional_002c-as-lvalues-877"></a><a name="index-casts-as-lvalues-878"></a><a name="index-generalized-lvalues-879"></a><a name="index-lvalues_002c-generalized-880"></a><a name="index-extensions_002c-_0040code_007b_003f_003a_007d-881"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007b_003f_003a_007d-extensions-882"></a>Compound expressions, conditional expressions and casts are allowed as
lvalues provided their operands are lvalues.  This means that you can take
their addresses or store values into them.

   <p>Standard C++ allows compound expressions and conditional expressions as
lvalues, and permits casts to reference type, so use of this extension
is deprecated for C++ code.

   <p>For example, a compound expression can be assigned, provided the last
expression in the sequence is an lvalue.  These two expressions are
equivalent:

<pre class="example">     (a, b) += 5
     a, (b += 5)
</pre>
   <p>Similarly, the address of the compound expression can be taken.  These two
expressions are equivalent:

<pre class="example">     &amp;(a, b)
     a, &amp;b
</pre>
   <p>A conditional expression is a valid lvalue if its type is not void and the
true and false branches are both valid lvalues.  For example, these two
expressions are equivalent:

<pre class="example">     (a ? b : c) = 5
     (a ? b = 5 : (c = 5))
</pre>
   <p>A cast is a valid lvalue if its operand is an lvalue.  A simple
assignment whose left-hand side is a cast works by converting the
right-hand side first to the specified type, then to the type of the
inner left-hand side expression.  After this is stored, the value is
converted back to the specified type to become the value of the
assignment.  Thus, if <code>a</code> has type <code>char *</code>, the following two
expressions are equivalent:

<pre class="example">     (int)a = 5
     (int)(a = (char *)(int)5)
</pre>
   <p>An assignment-with-arithmetic operation such as <span class="samp">+=</span> applied to a cast
performs the arithmetic using the type resulting from the cast, and then
continues as in the previous case.  Therefore, these two expressions are
equivalent:

<pre class="example">     (int)a += 5
     (int)(a = (char *)(int) ((int)a + 5))
</pre>
   <p>You cannot take the address of an lvalue cast, because the use of its
address would not work out coherently.  Suppose that <code>&amp;(int)f</code> were
permitted, where <code>f</code> has type <code>float</code>.  Then the following
statement would try to store an integer bit-pattern where a floating
point number belongs:

<pre class="example">     *&amp;(int)f = 1;
</pre>
   <p>This is quite different from what <code>(int)f = 1</code> would do&mdash;that
would convert 1 to floating point and store it.  Rather than cause this
inconsistency, we think it is better to prohibit use of <span class="samp">&amp;</span> on a cast.

   <p>If you really do want an <code>int *</code> pointer with the address of
<code>f</code>, you can simply write <code>(int *)&amp;f</code>.
