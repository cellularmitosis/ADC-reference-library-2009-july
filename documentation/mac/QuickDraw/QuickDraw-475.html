 <B>draft-quality printing</B>  The method by which printer drivers convert into drawing operations calls only to QuickDraw's text-drawing routines. The printer driver sends these routines directly to the printer instead of using <B>deferred printing</B> to capture the entire image for a page in a spool file. Draft-quality printing, which is supported on the ImageWriter printer driver, produces quick, low-quality drafts of text documents that are printed straight down the page, from top to bottom and left to right. Compare <B>enhanced draft-quality printing.</B><P>
 <B>eight-color system</B>  The eight predefined colors provided by <B>basic QuickDraw</B> for display on color screens and color printers. <P>

The ImageWriter printer driver, for example, supports enhanced draft-quality printing. Compare <B>deferred printing, draft-quality printing.</B><P>
 <B>erase</B>  To draw both the outline of a shape and its interior with the background pattern for the current graphics port. The background pattern is typically solid white on a black-and-white screen or a solid background color on a color screen. Making the shape blend into the background pattern of the graphics port effectively erases the shape.<P>
 <B>extended version 2 picture format</B>  The format for all pictures created with the <CODE>OpenCPicture</CODE> function. Available on all Macintosh computers running System 7, this format allows applications to specify resolutions when creating images.<P>
 <B>fill</B>  To draw both the outline of a shape and its interior with any pattern you specify. The procedure transfers the pattern with the <CODE>patCopy</CODE> pattern mode, which directly copies your requested pattern into the shape.<P>
 <B>font substitution</B>  Substitution of a screen font for a printer font by a printer driver. PostScript printer drivers may substitute PostScript printer fonts for bitmapped screen fonts.<P>
 <B>foreground color</B>  The color of the "ink" used for bit patterns and for the graphics pen when drawing. By default, the foreground color is black. <P>
 <B>frame</B>  To draw the outline of a shape (such as a rectangle) using the size, pattern, and pattern mode of the graphics pen for the current graphics port. The interior of the shape is unaffected, allowing previously existing pixels in the image to show through.<P>

 <B>graphics device</B>  Anything into which QuickDraw can draw. There are three types of graphics devices: video devices (such as plug-in video cards and built-in video interfaces) that control screens, offscreen graphics worlds (which allow your application to build complex images off the screen before displaying them), and printing graphics ports. For a video device or an offscreen graphics world, Color QuickDraw stores state information in a <CODE>GDevice<B> record.</B></CODE><P>

 <B>idle procedure</B>  A routine that handles events and updates information while system software completes a task. For example, applications displaying a print status dialog box while a printer driver directs output to a printer typically use an idle procedure that checks for user-generated events indicating that the user wishes to cancel the printing.<P>
 <B>imaging</B>  The construction and display of graphical information. Such graphical information can consist of shapes, pictures, and text and can be displayed on output devices such as screens and printers. <B></B><P>

 <B>invert</B>  To reverse the colors of all pixels within a shape. On a black-and-white screen, this changes all the black pixels in the shape to white and all the white pixels to black. Inverting operates on color pixels in color graphics ports, but the results are predictable only with direct pixels.<P>
 <B>job dialog box</B>  A dialog box--usually displayed by an application in response to the user choosing the Print command--that solicits printing information from the user, such as the number of copies to print, the print quality, and the range of pages to print.<P>
 <B>line</B>  A graphic image defined by two points: the current location of the <B>graphics pen</B> and its destination. The graphics pen, which can draw with different patterns, hangs below and to the right of the defining points. <B></B><P>
 <B>line layout error</B>  The difference between the width of the printed line and the width of the screen line after the printer driver has performed <B>font substitution.</B> Certain printer drivers compensate for this by distributing the error to <B>major glyphs</B> and <B>minor glyphs.</B><P>

When the Window Manager creates a window, it places the origin of the local coordinate system at the upper-left corner of the window's port rectangle. Compare <B>global coordinate system. </B><P>
 <B>luminance</B>  The intensity of light in a color. Color QuickDraw uses a color's luminance to convert the color to an appropriate grayscale color. <B></B><P>
 <B>main screen</B>  In a drawing environment with multiple screens, the screen with the menu bar. QuickDraw maps the (0,0) origin point of the coordinate plane to the main screen's upper-left corner, and other screens are positioned adjacent to it. Compare <B>startup screen. </B><P>
 <B>major error</B>  The amount of line layout error that a printer driver applies to the space glyph.<P>

 <B>minor error</B>  The amount of line layout error that a printer driver applies to nonspace glyphs.<P>
 <B>minor glyph</B>  On a printed page, a nonspace glyph, to which printer drivers apply the <B>line layout error</B> that remains after applying most of the error to <B>major glyphs.</B><P>
 <B>offscreen graphics world</B>  A sophisticated environment for preparing complex color or black-and-white images before displaying them on the screen. An offscreen graphics world is defined in a private data structure referred to by a pointer of type <CODE>GWorldPtr</CODE>.<P>
 <B>opcode</B>  A value passed to a routine, such as the <CODE>DrawPicture</CODE> or <CODE>PrGeneral</CODE> procedure, that determines how the routine should operate.<P>
 <B>oval</B>  A circular or elliptical shape defined by the bounding rectangle that encloses it. The oval is completely enclosed within the infinitely thin lines of its bounding rectangle, and never includes any pixels lying outside the bounding rectangle. If the bounding rectangle is square (that is, has equal width and height), then the oval is a circle.<P>
 <B>page rectangle</B>  The rectangle marking the boundaries of the printable area on a page. The upper-left corner of the page rectangle always has the coordinates (0,0). The coordinates of the lower-right corner give the maximum page height and width attainable on the given printer; these coordinates are specified by the units used to express the resolution of the printing graphics port. For example, the lower-right corner of a page rectangle used by the PostScript LaserWriter printer driver for an 8.5-by-11-inch U.S. letter page is (730,552) at 72 dpi.<B></B><P>
 <B>paint</B>  To draw the outline of a shape and its interior with the pattern of the graphics pen, using the pattern mode of the graphics pen<B>.</B><P>
 <B>Palette Manager</B>  A set of system software routines that allows your application to specify the colors that it needs on a window-by-window basis. The Palette Manager makes the colors available (within application-determined ranges) in a graceful manner. <B></B><P>
 <B>paper rectangle</B>  The rectangle that describes the size of a piece of paper on which a page is printed. This rectangle is defined in the same coordinate system as the <B>page rectangle.</B> Thus, the upper-left coordinates of the paper rectangle are typically negative and its lower-right coordinates are greater than those of the page rectangle.<P>
 <B>pattern</B>  An image that can be repeated indefinitely to form a repeating design when drawing lines and shapes or when filling areas on the screen. See also <B>bit pattern, pixel pattern. </B><P>

 <B>pixel</B>  Short for <I>picture element,</I> the smallest dot that QuickDraw can draw; also, the visual representation of that dot on the screen. On a black-and-white screen, each single-color phosphor dot is a pixel that represents a bit in memory--white if the bit is 0, black if it's 1. On a color screen, three phosphor dots (red, green, and blue) compose each color pixel, which represents up to 48 bits in memory. On a grayscale screen, a white phosphor dot whose intensity can vary is a pixel that usually represents 1, 2, 4, or 8 bits in memory. <P>
 <B>pixel depth</B>  The number of bits per pixel in a pixel image. Pixels on indexed devices can be 1, 2, 4, or 8 bits deep. (A pixel image that is 1 bit deep is equivalent to a bit image.) Pixels on direct devices can be 16 or 32 bits deep.<P>
 <B>pixel image</B>  A collection of pixels in memory that forms a grid--a rectangular pattern of pixels. The pixel image is pointed to in the <CODE>baseAddr</CODE> field of a <CODE>PixMap</CODE> record. Compare <B>bit image. </B><P>

 <B>pixel value</B>  A number used by system software and a graphics device to represent a color. The translation from the color that an application specifies in an <CODE>RGBColor</CODE> record to a pixel value is performed at the time the application draws the color. The process differs for indexed and direct devices.<P>

 <B>QuickDraw printer driver</B>  A printer driver that renders images on the Macintosh computer and then sends the rendered images in the form of bitmaps or pixel maps to the printer, which might be a dot-matrix printer, an ink jet printer, a laser printer, or a plotter.<P>
 <B>rectangle</B>  (1) A mathematical entity defined either by its four boundaries (upper, left, lower, and right) or by two points (the upper-left and lower-right corners). Rectangles are used to define active areas on the screen, to assign coordinate systems to graphical entities, and to specify the locations and sizes for various graphical operations. (2) A rectangular shape drawn onscreen with a QuickDraw procedure such as <CODE>FrameRect</CODE> or <CODE>PaintRect</CODE>. <B></B><P>
 <B>region</B>  An arbitrary area or set of areas on the QuickDraw coordinate plane. The outline of a region should be one or more closed loops. <P>
 <B>resolution</B>  The degree of detail at which a device such as a printer or a screen can display an image. Resolution is usually specified in dots per inch, or <B>dpi,</B> in the x and y directions. The higher the value, the finer the detail of the image.<P>
 <B>resource fork</B>  The part of a file that contains the files' resources, which contain data accessed using the Resource Manager. This data usually corresponds to data--such as menu, icon, and control definitions--created by the developer, but it may also include data created by the user while the application is running. Compare <B>data fork.</B><P>
 <B>RGBColor record</B>  A data structure of type <CODE>RGBColor</CODE> used to specify a color by its red, green, and blue components, with each component defined as a 16-bit integer. Color QuickDraw compares such a 48-bit value with the colors actually available on a screen's video device at execution time and chooses the closest match. <P>
 <B>RGB color value</B>  A value that indicates the red, green, and blue components of a color. An RGB color value is specified in an <B>RGBColor record. </B><P>
 <B>rounded rectangle</B>  A rectangle with rounded corners. The figure is defined by a bounding rectangle and the width and height of the ovals forming the corners.
