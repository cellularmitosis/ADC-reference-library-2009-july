DropDraw Sample Code
Version 1.0

The QuickTime Graphics Importers that ship with Panther now draw (via GraphicsImportDraw) using ColorSync color-matching by default. On pre-Panther systems, you had to write your own custom ColorSync code to perform color-matching.

Developers wishing to opt-out of this default color-matching must call GraphicsImportSetFlags as follows:

	GraphicsImportSetFlags( gi, kGraphicsImporterDontUseColorMatching );
	
This sample demonstrates how to draw various images both color-matched and non color-matched by toggling this flag.

Sample images provided by the ColorSync team can be found in the 

"Images with Trick Profiles"

folder. These sample images make it easy to determine whether ColorSync color-matching is being performed when the image is drawn (simply look at the message drawn with each image).
