____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

<b>NAME</b>
       menu, tk_menuSetFocus - Create and manipulate menu widgets

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>menu</b> <u>pathName</u> ?<u>options</u>?
       <b>tk_menuSetFocus</b> <u>pathName</u>

<b>STANDARD</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-activebackground</b>     <b>-borderwidth</b>         <b>-foreground</b>
       <b>-activeborderwidth</b>    <b>-cursor</b>              <b>-relief</b>
       <b>-activeforeground</b>     <b>-disabledforeground</b>  <b>-takefocus</b>
       <b>-background</b>           <b>-font</b>


       See the <b>options</b> manual entry for details on the standard options.

<b>WIDGET-SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       Command-Line Name:<b>-postcommand</b>                                                                        |
       Database Name:  <b>postCommand</b>                                                                           |
       Database Class: <b>Command</b>                                                                               |

              If  this  option  is specified then it provides a Tcl command to execute each time the menu is |
              posted.  The command is invoked by the <b>post</b> widget command before posting the menu. Note  that |
              in  8.0  on  Macintosh and Windows, all commands in a menu systems are executed before any are |
              posted. This is due to the limitations in the individual platforms' menu managers.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-selectcolor</b>
       Database Name:  <b>selectColor</b>
       Database Class: <b>Background</b>

              For menu entries that are check buttons or radio buttons, this option specifies the  color  to
              display in the indicator when the check button or radio button is selected.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-tearoff</b>
       Database Name:  <b>tearOff</b>
       Database Class: <b>TearOff</b>

              This  option  must have a proper boolean value, which specifies whether or not the menu should
              include a tear-off entry at the top.  If so, it will exist as entry 0  of  the  menu  and  the
              other entries will number starting at 1.  The default menu bindings arrange for the menu to be
              torn off when the tear-off entry is invoked.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-tearoffcommand</b>
       Database Name:  <b>tearOffCommand</b>
       Database Class: <b>TearOffCommand</b>

              If this option has a non-empty value, then it specifies a Tcl command to invoke  whenever  the
              menu  is torn off.  The actual command will consist of the value of this option, followed by a
              space, followed by the name of the menu window, followed by a space, followed by the  name  of
              the  name  of the torn off menu window.  For example, if the option's is ``<b>a</b> <b>b</b>'' and menu <b>.x.y</b>
              is torn off to create a new menu <b>.x.tearoff1</b>, then the command ``<b>a</b> <b>b</b> <b>.x.y</b>  <b>.x.tearoff1</b>''  will
              be invoked.                                                                                    |

       Command-Line Name:<b>-title</b>                                                                              |
       Database Name:  <b>title</b>                                                                                 |
       Database Class: <b>Title</b>                                                                                 |

              The  string  will be used to title the window created when this menu is torn off. If the title |
              is NULL, then the window will have the title of the menubutton or the text of the cascade item |
              from which this menu was invoked.                                                              |

       Command-Line Name:<b>-type</b>                                                                               |
       Database Name:  <b>type</b>                                                                                  |
       Database Class: <b>Type</b>                                                                                  |

              This  option  can  be one of <b>menubar</b>, <b>tearoff</b>, or <b>normal</b>, and is set when the menu is created. |
              While the string returned by the configuration database will change if this option is changed, |
              this  does not affect the menu widget's behavior. This is used by the cloning mechanism and is |
              not normally set outside of the Tk library.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
       The <b>menu</b> command creates a new top-level window (given by the <u>pathName</u> argument) and makes it into  a
       menu  widget.   Additional  options,  described above, may be specified on the command line or in the
       option database to configure aspects of the menu such as its  colors  and  font.   The  <b>menu</b>  command
       returns  its  <u>pathName</u>  argument.  At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a window
       named <u>pathName</u>, but <u>pathName</u>'s parent must exist.

       A menu is a widget that displays a collection of one-line entries arranged in one  or  more  columns. |
       There exist several different types of entries, each with different properties.  Entries of different |
       types may be combined in a single menu.  Menu entries are not the same as entry  widgets.   In  fact, |
       menu entries are not even distinct widgets; the entire menu is one widget.

       Menu  entries  are displayed with up to three separate fields.  The main field is a label in the form
       of a text string, a bitmap, or an image, controlled by the <b>-label</b>, <b>-bitmap</b>, and  <b>-image</b>  options  for
       the entry.  If the  <b>-accelerator</b> option is specified for an entry then a second textual field is dis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">played&nbsp;displayed</font>
       played to the right of the label.  The accelerator typically describes a keystroke sequence that  may
       be  typed in the application to cause the same result as invoking the menu entry.  The third field is
       an <u>indicator</u>.  The indicator is present only for checkbutton or radiobutton  entries.   It  indicates
       whether the entry is selected or not, and is displayed to the left of the entry's string.

       In  normal  use,  an entry becomes active (displays itself differently) whenever the mouse pointer is
       over the entry.  If a mouse button is released over the entry then the entry is <u>invoked</u>.  The  effect
       of  invocation is different for each type of entry; these effects are described below in the sections
       on individual entries.

       Entries may be <u>disabled</u>, which causes their labels and accelerators to be displayed with dimmer  col-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ors.&nbsp;colors.</font>
       ors.  The default menu bindings will not allow a disabled entry to be activated or invoked.  Disabled
       entries may be re-enabled, at which point it becomes possible to activate and invoke them again.      |

       Whenever a menu's active entry is changed, a &lt;&lt;MenuSelect&gt;&gt; virtual event is send to  the  menu.  The |
       active  item  can then be queried from the menu, and an action can be taken, such as setting context- |
       sensitive help text for the entry.


<b>COMMAND</b> <b>ENTRIES</b>
       The most common kind of menu entry is a command entry, which behaves much like a button widget.  When
       a  command  entry is invoked, a Tcl command is executed.  The Tcl command is specified with the <b>-com</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;-command</font>
       <b>mand</b> option.


<b>SEPARATOR</b> <b>ENTRIES</b>
       A separator is an entry that is displayed as a horizontal dividing line.   A  separator  may  not  be
       activated or invoked, and it has no behavior other than its display appearance.


<b>CHECKBUTTON</b> <b>ENTRIES</b>
       A  checkbutton menu entry behaves much like a checkbutton widget.  When it is invoked it toggles back
       and forth between the selected and deselected states.  When the entry is selected, a particular value
       is  stored  in  a particular global variable (as determined by the <b>-onvalue</b> and <b>-variable</b> options for
       the entry);  when the entry is deselected another value  (determined  by  the  <b>-offvalue</b>  option)  is
       stored in the global variable.  An indicator box is displayed to the left of the label in a checkbut-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ton&nbsp;checkbutton</font>
       ton entry.  If the entry is selected then the indicator's center is displayed in the color  given  by
       the  <b>-selectcolor</b>  option  for  the entry; otherwise the indicator's center is displayed in the back-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ground&nbsp;background</font>
       ground color for the menu.  If a <b>-command</b> option is specified for a checkbutton entry, then its value
       is  evaluated  as  a  Tcl  command  each  time the entry is invoked;  this happens after toggling the
       entry's selected state.


<b>RADIOBUTTON</b> <b>ENTRIES</b>
       A radiobutton menu entry behaves much like a radiobutton widget.  Radiobutton entries  are  organized
       in  groups  of  which  only one entry may be selected at a time.  Whenever a particular entry becomes
       selected it stores a particular value into a particular global variable (as determined by the  <b>-value</b>
       and  <b>-variable</b>  options for the entry).  This action causes any previously-selected entry in the same
       group to deselect itself.  Once an entry has become selected, any change to  the  entry's  associated
       variable  will  cause the entry to deselect itself.  Grouping of radiobutton entries is determined by
       their associated variables:  if two entries have the same associated variable then they  are  in  the
       same  group.   An  indicator diamond is displayed to the left of the label in each radiobutton entry.
       If the entry is selected then the indicator's center is displayed in the color given by the  <b>-select</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">color&nbsp;-selectcolor</font>
       <b>color</b> option for the entry; otherwise the indicator's center is displayed in the background color for
       the menu.  If a <b>-command</b> option is specified for a radiobutton entry, then its value is evaluated  as
       a Tcl command each time the entry is invoked;  this happens after selecting the entry.


<b>CASCADE</b> <b>ENTRIES</b>
       A  cascade  entry  is  one with an associated menu (determined by the <b>-menu</b> option).  Cascade entries
       allow the construction of cascading menus.  The <b>postcascade</b> widget command can be used  to  post  and
       unpost the associated menu just next to of the cascade entry.  The associated menu must be a child of
       the menu containing the cascade entry (this is needed in order for menu traversal to work correctly).

       A cascade entry posts its associated menu by invoking a Tcl command of the form
              <u>menu</u> <b>post</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u>
       where  <u>menu</u>  is  the path name of the associated menu, and <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> are the root-window coordinates of
       the upper-right corner of the cascade entry.  On Unix, the lower-level menu is unposted by  executing |
       a Tcl command with the form                                                                           |
              <u>menu</u> <b>unpost</b>                                                                                    |
       where  <u>menu</u> is the name of the associated menu.  On other platforms, the platform's native code takes |
       care of unposting the menu.

       If a <b>-command</b> option is specified for a cascade entry then it is evaluated as a Tcl command  whenever |
       the entry is invoked. This is not supported on Windows.


<b>TEAR-OFF</b> <b>ENTRIES</b>
       A  tear-off  entry appears at the top of the menu if enabled with the <b>tearOff</b> option.  It is not like
       other menu entries in that it cannot be created with the <b>add</b> widget command  and  cannot  be  deleted
       with  the <b>delete</b> widget command.  When a tear-off entry is created it appears as a dashed line at the
       top of the menu.  Under the default bindings, invoking the tear-off entry causes a torn-off  copy  to
       be made of the menu and all of its submenus.


<b>MENUBARS</b>                                                                                                     |
       Any menu can be set as a menubar for a toplevel window (see <b>toplevel</b> command for syntax). On the Mac- |
       intosh, whenever the toplevel is in front, this menu's cascade  items  will  appear  in  the  menubar |
       across  the  top  of  the main monitor. On Windows and Unix, this menu's items will be displayed in a |
       menubar accross the top of the window. These menus will behave according to the interface  guidelines |
       of their platforms. For every menu set as a menubar, a clone menu is made. See the <b>CLONES</b> section for |
       more information.                                                                                     |

       As noted, menubars may behave differently on different platforms.  One example of this  concerns  the |
       handling  of  checkbuttons and radiobuttons within the menu.  While it is permitted to put these menu |
       elements on menubars, they may not be drawn with indicators on some platforms, due to system restric- |
       tions.


<b>SPECIAL</b> <b>MENUS</b> <b>IN</b> <b>MENUBARS</b>                                                                                    |
       Certain  menus in a menubar will be treated specially.  On the Macintosh, access to the special Apple |
       and Help menus is provided. On Windows, access to the Windows System menu in each window is provided. |
       On X Windows, a special right-justified help menu is provided. In all cases, these menus must be cre- |
       ated with the command name of the menubar menu concatenated with the special name. So for  a  menubar |
       named  .menubar,  on  the  Macintosh, the special menus would be .menubar.apple and .menubar.help; on |
       Windows, the  special  menu  would  be  .menubar.system;  on  X  Windows,  the  help  menu  would  be |
       .menubar.help.                                                                                        |

       When  Tk  sees  an  Apple  menu on the Macintosh, that menu's contents make up the first items of the |
       Apple menu on the screen whenever the window containing the menubar is in  front.  The  menu  is  the |
       first  one  that  the  user sees and has a title which is an Apple logo.  After all of the Tk-defined |
       items, the menu will have a separator, followed by all of the items in the user's  Apple  Menu  Items |
       folder.   Since the System uses a different menu definition procedure for the Apple menu than Tk uses |
       for its menus, and the system APIs do not fully support everything Tk tries to do, the menu item will |
       only  have  its  text displayed. No font attributes, images, bitmaps, or colors will be displayed. In |
       addition, a menu with a tearoff item will have the tearoff item displayed as "(TearOff)".             |

       When Tk see a Help menu on the Macintosh, the menu's contents are appended to the standard help  menu |
       on  the  right  of the user's menubar whenever the user's menubar is in front. The first items in the |
       menu are provided by Apple. Similar to the Apple Menu, cusomization in this menu is limited  to  what |
       the system provides.                                                                                  |

       When  Tk sees a System menu on Windows, its items are appended to the system menu that the menubar is |
       attached to. This menu has an icon representing a spacebar, and can be invoked with the mouse  or  by |
       typing  Alt+Spacebar.   Due to limitations in the Windows API, any font changes, colors, images, bit- |
       maps, or tearoff images will not appear in the system menu.                                           |

       When Tk see a Help menu on X Windows, the menu is moved to be last in the menubar and is right justi- |
       fied.


<b>CLONES</b>                                                                                                       |
       When  a  menu  is  set as a menubar for a toplevel window, or when a menu is torn off, a clone of the |
       menu is made. This clone is a menu widget in its own right, but  it  is  a  child  of  the  original. |
       Changes  in  the configuration of the original are reflected in the clone. Additionally, any cascades |
       that are pointed to are also cloned so that menu traversal will work right. Clones are destroyed when |
       either the tearoff or menubar goes away, or when the original menu is destroyed.


<b>WIDGET</b> <b>COMMAND</b>
       The  <b>menu</b>  command  creates  a  new  Tcl command whose name is <u>pathName</u>.  This command may be used to
       invoke various operations on the widget.  It has the following general form:
              <u>pathName</u> <u>option</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
       <u>Option</u> and the <u>arg</u>s determine the exact behavior of the command.

       Many of the widget commands for a menu take as one argument an indicator of which entry of  the  menu
       to  operate  on.   These  indicators  are called <u>index</u>es and may be specified in any of the following
       forms:

       <u>number</u>      Specifies the entry numerically, where 0 corresponds to the top-most entry of the menu, 1
                   to the entry below it, and so on.

       <b>active</b>      Indicates  the  entry  that is currently active.  If no entry is active then this form is
                   equivalent to <b>none</b>.  This form may not be abbreviated.

       <b>end</b>         Indicates the bottommost entry in the menu.  If there are no entries  in  the  menu  then
                   this form is equivalent to <b>none</b>.  This form may not be abbreviated.

       <b>last</b>        Same as <b>end</b>.

       <b>none</b>        Indicates  ``no  entry  at all'';  this is used most commonly with the <b>activate</b> option to
                   deactivate all the entries in the menu.  In most cases the specification of  <b>none</b>  causes
                   nothing to happen in the widget command.  This form may not be abbreviated.

       <b>@</b><u>number</u>     In  this form, <u>number</u> is treated as a y-coordinate in the menu's window;  the entry clos-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">est&nbsp;closest</font>
                   est to that y-coordinate is used.  For example, ``<b>@0</b>'' indicates the  top-most  entry  in
                   the window.

       <u>pattern</u>     If  the  index doesn't satisfy one of the above forms then this form is used.  <u>Pattern</u> is
                   pattern-matched against the label of each entry in the menu, in order from the top  down,
                   until a matching entry is found.  The rules of <b>Tcl_StringMatch</b> are used.

       The following widget commands are possible for menu widgets:

       <u>pathName</u> <b>activate</b> <u>index</u>
              Change  the  state of the entry indicated by <u>index</u> to <b>active</b> and redisplay it using its active
              colors.  Any previously-active entry is deactivated.  If <u>index</u> is specified as <b>none</b>, or if the
              specified  entry  is  disabled,  then the menu ends up with no active entry.  Returns an empty
              string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>add</b> <u>type</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Add a new entry to the bottom of the menu.  The new entry's type is given by <u>type</u> and must  be
              one  of  <b>cascade</b>, <b>checkbutton</b>, <b>command</b>, <b>radiobutton</b>, or <b>separator</b>, or a unique abbreviation of
              one of the above.  If additional arguments are present, they  specify  any  of  the  following
              options:

              <b>-activebackground</b> <u>value</u>
                     Specifies  a  background  color to use for displaying this entry when it is active.  If
                     this option is specified as an empty string (the default),  then  the  <b>activeBackground</b>
                     option  for  the  overall menu is used.  If the <b>tk_strictMotif</b> variable has been set to
                     request strict Motif compliance, then this option is ignored and the <b>-background</b> option
                     is  used in its place.  This option is not available for separator or tear-off entries.

              <b>-activeforeground</b> <u>value</u>
                     Specifies a foreground color to use for displaying this entry when it  is  active.   If
                     this  option  is  specified as an empty string (the default), then the <b>activeForeground</b>
                     option for the overall menu is used.  This option is not  available  for  separator  or
                     tear-off entries.

              <b>-accelerator</b> <u>value</u>
                     Specifies  a string to display at the right side of the menu entry.  Normally describes
                     an accelerator keystroke sequence that may be typed to invoke the same function as  the
                     menu entry.  This option is not available for separator or tear-off entries.

              <b>-background</b> <u>value</u>
                     Specifies  a background color to use for displaying this entry when it is in the normal
                     state (neither active nor disabled).  If this option is specified as  an  empty  string
                     (the default), then the <b>background</b> option for the overall menu is used.  This option is
                     not available for separator or tear-off entries.

              <b>-bitmap</b> <u>value</u>
                     Specifies a bitmap to display in the menu instead of a textual label,  in  any  of  the
                     forms  accepted  by  <b>Tk_GetBitmap</b>.   This option overrides the <b>-label</b> option but may be
                     reset to an empty string to enable a textual label to be displayed.  If a <b>-image</b> option
                     has  been  specified, it overrides <b>-bitmap</b>.  This option is not available for separator
                     or tear-off entries.                                                                    |

              <b>-columnbreak</b>                                                                                   |
              <u>value</u>                                                                             |            |
                     When  this  option  is  zero, the appears below the previous entry. When this option is |
                     one, the menu appears at the top of a new column in the menu.

              <b>-command</b> <u>value</u>
                     Specifies a Tcl command to execute when the menu entry is invoked.  Not  available  for
                     separator or tear-off entries.                                                          |

              <b>-compound</b>                                                                                      |
              <u>value</u>                                                                                |         |
                     Specifies whether the menu entry should display both an image  and  text,  and  if  so, |
                     where  the  image  should be placed relative to the text.  Valid values for this option |
                     are <b>bottom</b>, <b>center</b>, <b>left</b>, <b>none</b>, <b>right</b> and <b>top</b>.  The default value is <b>none</b>, meaning that |
                     the  button will display either an image or text, depending on the values of the <b>-image</b> |
                     and <b>-bitmap</b> options.

              <b>-font</b> <u>value</u>
                     Specifies the font to use when drawing the label or accelerator string in  this  entry.
                     If  this  option is specified as an empty string (the default) then the <b>font</b> option for
                     the overall menu is used.  This option is  not  available  for  separator  or  tear-off
                     entries.

              <b>-foreground</b> <u>value</u>
                     Specifies  a foreground color to use for displaying this entry when it is in the normal
                     state (neither active nor disabled).  If this option is specified as  an  empty  string
                     (the default), then the <b>foreground</b> option for the overall menu is used.  This option is
                     not available for separator or tear-off entries.                                        |

              <b>-hidemargin</b>                                                                                    |
              <u>value</u>                                                                              |           |
                     Specifies  whether  the  standard  margins should be drawn for this menu entry. This is |
                     useful when creating palette  with  images  in  them,  i.e.,  color  palettes,  pattern |
                     palettes,  etc.  1  indicates that the margin for the entry is hidden; 0 means that the |
                     margin is used.

              <b>-image</b> <u>value</u>
                     Specifies an image to display in the menu instead of a text string or bitmap The  image
                     must  have been created by some previous invocation of <b>image</b> <b>create</b>.  This option over-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rides&nbsp;overrides</font>
                     rides the <b>-label</b> and <b>-bitmap</b> options but may be reset to an empty string  to  enable  a
                     textual or bitmap label to be displayed.  This option is not available for separator or
                     tear-off entries.

              <b>-indicatoron</b> <u>value</u>
                     Available only for checkbutton and radiobutton entries.  <u>Value</u> is a boolean that deter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mines&nbsp;determines</font>
                     mines whether or not the indicator should be displayed.

              <b>-label</b> <u>value</u>
                     Specifies a string to display as an identifying label in the menu entry.  Not available
                     for separator or tear-off entries.

              <b>-menu</b> <u>value</u>
                     Available only for cascade entries.  Specifies the path name of the submenu  associated
                     with this entry.  The submenu must be a child of the menu.

              <b>-offvalue</b> <u>value</u>
                     Available  only  for  checkbutton entries.  Specifies the value to store in the entry's
                     associated variable when the entry is deselected.

              <b>-onvalue</b> <u>value</u>
                     Available only for checkbutton entries.  Specifies the value to store  in  the  entry's
                     associated variable when the entry is selected.

              <b>-selectcolor</b> <u>value</u>
                     Available only for checkbutton and radiobutton entries.  Specifies the color to display
                     in the indicator when the entry is selected.  If the value  is  an  empty  string  (the
                     default) then the <b>selectColor</b> option for the menu determines the indicator color.

              <b>-selectimage</b> <u>value</u>
                     Available  only for checkbutton and radiobutton entries.  Specifies an image to display
                     in the entry (in place of the <b>-image</b> option) when it is selected.  <u>Value</u> is the name of
                     an  image,  which  must  have been created by some previous invocation of <b>image</b> <b>create</b>.
                     This option is ignored unless the <b>-image</b> option has been specified.

              <b>-state</b> <u>value</u>
                     Specifies one of three states for the entry:  <b>normal</b>, <b>active</b>, or <b>disabled</b>.   In  normal
                     state  the  entry  is  displayed using the <b>foreground</b> option for the menu and the <b>back</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ground&nbsp;background</font>
                     <b>ground</b> option from the entry or the menu.  The active state is typically used when  the
                     pointer  is  over  the entry.  In active state the entry is displayed using the <b>active</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">Foreground&nbsp;activeForeground</font>
                     <b>Foreground</b> option for the menu along with the <b>activebackground</b> option from  the  entry.
                     Disabled  state  means that the entry should be insensitive:  the default bindings will
                     refuse to activate or invoke the entry.  In this state the entry is displayed according
                     to the <b>disabledForeground</b> option for the menu and the <b>background</b> option from the entry.
                     This option is not available for separator entries.

              <b>-underline</b> <u>value</u>
                     Specifies the integer index of a character to underline in the entry.  This  option  is
                     also  queried by the default bindings and used to implement keyboard traversal.  0 cor-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">responds&nbsp;corresponds</font>
                     responds to the first character of the text displayed in the entry, 1 to the next char-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">acter,&nbsp;character,</font>
                     acter,  and  so on.  If a bitmap or image is displayed in the entry then this option is
                     ignored.  This option is not available for separator or tear-off entries.

              <b>-value</b> <u>value</u>
                     Available only for radiobutton entries.  Specifies the value to store  in  the  entry's
                     associated  variable when the entry is selected.  If an empty string is specified, then
                     the <b>-label</b> option for the entry as the value to store in the variable.

              <b>-variable</b> <u>value</u>
                     Available only for checkbutton and radiobutton entries.  Specifies the name of a global
                     value  to set when the entry is selected.  For checkbutton entries the variable is also
                     set when the entry is deselected.   For  radiobutton  entries,  changing  the  variable
                     causes the currently-selected entry to deselect itself.

              The <b>add</b> widget command returns an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>cget</b> <u>option</u>
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <u>option</u>.  <u>Option</u> may have any of
              the values accepted by the <b>menu</b> command.                                                       |

       <u>pathName</u> <b>clone</b> <u>newPathname</u> <u>?clone-</u>                                                                    |
       <u>Type?</u>                                                                |                                |
              Makes  a  clone  of the current menu named <u>newPathName</u>. This clone is a menu in its own right, |
              but any changes to the clone are propogated to the original menu and vice versa. <u>cloneType</u> can |
              be  <b>normal</b>,  <b>menubar</b>, or <b>tearoff</b>. Should not normally be called outside of the Tk library. See |
              the <b>CLONES</b> section for more information.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>configure</b> ?<u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no <u>option</u> is specified, returns a
              list  describing  all of the available options for <u>pathName</u> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for informa-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;information</font>
              tion on the format of this list).  If <u>option</u> is specified with  no  <u>value</u>,  then  the  command
              returns a list describing the one named option (this list will be identical to the correspond-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;corresponding</font>
              ing sublist of the value returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).  If  one  or  more  <u>option-value</u>
              pairs  are  specified,  then the command modifies the given widget <!-- a -->option(s)<!-- /a --> to have the given
              <!-- a -->value(s)<!-- /a -->;  in this case the command returns an empty string.  <u>Option</u> may have any of the  val-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ues&nbsp;values</font>
              ues accepted by the <b>menu</b> command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>delete</b> <u>index1</u> ?<u>index2</u>?
              Delete all of the menu entries between <u>index1</u> and <u>index2</u> inclusive.  If <u>index2</u> is omitted then
              it defaults to <u>index1</u>.  Attempts to delete a tear-off menu entry  are  ignored  (instead,  you
              should change the <b>tearOff</b> option to remove the tear-off entry).

       <u>pathName</u> <b>entrycget</b> <u>index</u> <u>option</u>
              Returns  the current value of a configuration option for the entry given by <u>index</u>.  <u>Option</u> may
              have any of the values accepted by the <b>add</b> widget command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>entryconfigure</b> <u>index</u> ?<u>options</u>?
              This command is similar to the <b>configure</b> command, except that it applies to the options for an
              individual  entry,  whereas <b>configure</b> applies to the options for the menu as a whole.  <u>Options</u>
              may have any of the values accepted by the <b>add</b> widget  command.   If  <u>options</u>  are  specified,
              options  are modified as indicated in the command and the command returns an empty string.  If
              no <u>options</u> are specified, returns a list describing the current options for entry  <u>index</u>  (see
              <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for information on the format of this list).

       <u>pathName</u> <b>index</b> <u>index</u>
              Returns the numerical index corresponding to <u>index</u>, or <b>none</b> if <u>index</u> was specified as <b>none</b>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>insert</b> <u>index</u> <u>type</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Same  as  the  <b>add</b>  widget  command except that it inserts the new entry just before the entry
              given by <u>index</u>, instead of appending to the end of the menu.   The  <u>type</u>,  <u>option</u>,  and  <u>value</u>
              arguments  have  the same interpretation as for the <b>add</b> widget command.  It is not possible to
              insert new menu entries before the tear-off entry, if the menu has one.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>invoke</b> <u>index</u>
              Invoke the action of the menu entry.  See the sections on the  individual  entries  above  for
              details  on  what  happens.  If the menu entry is disabled then nothing happens.  If the entry
              has a command associated with it then the result of that command is returned as the result  of
              the  <b>invoke</b>  widget command.  Otherwise the result is an empty string.  Note:  invoking a menu
              entry does not automatically unpost the menu;  the default bindings normally take care of this
              before invoking the <b>invoke</b> widget command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>post</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u>
              Arrange  for  the menu to be displayed on the screen at the root-window coordinates given by <u>x</u>
              and <u>y</u>.  These coordinates are adjusted if necessary to guarantee that the entire menu is visi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ble&nbsp;visible</font>
              ble  on the screen.  This command normally returns an empty string.  If the <b>postCommand</b> option
              has been specified, then its value is executed as a Tcl script before posting the menu and the
              result  of  that  script  is  returned  as the result of the <b>post</b> widget command.  If an error
              returns while executing the command, then the error is returned without posting the menu.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>postcascade</b> <u>index</u>
              Posts the submenu associated with the cascade entry given by <u>index</u>, and unposts any previously
              posted  submenu.  If <u>index</u> doesn't correspond to a cascade entry, or if <u>pathName</u> isn't posted,
              the command has no effect except to unpost any currently posted submenu.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>type</b> <u>index</u>
              Returns the type of the menu entry given by <u>index</u>.  This is the <u>type</u> argument  passed  to  the
              <b>add</b>  widget command when the entry was created, such as <b>command</b> or <b>separator</b>, or <b>tearoff</b> for a
              tear-off entry.

       <u>pathName</u>                                                                                              |
       <b>unpost</b>                                                                                       |        |
              Unmap the window so that it is no longer displayed.  If a lower-level cascaded menu is posted, |
              unpost that menu.  Returns an empty string. This subcommand does not work on Windows  and  the |
              Macintosh, as those platforms have their own way of unposting menus.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>yposition</b> <u>index</u>
              Returns  a  decimal string giving the y-coordinate within the menu window of the topmost pixel
              in the entry specified by <u>index</u>.


<b>MENU</b> <b>CONFIGURATIONS</b>
       The default bindings support four different ways of using menus:                                      |

       <b>Pulldown</b> <b>Menus</b> <b>in</b>                                                                                     |
       <b>Menubar</b>                                                                             |                 |
              This  is  the  most  command case. You create a menu widget that will become the menu bar. You |
              then add cascade entries to this menu, specifying the pull down menus you wish to use in  your |
              menu  bar.  You  then  create  all of the pulldowns. Once you have done this, specify the menu |
              using the <b>-menu</b> option of the toplevel's widget command. See the  <b>toplevel</b>  manual  entry  for |
              details.

       <b>Pulldown</b> <b>Menus</b> <b>in</b> <b>Menu</b> <b>Buttons</b>
              This  is  the  compatable way to do menu bars.  You create one menubutton widget for each top-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">level&nbsp;toplevel</font>
              level menu, and typically you arrange a series of menubuttons in a row in  a  menubar  window.
              You  also  create  the  top-level  menus and any cascaded submenus, and tie them together with
              <b>-menu</b> options in menubuttons and cascade menu entries.  The top-level menu must be a child  of
              the menubutton, and each submenu must be a child of the menu that refers to it.  Once you have
              done this, the default bindings will allow users to traverse and invoke the tree of menus  via
              its menubutton;  see the <b>menubutton</b> manual entry for details.

       <b>Popup</b> <b>Menus</b>
              Popup  menus  typically post in response to a mouse button press or keystroke.  You create the
              popup menus and any cascaded submenus, then you call the <b>tk_popup</b> procedure at the appropriate
              time to post the top-level menu.

       <b>Option</b> <b>Menus</b>
              An  option menu consists of a menubutton with an associated menu that allows you to select one
              of several values.  The current value is displayed in the menubutton and is also stored  in  a
              global  variable.   Use  the  <b>tk_optionMenu</b>  procedure  to create option menubuttons and their
              menus.

       <b>Torn-off</b> <b>Menus</b>
              You create a torn-off menu by invoking the tear-off entry at the top of an existing menu.  The
              default  bindings will create a new menu that is a copy of the original menu and leave it per-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">manently&nbsp;permanently</font>
              manently posted as a top-level window.  The torn-off menu behaves just the same as the  origi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nal&nbsp;original</font>
              nal menu.


<b>DEFAULT</b> <b>BINDINGS</b>
       Tk automatically creates class bindings for menus that give them the following default behavior:

       [1]    When  the  mouse enters a menu, the entry underneath the mouse cursor activates;  as the mouse
              moves around the menu, the active entry changes to track the mouse.

       [2]    When the mouse leaves a menu all of the entries in the menu deactivate, except in the  special
              case where the mouse moves from a menu to a cascaded submenu.

       [3]    When  a  button  is released over a menu, the active entry (if any) is invoked.  The menu also
              unposts unless it is a torn-off menu.

       [4]    The Space and Return keys invoke the active entry and unpost the menu.

       [5]    If any of the entries in a menu have letters underlined  with  with  <b>-underline</b>  option,  then
              pressing  one  of  the underlined letters (or its upper-case or lower-case equivalent) invokes
              that entry and unposts the menu.

       [6]    The Escape key aborts a menu selection in  progress  without  invoking  any  entry.   It  also
              unposts the menu unless it is a torn-off menu.

       [7]    The Up and Down keys activate the next higher or lower entry in the menu.  When one end of the
              menu is reached, the active entry wraps around to the other end.

       [8]    The Left key moves to the next menu to the left.  If the current menu is a  cascaded  submenu,
              then  the submenu is unposted and the current menu entry becomes the cascade entry in the par-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ent.&nbsp;parent.</font>
              ent.  If the current menu is a top-level menu posted  from  a  menubutton,  then  the  current
              menubutton  is  unposted and the next menubutton to the left is posted.  Otherwise the key has
              no effect.  The left-right order of menubuttons is determined by  their  stacking  order:   Tk
              assumes that the lowest menubutton (which by default is the first one created) is on the left.

       [9]    The Right key moves to the next menu to the right.  If the current entry is a  cascade  entry,
              then the submenu is posted and the  current menu entry becomes the first entry in the submenu.
              Otherwise, if the current menu was posted from a menubutton, then the  current  menubutton  is
              unposted and the next menubutton to the right is posted.

       Disabled  menu  entries are non-responsive:  they don't activate and they ignore mouse button presses
       and releases.

       Several of the bindings make use of the command <b>tk_menuSetFocus</b>.  It saves the current focus and sets |
       the focus to its <u>pathName</u> argument, which is a menu widget.

       The behavior of menus can be changed by defining new bindings for individual widgets or by redefining
       the class bindings.


<b>BUGS</b>
       At present it isn't possible to use the option database to specify values for the options to individ-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ual&nbsp;individual</font>
       ual entries.
