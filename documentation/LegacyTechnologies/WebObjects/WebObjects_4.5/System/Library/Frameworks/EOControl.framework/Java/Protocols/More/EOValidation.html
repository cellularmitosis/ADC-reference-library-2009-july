This method is responsible for twothings: coercing the value into an appropriate type for the object,and validating it according to the object's rules. The default implementationprovided by EOCustomObject consults the object's EOClassDescription(using the EOEnterpriseObject interface method  <a href="../EOEnterpriseObject.html#//apple_ref/java/intfm/EOEnterpriseObject/classDescription">classDescription</a>) to coerce the valueand to check for basic errors, such as a <code>null</code> valuewhen that isn't allowed. If no basic errors exist, this defaultimplementation then validates the value according to the objectitself. It searches for a method of the form <code>validate</code><em> Key</em>  andinvokes it if it exists. These are the methods that your customclasses can implement to validate individual properties, such as <code>validateAge</code> tocheck that the value the user entered is within acceptable limits. The <code>validateAge</code> methodshould raise an  <a href="../../Classes/EOValidationException.html#BAABJIHH">EOValidation.Exception</a> if it findsan unacceptable value.</p><p>Coercion is performed automatically for you (by the EOClassDescription),so all you need handle is validation itself. Since you can implementcustom validation logic in the <code>validate</code><em> Key</em>  methods,you rarely need to override the EOValidation method  <a href="../EOValidation.html#//apple_ref/java/intfm/EOValidation/validateValueForKey">validateValueForKey</a>. Rather, thedefault implementation provided by EOCustomObject is generally sufficient.</p><p>As an example of how validating a single property works, supposethat Member objects have an <code>age</code> attributestored as an integer. This attribute has a lower limit of 16, definedby the Member class. Now, suppose a user types "12" into a textfield for the age of a member. The value comes into the Framework asa string. When <code>validateValueForKey</code> is invokedto validate the new value, the method uses its EOClassDescriptionto convert the string "12" into an NSNumber, then invokes <code>validateAge</code> withthat NSNumber. The <code>validateAge</code> method comparesthe age to its limit of 16 and throws an exception to indicate thatthe new value is not acceptable.</p><blockquote><pre>public void validateAge(Object age) throws EOvalidation.Exception {    if ((((Number)age).intValue) &lt; 16)        throw new EOValidation.Exception("Age of " + age + " is below minimum.");}</pre></blockquote><br><br><h2>When Properties are Validated</h2><p>The Framework validates all of an object's properties beforethe object is saved to an external source-either inserted or updated.Additionally, you can design your application so that changes toa property's value are validated immediately, as soon as a userattempts to leave an editable field in the user interface (in JavaClient and Application Kit applications only). Whenever an EODisplayGroup setsa value in an object, it sends the object a <code>validateValueForKey</code> message,allowing the object to coerce the value's type, perform any additionalvalidation, and throw an exception if the value isn't valid. By default,the display group leaves validation errors to be handled when theobject is saved, using <code>validateValueForKey</code> onlyfor type coercion. However, you can use the EODisplayGroup method <code>setValidatesChangesImmediately</code> withan argument of true to tell the display group to immediately presentan attention panel whenever a validation error is encountered.</p><br><a name = "CJFEAACJ"></a><h2>Validating Before an Operation</h2><p>The remaining EOValidation methods- <a href="../EOValidation.html#//apple_ref/java/intfm/EOValidation/validateForInsert">validateForInsert</a>,  <a href="../EOValidation.html#//apple_ref/java/intfm/EOValidation/validateForUpdate">validateForUpdate</a>,  <a href="../EOValidation.html#//apple_ref/java/intfm/EOValidation/validateForSave">validateForSave</a>, and  <a href="../EOValidation.html#//apple_ref/java/intfm/EOValidation/validateForDelete">validateForDelete</a>-validate an entireobject to see if it's valid for a particular operation. These methodsare invoked automatically by the Framework when the associated operationis initiated. EOCustomObject provides default implementations, soyou only have to implement them yourself when special validationlogic is required. For example, you can override these methods inyour custom enterprise object classes to allow or refuse the operationbased on property values. For example, a Fee object might refuseto be deleted if it hasn't been paid yet. Or you can overridethese methods to perform delayed validation of properties or tocompare multiple properties against one another; for example, youmight verify that a pair of dates is in the proper temporal order.</p><p>If you override any of these operation-specific validationmethods, be sure to invoke <code>super</code>'s implementation.This is important, as the default implementations of the <code>validateFor...</code> methodspass the check on to the object's EOClassDescription, which performsbasic checking among properties, including invoking  <a href="../EOValidation.html#//apple_ref/java/intfm/EOValidation/validateValueForKey">validateValueForKey</a> for each property.The access layer's EOEntityClassDescription class verifies constraintsbased on an EOModel, such as delete rules. For example, the deleterule for a Department object might state that it can't be deletedif it still contains Employee objects.</p><p>The method <code>validateForSave</code> is thegeneric validation method for when an object is written to the externalstore. The default implementations of <code>validateForInsert</code>,  <a href="../EOValidation.html#//apple_ref/java/intfm/EOValidation/validateForUpdate">validateForUpdate</a> both invoke it.If an object performs validation that isn't specific to insertionor to updating, it should go in <code>validateForSave</code>.</p><br><a href="../../EOControlTOC.html"><img src="../../../../../../../images/up.gif" border="0" alt="Table of Contents"></a></BODY></HTML>
