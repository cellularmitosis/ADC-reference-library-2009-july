README - QTShowEffectThis sample code illustrates how to use the low-level QuickTime videoeffects API to apply a filter (a one-source effect) to a picture, orto apply a transition (a two-source effect) to two pictures.Launch the application. The user must select an effect and any customparameters for the effect.  To see the effect rendered, select "Run"from the Effects menu.NOTE: QTShowEffect runs only from unlocked volumes; copy the applicationfrom the CD to your local computer before running it.You can choose another effect using the "Select Effect" menu commandin the Effects menu. You can choose some options for the effect inthe Settings menu. Note that you can choose to have a standard effectsparameters dialog box, or you can embed the effects parameters controlsin a custom dialog box of your own.QTShowEffect can also build a QuickTime movie containing a filter or transition. QTShowEffect can be built for both the MacOS and Windows.For Windows builds using Microsoft Visual C++, the Makefile (QTShowEffect.mak)automatically calls Rez to create the resource file QTShowEffect.qtr from theinput file QTShowEffect.r. The .qtr file must reside in the same directory as theapplication QTShowEffect.exe. For final delivery of your product, you shouldinsert the .qtr file into the .exe file by using the tool RezWackLATE BREAKING NOTES: This sample contains some code for building movies with compound effects. That code hasNOT been tested and is currently NOT compiled into the application (because the compilerflag ALLOW_COMPOUND_EFFECTS is set to 0). If you set ALLOW_COMPOUND_EFFECTS to 1,the application may not work as intended.Enjoy,QuickTime Team
