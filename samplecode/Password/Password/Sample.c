If a desk accessory owned two windows, it would	close both those windows when CloseDeskAcc was called. When DoCloseBehind	got around to calling DoCloseWindow for that other window that was already	closed, things would go very poorly. Another option would be to have a	procedure, GetRearWindow, that would go through the window list and return	the last window. Instead, we decided to present the standard approach	of getting and closing FrontWindow until FrontWindow returns NIL. This	has a potential benefit in that the window whose document needs to be saved	may be visible since it is the front window, therefore decreasing the	chance of user confusion. For aesthetic reasons, the windows in the	application should be checked for updates periodically and have the	updates serviced.**************************************************************************************/
