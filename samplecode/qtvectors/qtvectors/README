README - QTVectorsQTVectors is a simple application that constructs a QuickTime vector movie. It shows how to create a new movie, construct a series of QTAtoms that describe a vector picture, and then save the QTAtoms in the new movie. You can then open the movie to see what was drawn.Currently, QTVectors creates the atoms by using one of two methods: (1) It can build the atoms by "brute force", just stuffing the data into a handle, long word after long word. (Ouch!) (2) It can also build an atom stream using the Curve Utilities described in the "QuickTime Vectors" chapter of the developer documentation. This second method is higher-level and far more readable in the source code.QTVectors can be compiled and run under the MacOS and under Windows. The main vector code is found in the file QTVectors.c. The remaining files in this folder are part of the general Mac and Windows support code.Enjoy,QuickTime Team
