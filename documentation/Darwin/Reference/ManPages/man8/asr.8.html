ASR(8)                    BSD System Manager's Manual                   ASR(8)

<b>NAME</b>
     <b>asr</b> -- Apple Software Restore; copy volumes (e.g. from disk images)

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
     <b>asr</b> <u>verb</u> [options]
     <b>asr</b> <b>restore</b> <b>--source</b> <u>source</u> <b>--target</b> <u>target</u> [<u>options</u>]
     <b>asr</b> <b>server</b> <b>--source</b> <u>source</u> <b>--config</b> <u>configuration</u> [<u>options</u>]
     <b>asr</b> <b>restore</b> <b>--source</b> <u>asr://source</u> <b>--file</b> <u>file</u> [<u>options</u>]
     <b>asr</b> <b>imagescan</b> <b>--source</b> <u>image</u> [<u>options</u>]
     <b>asr</b> <b>help</b> | <b>version</b>

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
     <b>asr</b> efficiently copies disk images onto volumes, either directly or via a multicast network stream.
     <b>asr</b> can also accurately clone volumes without the use of an intermediate disk image.

     In its first form, <b>asr</b> copies <u>source</u> (usually a disk image, potentially on an HTTP server) to <u>target</u>.
     <u>source</u> can be specified using a path in the filesystem, or an http or https URL.  It can also be an
     asr:// URL to indicate a multicast source.  <b>asr</b> can also be invoked with its second form to act as a
     multicast server.  In its third form, <b>asr</b> will restore a multicast disk image to a file instead of disk
     volume.  In its fourth form, <b>asr</b> prepares a disk image to be restored efficiently, adding whole-volume
     and (optionally) file by file checksum information.  <b>help</b> and <b>version</b> provide usage and version infor-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mation,&nbsp;information,</font>
     mation, respectively.

     <u>source</u> and <u>target</u> can be /dev entries or volume mountpoints.  If restoring a multicast disk image to a
     file, <u>file</u> can be a path to a local file or directory. If the specified path is a file, the disk image
     is given the specified name. If a directory, the name of the disk image being multicast is used. When
     specifying <b>server,</b> <u>source</u> has to be a UDIF disk image. Restoring from a multicast stream is accom-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">plished&nbsp;accomplished</font>
     plished by passing a asr:// url as <u>source</u>.  By default, <b>asr</b> will restore in place, and will not bless
     (see <a href="bless.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/bless">bless(8)</a>) any folders.  If <b>--erase</b> is specified, any blessed folders on the source will also be
     blessed on the target.
           bless -info /Volumes/&lt;vol&gt;
     will display current blessed folders for the given volume.

     <b>asr</b> generally needs to be run as root (see <a href="sudo.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/sudo">sudo(8)</a>) in order to accomplish its tasks.

<b>VERBS</b>
     Each verb is listed with its description and individual arguments.

     <b>restore</b>    restores a disk image or volume to another volume (including a mounted disk image)

                <b>--source</b>       can be a disk image, /dev entry, or volume mountpoint. In the latter two
                               cases, the volume must be unmountable or mounted read-only in order for a
                               erase blockcopy to occur (thus, one cannot erase blockcopy the root filesys-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tem&nbsp;filesystem</font>
                               tem as the source, unless it happened to be mounted read-only).

                <b>--target</b>       can be a /dev entry, or volume mountpoint. Must be unmountable in order for a
                               erase blockcopy to occur.

                <b>--file</b>         when performing a multicast restore, <b>--file</b> can be specified instead of
                               <b>--target.</b> If the specified path is a file, the disk image is given the speci-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fied&nbsp;specified</font>
                               fied name. If a directory, the name of the disk image being multicast is
                               used.

                <b>--erase</b>        erase erases <u>target</u> and is required if a fast block-copy restore is desired.
                               By default <b>asr</b> will do a restore-in-place.  Duplicate items will not harm
                               target contents, but files will be replaced.  If <u>source</u> is a asr:// url for
                               restoring from a multicast stream, <b>--erase</b> must be passed (multicasting only
                               supports erase block-copy restores).  Passing <b>--erase</b> with <b>--file</b> indicates
                               any existing file should be overwritten when doing a multicast file copy.

                <b>--updatebless</b>  When performing a non-erase restore, <b>--updatebless</b> will update the appropri-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ate&nbsp;appropriate</font>
                               ate information required for the restored volume to boot if the source image
                               is bootable (equivalent to sudo bless --mount &lt;volume&gt; --setBoot).

                <b>--format</b> <u>HFS+</u> | <u>HFSX</u>
                               specifies the destination filesystem format, when <b>--erase</b> is also given. If
                               not specified, the destination will be formatted with the same filesystem
                               format as the source. If multicasting, the <b>--format</b> specified must be block
                               copy compatible with the <u>source</u>.  <b>--format</b> is ignored if <b>--erase</b> is not used.
                               Note: HFS Journaling is an attribute of the source image, and is not affected
                               by <b>--format</b>.

                <b>--noprompt</b>     suppresses the prompt which usually occurs before <u>target</u> is erased.
                               <a href="newfs_hfs.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/newfs_hfs">newfs_hfs(8)</a> will be called on <u>target</u> and once you start writing new data,
                               there isn't much hope for recovery.  You have been warned.

                <b>--timeout</b> <u>num</u>  specifies <u>num</u> seconds that a multicast client should wait when no payload
                               data has been received over a multicast stream before exiting, allowing the
                               client to stop in case of server failure/stoppage.  It defaults to 0 (e.g.
                               never time out).

                <b>--puppetstrings</b>
                               provide progress output that is easy for another program to parse.  Any pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">gram&nbsp;program</font>
                               gram trying to interpret <b>asr</b>'s progress should use <b>--puppetstrings</b>.

                <b>--noverify</b>     skips the verification steps normally taken to ensure that a volume has been
                               properly restored.  <b>--noverify</b> allows images which have not been scanned to
                               be restored.  Skipping verification is dangerous for a number of reasons and
                               should never be used in production systems.

                <b>--disableOwners</b>
                               prevents the default owner-enabling behavior for <u>source</u> and <u>target</u>.  Enabling
                               owners is usually very important for accurate file-by-file copying.  In
                               block-copy restore mode, <b>--disableOwners</b> has no effect.

                <b>--wrapper</b>      forces an HFS wrapper to be created on the target volume if the <b>--erase</b>
                               option is used.  Normally the creation of a wrapper depends on certain
                               filesystem variables.  <b>--wrapper</b> is ignored if <b>--erase</b> is not used.

                <b>--nowrapper</b>    forces an HFS wrapper to not be created on the target volume if the <b>--erase</b>
                               option is used.  Normally the creation of a wrapper depends on certain
                               filesystem variables.  <b>--nowrapper</b> is ignored if <b>--erase</b> is not used.

     <b>server</b>     multicasts <u>source</u> over the network. Requires <b>--erase</b> be passed in by clients (multicasting
                only supports erase block-copy restores).

                <b>--source</b>   <u>source</u> has to be a UDIF disk image. A path to a disk image on a local/remote vol-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ume&nbsp;volume</font>
                           ume can be passed in, or a <a href="http://">http://</a> url to a disk image that is accessible via a
                           web server.

                <b>--interface</b>
                           the network interface to be used for multicasting (e.g. en0) instead of the
                           default network interface.

                <b>--config</b>   <b>server</b> requires a configuration file to be passed, in standard property list for-
                           mat.  The following keys/options configure the various parameters for multicast
                           operation.

                <u>Required</u>

                Data Rate              this is the desired data rate in bytes per second.  On average, the
                                       stream will go slightly slower than this speed, but will never exceed
                                       it.  It's a number in the plist (-int when set with <a href="../man1/defaults.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/defaults">defaults(1)</a>).

                                       Note: The performance/reliability of the networking infrastructure
                                       being multicast on is an important factor in determining what data
                                       rate can be supported. Excessive/bursty packet loss for a given data
                                       rate could be due to an inability of the server/client to be able to
                                       send/receive multicast data at that rate, but it's equally important
                                       to verify that the network infrastructure can support multicasting at
                                       the requested rate.

                Multicast Address      this is the Multicast address for the data stream. It's a string in
                                       the plist.

                <u>Optional</u>

                Client Data Rate       this is the rate the slowest client can write data to its <u>target</u> in
                                       bytes per second.  if <b>asr</b> misses data on the first pass (x's during
                                       progress) and slowing the Data Rate doesn't resolve it, setting the
                                       Client Data Rate will dynamically regulate the speed of the multicast
                                       stream to allow clients more time to write the data. It's a number in
                                       the plist (-int when set with <a href="../man1/defaults.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/defaults">defaults(1)</a>).

                DNS Service Discovery  whether the server should be advertised via DNS Service Discovery,
                                       a.k.a. Bonjour (tm).  It defaults to true.  It's a boolean in the
                                       plist (-bool when set with <a href="../man1/defaults.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/defaults">defaults(1)</a>).

                Loop Suspend           a limit of the number of times to multicast the image file when no
                                       clients have started a restore operation. Once exceeded, the server
                                       will stop the stream and wait for new clients before multicasting the
                                       image file. It defaults to 0 (e.g. never stop multicasting once a
                                       client starts the stream), and should not be set to &lt;2.  It's a num-
                                       ber in the plist (-int when set with <a href="../man1/defaults.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/defaults">defaults(1)</a>).

                Multicast TTL          the time to live on the multicast packets (for multicasting through
                                       routers). It defaults to 3.  It cannot be set to 0, and should not be
                                       set to 1 (otherwise, it could adversely affect some network routers).
                                       It's a number in the plist (-int when set with <a href="../man1/defaults.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/defaults">defaults(1)</a>).

                Port                   the port of initial client-server handshake, version checks, multi-
                                       cast restore metadata, and stream data.  It defaults to 7800.  This
                                       should only be included/modified if the default port cannot be used.
                                       It's a number in the plist (-int when set with <a href="../man1/defaults.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/defaults">defaults(1)</a>).

     <b>imagescan</b>  calculate checksums of the data in the provided image and store them in the image.  These
                checksums are used to ensure proper restores.  Also determines if the disk image is in order
                for multicasting, and rewrites the file in order if not.  If the image has to be reordered,
                it will require free disk space equal to the size of the disk image being scanned.

                <b>--filechecksum</b>
                              will calculate/store checksum information required to perform file copy
                              restores.  <b>--filechecksum</b> can take a significant amount of time (depending on
                              the number of files in the image), and will require the user to invoke <b>asr</b> as
                              root. (see <a href="sudo.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/sudo">sudo(8)</a> ). Off by default. Note: without file checksums, erase
                              restores that would degrade from block copy to file copy will instead fail.

                <b>--nostream</b>    bypasses the check/reordering of a disk image file for multicasting. Off by
                              default.  Disk images will be reordered for multicasting.

<b>BUFFERING</b>
     The following options control how <b>asr</b> uses memory.  These options can have a significant impact on per-
     formance.  <b>asr</b> is optimized for copying between devices (different disk drives, from a network volume
     to a local disk, etc).  As such, <b>asr</b> defaults to using eight one megabyte buffers.  These buffers are
     wired down (occupying physical memory).  For partition to partition copies on the same device, one
     large buffer (e.g. 32 MB) is much faster than the default eight medium sized ones. For multicast, 4
     256k buffers are the default.  Custom buffering for multicast operation is not recommended.

     <b>--csumbuffers</b> and <b>--csumbuffersize</b> allow a different buffer configuration for checksumming operations.
     One checksum buffer offers the best performance.  The default is 1 1MB buffer. Custom checksum buffer-
     ing is not recommended.

     Like <a href="mkfile.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/mkfile">mkfile(8)</a>, <u>size</u> defaults to bytes but can be followed by a multiplier character (e.g. 'm').

     <b>--buffers</b> <u>num</u>
                 specifies that <u>num</u> buffers should be used.

     <b>--buffersize</b> <u>size</u>
                 specifies the size of each buffer.

     <b>--csumbuffers</b> <u>num</u>
                 specifies that <u>num</u> buffers should be used for checksumming operations (which only affect
                 the target).  Custom checksum buffering is not recommended.

     <b>--csumbuffersize</b> <u>size</u>
                 specifies the size of each buffer used for checksumming.  Custom checksum buffering is not
                 recommended.

<b>OTHER</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
     <b>--verbose</b>   enables verbose progress and error messages.
     <b>--debug</b>     enables other progress and error messages.

<b>EXAMPLES</b>
     <u>Volume</u> <u>cloning:</u>
           sudo asr restore --source /Volumes/Classic --target /Volumes/install

     <u>Restoring:</u>
           sudo asr restore -s &lt;compressedimage&gt; -t &lt;targetvol&gt; --erase

     Will erase the target and potentially do a block copy restore.

     <u>Multicast</u> <u>server:</u>
           asr server --source &lt;compressedimage&gt; --config &lt;configuration.plist&gt;

     Will start up a multicast server for the specified image, using the parameters in the configura-
     tion.plist. The image will not start multicasting on the network until a client attempts to start a
     restore. The server will continue to multicast the image until the process is terminated.

     <u>An</u> <u>example</u> <u>multicast</u> <u>configuration</u> <u>file:</u>
           defaults write /tmp/streamconfig "Data Rate" -int 6000000
           defaults write /tmp/streamconfig "Multicast Address" &lt;mcastaddr&gt;
           (will create the file /tmp/streamconfig.plist)
           &lt;mcastaddr&gt; should be appropriate for your network infrastructure and policy, usually from a
           range assigned by your network administrator.

     <u>Multicast</u> <u>client</u>
           sudo asr restore --source asr://&lt;hostname&gt; --target &lt;targetvol&gt; --erase

     <u>Multicast</u> <u>client</u> <u>restoring</u> <u>to</u> <u>a</u> <u>file</u>
           sudo asr restore --source asr://&lt;hostname&gt; --file &lt;file&gt; --erase
     Will receive the multicast stream from &lt;hostname&gt; and save it to a file. If &lt;file&gt; is a directory, the
     image of the streamed disk image will be used the save the file. --erase causes any existing file with
     the same name to be overwritten.

<b>HOW</b> <b>TO</b> <b>USE</b> <b>ASR</b>
     <b>asr</b> requires a properly created disk image for most efficient operation.  This image is most easily
     made with the Disk Utility application's "Image from Folder" function in OS X 10.3.  The Disk Copy from
     OS X 10.2.3 (v55.6) or later can also be used.

     Basic steps for imaging and restoring a volume:

     1.   Set up the source volume the way you want it.

     2.   Use Disk Utility's "Images -&gt; New -&gt; Image from Folder..." function and select the root of the
          volume.  Save the image as read-only or compressed.  "Images-&gt;New-&gt;Image from &lt;device&gt;" is not
          recommended on 10.3.x.

     3.   Scan the image with "Images -&gt; Scan Image for Restore."

     4.   Select an image or volume and click on the "Restore" tab.  Drag the source image and destination
          partition to the source and destination fields.  Check "Erase Destination" if you don't need the
          target's data.  Click Restore.

<b>HOW</b> <b>TO</b> <b>GET</b> <b>THE</b> <b>FASTEST</b> <b>RESTORES</b>
     If you are trying to understand file copy (slower) vs. block copy (fast): When you see "Restoring...",
     that means the source image volume is larger than the target volume or the volume geometry of the
     source image is stretchable to the target size, allowing a high speed block copy to occur.  As of OS X
     version 10.3, the geometry restrictions have been significantly relaxed such that stretchable source
     images are no longer required.

     When you see:
     Copying "/private/tmp/..." (/dev/diskMsN) to "&lt;target&gt;" (/dev/diskPsQ)...
     It means the above is not true, and <b>asr</b> has fallen back to a file copy operation.  <b>asr</b> will only block
     copy if the volume geometries support it AND you are doing an erase restore.  If you are restoring "in
     place," a file copy is always performed.

     If some target volumes restore quickly and others slowly, the source image was probably created without
     enough stretch (i.e. "image from device" instead of the "image from folder" recommended above).   For
     example, if the source was a 60 GB volume, the image will block restore on 60 GB and smaller volumes,
     but file copy on an 80 GB target under OS X version 10.2.

     By default (given source size &gt; 256 MB), Disk Utility will create an image of a volume that is block
     restorable to 256 GB.  If you want to create an image that will restore to a larger volume (say a 480
     GB RAID set), you will need to set some defaults before you have Disk Utility image the volume:

           defaults write com.apple.frameworks.diskimages \
                   hfsplus-stretch-parameters -dict \
                   hfsplus-stretch-threshold 524288 \
                   hfsplus-stretch-allocation-block-size 4096 \
                   hfsplus-stretch-allocation-file-size 16777216

     will make a 512 GB stretchable volume.  By default the hfsplus-stretch-allocation-file-size value is
     8388608 (8 MB).

     The size of the allocation file will increase image size, so it shouldn't be too big.  It has only been
     tested with sizes that are multiples of 4k.

     In addition to geometry requirements for supporting block copies, <b>asr</b> requires that the source and des-
     tination filesystems be compatible.  A non-HFS+ source can only be used to perform a file copy. HFS+
     can be used as the source of a block copy to either an HFS+ or HFSX destination.  However, an HFSX
     source can only be used to block copy to an HFSX destination.  This is because case collision of file
     names could occur when converting from an HFSX filesystem to HFS+.

<b>COMPATIBILITY</b>
     <b>asr</b> maintains compatibility with previous syntax, e.g.

     <b>asr</b> <b>-source</b> <u>source</u> <b>-target</b> <u>target</u> [<u>options</u>]
     <b>asr</b> <b>-source</b> <u>source</u> <b>-server</b> <u>configuration</u> [<u>options</u>]
     <b>asr</b> <b>-source</b> <u>asr://source</u> <b>-file</b> <u>file</u> [<u>options</u>]
     <b>asr</b> <b>-imagescan</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>image</u>
     <b>asr</b> <b>-h</b> | <b>-v</b>

     where <b>-source,</b> <b>-target,</b> and <b>-file</b> are equivalent to <b>--source,</b> <b>--target,</b> and <b>--file</b> respectively, and
     all [<u>options</u>] are equivalent to their -- descriptions.  <b>asr</b> <b>-server</b> <u>configuration</u> is superseded by <b>asr</b>
     <b>server</b> <b>--config</b> <u>configuration</u>.  The following deprecated options also remain:

     <b>-nocheck</b>   this option is deprecated, but remains for script compatibility.  Use <b>-noverify</b> instead.

     <b>-blockonly</b>
                this option is deprecated, but remains for script compatibility. On by default.  Note that
                if an image scanned with <b>-blockonly</b> cannot be block-copied to a particular <u>target</u> an error
                will occur, since the file-copy information was omitted.

     <b>Note:</b> Compatibility with previous syntax is not guaranteed in the next major OS release.

<b>ERRORS</b>
     <b>asr</b> will exit with status 1 if it cannot complete the requested operation.  A human readable error mes-
     sage will be printed in most cases.  Note that <b>asr</b> will mount the source image as part of verifying its
     geometry (see also <a href="umount.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/umount">umount(8)</a> and <a href="../man1/hdiutil.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/hdiutil">hdiutil(1)</a> should an image get stuck in this situation).  Using
     <a href="../man1/hdiutil.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/hdiutil">hdiutil(1)</a>, particularly the <b>imageinfo</b>, <b>verify</b>, and <b>attach</b> verbs, can help isolate various problems in
     accessing the image in question.

<b>HISTORY</b>
     Apple Software Restore got its start as a field service restoration tool used to reconfigure computers'
     software to 'factory' state.  It later became a more general software restore mechanism and software
     installation helper application for various Apple computer products.  ASR has been used in manufactur-
     ing processes and in shipping computers' System Software Installers.

     For Mac OS X, asr was rewritten as a command line tool for manufacturing and professional customers.
     <b>asr</b> is the backend for the Mac OS X Software Restore application that shipped on Macintosh computers as
     well as the Scan and Restore functionality in Disk Utility.

     Multicast support was added to allow multiple clients to erase restore an image from a multicast net-
     work stream.

     Per its history, most functionality in <b>asr</b> is limited to HFS+ volumes.
