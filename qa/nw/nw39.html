Under OT 1.1 it returns an <code>authNameErr</code>. What's going on?</p><p id = p4>A: In 1.0.8, Open Transport mapped name-to-addressand address-to-name translations into the same cache, and searchedthere whenever either a name-to-address or address-to-name mappingwas requested. Sounds good, yes? Problem is, it broke several serverload-sharing implementations that registered a service name as asingle alias for a list of CNAMEs, each of which pointed to a serverrunning the service. Under the former caching scheme, load-sharingutilizing reverse lookups didn't work for the Mac - we'd always windup with the same host name and hardware address for the originalalias.</p><p id=p4>As a result, OT 1.1 no longer caches address-to-name mappings (PTRrecords), nor does it search the name-to-address cache foraddress-to-name requests. (We also modified our treatment of CNAMErecords received, but that's irrelevant to your question.) Instead,it queries the configured domain name servers; apparently you got noauthoritative information from any of them (or, perhaps, weren'tusing them at all).</P><p id=p4>Strictly speaking, the behavior you are now seeing is more correctthan that seen before. A DNS A resource record maps a name to anaddress. In order to map an address to a name, a PTR record isrequired. The previous behavior of the MacTCP and Open TransportTCP/IP DNRs, treating the one as the mirror image of the other, wasincorrect and has been changed accordingly.</P><p id=p4>The Mac Hosts file historically did not support PTR records, anddoes not support PTR records now because in order to do so, we wouldhave to go back to caching those records, once again breaking theload-sharing schemes. The Hosts file supports only A (name toaddress), CNAME (alias to fully qualified domain name) and NS (domainname server's fully qualified domain name) resource records. If youneed a PTR mapping, you need to register it with your local DomainName server administrator, or maintain it within your own code fromthe results of your earlier name-to-address request.</P><p id=p4>It's unfortunate that this no longer works for you, but we'retrying to make Open Transport support the widest range of possibleclients. Occasionally those clients' needs conflict with each other,and then we have to make choices. When we do so, we try to make thechoice that is more technically correct, and this, unfortunately, wassuch a choice.</P></td></tr></table></center><!-- end_content --><!-- begin_date --><H4 ALIGN=center>[Sep 27 1996]</H4><!-- end_date --><!-- begin_footer_information -->	<table width="680" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
