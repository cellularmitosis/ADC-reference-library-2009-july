JAWTExample 1.0
8/27/2003

This sample project demonstrates how to use the new JAWT structs included with Java 1.4.1 Update 1.  Note that 1.4.1 Update 1 is *REQUIRED* for this sample to work; it will not work with the initial Java 1.4.1 release, nor with Java 1.3.1.  It is therefore important to remember to use the "JVMVersion" Info.plist key apporpriately for double-clickable Java apps that will use JAWT.  See the following documents for more on the "JVMVersion" key and using Info.plist in Java applications:

The project was built with ProjectBuilder 2.1 (December 2002 Tools) on Mac OS X 10.2.6.  It has also been tested with XCode under Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther).  Please send feedback to DTS at the address below.
