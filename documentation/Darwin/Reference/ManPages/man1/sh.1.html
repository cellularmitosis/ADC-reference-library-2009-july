<b>NAME</b>
       bash - GNU Bourne-Again SHell

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>bash</b> [options] [file]

<b>COPYRIGHT</b>
       Bash is Copyright (C) 1989-2005 by the Free Software Foundation, Inc.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       <b>Bash</b>  is  an <b>sh</b>-compatible command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard
       input or from a file.  <b>Bash</b> also incorporates useful features from the <u>Korn</u> and  <u>C</u>  shells  (<b>ksh</b>  and
       <b>csh</b>).

       <b>Bash</b>  is  intended  to  be a conformant implementation of the Shell and Utilities portion of the IEEE
       POSIX specification (IEEE Standard 1003.1).   <b>Bash</b>  can  be  configured  to  be  POSIX-conformant  by
       default.

<b>OPTIONS</b>
       In  addition  to  the single-character shell options documented in the description of the <b>set</b> builtin
       command, <b>bash</b> interprets the following options when it is invoked:

       <b>-c</b> <u>string</u> If the <b>-c</b> option is present, then commands are read from <u>string</u>.  If  there  are  arguments
                 after the <u>string</u>, they are assigned to the positional parameters, starting with <b>$0</b>.
       <b>-i</b>        If the <b>-i</b> option is present, the shell is <u>interactive</u>.
       <b>-l</b>        Make <b>bash</b> act as if it had been invoked as a login shell (see <b>INVOCATION</b> below).
       <b>-r</b>        If the <b>-r</b> option is present, the shell becomes <u>restricted</u> (see <b>RESTRICTED</b> <b>SHELL</b> below).
       <b>-s</b>        If  the  <b>-s</b> option is present, or if no arguments remain after option processing, then com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mands&nbsp;commands</font>
                 mands are read from the standard input.  This option allows the positional parameters to be
                 set when invoking an interactive shell.
       <b>-D</b>        A list of all double-quoted strings preceded by <b>$</b> is printed on the standard output.  These
                 are the strings that are subject to language translation when the current locale is  not  <b>C</b>
                 or <b>POSIX</b>.  This implies the <b>-n</b> option; no commands will be executed.
       <b>[-+]O</b> <b>[</b><u>shopt</u><b>_</b><u>option</u><b>]</b>
                 <u>shopt</u><b>_</b><u>option</u>  is  one of the shell options accepted by the <b>shopt</b> builtin (see <b>SHELL</b> <b>BUILTIN</b>
                 <b>COMMANDS</b> below).  If <u>shopt</u><b>_</b><u>option</u> is present, <b>-O</b> sets the value of that option;  <b>+O</b>  unsets
                 it.  If <u>shopt</u><b>_</b><u>option</u> is not supplied, the names and values of the shell options accepted by
                 <b>shopt</b> are printed on the standard output.  If the invocation option is <b>+O</b>,  the  output  is
                 displayed in a format that may be reused as input.
       <b>--</b>        A  <b>--</b>  signals  the  end  of options and disables further option processing.  Any arguments
                 after the <b>--</b> are treated as filenames and arguments.  An argument of <b>-</b> is equivalent to <b>--</b>.

       <b>Bash</b>  also  interprets a number of multi-character options.  These options must appear on the command
       line before the single-character options to be recognized.

       <b>--debugger</b>
              Arrange for the debugger profile to be executed before the shell starts.   Turns  on  extended
              debugging  mode  (see  the  description of the <b>extdebug</b> option to the <b>shopt</b> builtin below) and
              shell function tracing (see the description of the <b>-o</b> <b>functrace</b>  option  to  the  <b>set</b>  builtin
              below).
       <b>--dump-po-strings</b>
              Equivalent to <b>-D</b>, but the output is in the GNU <u>gettext</u> <b>po</b> (portable object) file format.
       <b>--dump-strings</b>
              Equivalent to <b>-D</b>.
       <b>--help</b> Display a usage message on standard output and exit successfully.
       <b>--init-file</b> <u>file</u>
       <b>--rcfile</b> <u>file</u>
              Execute  commands  from <u>file</u> instead of the standard personal initialization file <u>~/.bashrc</u> if
              the shell is interactive (see <b>INVOCATION</b> below).

       <b>--login</b>
              Equivalent to <b>-l</b>.

       <b>--noediting</b>
              Do not use the GNU <b>readline</b> library to read command lines when the shell is interactive.

       <b>--noprofile</b>
              Do not read either the system-wide startup file <u>/etc/profile</u> or any of the  personal  initial-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ization&nbsp;initialization</font>
              ization  files  <u>~/.bash</u><b>_</b><u>profile</u>,  <u>~/.bash</u><b>_</b><u>login</u>,  or <u>~/.profile</u>.  By default, <b>bash</b> reads these
              files when it is invoked as a login shell (see <b>INVOCATION</b> below).

       <b>--norc</b> Do not read and execute the personal initialization file <u>~/.bashrc</u> if the  shell  is  interac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tive.&nbsp;interactive.</font>
              tive.  This option is on by default if the shell is invoked as <b>sh</b>.

       <b>--posix</b>
              Change  the  behavior  of  <b>bash</b> where the default operation differs from the POSIX standard to
              match the standard (<u>posix</u> <u>mode</u>).

       <b>--restricted</b>
              The shell becomes restricted (see <b>RESTRICTED</b> <b>SHELL</b> below).

       <b>--verbose</b>
              Equivalent to  <b>-v</b>.

       <b>--version</b>
              Show version information for this instance of <b>bash</b> on the standard output  and  exit  success-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fully.&nbsp;successfully.</font>
              fully.

<b>ARGUMENTS</b>
       If  arguments remain after option processing, and neither the <b>-c</b> nor the <b>-s</b> option has been supplied,
       the first argument is assumed to be the name of a file containing shell commands.  If <b>bash</b> is invoked
       in  this  fashion,  <b>$0</b>  is  set to the name of the file, and the positional parameters are set to the
       remaining arguments.  <b>Bash</b> reads and executes commands from this file, then exits.  <b>Bash</b>'s exit  sta-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tus&nbsp;status</font>
       tus  is the exit status of the last command executed in the script.  If no commands are executed, the
       exit status is 0.  An attempt is first made to open the file in the current  directory,  and,  if  no
       file is found, then the shell searches the directories in <b>PATH</b> for the script.

<b>INVOCATION</b>
       A  <u>login</u>  <u>shell</u> is one whose first character of argument zero is a <b>-</b>, or one started with the <b>--login</b>
       option.

       An <u>interactive</u> shell is one started without non-option arguments and  without  the  <b>-c</b>  option  whose
       standard input and error are both connected to terminals (as determined by <a href="../man3/isatty.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/isatty"><u>isatty</u>(3)</a>), or one started
       with the <b>-i</b> option.  <b>PS1</b> is set and <b>$-</b> includes <b>i</b> if <b>bash</b> is interactive, allowing a shell script  or
       a startup file to test this state.

       The following paragraphs describe how <b>bash</b> executes its startup files.  If any of the files exist but
       cannot be read, <b>bash</b> reports an error.  Tildes are expanded in file names as  described  below  under
       <b>Tilde</b> <b>Expansion</b> in the <b>EXPANSION</b> section.

       When  <b>bash</b>  is  invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive shell with the <b>--login</b>
       option, it first reads and executes commands from the file <u>/etc/profile</u>, if that file exists.   After
       reading  that  file,  it looks for <u>~/.bash</u><b>_</b><u>profile</u>, <u>~/.bash</u><b>_</b><u>login</u>, and <u>~/.profile</u>, in that order, and
       reads and executes commands from the first one that exists and is readable.  The  <b>--noprofile</b>  option
       may be used when the shell is started to inhibit this behavior.

       When  a  login  shell  exits,  <b>bash</b>  reads  and executes commands from the file <u>~/.bash</u><b>_</b><u>logout</u>, if it
       exists.

       When an interactive shell that is not a login shell is started, <b>bash</b> reads and executes commands from
       <u>~/.bashrc</u>, if that file exists.  This may be inhibited by using the <b>--norc</b> option.  The <b>--rcfile</b> <u>file</u>
       option will force <b>bash</b> to read and execute commands from <u>file</u> instead of <u>~/.bashrc</u>.

       When <b>bash</b> is started non-interactively, to run a shell script, for example, it looks for the variable
       <b>BASH_ENV</b>  in  the  environment, expands its value if it appears there, and uses the expanded value as
       the name of a file to read and execute.  <b>Bash</b> behaves as if the following command were executed:
              if [ -n "$BASH_ENV" ]; then . "$BASH_ENV"; fi
       but the value of the <b>PATH</b> variable is not used to search for the file name.

       If <b>bash</b> is invoked with the name <b>sh</b>, it tries to mimic the startup behavior of historical versions of
       <b>sh</b> as closely as possible, while conforming to the POSIX standard as well.  When invoked as an inter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">active&nbsp;interactive</font>
       active login shell, or a non-interactive shell with the <b>--login</b> option, it first attempts to read and
       execute commands from <u>/etc/profile</u> and <u>~/.profile</u>, in that order.  The <b>--noprofile</b> option may be used
       to inhibit this behavior.  When invoked as an interactive shell with the name <b>sh</b>, <b>bash</b> looks for  the
       variable  <b>ENV</b>,  expands its value if it is defined, and uses the expanded value as the name of a file
       to read and execute.  Since a shell invoked as <b>sh</b> does not attempt to read and execute commands  from
       any other startup files, the <b>--rcfile</b> option has no effect.  A non-interactive shell invoked with the
       name <b>sh</b> does not attempt to read any other startup files.  When invoked as <b>sh</b>, <b>bash</b> enters <u>posix</u> mode
       after the startup files are read.

       When  <b>bash</b>  is  started  in <u>posix</u> mode, as with the <b>--posix</b> command line option, it follows the POSIX
       standard for startup files.  In this mode, interactive shells expand the <b>ENV</b>  variable  and  commands
       are  read  and  executed  from the file whose name is the expanded value.  No other startup files are
       read.

       <b>Bash</b> attempts to determine when it is being run by the remote shell daemon, usually  <u>rshd</u>.   If  <b>bash</b>
       determines  it  is  being  run  by  <u>rshd</u>, it reads and executes commands from <u>~/.bashrc</u>, if that file
       exists and is readable.  It will not do this if invoked as <b>sh</b>.  The <b>--norc</b>  option  may  be  used  to
       inhibit this behavior, and the <b>--rcfile</b> option may be used to force another file to be read, but <u>rshd</u>
       does not generally invoke the shell with those options or allow them to be specified.

       If the shell is started with the effective user (group) id not equal to the real user (group) id, and
       the  <b>-p</b> option is not supplied, no startup files are read, shell functions are not inherited from the
       environment, the <b>SHELLOPTS</b> variable, if it appears in the environment, is ignored, and the  effective
       user id is set to the real user id.  If the <b>-p</b> option is supplied at invocation, the startup behavior
       is the same, but the effective user id is not reset.

<b>DEFINITIONS</b>
       The following definitions are used throughout the rest of this document.
       <b>blank</b>  A space or tab.
       <b>word</b>   A sequence of characters considered as a single unit by the shell.  Also known as a <b>token</b>.
       <b>name</b>   A <u>word</u> consisting only of alphanumeric characters  and  underscores,  and  beginning  with  an
              alphabetic character or an underscore.  Also referred to as an <b>identifier</b>.
       <b>metacharacter</b>
              A character that, when unquoted, separates words.  One of the following:
              <b>|</b>  <b>&amp;</b> <b>;</b> <b>(</b> <b>)</b> <b>&lt;</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>space</b> <b>tab</b>
       <b>control</b> <b>operator</b>
              A <u>token</u> that performs a control function.  It is one of the following symbols:
              <b>||</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <b>;</b> <b>;;</b> <b>(</b> <b>)</b> <b>|</b> <b>&lt;newline&gt;</b>

<b>RESERVED</b> <b>WORDS</b>
       <u>Reserved</u>  <u>words</u>  are  words that have a special meaning to the shell.  The following words are recog-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nized&nbsp;recognized</font>
       nized as reserved when unquoted and either the first word of a  simple  command  (see  <b>SHELL</b>  <b>GRAMMAR</b>
       below) or the third word of a <b>case</b> or <b>for</b> command:

       <b>!</b> <b>case</b>  <b>do</b> <b>done</b> <b>elif</b> <b>else</b> <b>esac</b> <b>fi</b> <b>for</b> <b>function</b> <b>if</b> <b>in</b> <b>select</b> <b>then</b> <b>until</b> <b>while</b> <b>{</b> <b>}</b> <b>time</b> <b>[[</b> <b>]]</b>

<b>SHELL</b> <b>GRAMMAR</b>
   <b>Simple</b> <b>Commands</b>
       A <u>simple</u> <u>command</u> is a sequence of optional variable assignments followed by <b>blank</b>-separated words and
       redirections, and terminated by a <u>control</u> <u>operator</u>.  The first word specifies the command to be  exe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cuted,&nbsp;executed,</font>
       cuted,  and  is  passed as argument zero.  The remaining words are passed as arguments to the invoked
       command.

       The return value of a <u>simple</u> <u>command</u> is its exit status, or 128+<u>n</u> if the  command  is  terminated  by
       signal <u>n</u>.

   <b>Pipelines</b>
       A  <u>pipeline</u>  is  a  sequence  of one or more commands separated by the character <b>|</b>.  The format for a
       pipeline is:

              [<b>time</b> [<b>-p</b>]] [ ! ] <u>command</u> [ <b>|</b> <u>command2</u> ... ]

       The standard output of <u>command</u> is connected via a pipe to the standard input of <u>command2</u>.  This  con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nection&nbsp;connection</font>
       nection is performed before any redirections specified by the command (see <b>REDIRECTION</b> below).

       The return status of a pipeline is the exit status of the last command, unless the <b>pipefail</b> option is
       enabled.  If <b>pipefail</b> is enabled, the pipeline's return status is the value of the  last  (rightmost)
       command  to  exit with a non-zero status, or zero if all commands exit successfully.  If the reserved
       word <b>!</b>  precedes a pipeline, the exit status of that pipeline is the logical  negation  of  the  exit
       status  as  described  above.   The  shell waits for all commands in the pipeline to terminate before
       returning a value.

       If the <b>time</b> reserved word precedes a pipeline, the elapsed as well as user and system  time  consumed
       by  its execution are reported when the pipeline terminates.  The <b>-p</b> option changes the output format
       to that specified by POSIX.  The <b>TIMEFORMAT</b> variable may be set to a format string that specifies how
       the  timing  information should be displayed; see the description of <b>TIMEFORMAT</b> under <b>Shell</b> <b>Variables</b>
       below.

       Each command in a pipeline is executed as a separate process (i.e., in a subshell).

   <b>Lists</b>
       A <u>list</u> is a sequence of one or more pipelines separated by one of the operators <b>;</b>, <b>&amp;</b>, <b>&amp;&amp;</b>, or <b>||</b>,  and
       optionally terminated by one of <b>;</b>, <b>&amp;</b>, or <b>&lt;newline&gt;</b>.

       Of  these  list  operators,  <b>&amp;&amp;</b>  and  <b>||</b> have equal precedence, followed by <b>;</b> and <b>&amp;,</b> which have equal
       precedence.

       A sequence of one or more newlines may appear in a <u>list</u> instead of a semicolon to delimit commands.

       If a command is terminated by the control operator <b>&amp;</b>, the shell executes the  command  in  the  <u>back</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ground&nbsp;background</font>
       <u>ground</u> in a subshell.  The shell does not wait for the command to finish, and the return status is 0.
       Commands separated by a <b>;</b> are executed sequentially; the shell waits for each command to terminate in
       turn.  The return status is the exit status of the last command executed.

       The  control  operators  <b>&amp;&amp;</b>  and <b>||</b> denote AND lists and OR lists, respectively.  An AND list has the
       form

              <u>command1</u> <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <u>command2</u>

       <u>command2</u> is executed if, and only if, <u>command1</u> returns an exit status of zero.

       An OR list has the form

              <u>command1</u> <b>||</b> <u>command2</u>


       <u>command2</u> is executed if and only if <u>command1</u> returns a non-zero exit status.  The  return  status  of
       AND and OR lists is the exit status of the last command executed in the list.

   <b>Compound</b> <b>Commands</b>
       A <u>compound</u> <u>command</u> is one of the following:

       (<u>list</u>) <u>list</u>  is  executed in a subshell environment (see <b>COMMAND</b> <b>EXECUTION</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b> below).  Vari-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able&nbsp;Variable</font>
              able assignments and builtin commands that affect the shell's environment  do  not  remain  in
              effect after the command completes.  The return status is the exit status of <u>list</u>.

       { <u>list</u>; }
              <u>list</u> is simply executed in the current shell environment.  <u>list</u> must be terminated with a new-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">line&nbsp;newline</font>
              line or semicolon.  This is known as a <u>group</u> <u>command</u>.  The return status is the exit status of
              <u>list</u>.   Note that unlike the metacharacters <b>(</b> and <b>)</b>, <b>{</b> and <b>}</b> are <u>reserved</u> <u>words</u> and must occur
              where a reserved word is permitted to be recognized.  Since they do not cause  a  word  break,
              they must be separated from <u>list</u> by whitespace.

       ((<u>expression</u>))
              The  <u>expression</u>  is  evaluated according to the rules described below under <b>ARITHMETIC</b> <b>EVALUA</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">TION.&nbsp;EVALUATION.</font>
              <b>TION</b>.  If the value of the expression is non-zero, the  return  status  is  0;  otherwise  the
              return status is 1.  This is exactly equivalent to <b>let</b> <b>"</b><u>expression</u><b>"</b>.

       <b>[[</b> <u>expression</u> <b>]]</b>
              Return  a  status  of 0 or 1 depending on the evaluation of the conditional expression <u>expres</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion.&nbsp;expression.</font>
              <u>sion</u>.  Expressions are composed of the primaries described  below  under  <b>CONDITIONAL</b>  <b>EXPRES</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">SIONS.&nbsp;EXPRESSIONS.</font>
              <b>SIONS</b>.   Word  splitting  and pathname expansion are not performed on the words between the <b>[[</b>
              and <b>]]</b>; tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, arithmetic expansion, command  sub-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">stitution,&nbsp;substitution,</font>
              stitution,  process substitution, and quote removal are performed.  Conditional operators such
              as <b>-f</b> must be unquoted to be recognized as primaries.

              When the <b>==</b> and <b>!=</b> operators are used, the string to the right of the operator is considered a
              pattern  and  matched  according  to the rules described below under <b>Pattern</b> <b>Matching</b>.  If the
              shell option <b>nocasematch</b> is enabled, the match is performed without  regard  to  the  case  of
              alphabetic  characters.   The  return  value is 0 if the string matches (<b>==</b>) or does not match
              (<b>!=</b>) the pattern, and 1 otherwise.  Any part of the pattern may be quoted to force  it  to  be
              matched as a string.

              An  additional binary operator, <b>=~</b>, is available, with the same precedence as <b>==</b> and <b>!=</b>.  When
              it is used, the string to the right of the operator is considered an extended regular  expres-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion&nbsp;expression</font>
              sion  and  matched  accordingly (as in <a href="../man3/regex.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/regex"><u>regex</u>(3)</a>).  The return value is 0 if the string matches
              the pattern, and 1 otherwise.  If the regular expression is syntactically incorrect, the  con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ditional&nbsp;conditional</font>
              ditional  expression's  return  value  is  2.  If the shell option <b>nocasematch</b> is enabled, the
              match is performed without regard to the case of alphabetic characters.  Substrings matched by
              parenthesized  subexpressions  within  the  regular expression are saved in the array variable
              <b>BASH_REMATCH</b>.  The element of <b>BASH_REMATCH</b> with index 0 is the portion of the string  matching
              the entire regular expression.  The element of <b>BASH_REMATCH</b> with index <u>n</u> is the portion of the
              string matching the <u>n</u>th parenthesized subexpression.

              Expressions may be combined using the following  operators,  listed  in  decreasing  order  of
              precedence:

              <b>(</b> <u>expression</u> <b>)</b>
                     Returns the value of <u>expression</u>.  This may be used to override the normal precedence of
                     operators.
              <b>!</b> <u>expression</u>
                     True if <u>expression</u> is false.
              <u>expression1</u> <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <u>expression2</u>
                     True if both <u>expression1</u> and <u>expression2</u> are true.
              <u>expression1</u> <b>||</b> <u>expression2</u>
                     True if either <u>expression1</u> or <u>expression2</u> is true.

              The <b>&amp;&amp;</b> and <b>||</b> operators do not evaluate <u>expression2</u> if the value of <u>expression1</u> is  sufficient
              to determine the return value of the entire conditional expression.

       <b>for</b> <u>name</u> [ <b>in</b> <u>word</u> ] ; <b>do</b> <u>list</u> ; <b>done</b>
              The  list of words following <b>in</b> is expanded, generating a list of items.  The variable <u>name</u> is
              set to each element of this list in turn, and <u>list</u> is executed each time.  If the <b>in</b>  <u>word</u>  is
              omitted,  the  <b>for</b>  command  executes <u>list</u> once for each positional parameter that is set (see
              <b>PARAMETERS</b> below).  The return status is the exit status of the last  command  that  executes.
              If the expansion of the items following <b>in</b> results in an empty list, no commands are executed,
              and the return status is 0.

       <b>for</b> (( <u>expr1</u> ; <u>expr2</u> ; <u>expr3</u> )) ; <b>do</b> <u>list</u> ; <b>done</b>
              First, the arithmetic expression <u>expr1</u> is evaluated according to  the  rules  described  below
              under  <b>ARITHMETIC</b>  <b>EVALUATION</b>.   The  arithmetic expression <u>expr2</u> is then evaluated repeatedly
              until it evaluates to zero.  Each time <u>expr2</u> evaluates to a non-zero value, <u>list</u>  is  executed
              and the arithmetic expression <u>expr3</u> is evaluated.  If any expression is omitted, it behaves as
              if it evaluates to 1.  The return value is the exit status of the last command in <u>list</u> that is
              executed, or false if any of the expressions is invalid.

       <b>select</b> <u>name</u> [ <b>in</b> <u>word</u> ] ; <b>do</b> <u>list</u> ; <b>done</b>
              The  list  of words following <b>in</b> is expanded, generating a list of items.  The set of expanded
              words is printed on the standard error, each preceded by a number.  If the <b>in</b> <u>word</u> is omitted,
              the  positional  parameters  are  printed (see <b>PARAMETERS</b> below).  The <b>PS3</b> prompt is then dis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">played&nbsp;displayed</font>
              played and a line read from the standard input.  If the line consists of a number  correspond-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;corresponding</font>
              ing to one of the displayed words, then the value of <u>name</u> is set to that word.  If the line is
              empty, the words and prompt are displayed again.  If EOF is read, the command completes.   Any
              other value read causes <u>name</u> to be set to null.  The line read is saved in the variable <b>REPLY</b>.
              The <u>list</u> is executed after each selection until a <b>break</b> command is executed.  The exit  status
              of <b>select</b> is the exit status of the last command executed in <u>list</u>, or zero if no commands were
              executed.

       <b>case</b> <u>word</u> <b>in</b> [ [(] <u>pattern</u> [ <b>|</b> <u>pattern</u> ] ... ) <u>list</u> ;; ] ... <b>esac</b>
              A <b>case</b> command first expands <u>word</u>, and tries to match it against each <u>pattern</u> in  turn,  using
              the same matching rules as for pathname expansion (see <b>Pathname</b> <b>Expansion</b> below).  The <u>word</u> is
              expanded using tilde expansion, parameter and  variable  expansion,  arithmetic  substitution,
              command  substitution,  process  substitution  and  quote  removal.   Each <u>pattern</u> examined is
              expanded using tilde expansion, parameter and  variable  expansion,  arithmetic  substitution,
              command  substitution,  and process substitution.  If the shell option <b>nocasematch</b> is enabled,
              the match is performed without regard to the case of alphabetic characters.  When a  match  is
              found,  the  corresponding <u>list</u> is executed.  After the first match, no subsequent matches are
              attempted.  The exit status is zero if no pattern matches.  Otherwise, it is the  exit  status
              of the last command executed in <u>list</u>.

       <b>if</b> <u>list</u>; <b>then</b> <u>list;</u> [ <b>elif</b> <u>list</u>; <b>then</b> <u>list</u>; ] ... [ <b>else</b> <u>list</u>; ] <b>fi</b>
              The  <b>if</b>  <u>list</u> is executed.  If its exit status is zero, the <b>then</b> <u>list</u> is executed.  Otherwise,
              each <b>elif</b> <u>list</u> is executed in turn, and if its exit status is  zero,  the  corresponding  <b>then</b>
              <u>list</u> is executed and the command completes.  Otherwise, the <b>else</b> <u>list</u> is executed, if present.
              The exit status is the exit status of the last command  executed,  or  zero  if  no  condition
              tested true.

       <b>while</b> <u>list</u>; <b>do</b> <u>list</u>; <b>done</b>
       <b>until</b> <u>list</u>; <b>do</b> <u>list</u>; <b>done</b>
              The  <b>while</b>  command  continuously  executes  the  <b>do</b>  <u>list</u> as long as the last command in <u>list</u>
              returns an exit status of zero.  The <b>until</b> command is identical to the <b>while</b>  command,  except
              that  the test is negated; the <b>do</b> <u>list</u> is executed as long as the last command in <u>list</u> returns
              a non-zero exit status.  The exit status of the <b>while</b> and <b>until</b> commands is the exit status of
              the last <b>do</b> <u>list</u> command executed, or zero if none was executed.

   <b>Shell</b> <b>Function</b> <b>Definitions</b>
       A  shell  function  is an object that is called like a simple command and executes a compound command
       with a new set of positional parameters.  Shell functions are declared as follows:

       [ <b>function</b> ] <u>name</u> () <u>compound-command</u> [<u>redirection</u>]
              This defines a function named <u>name</u>.  The reserved word <b>function</b> is optional.  If the  <b>function</b>
              reserved word is supplied, the parentheses are optional.  The <u>body</u> of the function is the com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pound&nbsp;compound</font>
              pound command <u>compound-command</u> (see <b>Compound</b> <b>Commands</b> above).  That command is usually a  <u>list</u>
              of  commands  between  {  and  }, but may be any command listed under <b>Compound</b> <b>Commands</b> above.
              <u>compound-command</u> is executed whenever <u>name</u> is specified as the name of a simple command.   Any
              redirections  (see  <b>REDIRECTION</b> below) specified when a function is defined are performed when
              the function is executed.  The exit status of a function definition is zero  unless  a  syntax
              error  occurs  or  a  readonly function with the same name already exists.  When executed, the
              exit status of a function is the exit status of the last command executed in the  body.   (See
              <b>FUNCTIONS</b> below.)

<b>COMMENTS</b>
       In  a  non-interactive shell, or an interactive shell in which the <b>interactive_comments</b> option to the
       <b>shopt</b> builtin is enabled (see <b>SHELL</b> <b>BUILTIN</b> <b>COMMANDS</b> below), a word beginning with <b>#</b> causes that word
       and  all  remaining characters on that line to be ignored.  An interactive shell without the <b>interac</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tive_comments&nbsp;interactive_comments</font>
       <b>tive_comments</b> option enabled does not allow comments.   The  <b>interactive_comments</b>  option  is  on  by
       default in interactive shells.

<b>QUOTING</b>
       <u>Quoting</u>  is  used to remove the special meaning of certain characters or words to the shell.  Quoting
       can be used to disable special treatment for special characters, to prevent reserved words from being
       recognized as such, and to prevent parameter expansion.

       Each  of  the <u>metacharacters</u> listed above under <b>DEFINITIONS</b> has special meaning to the shell and must
       be quoted if it is to represent itself.

       When the command history expansion facilities are being used (see <b>HISTORY</b> <b>EXPANSION</b> below), the  <u>his</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tory&nbsp;history</font>
       <u>tory</u> <u>expansion</u> character, usually <b>!</b>, must be quoted to prevent history expansion.

       There are three quoting mechanisms: the <u>escape</u> <u>character</u>, single quotes, and double quotes.

       A non-quoted backslash (<b>\</b>) is the <u>escape</u> <u>character</u>.  It preserves the literal value of the next char-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">acter&nbsp;character</font>
       acter that follows, with the exception of &lt;newline&gt;.  If a <b>\&lt;</b>newline&gt; pair appears, and the backslash
       is  not  itself quoted, the <b>\&lt;</b>newline&gt; is treated as a line continuation (that is, it is removed from
       the input stream and effectively ignored).

       Enclosing characters in single quotes preserves the  literal  value  of  each  character  within  the
       quotes.  A single quote may not occur between single quotes, even when preceded by a backslash.

       Enclosing  characters  in  double  quotes  preserves  the  literal value of all characters within the
       quotes, with the exception of <b>$</b>, <b>`</b>, <b>\</b>, and, when history expansion is enabled, <b>!</b>.  The  characters  <b>$</b>
       and  <b>`</b>  retain their special meaning within double quotes.  The backslash retains its special meaning
       only when followed by one of the following characters: <b>$</b>, <b>`</b>, <b>"</b>, <b>\</b>, or <b>&lt;newline&gt;</b>.  A double quote  may
       be  quoted within double quotes by preceding it with a backslash.  If enabled, history expansion will
       be performed unless an <b>!</b>  appearing in double quotes is escaped using  a  backslash.   The  backslash
       preceding the <b>!</b>  is not removed.

       The special parameters <b>*</b> and <b>@</b> have special meaning when in double quotes (see <b>PARAMETERS</b> below).

       Words  of  the  form  <b>$</b>'<u>string</u>'  are  treated specially.  The word expands to <u>string</u>, with backslash-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">escaped&nbsp;backslashescaped</font>
       escaped characters replaced as specified by the ANSI C  standard.   Backslash  escape  sequences,  if
       present, are decoded as follows:
              <b>\a</b>     alert (bell)
              <b>\b</b>     backspace
              <b>\e</b>     an escape character
              <b>\f</b>     form feed
              <b>\n</b>     new line
              <b>\r</b>     carriage return
              <b>\t</b>     horizontal tab
              <b>\v</b>     vertical tab
              <b>\\</b>     backslash
              <b>\'</b>     single quote
              <b>\</b><u>nnn</u>   the eight-bit character whose value is the octal value <u>nnn</u> (one to three digits)
              <b>\x</b><u>HH</u>   the eight-bit character whose value is the hexadecimal value <u>HH</u> (one or two hex digits)
              <b>\c</b><u>x</u>    a control-<u>x</u> character

       The expanded result is single-quoted, as if the dollar sign had not been present.

       A double-quoted string preceded by a dollar sign (<b>$</b>) will cause the string to be translated according
       to  the  current  locale.   If  the current locale is <b>C</b> or <b>POSIX</b>, the dollar sign is ignored.  If the
       string is translated and replaced, the replacement is double-quoted.

<b>PARAMETERS</b>
       A <u>parameter</u> is an entity that stores values.  It can be a <u>name</u>, a number, or one of the special char-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">acters&nbsp;characters</font>
       acters  listed below under <b>Special</b> <b>Parameters</b>.  A <u>variable</u> is a parameter denoted by a <u>name</u>.  A vari-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able&nbsp;variable</font>
       able has a <u>value</u> and zero or more <u>attributes</u>.  Attributes are assigned using the <b>declare</b> builtin com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
       mand (see <b>declare</b> below in <b>SHELL</b> <b>BUILTIN</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>).

       A  parameter is set if it has been assigned a value.  The null string is a valid value.  Once a vari-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able&nbsp;variable</font>
       able is set, it may be unset only by using the <b>unset</b> builtin  command  (see  <b>SHELL</b>  <b>BUILTIN</b>  <b>COMMANDS</b>
       below).

       A <u>variable</u> may be assigned to by a statement of the form

              <u>name</u>=[<u>value</u>]

       If <u>value</u> is not given, the variable is assigned the null string.  All <u>values</u> undergo tilde expansion,
       parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal  (see
       <b>EXPANSION</b>  below).   If  the  variable  has  its <b>integer</b> attribute set, then <u>value</u> is evaluated as an
       arithmetic expression even if the $((...)) expansion is not used (see  <b>Arithmetic</b>  <b>Expansion</b>  below).
       Word  splitting is not performed, with the exception of <b>"$@"</b> as explained below under <b>Special</b> <b>Parame</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ters.&nbsp;Parameters.</font>
       <b>ters</b>.  Pathname expansion is not performed.  Assignment statements may also appear  as  arguments  to
       the <b>alias</b>, <b>declare</b>, <b>typeset</b>, <b>export</b>, <b>readonly</b>, and <b>local</b> builtin commands.

       In the context where an assignment statement is assigning a value to a shell variable or array index,
       the += operator can be used to append to or add to the variable's previous value.  When += is applied
       to  a  variable  for  which  the  integer attribute has been set, <u>value</u> is evaluated as an arithmetic
       expression and added to the variable's current value, which is also evaluated.  When += is applied to
       an array variable using compound assignment (see <b>Arrays</b> below), the variable's value is not unset (as
       it is when using =), and new values are appended to the array  beginning  at  one  greater  than  the
       array's  maximum  index.  When applied to a string-valued variable, <u>value</u> is expanded and appended to
       the variable's value.

   <b>Positional</b> <b>Parameters</b>
       A <u>positional</u> <u>parameter</u> is a parameter denoted by one or more digits, other than the single  digit  0.
       Positional  parameters  are  assigned from the shell's arguments when it is invoked, and may be reas-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">signed&nbsp;reassigned</font>
       signed using the <b>set</b> builtin command.  Positional parameters may not be assigned to  with  assignment
       statements.   The  positional  parameters  are temporarily replaced when a shell function is executed
       (see <b>FUNCTIONS</b> below).

       When a positional parameter consisting of more than a single digit is expanded, it must  be  enclosed
       in braces (see <b>EXPANSION</b> below).

   <b>Special</b> <b>Parameters</b>
       The  shell  treats several parameters specially.  These parameters may only be referenced; assignment
       to them is not allowed.
       <b>*</b>      Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one.  When  the  expansion  occurs  within
              double  quotes,  it expands to a single word with the value of each parameter separated by the
              first character of the <b>IFS</b> special variable.  That is,  "<b>$*</b>"  is  equivalent  to  "<b>$1</b><u>c</u><b>$2</b><u>c</u><b>...</b>",
              where <u>c</u> is the first character of the value of the <b>IFS</b> variable.  If <b>IFS</b> is unset, the parame-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ters&nbsp;parameters</font>
              ters are separated by spaces.  If <b>IFS</b> is null, the parameters are joined  without  intervening
              separators.
       <b>@</b>      Expands  to  the  positional  parameters, starting from one.  When the expansion occurs within
              double quotes, each parameter expands to a separate word.  That is, "<b>$@</b>" is equivalent to "<b>$1</b>"
              "<b>$2</b>"  ...   If  the  double-quoted  expansion occurs within a word, the expansion of the first
              parameter is joined with the beginning part of the original word, and  the  expansion  of  the
              last  parameter  is  joined  with the last part of the original word.  When there are no posi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tional&nbsp;positional</font>
              tional parameters, "<b>$@</b>" and <b>$@</b> expand to nothing (i.e., they are removed).
       <b>#</b>      Expands to the number of positional parameters in decimal.
       <b>?</b>      Expands to the status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline.
       <b>-</b>      Expands to the current option flags as specified upon invocation, by the <b>set</b> builtin  command,
              or those set by the shell itself (such as the <b>-i</b> option).
       <b>$</b>      Expands to the process ID of the shell.  In a () subshell, it expands to the process ID of the
              current shell, not the subshell.
       <b>!</b>      Expands to the process ID of the most recently executed background (asynchronous) command.
       <b>0</b>      Expands to the name of the shell or shell script.  This is set at  shell  initialization.   If
              <b>bash</b>  is  invoked  with  a  file  of commands, <b>$0</b> is set to the name of that file.  If <b>bash</b> is
              started with the <b>-c</b> option, then <b>$0</b> is set to the first argument after the string to  be  exe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cuted,&nbsp;executed,</font>
              cuted, if one is present.  Otherwise, it is set to the file name used to invoke <b>bash</b>, as given
              by argument zero.
       <b>_</b>      At shell startup, set to the absolute pathname used to invoke the shell or shell script  being
              executed  as  passed  in  the environment or argument list.  Subsequently, expands to the last
              argument to the previous command, after expansion.  Also set to  the  full  pathname  used  to
              invoke  each  command  executed  and placed in the environment exported to that command.  When
              checking mail, this parameter holds the name of the mail file currently being checked.

   <b>Shell</b> <b>Variables</b>
       The following variables are set by the shell:

       <b>BASH</b>   Expands to the full file name used to invoke this instance of <b>bash</b>.
       <b>BASH_ARGC</b>
              An array variable whose values are the number of parameters in each frame of the current  bash
              execution  call  stack.  The number of parameters to the current subroutine (shell function or
              script executed with <b>.</b> or <b>source</b>) is at the top of the stack.  When a subroutine is  executed,
              the  number of parameters passed is pushed onto <b>BASH_ARGC</b>.  The shell sets <b>BASH_ARGC</b> only when
              in extended debugging mode (see the description of the <b>extdebug</b> option to  the  <b>shopt</b>  builtin
              below)
       <b>BASH_ARGV</b>
              An  array  variable containing all of the parameters in the current bash execution call stack.
              The final parameter of the last subroutine call is at the top of the stack; the first  parame-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ter&nbsp;parameter</font>
              ter  of the initial call is at the bottom.  When a subroutine is executed, the parameters sup-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">plied&nbsp;supplied</font>
              plied are pushed onto <b>BASH_ARGV</b>.  The shell sets <b>BASH_ARGV</b> only  when  in  extended  debugging
              mode (see the description of the <b>extdebug</b> option to the <b>shopt</b> builtin below)
       <b>BASH_COMMAND</b>
              The  command currently being executed or about to be executed, unless the shell is executing a
              command as the result of a trap, in which case it is the command executing at the time of  the
              trap.
       <b>BASH_EXECUTION_STRING</b>
              The command argument to the <b>-c</b> invocation option.
       <b>BASH_LINENO</b>
              An  array  variable  whose  members are the line numbers in source files corresponding to each
              member of <b>FUNCNAME</b>.  <b>${BASH_LINENO[</b><u>$i</u><b>]}</b> is the line number in the source  file  where  <b>${FUNC</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">NAME[$ifP]}&nbsp;${FUNCNAME[$ifP]}</font>

              <b>to</b> <b>obtain</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>line</b> <b>number.</b>
       <b>BASH_REMATCH</b>
              An array variable whose members are assigned by the <b>=~</b> binary operator to the  <b>[[</b>  conditional
              command.   The  element  with index 0 is the portion of the string matching the entire regular
              expression.  The element with index <u>n</u> is the portion of the string matching the <u>n</u>th  parenthe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sized&nbsp;parenthesized</font>
              sized subexpression.  This variable is read-only.
       <b>BASH_SOURCE</b>
              An  array variable whose members are the source filenames corresponding to the elements in the

              <b>BASH_VERSINFO[</b>5<b>]</b>        The value of <b>MACHTYPE</b>.

       <b>BASH_VERSION</b>
              Expands to a string describing the version of this instance of <b>bash</b>.

       <b>COMP_CWORD</b>
              An index into <b>${COMP_WORDS}</b> of the word containing the current cursor position.  This variable
              is  available  only  in shell functions invoked by the programmable completion facilities (see
              <b>Programmable</b> <b>Completion</b> below).

       <b>COMP_LINE</b>
              The current command line.  This variable is available only in  shell  functions  and  external
              commands  invoked  by  the  programmable  completion  facilities  (see <b>Programmable</b> <b>Completion</b>
              below).

       <b>COMP_POINT</b>
              The index of the current cursor position relative to the beginning of the current command.  If
              the  current  cursor position is at the end of the current command, the value of this variable
              is equal to <b>${#COMP_LINE}</b>.  This variable is available only in shell  functions  and  external
              commands  invoked  by  the  programmable  completion  facilities  (see <b>Programmable</b> <b>Completion</b>
              below).

       <b>COMP_WORDBREAKS</b>
              The set of characters that the Readline library treats as word separators when performing word
              completion.   If <b>COMP_WORDBREAKS</b> is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is sub-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sequently&nbsp;subsequently</font>
              sequently reset.

       <b>COMP_WORDS</b>
              An array variable (see <b>Arrays</b> below) consisting of the individual words in the current command
              line.   The  words  are split on shell metacharacters as the shell parser would separate them.
              This variable is available only in shell functions  invoked  by  the  programmable  completion
              facilities (see <b>Programmable</b> <b>Completion</b> below).

       <b>DIRSTACK</b>
              An  array  variable (see <b>Arrays</b> below) containing the current contents of the directory stack.
              Directories appear in the stack in the order they are displayed by the <b>dirs</b> builtin.   Assign-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;Assigning</font>
              ing  to members of this array variable may be used to modify directories already in the stack,
              but the <b>pushd</b> and <b>popd</b> builtins must be used to add and  remove  directories.   Assignment  to
              this  variable will not change the current directory.  If <b>DIRSTACK</b> is unset, it loses its spe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cial&nbsp;special</font>
              cial properties, even if it is subsequently reset.

       <b>EUID</b>   Expands to the effective user ID of the current user,  initialized  at  shell  startup.   This
              variable is readonly.

       <b>FUNCNAME</b>
              An  array variable containing the names of all shell functions currently in the execution call
              stack.  The element with index 0 is the name of any currently-executing shell  function.   The
              bottom-most  element is "main".  This variable exists only when a shell function is executing.
              Assignments to <b>FUNCNAME</b> have no effect and return an error status.  If <b>FUNCNAME</b> is  unset,  it
              loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.

       <b>GROUPS</b> An  array  variable  containing  the  list  of  groups  of which the current user is a member.
              Assignments to <b>GROUPS</b> have no effect and return an error status.  If <b>GROUPS</b> is unset, it loses
              its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.

       <b>HISTCMD</b>
              The  history  number,  or  index  in  the history list, of the current command.  If <b>HISTCMD</b> is
              unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.

       <b>HOSTNAME</b>
              Automatically set to the name of the current host.

       <b>HOSTTYPE</b>
              Automatically set to a string that uniquely describes the type of machine  on  which  <b>bash</b>  is
              executing.  The default is system-dependent.

       <b>LINENO</b> Each  time  this  parameter is referenced, the shell substitutes a decimal number representing
              the current sequential line number (starting with 1) within a script or function.  When not in
              a  script or function, the value substituted is not guaranteed to be meaningful.  If <b>LINENO</b> is
              unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.

       <b>MACHTYPE</b>
              Automatically set to a string that fully describes the system type on which <b>bash</b> is executing,
              in the standard GNU <u>cpu-company-system</u> format.  The default is system-dependent.

       <b>OLDPWD</b> The previous working directory as set by the <b>cd</b> command.

       <b>OPTARG</b> The  value  of  the  last  option argument processed by the <b>getopts</b> builtin command (see <b>SHELL</b>
              <b>BUILTIN</b> <b>COMMANDS</b> below).

       <b>OPTIND</b> The index of the next argument to be processed by  the  <b>getopts</b>  builtin  command  (see  <b>SHELL</b>
              <b>BUILTIN</b> <b>COMMANDS</b> below).

       <b>OSTYPE</b> Automatically  set to a string that describes the operating system on which <b>bash</b> is executing.
              The default is system-dependent.

       <b>PIPESTATUS</b>
              An array variable (see <b>Arrays</b> below) containing a list of exit status  values  from  the  pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cesses&nbsp;processes</font>
              cesses in the most-recently-executed foreground pipeline (which may contain only a single com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand).&nbsp;command).</font>
              mand).

       <b>PPID</b>   The process ID of the shell's parent.  This variable is readonly.

       <b>PWD</b>    The current working directory as set by the <b>cd</b> command.

       <b>RANDOM</b> Each time this parameter is referenced, a random integer between 0  and  32767  is  generated.
              The  sequence  of random numbers may be initialized by assigning a value to <b>RANDOM</b>.  If <b>RANDOM</b>
              is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.

       <b>REPLY</b>  Set to the line of input read by the <b>read</b> builtin command when no arguments are supplied.

       <b>SECONDS</b>
              Each time this parameter is referenced, the  number  of  seconds  since  shell  invocation  is
              returned.  If a value is assigned to <b>SECONDS</b>, the value returned upon subsequent references is
              the number of seconds since the assignment plus the value assigned.  If <b>SECONDS</b> is  unset,  it
              loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.

       <b>SHELLOPTS</b>
              A  colon-separated  list  of enabled shell options.  Each word in the list is a valid argument
              for the <b>-o</b> option to the <b>set</b> builtin command (see <b>SHELL</b> <b>BUILTIN</b> <b>COMMANDS</b> below).  The  options
              appearing  in  <b>SHELLOPTS</b> are those reported as <u>on</u> by <b>set</b> <b>-o</b>.  If this variable is in the envi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ronment&nbsp;environment</font>
              ronment when <b>bash</b> starts up, each shell option in the list will be enabled before reading  any
              startup files.  This variable is read-only.

       <b>SHLVL</b>  Incremented by one each time an instance of <b>bash</b> is started.

       <b>UID</b>    Expands  to  the  user ID of the current user, initialized at shell startup.  This variable is
              readonly.

       The following variables are used by the shell.  In some cases, <b>bash</b> assigns  a  default  value  to  a
       variable; these cases are noted below.

       <b>BASH_ENV</b>
              If  this parameter is set when <b>bash</b> is executing a shell script, its value is interpreted as a
              filename containing commands to initialize the shell, as in <u>~/.bashrc</u>.  The value of  <b>BASH_ENV</b>
              is  subjected  to  parameter  expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion before
              being interpreted as a file name.  <b>PATH</b> is not used to search for the resultant file name.
       <b>CDPATH</b> The search path for the <b>cd</b> command.  This is a colon-separated list of  directories  in  which
              the  shell  looks  for destination directories specified by the <b>cd</b> command.  A sample value is
              ".:~:/usr".
       <b>COLUMNS</b>
              Used by the <b>select</b> builtin command to determine the terminal  width  when  printing  selection
              lists.  Automatically set upon receipt of a SIGWINCH.
       <b>COMPREPLY</b>
              An array variable from which <b>bash</b> reads the possible completions generated by a shell function
              invoked by the programmable completion facility (see <b>Programmable</b> <b>Completion</b> below).
       <b>EMACS</b>  If <b>bash</b> finds this variable in the environment when  the  shell  starts  with  value  "t",  it
              assumes that the shell is running in an emacs shell buffer and disables line editing.
       <b>FCEDIT</b> The default editor for the <b>fc</b> builtin command.
       <b>FIGNORE</b>
              A colon-separated list of suffixes to ignore when performing filename completion (see <b>READLINE</b>
              below).  A filename whose suffix matches one of the entries in <b>FIGNORE</b> is  excluded  from  the
              list of matched filenames.  A sample value is ".o:~".
       <b>GLOBIGNORE</b>
              A  colon-separated  list  of  patterns defining the set of filenames to be ignored by pathname
              expansion.  If a filename matched by a pathname expansion pattern also matches one of the pat-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">terns&nbsp;patterns</font>
              terns in <b>GLOBIGNORE</b>, it is removed from the list of matches.
       <b>HISTCONTROL</b>
              A  colon-separated  list of values controlling how commands are saved on the history list.  If
              the list of values includes <u>ignorespace</u>, lines which begin with  a  <b>space</b>  character  are  not
              saved  in  the history list.  A value of <u>ignoredups</u> causes lines matching the previous history
              entry to not be saved.  A value of <u>ignoreboth</u> is shorthand for <u>ignorespace</u> and <u>ignoredups</u>.   A
              value  of <u>erasedups</u> causes all previous lines matching the current line to be removed from the
              history list before that line is saved.  Any value not in the above list is ignored.  If <b>HIST</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">CONTROL&nbsp;HISTCONTROL</font>
              <b>CONTROL</b>  is  unset,  or does not include a valid value, all lines read by the shell parser are
              saved on the history list, subject to the value of  <b>HISTIGNORE</b>.   The  second  and  subsequent
              lines of a multi-line compound command are not tested, and are added to the history regardless
              of the value of <b>HISTCONTROL</b>.
       <b>HISTFILE</b>
              The name of the file in which command history is saved (see <b>HISTORY</b> below).  The default value
              is  <u>~/.bash</u><b>_</b><u>history</u>.   If  unset,  the  command history is not saved when an interactive shell
              exits.
       <b>HISTFILESIZE</b>
              The maximum number of lines contained in the history file.  When this variable is  assigned  a
              value, the history file is truncated, if necessary, by removing the oldest entries, to contain
              no more than that number of lines.  The default value is 500.  The history file is also  trun-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cated&nbsp;truncated</font>
              cated to this size after writing it when an interactive shell exits.
       <b>HISTIGNORE</b>
              A  colon-separated  list of patterns used to decide which command lines should be saved on the
              history list.  Each pattern is anchored at the beginning of the line and must match  the  com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">plete&nbsp;complete</font>
              plete  line  (no implicit `<b>*</b>' is appended).  Each pattern is tested against the line after the
              checks specified by <b>HISTCONTROL</b> are applied.  In addition to the normal shell pattern matching
              characters,  `<b>&amp;</b>' matches the previous history line.  `<b>&amp;</b>' may be escaped using a backslash; the
              backslash is removed before attempting a match.  The second and subsequent lines of  a  multi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">line&nbsp;multiline</font>
              line  compound command are not tested, and are added to the history regardless of the value of
              <b>HISTIGNORE</b>.
       <b>HISTSIZE</b>
              The number of commands to remember in the command history (see <b>HISTORY</b>  below).   The  default
              value is 500.
       <b>HISTTIMEFORMAT</b>
              If  this variable is set and not null, its value is used as a format string for <a href="../man3/strftime.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/strftime"><u>strftime</u>(3)</a> to
              print the time stamp associated with each history entry displayed by the <b>history</b> builtin.   If
              this  variable  is  set,  time stamps are written to the history file so they may be preserved
              across shell sessions.
       <b>HOME</b>   The home directory of the current user; the default argument for the <b>cd</b> builtin command.   The
              value of this variable is also used when performing tilde expansion.
       <b>HOSTFILE</b>
              Contains  the  name  of  a  file in the same format as <u>/etc/hosts</u> that should be read when the
              shell needs to complete a hostname.  The list of possible hostname completions may be  changed
              while  the shell is running; the next time hostname completion is attempted after the value is
              changed, <b>bash</b> adds the contents of the new file to the existing list.  If <b>HOSTFILE</b> is set, but
              has no value, <b>bash</b> attempts to read <u>/etc/hosts</u> to obtain the list of possible hostname comple-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tions.&nbsp;completions.</font>
              tions.  When <b>HOSTFILE</b> is unset, the hostname list is cleared.
       <b>IFS</b>    The <u>Internal</u> <u>Field</u> <u>Separator</u> that is used for word splitting  after  expansion  and  to  split
              lines  into  words  with  the  <b>read</b> builtin command.  The default value is ``&lt;space&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;new-
              line&gt;''.
       <b>IGNOREEOF</b>
              Controls the action of an interactive shell on receipt of an <b>EOF</b> character as the sole  input.
              If set, the value is the number of consecutive <b>EOF</b> characters which must be typed as the first
              characters on an input line before <b>bash</b> exits.  If the variable exists but  does  not  have  a
              numeric  value, or has no value, the default value is 10.  If it does not exist, <b>EOF</b> signifies
              the end of input to the shell.
       <b>INPUTRC</b>
              The filename for the <b>readline</b> startup file, overriding the default of <u>~/.inputrc</u> (see <b>READLINE</b>
              below).
       <b>LANG</b>   Used  to determine the locale category for any category not specifically selected with a vari-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able&nbsp;variable</font>
              able starting with <b>LC_</b>.
       <b>LC_ALL</b> This variable overrides the value of <b>LANG</b> and any other <b>LC_</b> variable specifying a locale cate-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">gory.&nbsp;category.</font>
              gory.
       <b>LC_COLLATE</b>
              This  variable determines the collation order used when sorting the results of pathname expan-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion,&nbsp;expansion,</font>
              sion, and determines the behavior of range expressions,  equivalence  classes,  and  collating
              sequences within pathname expansion and pattern matching.
       <b>LC_CTYPE</b>
              This  variable  determines  the  interpretation  of  characters  and the behavior of character
              classes within pathname expansion and pattern matching.
       <b>LC_MESSAGES</b>
              This variable determines the locale used to translate double-quoted strings preceded by a <b>$</b>.
       <b>LC_NUMERIC</b>
              This variable determines the locale category used for number formatting.
       <b>LINES</b>  Used by the <b>select</b> builtin command to determine  the  column  length  for  printing  selection
              lists.  Automatically set upon receipt of a SIGWINCH.
       <b>MAIL</b>   If this parameter is set to a file name and the <b>MAILPATH</b> variable is not set, <b>bash</b> informs the
              user of the arrival of mail in the specified file.
       <b>MAILCHECK</b>
              Specifies how often (in seconds) <b>bash</b> checks for mail.  The default is 60 seconds.  When it is
              time to check for mail, the shell does so before displaying the primary prompt.  If this vari-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able&nbsp;variable</font>
              able is unset, or set to a value that is not a number greater than or equal to zero, the shell
              disables mail checking.
       <b>MAILPATH</b>
              A  colon-separated  list of file names to be checked for mail.  The message to be printed when
              mail arrives in a particular file may be specified by separating the file name from  the  mes-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sage&nbsp;message</font>
              sage  with a `?'.  When used in the text of the message, <b>$_</b> expands to the name of the current
              mailfile.  Example:
              <b>MAILPATH</b>='/var/mail/bfox?"You have mail":~/shell-mail?"$_ has mail!"'
              <b>Bash</b> supplies a default value for this variable, but the location of the user mail files  that
              it uses is system dependent (e.g., /var/mail/<b>$USER</b>).
       <b>OPTERR</b> If  set  to the value 1, <b>bash</b> displays error messages generated by the <b>getopts</b> builtin command
              (see <b>SHELL</b> <b>BUILTIN</b> <b>COMMANDS</b> below).  <b>OPTERR</b> is initialized to 1 each time the shell is invoked
              or a shell script is executed.
       <b>PATH</b>   The  search path for commands.  It is a colon-separated list of directories in which the shell
              looks for commands (see <b>COMMAND</b> <b>EXECUTION</b> below).  A zero-length (null) directory name in  the
              value  of <b>PATH</b> indicates the current directory.  A null directory name may appear as two adja-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cent&nbsp;adjacent</font>
              cent colons, or as an initial or trailing colon.  The default path is system-dependent, and is
              set     by     the    administrator    who    installs    <b>bash</b>.     A    common    value    is
              ``/usr/gnu/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/ucb:/bin:/usr/bin''.
       <b>POSIXLY_CORRECT</b>
              If this variable is in the environment when <b>bash</b> starts, the shell enters  <u>posix</u>  <u>mode</u>  before
              reading  the  startup  files, as if the <b>--posix</b> invocation option had been supplied.  If it is
              set while the shell is running, <b>bash</b> enables <u>posix</u> <u>mode</u>, as if the command <u>set</u>  <u>-o</u>  <u>posix</u>  had
              been executed.
       <b>PROMPT_COMMAND</b>
              If set, the value is executed as a command prior to issuing each primary prompt.
       <b>PS1</b>    The  value  of this parameter is expanded (see <b>PROMPTING</b> below) and used as the primary prompt
              string.  The default value is ``<b>\s-\v\$</b> ''.
       <b>PS2</b>    The value of this parameter is expanded as with <b>PS1</b> and used as the secondary  prompt  string.
              The default is ``<b>&gt;</b> ''.
       <b>PS3</b>    The  value  of  this parameter is used as the prompt for the <b>select</b> command (see <b>SHELL</b> <b>GRAMMAR</b>
              above).
       <b>PS4</b>    The value of this parameter is expanded as with <b>PS1</b> and the value is printed before each  com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
              mand <b>bash</b> displays during an execution trace.  The first character of <b>PS4</b> is replicated multi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ple&nbsp;multiple</font>
              ple times, as necessary, to indicate multiple levels of indirection.  The default is ``<b>+</b> ''.
       <b>SHELL</b>  The full pathname to the shell is kept in this environment variable.  If it is  not  set  when
              the shell starts, <b>bash</b> assigns to it the full pathname of the current user's login shell.
       <b>TIMEFORMAT</b>
              The  value  of this parameter is used as a format string specifying how the timing information
              for pipelines prefixed with the <b>time</b> reserved word  should  be  displayed.   The  <b>%</b>  character
              introduces  an  escape  sequence  that  is expanded to a time value or other information.  The
              escape sequences and their meanings are as follows; the braces denote optional portions.
              <b>%%</b>        A literal <b>%</b>.
              <b>%[</b><u>p</u><b>][l]R</b>  The elapsed time in seconds.
              <b>%[</b><u>p</u><b>][l]U</b>  The number of CPU seconds spent in user mode.
              <b>%[</b><u>p</u><b>][l]S</b>  The number of CPU seconds spent in system mode.
              <b>%P</b>        The CPU percentage, computed as (%U + %S) / %R.

              The optional <u>p</u> is a digit specifying the <u>precision</u>, the number of fractional  digits  after  a
              decimal  point.  A value of 0 causes no decimal point or fraction to be output.  At most three
              places after the decimal point may be specified; values of <u>p</u> greater than 3 are changed to  3.
              If <u>p</u> is not specified, the value 3 is used.

              The optional <b>l</b> specifies a longer format, including minutes, of the form <u>MM</u>m<u>SS</u>.<u>FF</u>s.  The value
              of <u>p</u> determines whether or not the fraction is included.

              If   this   variable   is   not   set,   <b>bash</b>    acts    as    if    it    had    the    value
              <b>$'\nreal\t%3lR\nuser\t%3lU\nsys%3lS'</b>.   If  the  value  is null, no timing information is dis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">played.&nbsp;displayed.</font>
              played.  A trailing newline is added when the format string is displayed.

       <b>TMOUT</b>  If set to a value greater than zero, <b>TMOUT</b> is treated as the  default  timeout  for  the  <b>read</b>
              builtin.   The  <b>select</b>  command  terminates  if input does not arrive after <b>TMOUT</b> seconds when
              input is coming from a terminal.  In an interactive shell, the value  is  interpreted  as  the
              number  of  seconds to wait for input after issuing the primary prompt.  <b>Bash</b> terminates after
              waiting for that number of seconds if input does not arrive.

       <b>TMPDIR</b> If set, <b>Bash</b> uses its value as the name of a directory in which <b>Bash</b> creates  temporary  files
              for the shell's use.

       <b>auto_resume</b>
              This  variable  controls how the shell interacts with the user and job control.  If this vari-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able&nbsp;variable</font>
              able is set, single word simple commands without redirections are treated  as  candidates  for
              resumption  of  an existing stopped job.  There is no ambiguity allowed; if there is more than
              one job beginning with the string typed, the job most recently accessed is selected.  The <u>name</u>
              of  a stopped job, in this context, is the command line used to start it.  If set to the value
              <u>exact</u>, the string supplied must match the name of a stopped job exactly; if set to  <u>substring</u>,
              the  string  supplied  needs to match a substring of the name of a stopped job.  The <u>substring</u>
              value provides functionality analogous to the <b>%?</b>  job identifier (see <b>JOB</b> <b>CONTROL</b> below).   If
              set  to  any  other  value, the supplied string must be a prefix of a stopped job's name; this
              provides functionality analogous to the <b>%</b><u>string</u> job identifier.

       <b>histchars</b>
              The two or three characters which control history  expansion  and  tokenization  (see  <b>HISTORY</b>
              <b>EXPANSION</b> below).  The first character is the <u>history</u> <u>expansion</u> character, the character which
              signals the start of a history expansion, normally `<b>!</b>'.  The second  character  is  the  <u>quick</u>
              <u>substitution</u>  character,  which  is  used  as  shorthand  for  re-running the previous command
              entered, substituting one string for another  in  the  command.   The  default  is  `<b>^</b>'.   The
              optional  third character is the character which indicates that the remainder of the line is a
              comment when found as the first character of a word, normally `<b>#</b>'.  The history comment  char-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">acter&nbsp;character</font>
              acter  causes history substitution to be skipped for the remaining words on the line.  It does
              not necessarily cause the shell parser to treat the rest of the line as a comment.

   <b>Arrays</b>
       <b>Bash</b> provides one-dimensional array variables.  Any variable may be used as  an  array;  the  <b>declare</b>
       builtin will explicitly declare an array.  There is no maximum limit on the size of an array, nor any
       requirement that members be indexed or assigned contiguously.  Arrays are indexed using integers  and
       are zero-based.

       An  array  is  created  automatically  if  any  variable  is  assigned  to using the syntax <u>name</u>[<u>sub</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">script]=value.&nbsp;name[subscript]=value.</font>
       <u>script</u>]=<u>value</u>.  The <u>subscript</u> is treated as an arithmetic expression that must evaluate to  a  number
       greater  than  or  equal  to  zero.   To  explicitly declare an array, use <b>declare</b> <b>-a</b> <u>name</u> (see <b>SHELL</b>
       <b>BUILTIN</b> <b>COMMANDS</b> below).  <b>declare</b> <b>-a</b> <u>name</u><b>[</b><u>subscript</u><b>]</b> is also  accepted;  the  <u>subscript</u>  is  ignored.
       Attributes  may  be  specified  for  an array variable using the <b>declare</b> and <b>readonly</b> builtins.  Each
       attribute applies to all members of an array.

       Arrays are assigned to using compound assignments of the form <u>name</u>=<b>(</b>value<u>1</u> ...  value<u>n</u><b>)</b>,  where  each
       <u>value</u> is of the form [<u>subscript</u>]=<u>string</u>.  Only <u>string</u> is required.  If the optional brackets and sub-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">script&nbsp;subscript</font>
       script are supplied, that index is assigned to; otherwise the index of the element  assigned  is  the
       last  index  assigned  to  by  the statement plus one.  Indexing starts at zero.  This syntax is also
       accepted by the <b>declare</b> builtin.  Individual array elements may be assigned to  using  the  <u>name</u>[<u>sub</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">script]=value&nbsp;name[subscript]=value</font>
       <u>script</u>]=<u>value</u> syntax introduced above.

       Any element of an array may be referenced using ${<u>name</u>[<u>subscript</u>]}.  The braces are required to avoid
       conflicts with pathname expansion.  If <u>subscript</u> is <b>@</b> or <b>*</b>, the word expands to all members of  <u>name</u>.
       These  subscripts  differ  only  when  the word appears within double quotes.  If the word is double-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">quoted,&nbsp;doublequoted,</font>
       quoted, ${<u>name</u>[*]} expands to a single word with the value of each  array  member  separated  by  the
       first  character  of the <b>IFS</b> special variable, and ${<u>name</u>[@]} expands each element of <u>name</u> to a sepa-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rate&nbsp;separate</font>
       rate word.  When there are no array members, ${<u>name</u>[@]} expands to  nothing.   If  the  double-quoted
       expansion  occurs  within  a  word, the expansion of the first parameter is joined with the beginning
       part of the original word, and the expansion of the last parameter is joined with the  last  part  of
       the original word.  This is analogous to the expansion of the special parameters <b>*</b> and <b>@</b> (see <b>Special</b>
       <b>Parameters</b> above).  ${#<u>name</u>[<u>subscript</u>]} expands to the length of ${<u>name</u>[<u>subscript</u>]}.  If <u>subscript</u> is
       <b>*</b>  or <b>@</b>, the expansion is the number of elements in the array.  Referencing an array variable without
       a subscript is equivalent to referencing element zero.

       The <b>unset</b> builtin is used to destroy arrays.  <b>unset</b> <u>name</u>[<u>subscript</u>] destroys  the  array  element  at
       index  <u>subscript</u>.   Care  must be taken to avoid unwanted side effects caused by filename generation.
       <b>unset</b> <u>name</u>, where <u>name</u> is an array, or <b>unset</b> <u>name</u>[<u>subscript</u>], where <u>subscript</u> is <b>*</b> or <b>@</b>, removes  the
       entire array.

       The  <b>declare</b>,  <b>local</b>,  and  <b>readonly</b>  builtins each accept a <b>-a</b> option to specify an array.  The <b>read</b>
       builtin accepts a <b>-a</b> option to assign a list of words read from the standard input to an array.   The
       <b>set</b>  and <b>declare</b> builtins display array values in a way that allows them to be reused as assignments.

<b>EXPANSION</b>
       Expansion is performed on the command line after it has been split into words.  There are seven kinds
       of  expansion  performed: <u>brace</u> <u>expansion</u>, <u>tilde</u> <u>expansion</u>, <u>parameter</u> <u>and</u> <u>variable</u> <u>expansion</u>, <u>command</u>
       <u>substitution</u>, <u>arithmetic</u> <u>expansion</u>, <u>word</u> <u>splitting</u>, and <u>pathname</u> <u>expansion</u>.

       The order of expansions is: brace expansion, tilde  expansion,  parameter,  variable  and  arithmetic
       expansion  and  command  substitution (done in a left-to-right fashion), word splitting, and pathname
       expansion.

       On systems that can support it, there is an additional expansion available: <u>process</u> <u>substitution</u>.

       Only brace expansion, word splitting, and pathname expansion can change the number of  words  of  the
       expansion;  other  expansions expand a single word to a single word.  The only exceptions to this are
       the expansions of "<b>$@</b>" and "<b>${</b><u>name</u><b>[@]}</b>" as explained above (see <b>PARAMETERS</b>).

   <b>Brace</b> <b>Expansion</b>
       <u>Brace</u> <u>expansion</u> is a mechanism by which arbitrary strings may be generated.  This mechanism is  simi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lar&nbsp;similar</font>
       lar to <u>pathname</u> <u>expansion</u>, but the filenames generated need not exist.  Patterns to be brace expanded
       take the form of an optional <u>preamble</u>, followed by either a series of comma-separated  strings  or  a
       sequence  expression  between  a pair of braces, followed by an optional <u>postscript</u>.  The preamble is
       prefixed to each string contained within the braces, and the postscript  is  then  appended  to  each
       resulting string, expanding left to right.

       Brace  expansions  may  be nested.  The results of each expanded string are not sorted; left to right
       order is preserved.  For example, a<b>{</b>d,c,b<b>}</b>e expands into `ade ace abe'.

       A sequence expression takes the form <b>{</b><u>x</u><b>..</b><u>y</u><b>}</b>, where <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> are either integers or single  characters.
       When  integers  are supplied, the expression expands to each number between <u>x</u> and <u>y</u>, inclusive.  When
       characters are supplied, the expression expands to each character lexicographically between <u>x</u> and  <u>y</u>,
       inclusive.  Note that both <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> must be of the same type.

       Brace  expansion is performed before any other expansions, and any characters special to other expan-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sions&nbsp;expansions</font>
       sions are preserved in the result.  It is strictly textual.  <b>Bash</b> does not apply any syntactic inter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pretation&nbsp;interpretation</font>
       pretation to the context of the expansion or the text between the braces.

       A correctly-formed brace expansion must contain unquoted opening and closing braces, and at least one
       unquoted comma or a valid sequence expression.   Any  incorrectly  formed  brace  expansion  is  left
       unchanged.   A  <b>{</b> or <b>,</b> may be quoted with a backslash to prevent its being considered part of a brace
       expression.  To avoid conflicts with parameter expansion, the string <b>${</b> is  not  considered  eligible
       for brace expansion.

       This  construct  is typically used as shorthand when the common prefix of the strings to be generated
       is longer than in the above example:

              mkdir /usr/local/src/bash/{old,new,dist,bugs}
       or
              chown root /usr/{ucb/{ex,edit},lib/{ex?.?*,how_ex}}

       Brace expansion introduces a slight incompatibility with historical versions  of  <b>sh</b>.   <b>sh</b>  does  not
       treat  opening  or closing braces specially when they appear as part of a word, and preserves them in
       the output.  <b>Bash</b> removes braces from words as a consequence of brace expansion.  For example, a word
       entered to <b>sh</b> as <u>file{1,2}</u> appears identically in the output.  The same word is output as <u>file1</u> <u>file2</u>
       after expansion by <b>bash</b>.  If strict compatibility with <b>sh</b> is desired, start <b>bash</b> with the  <b>+B</b>  option
       or  disable brace expansion with the <b>+B</b> option to the <b>set</b> command (see <b>SHELL</b> <b>BUILTIN</b> <b>COMMANDS</b> below).

   <b>Tilde</b> <b>Expansion</b>
       If a word begins with an unquoted tilde character (`<b>~</b>'), all of the characters  preceding  the  first
       unquoted  slash (or all characters, if there is no unquoted slash) are considered a <u>tilde-prefix</u>.  If
       none of the characters in the tilde-prefix are quoted, the characters in the  tilde-prefix  following
       the  tilde are treated as a possible <u>login</u> <u>name</u>.  If this login name is the null string, the tilde is
       replaced with the value of the shell parameter <b>HOME</b>.  If <b>HOME</b> is unset, the  home  directory  of  the
       user  executing  the  shell is substituted instead.  Otherwise, the tilde-prefix is replaced with the
       home directory associated with the specified login name.

       If the tilde-prefix is a `~+', the value of the shell variable <b>PWD</b> replaces the tilde-prefix.  If the
       tilde-prefix is a `~-', the value of the shell variable <b>OLDPWD</b>, if it is set, is substituted.  If the
       characters following the tilde in the tilde-prefix consist of a number <u>N</u>, optionally  prefixed  by  a
       `+'  or  a `-', the tilde-prefix is replaced with the corresponding element from the directory stack,
       as it would be displayed by the <b>dirs</b> builtin invoked with the tilde-prefix as an  argument.   If  the
       characters  following the tilde in the tilde-prefix consist of a number without a leading `+' or `-',
       `+' is assumed.

       If the login name is invalid, or the tilde expansion fails, the word is unchanged.

       Each variable assignment is checked for unquoted tilde-prefixes immediately  following  a  <b>:</b>  or  the
       first  <b>=</b>.   In  these cases, tilde expansion is also performed.  Consequently, one may use file names
       with tildes in assignments to <b>PATH</b>, <b>MAILPATH</b>, and <b>CDPATH</b>, and the shell assigns the expanded value.

   <b>Parameter</b> <b>Expansion</b>
       The `<b>$</b>' character introduces parameter expansion, command substitution, or arithmetic expansion.  The
       parameter  name  or  symbol to be expanded may be enclosed in braces, which are optional but serve to
       protect the variable to be expanded from characters immediately following it which  could  be  inter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">preted&nbsp;interpreted</font>
       preted as part of the name.

       When braces are used, the matching ending brace is the first `<b>}</b>' not escaped by a backslash or within
       a quoted string, and not within an embedded arithmetic expansion, command substitution, or  parameter
       expansion.

       ${<u>parameter</u>}
              The value of <u>parameter</u> is substituted.  The braces are required when <u>parameter</u> is a positional
              parameter with more than one digit, or when <u>parameter</u> is followed by a character which is  not
              to be interpreted as part of its name.

       If  the  first  character  of  <u>parameter</u>  is an exclamation point, a level of variable indirection is
       introduced.  <b>Bash</b> uses the value of the variable formed from the rest of <u>parameter</u> as the name of the
       variable;  this  variable  is  then  expanded and that value is used in the rest of the substitution,
       rather than the value of <u>parameter</u> itself.  This is known as <u>indirect</u> <u>expansion</u>.  The  exceptions  to
       this  are  the expansions of ${!<u>prefix</u>*} and ${<b>!</b><u>name</u>[<u>@</u>]} described below.  The exclamation point must
       immediately follow the left brace in order to introduce indirection.

       In each of the cases below, <u>word</u> is subject to tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command  substi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tution,&nbsp;substitution,</font>
       tution,  and arithmetic expansion.  When not performing substring expansion, <b>bash</b> tests for a parame-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ter&nbsp;parameter</font>
       ter that is unset or null; omitting the colon results in a test only for a parameter that is unset.

       ${<u>parameter</u><b>:-</b><u>word</u>}
              <b>Use</b> <b>Default</b> <b>Values</b>.  If <u>parameter</u> is unset or null, the  expansion  of  <u>word</u>  is  substituted.
              Otherwise, the value of <u>parameter</u> is substituted.
       ${<u>parameter</u><b>:=</b><u>word</u>}
              <b>Assign</b>  <b>Default</b>  <b>Values</b>.   If <u>parameter</u> is unset or null, the expansion of <u>word</u> is assigned to
              <u>parameter</u>.  The value of <u>parameter</u> is then substituted.   Positional  parameters  and  special
              parameters may not be assigned to in this way.
       ${<u>parameter</u><b>:?</b><u>word</u>}
              <b>Display</b>  <b>Error</b>  <b>if</b>  <b>Null</b> <b>or</b> <b>Unset</b>.  If <u>parameter</u> is null or unset, the expansion of <u>word</u> (or a
              message to that effect if <u>word</u> is not present) is written to the standard error and the shell,
              if it is not interactive, exits.  Otherwise, the value of <u>parameter</u> is substituted.
       ${<u>parameter</u><b>:+</b><u>word</u>}
              <b>Use</b>  <b>Alternate</b>  <b>Value</b>.   If  <u>parameter</u> is null or unset, nothing is substituted, otherwise the
              expansion of <u>word</u> is substituted.
       ${<u>parameter</u><b>:</b><u>offset</u>}
       ${<u>parameter</u><b>:</b><u>offset</u><b>:</b><u>length</u>}
              <b>Substring</b> <b>Expansion.</b>  Expands to up to <u>length</u> characters of <u>parameter</u> starting at the  charac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ter&nbsp;character</font>
              ter specified by <u>offset</u>.  If <u>length</u> is omitted, expands to the substring of <u>parameter</u> starting
              at the character specified by <u>offset</u>.  <u>length</u>  and  <u>offset</u>  are  arithmetic  expressions  (see
              <b>ARITHMETIC</b> <b>EVALUATION</b> below).  <u>length</u> must evaluate to a number greater than or equal to zero.
              If <u>offset</u> evaluates to a number less than zero, the value is used as an offset from the end of
              the  value of <u>parameter</u>.  If <u>parameter</u> is <b>@</b>, the result is <u>length</u> positional parameters begin-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ning&nbsp;beginning</font>
              ning at <u>offset</u>.  If <u>parameter</u> is an array name indexed by @ or *, the  result  is  the  <u>length</u>
              members of the array beginning with ${<u>parameter</u>[<u>offset</u>]}.  A negative <u>offset</u> is taken relative
              to one greater than the maximum index of the specified array.  Note  that  a  negative  offset
              must  be  separated  from  the colon by at least one space to avoid being confused with the :-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">expansion.&nbsp;:expansion.</font>
              expansion.  Substring indexing is zero-based unless the positional  parameters  are  used,  in
              which case the indexing starts at 1.

       ${<b>!</b><u>prefix</u><b>*</b>}
       ${<b>!</b><u>prefix</u><b>@</b>}
              Expands  to the names of variables whose names begin with <u>prefix</u>, separated by the first char-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">acter&nbsp;character</font>
              acter of the <b>IFS</b> special variable.

       ${<b>!</b><u>name</u>[<u>@</u>]}
       ${<b>!</b><u>name</u>[<u>*</u>]}
              If <u>name</u> is an array variable, expands to the list of array indices (keys)  assigned  in  <u>name</u>.
              If  <u>name</u>  is not an array, expands to 0 if <u>name</u> is set and null otherwise.  When <u>@</u> is used and
              the expansion appears within double quotes, each key expands to a separate word.

       ${<b>#</b><u>parameter</u>}
              The length in characters of the value of <u>parameter</u> is substituted.  If <u>parameter</u> is  <b>*</b>  or  <b>@</b>,
              the  value  substituted is the number of positional parameters.  If <u>parameter</u> is an array name
              subscripted by <b>*</b> or <b>@</b>, the value substituted is the number of elements in the array.

       ${<u>parameter</u><b>#</b><u>word</u>}
       ${<u>parameter</u><b>##</b><u>word</u>}
              The <u>word</u> is expanded to produce a pattern just as  in  pathname  expansion.   If  the  pattern
              matches  the  beginning  of  the  value  of <u>parameter</u>, then the result of the expansion is the
              expanded value of <u>parameter</u> with the shortest matching pattern (the ``<b>#</b>'' case) or the longest
              matching pattern (the ``<b>##</b>'' case) deleted.  If <u>parameter</u> is <b>@</b> or <b>*</b>, the pattern removal oper-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ation&nbsp;operation</font>
              ation is applied to each positional parameter in turn, and  the  expansion  is  the  resultant
              list.   If  <u>parameter</u> is an array variable subscripted with <b>@</b> or <b>*</b>, the pattern removal opera-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;operation</font>
              tion is applied to each member of the array in turn, and the expansion is the resultant  list.

       ${<u>parameter</u><b>%</b><u>word</u>}
       ${<u>parameter</u><b>%%</b><u>word</u>}
              The  <u>word</u>  is  expanded  to  produce  a pattern just as in pathname expansion.  If the pattern
              matches a trailing portion of the expanded value of <u>parameter</u>, then the result of  the  expan-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion&nbsp;expansion</font>
              sion is the expanded value of <u>parameter</u> with the shortest matching pattern (the ``<b>%</b>'' case) or
              the longest matching pattern (the ``<b>%%</b>'' case) deleted.  If <u>parameter</u> is <b>@</b> or <b>*</b>,  the  pattern
              removal  operation  is  applied to each positional parameter in turn, and the expansion is the
              resultant list.  If <u>parameter</u> is an array variable  subscripted  with  <b>@</b>  or  <b>*</b>,  the  pattern
              removal  operation  is  applied  to each member of the array in turn, and the expansion is the
              resultant list.

       ${<u>parameter</u><b>/</b><u>pattern</u><b>/</b><u>string</u>}
              The <u>pattern</u> is expanded to produce a pattern just as  in  pathname  expansion.   <u>Parameter</u>  is
              expanded and the longest match of <u>pattern</u> against its value is replaced with <u>string</u>.  If Ipat-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tern&nbsp;Ipattern</font>
              tern <u>begins</u> <u>with</u> <b>/</b><u>,</u> <u>all</u> <u>matches</u> <u>of</u> <u>pattern</u> <u>are</u> <u>replaced</u> <u>with</u> <u>string.</u>  <u>Normally</u> <u>only</u> <u>the</u>  <u>first</u>
              <u>match</u>  <u>is</u>  <u>replaced.</u>  <u>If</u> <u>pattern</u> <u>begins</u> <u>with</u> <b>#</b><u>,</u> <u>it</u> <u>must</u> <u>match</u> <u>at</u> <u>the</u> <u>beginning</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>expanded</u>
              <u>value</u> <u>of</u> <u>parameter.</u>  <u>If</u> <u>pattern</u> <u>begins</u> <u>with</u> <b>%</b><u>,</u> <u>it</u> <u>must</u> <u>match</u> <u>at</u> <u>the</u> <u>end</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>expanded</u>  <u>value</u>
              <u>of</u>  <u>parameter.</u>   <u>If</u> <u>string</u> <u>is</u> <u>null,</u> <u>matches</u> <u>of</u> <u>pattern</u> <u>are</u> <u>deleted</u> <u>and</u> <u>the</u> <b>/</b> <u>following</u> <u>pattern</u>
              <u>may</u> <u>be</u> <u>omitted.</u>  <u>If</u> <u>parameter</u> is <b>@</b> or <b>*</b>, the substitution operation is applied to  each  posi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tional&nbsp;positional</font>
              tional  parameter  in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.  If <u>parameter</u> is an array
              variable subscripted with <b>@</b> or <b>*</b>, the substitution operation is applied to each member of  the
              array in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.

   <b>Command</b> <b>Substitution</b>
       <u>Command</u>  <u>substitution</u>  allows  the  output  of  a command to replace the command name.  There are two
       forms:


              <b>$(</b><u>command</u><b>)</b>
       or
              <b>`</b><u>command</u><b>`</b>

       <b>Bash</b> performs the expansion by executing <u>command</u> and replacing  the  command  substitution  with  the
       standard  output  of  the  command,  with  any  trailing newlines deleted.  Embedded newlines are not
       deleted, but they may be removed during word splitting.  The command substitution <b>$(cat</b> <u>file</u><b>)</b> can  be
       replaced by the equivalent but faster <b>$(&lt;</b> <u>file</u><b>)</b>.

       When  the  old-style  backquote  form  of substitution is used, backslash retains its literal meaning
       except when followed by <b>$</b>, <b>`</b>, or <b>\</b>.  The first backquote not preceded by a backslash  terminates  the
       command substitution.  When using the $(<u>command</u>) form, all characters between the parentheses make up
       the command; none are treated specially.

       Command substitutions may be nested.  To nest when using the backquoted form, escape the inner  back-
       quotes with backslashes.

       If  the substitution appears within double quotes, word splitting and pathname expansion are not per-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">formed&nbsp;performed</font>
       formed on the results.

   <b>Arithmetic</b> <b>Expansion</b>
       Arithmetic expansion allows the evaluation of an arithmetic expression and the  substitution  of  the
       result.  The format for arithmetic expansion is:

              <b>$((</b><u>expression</u><b>))</b>

       The <u>expression</u> is treated as if it were within double quotes, but a double quote inside the parenthe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ses&nbsp;parentheses</font>
       ses is not treated specially.  All tokens in  the  expression  undergo  parameter  expansion,  string
       expansion, command substitution, and quote removal.  Arithmetic expansions may be nested.

       The  evaluation  is  performed  according  to the rules listed below under <b>ARITHMETIC</b> <b>EVALUATION</b>.  If
       <u>expression</u> is invalid, <b>bash</b> prints a message indicating failure and no substitution occurs.

   <b>Process</b> <b>Substitution</b>
       <u>Process</u> <u>substitution</u> is supported on systems that support named pipes (<u>FIFOs</u>) or the  <b>/dev/fd</b>  method
       of  naming  open  files.   It takes the form of <b>&lt;(</b><u>list</u><b>)</b> or <b>&gt;(</b><u>list</u><b>)</b>.  The process <u>list</u> is run with its
       input or output connected to a <u>FIFO</u> or some file in <b>/dev/fd</b>.  The name of this file is passed  as  an
       argument to the current command as the result of the expansion.  If the <b>&gt;(</b><u>list</u><b>)</b> form is used, writing
       to the file will provide input for <u>list</u>.  If the <b>&lt;(</b><u>list</u><b>)</b> form is used, the file passed as an argument
       should be read to obtain the output of <u>list</u>.

       When  available,  process substitution is performed simultaneously with parameter and variable expan-
       sion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion.

   <b>Word</b> <b>Splitting</b>
       The shell scans the results of parameter expansion, command substitution,  and  arithmetic  expansion
       that did not occur within double quotes for <u>word</u> <u>splitting</u>.

       The shell treats each character of <b>IFS</b> as a delimiter, and splits the results of the other expansions
       into words on these characters.  If <b>IFS</b> is unset, or its value is exactly <b>&lt;space&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;newline&gt;</b>,  the
       default,  then any sequence of <b>IFS</b> characters serves to delimit words.  If <b>IFS</b> has a value other than
       the default, then sequences of the whitespace characters <b>space</b> and <b>tab</b> are ignored at  the  beginning
       and  end  of  the word, as long as the whitespace character is in the value of <b>IFS</b> (an <b>IFS</b> whitespace
       character).  Any character in <b>IFS</b> that is not <b>IFS</b> whitespace, along with any adjacent <b>IFS</b>  whitespace
       characters,  delimits  a  field.  A sequence of <b>IFS</b> whitespace characters is also treated as a delim-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">iter.&nbsp;delimiter.</font>
       iter.  If the value of <b>IFS</b> is null, no word splitting occurs.

       Explicit null arguments (<b>""</b> or <b>''</b>) are retained.  Unquoted implicit null  arguments,  resulting  from
       the  expansion  of  parameters  that  have  no  values, are removed.  If a parameter with no value is
       expanded within double quotes, a null argument results and is retained.

       Note that if no expansion occurs, no splitting is performed.

   <b>Pathname</b> <b>Expansion</b>
       After word splitting, unless the <b>-f</b> option has been set, <b>bash</b> scans each word for the  characters  <b>*</b>,
       <b>?</b>,  and  <b>[</b>.  If one of these characters appears, then the word is regarded as a <u>pattern</u>, and replaced
       with an alphabetically sorted list of file names matching the pattern.  If no matching file names are
       found, and the shell option <b>nullglob</b> is disabled, the word is left unchanged.  If the <b>nullglob</b> option
       is set, and no matches are found, the word is removed.  If the <b>failglob</b> shell option is set,  and  no
       matches  are found, an error message is printed and the command is not executed.  If the shell option
       <b>nocaseglob</b> is enabled, the match is performed without regard to the case  of  alphabetic  characters.
       When a pattern is used for pathname expansion, the character <b>``.''</b>  at the start of a name or immedi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ately&nbsp;immediately</font>
       ately following a slash must be matched explicitly, unless the shell option  <b>dotglob</b>  is  set.   When
       matching  a  pathname,  the  slash  character must always be matched explicitly.  In other cases, the
       <b>``.''</b>  character is not treated specially.  See the description of <b>shopt</b> below  under  <b>SHELL</b>  <b>BUILTIN</b>
       <b>COMMANDS</b> for a description of the <b>nocaseglob</b>, <b>nullglob</b>, <b>failglob</b>, and <b>dotglob</b> shell options.

       The  <b>GLOBIGNORE</b>  shell variable may be used to restrict the set of file names matching a <u>pattern</u>.  If
       <b>GLOBIGNORE</b> is set, each matching file name that also matches one of the  patterns  in  <b>GLOBIGNORE</b>  is
       removed  from the list of matches.  The file names <b>``.''</b>  and <b>``..''</b>  are always ignored when <b>GLOBIG</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">NORE&nbsp;GLOBIGNORE</font>
       <b>NORE</b> is set and not null.  However, setting <b>GLOBIGNORE</b> to a non-null value has the effect of enabling
       the <b>dotglob</b> shell option, so all other file names beginning with a <b>``.''</b>  will match.  To get the old
       behavior of ignoring file names beginning with a <b>``.''</b>, make <b>``.*''</b>  one of the patterns  in  <b>GLOBIG</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">NORE.&nbsp;GLOBIGNORE.</font>
       <b>NORE</b>.  The <b>dotglob</b> option is disabled when <b>GLOBIGNORE</b> is unset.

       <b>Pattern</b> <b>Matching</b>

       Any  character  that appears in a pattern, other than the special pattern characters described below,
       matches itself.  The NUL character may not occur in a pattern.  A  backslash  escapes  the  following
       character; the escaping backslash is discarded when matching.  The special pattern characters must be
       quoted if they are to be matched literally.

       The special pattern characters have the following meanings:

       <b>*</b>      Matches any string, including the null string.
       <b>?</b>      Matches any single character.
       <b>[...]</b>  Matches any one of the enclosed characters.  A  pair  of  characters  separated  by  a  hyphen
              denotes  a <u>range</u> <u>expression</u>; any character that sorts between those two characters, inclusive,
              using the current locale's collating sequence and character set, is  matched.   If  the  first
              character  following  the  <b>[</b>  is  a <b>!</b>  or a <b>^</b> then any character not enclosed is matched.  The
              sorting order of characters in range expressions is determined by the current locale  and  the
              value  of  the  <b>LC_COLLATE</b>  shell variable, if set.  A <b>-</b> may be matched by including it as the
              first or last character in the set.  A <b>]</b> may be matched by including it as the first character
              in the set.

              Within  <b>[</b> and <b>]</b>, <u>character</u> <u>classes</u> can be specified using the syntax <b>[:</b><u>class</u><b>:]</b>, where <u>class</u> is
              one of the following classes defined in the POSIX standard:
              <b>alnum</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>ascii</b> <b>blank</b> <b>cntrl</b> <b>digit</b> <b>graph</b> <b>lower</b> <b>print</b> <b>punct</b> <b>space</b> <b>upper</b> <b>word</b> <b>xdigit</b>
              A character class matches any character belonging to that class.   The  <b>word</b>  character  class
              matches letters, digits, and the character _.

              Within  <b>[</b>  and  <b>]</b>, an <u>equivalence</u> <u>class</u> can be specified using the syntax <b>[=</b><u>c</u><b>=]</b>, which matches
              all characters with the same collation weight (as defined by the current locale) as the  char-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">acter&nbsp;character</font>
              acter <u>c</u>.

              Within <b>[</b> and <b>]</b>, the syntax <b>[.</b><u>symbol</u><b>.]</b> matches the collating symbol <u>symbol</u>.

       If  the  <b>extglob</b>  shell  option is enabled using the <b>shopt</b> builtin, several extended pattern matching
       operators are recognized.  In the following description, a <u>pattern-list</u> is a list of one or more pat-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">terns&nbsp;patterns</font>
       terns separated by a <b>|</b>.  Composite patterns may be formed using one or more of the following sub-pat-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">terns:&nbsp;sub-patterns:</font>
       terns:

              <b>?(</b><u>pattern-list</u><b>)</b>
                     Matches zero or one occurrence of the given patterns
              <b>*(</b><u>pattern-list</u><b>)</b>
                     Matches zero or more occurrences of the given patterns
              <b>+(</b><u>pattern-list</u><b>)</b>
                     Matches one or more occurrences of the given patterns
              <b>@(</b><u>pattern-list</u><b>)</b>
                     Matches one of the given patterns
              <b>!(</b><u>pattern-list</u><b>)</b>
                     Matches anything except one of the given patterns

   <b>Quote</b> <b>Removal</b>
       After the preceding expansions, all unquoted occurrences of the characters <b>\</b>, <b>'</b>, and <b>"</b> that  did  not
       result from one of the above expansions are removed.

<b>REDIRECTION</b>
       Before  a command is executed, its input and output may be <u>redirected</u> using a special notation inter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">preted&nbsp;interpreted</font>
       preted by the shell.  Redirection may also be used to open and close files for the current shell exe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cution&nbsp;execution</font>
       cution environment.  The following redirection operators may precede or appear anywhere within a <u>sim</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ple&nbsp;simple</font>
       <u>ple</u> <u>command</u> or may follow a <u>command</u>.  Redirections are processed in the order they appear, from  left
       to right.

       In  the  following descriptions, if the file descriptor number is omitted, and the first character of
       the redirection operator is <b>&lt;</b>, the redirection refers to the standard input (file descriptor 0).   If
       the  first  character of the redirection operator is <b>&gt;</b>, the redirection refers to the standard output
       (file descriptor 1).

       The word following the redirection operator in the following descriptions, unless otherwise noted, is
       subjected  to brace expansion, tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic
       expansion, quote removal, pathname expansion, and word splitting.  If it expands  to  more  than  one
       word, <b>bash</b> reports an error.

       Note that the order of redirections is significant.  For example, the command

              ls <b>&gt;</b> dirlist 2<b>&gt;&amp;</b>1

       directs both standard output and standard error to the file <u>dirlist</u>, while the command

              ls 2<b>&gt;&amp;</b>1 <b>&gt;</b> dirlist

       directs  only the standard output to file <u>dirlist</u>, because the standard error was duplicated as stan-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dard&nbsp;standard</font>
       dard output before the standard output was redirected to <u>dirlist</u>.

       <b>Bash</b> handles several filenames specially when they are used in redirections, as described in the fol-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lowing&nbsp;following</font>
       lowing table:

              <b>/dev/fd/</b><u>fd</u>
                     If <u>fd</u> is a valid integer, file descriptor <u>fd</u> is duplicated.
              <b>/dev/stdin</b>
                     File descriptor 0 is duplicated.
              <b>/dev/stdout</b>
                     File descriptor 1 is duplicated.
              <b>/dev/stderr</b>
                     File descriptor 2 is duplicated.
              <b>/dev/tcp/</b><u>host</u><b>/</b><u>port</u>
                     If  <u>host</u> is a valid hostname or Internet address, and <u>port</u> is an integer port number or
                     service name, <b>bash</b> attempts to open a TCP connection to the corresponding socket.
              <b>/dev/udp/</b><u>host</u><b>/</b><u>port</u>
                     If <u>host</u> is a valid hostname or Internet address, and <u>port</u> is an integer port number  or
                     service name, <b>bash</b> attempts to open a UDP connection to the corresponding socket.

       A failure to open or create a file causes the redirection to fail.

       Redirections  using  file  descriptors  greater than 9 should be used with care, as they may conflict
       with file descriptors the shell uses internally.

   <b>Redirecting</b> <b>Input</b>
       Redirection of input causes the file whose name results from the expansion of <u>word</u> to be  opened  for
       reading on file descriptor <u>n</u>, or the standard input (file descriptor 0) if <u>n</u> is not specified.

       The general format for redirecting input is:

              [<u>n</u>]<b>&lt;</b><u>word</u>

   <b>Redirecting</b> <b>Output</b>
       Redirection  of output causes the file whose name results from the expansion of <u>word</u> to be opened for
       writing on file descriptor <u>n</u>, or the standard output (file descriptor 1) if <u>n</u> is not  specified.   If
       the file does not exist it is created; if it does exist it is truncated to zero size.

       The general format for redirecting output is:

              [<u>n</u>]<b>&gt;</b><u>word</u>

       If  the  redirection operator is <b>&gt;</b>, and the <b>noclobber</b> option to the <b>set</b> builtin has been enabled, the
       redirection will fail if the file whose name results from the expansion of <u>word</u> exists and is a regu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lar&nbsp;regular</font>
       lar  file.   If  the  redirection  operator is <b>&gt;|</b>, or the redirection operator is <b>&gt;</b> and the <b>noclobber</b>
       option to the <b>set</b> builtin command is not enabled, the redirection is attempted even if the file named
       by <u>word</u> exists.

   <b>Appending</b> <b>Redirected</b> <b>Output</b>
       Redirection  of  output in this fashion causes the file whose name results from the expansion of <u>word</u>
       to be opened for appending on file descriptor <u>n</u>, or the standard output (file descriptor 1) if  <u>n</u>  is
       not specified.  If the file does not exist it is created.

       The general format for appending output is:

              [<u>n</u>]<b>&gt;&gt;</b><u>word</u>


   <b>Redirecting</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Output</b> <b>and</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Error</b>
       <b>Bash</b> allows both the standard output (file descriptor 1) and the standard error output (file descrip-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tor&nbsp;descriptor</font>
       tor 2) to be redirected to the file whose name is the expansion of <u>word</u> with this construct.

       There are two formats for redirecting standard output and standard error:

              <b>&amp;&gt;</b><u>word</u>
       and
              <b>&gt;&amp;</b><u>word</u>

       Of the two forms, the first is preferred.  This is semantically equivalent to

              <b>&gt;</b><u>word</u> 2<b>&gt;&amp;</b>1

   <b>Here</b> <b>Documents</b>
       This type of redirection instructs the shell to read input from the current source until a line  con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">taining&nbsp;containing</font>
       taining only <u>word</u> (with no trailing blanks) is seen.  All of the lines read up to that point are then
       used as the standard input for a command.

       The format of here-documents is:

              <b>&lt;&lt;</b>[<b>-</b>]<u>word</u>
                      <u>here-document</u>
              <u>delimiter</u>

       No parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, or  pathname  expansion  is  per-
       formed  on  <u>word</u>.  If any characters in <u>word</u> are quoted, the <u>delimiter</u> is the result of quote removal
       on <u>word</u>, and the lines in the here-document are not expanded.  If <u>word</u> is unquoted, all lines of  the
       here-document  are  subjected to parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion.
       In the latter case, the character sequence <b>\&lt;newline&gt;</b> is ignored, and <b>\</b> must be  used  to  quote  the
       characters <b>\</b>, <b>$</b>, and <b>`</b>.

       If the redirection operator is <b>&lt;&lt;-</b>, then all leading tab characters are stripped from input lines and
       the line containing <u>delimiter</u>.  This allows here-documents within shell scripts to be indented  in  a
       natural fashion.

   <b>Here</b> <b>Strings</b>
       A variant of here documents, the format is:

              <b>&lt;&lt;&lt;</b><u>word</u>

       The <u>word</u> is expanded and supplied to the command on its standard input.

   <b>Duplicating</b> <b>File</b> <b>Descriptors</b>
       The redirection operator

              [<u>n</u>]<b>&lt;&amp;</b><u>word</u>

       is  used  to  duplicate  input  file  descriptors.   If  <u>word</u> expands to one or more digits, the file
       descriptor denoted by <u>n</u> is made to be a copy of that file descriptor.  If the digits in <u>word</u>  do  not
       specify  a  file descriptor open for input, a redirection error occurs.  If <u>word</u> evaluates to <b>-</b>, file
       descriptor <u>n</u> is closed.  If <u>n</u> is not specified, the standard input (file descriptor 0) is used.

       The operator

              [<u>n</u>]<b>&gt;&amp;</b><u>word</u>

       is used similarly to duplicate output file descriptors.  If <u>n</u> is not specified, the  standard  output
       (file descriptor 1) is used.  If the digits in <u>word</u> do not specify a file descriptor open for output,
       a redirection error occurs.  As a special case, if <u>n</u> is omitted, and <u>word</u> does not expand to  one  or
       more digits, the standard output and standard error are redirected as described previously.

   <b>Moving</b> <b>File</b> <b>Descriptors</b>
       The redirection operator

              [<u>n</u>]<b>&lt;&amp;</b><u>digit</u><b>-</b>

       moves  the file descriptor <u>digit</u> to file descriptor <u>n</u>, or the standard input (file descriptor 0) if <u>n</u>
       is not specified.  <u>digit</u> is closed after being duplicated to <u>n</u>.

       Similarly, the redirection operator

              [<u>n</u>]<b>&gt;&amp;</b><u>digit</u><b></b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">moves&nbsp;[n]&gt;&amp;digitmoves</font>

       moves the file descriptor <u>digit</u> to file descriptor <u>n</u>, or the standard output (file descriptor 1) if <u>n</u>
       is not specified.

   <b>Opening</b> <b>File</b> <b>Descriptors</b> <b>for</b> <b>Reading</b> <b>and</b> <b>Writing</b>
       The redirection operator

              [<u>n</u>]<b>&lt;&gt;</b><u>word</u>

       causes the file whose name is the expansion of <u>word</u> to be opened for both reading and writing on file
       descriptor <u>n</u>, or on file descriptor 0 if <u>n</u> is not specified.  If the file does not exist, it is  cre-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ated.&nbsp;created.</font>
       ated.

<b>ALIASES</b>
       <u>Aliases</u>  allow  a  string  to be substituted for a word when it is used as the first word of a simple
       command.  The shell maintains a list of aliases that may be set and unset with the <b>alias</b> and  <b>unalias</b>
       builtin  commands  (see  <b>SHELL</b>  <b>BUILTIN</b>  <b>COMMANDS</b>  below).  The first word of each simple command, if
       unquoted, is checked to see if it has an alias.  If so, that word is replaced  by  the  text  of  the
       alias.   The  characters  <b>/</b>,  <b>$</b>,  <b>`</b>,  and <b>=</b> and any of the shell <u>metacharacters</u> or quoting characters
       listed above may not appear in an alias name.  The replacement  text  may  contain  any  valid  shell
       input, including shell metacharacters.  The first word of the replacement text is tested for aliases,
       but a word that is identical to an alias being expanded is not expanded a second  time.   This  means
       that  one  may  alias  <b>ls</b>  to  <b>ls</b>  <b>-F</b>,  for instance, and <b>bash</b> does not try to recursively expand the
       replacement text.  If the last character of the alias value is a <u>blank</u>, then the  next  command  word
       following the alias is also checked for alias expansion.

       Aliases are created and listed with the <b>alias</b> command, and removed with the <b>unalias</b> command.

       There  is no mechanism for using arguments in the replacement text.  If arguments are needed, a shell
       function should be used (see <b>FUNCTIONS</b> below).

       Aliases are not expanded when the shell is not interactive, unless the <b>expand_aliases</b> shell option is
       set using <b>shopt</b> (see the description of <b>shopt</b> under <b>SHELL</b> <b>BUILTIN</b> <b>COMMANDS</b> below).

       The  rules concerning the definition and use of aliases are somewhat confusing.  <b>Bash</b> always reads at
       least one complete line of input before executing any of the commands  on  that  line.   Aliases  are
       expanded  when  a command is read, not when it is executed.  Therefore, an alias definition appearing
       on the same line as another command does not take effect until the next line of input is  read.   The
       commands  following the alias definition on that line are not affected by the new alias.  This behav-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ior&nbsp;behavior</font>
       ior is also an issue when functions are executed.  Aliases are expanded when a function definition is
       read,  not when the function is executed, because a function definition is itself a compound command.
       As a consequence, aliases defined in a function are not available until after that function  is  exe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cuted.&nbsp;executed.</font>
       cuted.  To be safe, always put alias definitions on a separate line, and do not use <b>alias</b> in compound
       commands.

       For almost every purpose, aliases are superseded by shell functions.

<b>FUNCTIONS</b>
       A shell function, defined as described above under <b>SHELL</b> <b>GRAMMAR</b>, stores a  series  of  commands  for
       later  execution.   When  the  name of a shell function is used as a simple command name, the list of
       commands associated with that function name is executed.  Functions are executed in  the  context  of
       the current shell; no new process is created to interpret them (contrast this with the execution of a
       shell script).  When a function is executed, the arguments to  the  function  become  the  positional
       parameters  during its execution.  The special parameter <b>#</b> is updated to reflect the change.  Special
       parameter 0 is unchanged.  The first element of the <b>FUNCNAME</b> variable is set to the name of the func-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;function</font>
       tion while the function is executing.  All other aspects of the shell execution environment are iden-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tical&nbsp;identical</font>
       tical between a function and its caller with the exception that the <b>DEBUG</b> and <b>RETURN</b> traps  (see  the
       description  of  the  <b>trap</b>  builtin  under <b>SHELL</b> <b>BUILTIN</b> <b>COMMANDS</b> below) are not inherited unless the
       function has been given the <b>trace</b> attribute (see the description of the <b>declare</b> builtin below) or the
       <b>-o</b>  <b>functrace</b> shell option has been enabled with the <b>set</b> builtin (in which case all functions inherit
       the <b>DEBUG</b> and <b>RETURN</b> traps).

       Variables local to the function may be declared with the <b>local</b> builtin  command.   Ordinarily,  vari-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ables&nbsp;variables</font>
       ables and their values are shared between the function and its caller.

       If the builtin command <b>return</b> is executed in a function, the function completes and execution resumes
       with the next command after the function call.  Any command associated with the <b>RETURN</b> trap  is  exe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cuted&nbsp;executed</font>
       cuted  before  execution resumes.  When a function completes, the values of the positional parameters
       and the special parameter <b>#</b> are restored to the values they had prior to the function's execution.

       Function names and definitions may be listed with the <b>-f</b> option to the  <b>declare</b>  or  <b>typeset</b>  builtin
       commands.   The <b>-F</b> option to <b>declare</b> or <b>typeset</b> will list the function names only (and optionally the
       source file and line number, if the <b>extdebug</b> shell option is enabled).  Functions may be exported  so
       that  subshells automatically have them defined with the <b>-f</b> option to the <b>export</b> builtin.  A function
       definition may be deleted using the <b>-f</b> option to the <b>unset</b> builtin.  Note that  shell  functions  and
       variables  with  the  same  name  may result in multiple identically-named entries in the environment
       passed to the shell's children.  Care should be taken in cases where this may cause a problem.

       Functions may be recursive.  No limit is imposed on the number of recursive calls.

<b>ARITHMETIC</b> <b>EVALUATION</b>
       The shell allows arithmetic expressions to be evaluated, under certain circumstances (see the <b>let</b> and
       <b>declare</b>  builtin commands and <b>Arithmetic</b> <b>Expansion</b>).  Evaluation is done in fixed-width integers with
       no check for overflow, though division by 0 is trapped and flagged as an error.   The  operators  and
       their precedence, associativity, and values are the same as in the C language.  The following list of
       operators is grouped into levels of equal-precedence operators.  The levels are listed  in  order  of
       decreasing precedence.

       <u>id</u><b>++</b> <u>id</u><b>-</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">variable&nbsp;id-variable</font>
              variable post-increment and post-decrement
       <b>++</b><u>id</u> <b>--</b><u>id</u>
              variable pre-increment and pre-decrement
       <b>-</b> <b>+</b>    unary minus and plus
       <b>!</b> <b>~</b>    logical and bitwise negation
       <b>**</b>     exponentiation
       <b>*</b> <b>/</b> <b>%</b>  multiplication, division, remainder
       <b>+</b> <b>-</b>    addition, subtraction
       <b>&lt;&lt;</b> <b>&gt;&gt;</b>  left and right bitwise shifts
       <b>&lt;=</b> <b>&gt;=</b> <b>&lt;</b> <b>&gt;</b>
              comparison
       <b>==</b> <b>!=</b>  equality and inequality
       <b>&amp;</b>      bitwise AND
       <b>^</b>      bitwise exclusive OR
       <b>|</b>      bitwise OR
       <b>&amp;&amp;</b>     logical AND
       <b>||</b>     logical OR
       <u>expr</u><b>?</b><u>expr</u><b>:</b><u>expr</u>
              conditional operator
       <b>=</b> <b>*=</b> <b>/=</b> <b>%=</b> <b>+=</b> <b>-=</b> <b>&lt;&lt;=</b> <b>&gt;&gt;=</b> <b>&amp;=</b> <b>^=</b> <b>|=</b>
              assignment
       <u>expr1</u> <b>,</b> <u>expr2</u>
              comma

       Shell  variables  are  allowed as operands; parameter expansion is performed before the expression is
       evaluated.  Within an expression, shell variables may also be referenced by name  without  using  the
       parameter expansion syntax.  A shell variable that is null or unset evaluates to 0 when referenced by
       name without using the parameter expansion syntax.  The value of a variable is evaluated as an arith-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">metic&nbsp;arithmetic</font>
       metic expression when it is referenced, or when a variable which has been given the <u>integer</u> attribute
       using <b>declare</b> <b>-i</b> is assigned a value.  A null value evaluates to 0.  A shell variable need  not  have
       its integer attribute turned on to be used in an expression.

       Constants with a leading 0 are interpreted as octal numbers.  A leading 0x or 0X denotes hexadecimal.
       Otherwise, numbers take the form [<u>base#</u>]n, where <u>base</u> is a decimal number between 2 and 64 represent-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;representing</font>
       ing  the arithmetic base, and <u>n</u> is a number in that base.  If <u>base#</u> is omitted, then base 10 is used.
       The digits greater than 9 are represented by the lowercase letters, the uppercase letters, @, and  _,
       in  that  order.   If  <u>base</u>  is less than or equal to 36, lowercase and uppercase letters may be used
       interchangeably to represent numbers between 10 and 35.

       Operators are evaluated in order of precedence.  Sub-expressions in parentheses are  evaluated  first
       and may override the precedence rules above.

<b>CONDITIONAL</b> <b>EXPRESSIONS</b>
       Conditional  expressions  are  used by the <b>[[</b> compound command and the <b>test</b> and <b>[</b> builtin commands to
       test file attributes and perform string and arithmetic comparisons.  Expressions are formed from  the
       following  unary  or  binary  primaries.  If any <u>file</u> argument to one of the primaries is of the form
       <u>/dev/fd/n</u>, then file descriptor <u>n</u> is checked.  If the <u>file</u> argument to one of the primaries is one of
       <u>/dev/stdin</u>, <u>/dev/stdout</u>, or <u>/dev/stderr</u>, file descriptor 0, 1, or 2, respectively, is checked.

       Unless  otherwise specified, primaries that operate on files follow symbolic links and operate on the
       target of the link, rather than the link itself.

              than or equal to <u>arg2</u>, respectively.  <u>Arg1</u> and <u>arg2</u> may be positive or negative integers.

<b>SIMPLE</b> <b>COMMAND</b> <b>EXPANSION</b>
       When a simple command is executed, the shell performs  the  following  expansions,  assignments,  and
       redirections, from left to right.

       1.     The  words  that  the  parser  has marked as variable assignments (those preceding the command
              name) and redirections are saved for later processing.

       2.     The words that are not variable assignments or redirections are expanded.  If any words remain
              after expansion, the first word is taken to be the name of the command and the remaining words
              are the arguments.

       3.     Redirections are performed as described above under <b>REDIRECTION</b>.

       4.     The text after the <b>=</b> in each variable assignment undergoes tilde expansion,  parameter  expan-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion,&nbsp;expansion,</font>
              sion,  command  substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal before being assigned to
              the variable.

       If no command name results, the variable assignments affect the current  shell  environment.   Other-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">wise,&nbsp;Otherwise,</font>
       wise,  the  variables are added to the environment of the executed command and do not affect the cur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rent&nbsp;current</font>
       rent shell environment.  If any of the assignments attempts to assign a value to a readonly variable,
       an error occurs, and the command exits with a non-zero status.

       If  no command name results, redirections are performed, but do not affect the current shell environ-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment.&nbsp;environment.</font>
       ment.  A redirection error causes the command to exit with a non-zero status.

       If there is a command name left after expansion, execution proceeds as described  below.   Otherwise,
       the command exits.  If one of the expansions contained a command substitution, the exit status of the
       command is the exit status of the last command substitution performed.  If there were no command sub-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">stitutions,&nbsp;substitutions,</font>
       stitutions, the command exits with a status of zero.

<b>COMMAND</b> <b>EXECUTION</b>
       After  a command has been split into words, if it results in a simple command and an optional list of
       arguments, the following actions are taken.

       If the command name contains no slashes, the shell attempts to locate it.  If there  exists  a  shell
       function  by  that  name, that function is invoked as described above in <b>FUNCTIONS</b>.  If the name does
       not match a function, the shell searches for it in the list of shell builtins.  If a match is  found,
       that builtin is invoked.

       If  the  name  is neither a shell function nor a builtin, and contains no slashes, <b>bash</b> searches each
       element of the <b>PATH</b> for a directory containing an executable file by that name.  <b>Bash</b> uses a hash ta-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ble&nbsp;table</font>
       ble to remember the full pathnames of executable files (see <b>hash</b> under <b>SHELL</b> <b>BUILTIN</b> <b>COMMANDS</b> below).
       A full search of the directories in <b>PATH</b> is performed only if the command is not found  in  the  hash
       table.   If  the search is unsuccessful, the shell prints an error message and returns an exit status
       of 127.

       If the search is successful, or if the command name contains one or more slashes, the shell  executes
       the  named program in a separate execution environment.  Argument 0 is set to the name given, and the
       remaining arguments to the command are set to the arguments given, if any.

       If this execution fails because the file is not in executable format, and the file is  not  a  direc-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tory,&nbsp;directory,</font>
       tory, it is assumed to be a <u>shell</u> <u>script</u>, a file containing shell commands.  A subshell is spawned to
       execute it.  This subshell reinitializes itself, so that the effect is as if a  new  shell  had  been
       invoked  to  handle  the  script, with the exception that the locations of commands remembered by the
       parent (see <b>hash</b> below under <b>SHELL</b> <b>BUILTIN</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>) are retained by the child.

       If the program is a file beginning with <b>#!</b>, the remainder of the first line specifies an  interpreter
       for  the program.  The shell executes the specified interpreter on operating systems that do not han-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dle&nbsp;handle</font>
       dle this executable format themselves.  The arguments to the interpreter consist of a single optional
       argument following the interpreter name on the first line of the program, followed by the name of the
       program, followed by the command arguments, if any.

<b>COMMAND</b> <b>EXECUTION</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b>
       The shell has an <u>execution</u> <u>environment</u>, which consists of the following:


             open files inherited by the shell at invocation, as modified by redirections supplied  to  the
              <b>exec</b> builtin

             the current working directory as set by <b>cd</b>, <b>pushd</b>, or <b>popd</b>, or inherited by the shell at invo-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cation&nbsp;invocation</font>
              cation

             the file creation mode mask as set by <b>umask</b> or inherited from the shell's parent

             current traps set by <b>trap</b>

             shell parameters that are set by variable assignment or with <b>set</b> or inherited from the shell's
              parent in the environment

             shell  functions defined during execution or inherited from the shell's parent in the environ-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment&nbsp;environment</font>
              ment

             options enabled at invocation (either by default or with command-line arguments) or by <b>set</b>

             options enabled by <b>shopt</b>

             shell aliases defined with <b>alias</b>

             various process IDs, including those of background jobs, the value of <b>$$</b>,  and  the  value  of
              <b>$PPID</b>

       When  a  simple  command other than a builtin or shell function is to be executed, it is invoked in a
       separate execution environment that consists of the following.  Unless otherwise  noted,  the  values
       are inherited from the shell.


             the  shell's open files, plus any modifications and additions specified by redirections to the
              command

             the current working directory

             the file creation mode mask

             shell variables and functions marked for export, along with variables exported  for  the  com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand,&nbsp;command,</font>
              mand, passed in the environment

             traps caught by the shell are reset to the values inherited from the shell's parent, and traps
              ignored by the shell are ignored

       A command invoked in this separate environment cannot affect the shell's execution environment.

       Command substitution, commands grouped with parentheses, and asynchronous commands are invoked  in  a
       subshell  environment  that  is a duplicate of the shell environment, except that traps caught by the
       shell are reset to the values that the shell inherited from its parent at invocation.   Builtin  com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mands&nbsp;commands</font>
       mands  that  are  invoked as part of a pipeline are also executed in a subshell environment.  Changes
       made to the subshell environment cannot affect the shell's execution environment.

       If a command is followed by a <b>&amp;</b> and job control is not active, the default  standard  input  for  the
       command is the empty file <u>/dev/null</u>.  Otherwise, the invoked command inherits the file descriptors of
       the calling shell as modified by redirections.

<b>ENVIRONMENT</b>
       When a program is invoked it is given an array of strings called the <u>environment</u>.  This is a list  of
       <u>name</u>-<u>value</u> pairs, of the form <u>name</u>=<u>value</u>.

       The  shell  provides  several ways to manipulate the environment.  On invocation, the shell scans its
       own environment and creates a parameter for each name found, automatically marking it for  <u>export</u>  to
       child  processes.   Executed  commands  inherit  the environment.  The <b>export</b> and <b>declare</b> <b>-x</b> commands
       allow parameters and functions to be added to and deleted from the environment.  If the  value  of  a
       parameter  in  the  environment is modified, the new value becomes part of the environment, replacing
       the old.  The environment inherited by any executed command consists of the shell's initial  environ-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment,&nbsp;environment,</font>
       ment,  whose  values  may be modified in the shell, less any pairs removed by the <b>unset</b> command, plus
       any additions via the <b>export</b> and <b>declare</b> <b>-x</b> commands.

       The environment for any <u>simple</u> <u>command</u> or function may be augmented temporarily by prefixing it  with
       parameter assignments, as described above in <b>PARAMETERS</b>.  These assignment statements affect only the
       environment seen by that command.

       If the <b>-k</b> option is set (see the <b>set</b> builtin command  below),  then  <u>all</u>  parameter  assignments  are
       placed in the environment for a command, not just those that precede the command name.

       When <b>bash</b> invokes an external command, the variable <b>_</b> is set to the full file name of the command and
       passed to that command in its environment.

<b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b>
       For the shell's purposes, a command which exits with a zero exit status has succeeded.  An exit  sta-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tus&nbsp;status</font>
       tus  of zero indicates success.  A non-zero exit status indicates failure.  When a command terminates
       on a fatal signal <u>N</u>, <b>bash</b> uses the value of 128+<u>N</u> as the exit status.

       If a command is not found, the child process created to execute it returns a status  of  127.   If  a
       command is found but is not executable, the return status is 126.

       If  a  command  fails because of an error during expansion or redirection, the exit status is greater
       than zero.

       Shell builtin commands return a status of 0 (<u>true</u>) if successful, and non-zero (<u>false</u>)  if  an  error
       occurs while they execute.  All builtins return an exit status of 2 to indicate incorrect usage.

       <b>Bash</b>  itself  returns  the exit status of the last command executed, unless a syntax error occurs, in
       which case it exits with a non-zero value.  See also the <b>exit</b> builtin command below.

<b>SIGNALS</b>
       When <b>bash</b> is interactive, in the absence of any traps, it ignores <b>SIGTERM</b> (so that <b>kill</b>  <b>0</b>  does  not
       kill  an interactive shell), and <b>SIGINT</b> is caught and handled (so that the <b>wait</b> builtin is interrupt-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ible).&nbsp;interruptible).</font>
       ible).  In all cases, <b>bash</b> ignores <b>SIGQUIT</b>.  If job control is in effect, <b>bash</b> ignores <b>SIGTTIN</b>, <b>SIGT</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">TOU,&nbsp;SIGTTOU,</font>
       <b>TOU</b>, and <b>SIGTSTP</b>.

       Non-builtin  commands  run by <b>bash</b> have signal handlers set to the values inherited by the shell from
       its parent.  When job control is not in effect, asynchronous commands ignore <b>SIGINT</b>  and  <b>SIGQUIT</b>  in
       addition  to  these  inherited handlers.  Commands run as a result of command substitution ignore the
       keyboard-generated job control signals <b>SIGTTIN</b>, <b>SIGTTOU</b>, and <b>SIGTSTP</b>.

       The shell exits by default upon receipt of a <b>SIGHUP</b>.  Before exiting, an  interactive  shell  resends
       the  <b>SIGHUP</b>  to  all  jobs,  running  or  stopped.  Stopped jobs are sent <b>SIGCONT</b> to ensure that they
       receive the <b>SIGHUP</b>.  To prevent the shell from sending the signal to a particular job, it  should  be
       removed  from  the jobs table with the <b>disown</b> builtin (see <b>SHELL</b> <b>BUILTIN</b> <b>COMMANDS</b> below) or marked to
       not receive <b>SIGHUP</b> using <b>disown</b> <b>-h</b>.

       If the <b>huponexit</b> shell option has been set with <b>shopt</b>, <b>bash</b> sends a <b>SIGHUP</b> to all jobs when an inter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">active&nbsp;interactive</font>
       active login shell exits.

       If <b>bash</b> is waiting for a command to complete and receives a signal for which a trap has been set, the
       trap will not be executed until the command completes.  When <b>bash</b> is waiting for an asynchronous com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
       mand  via  the  <b>wait</b>  builtin, the reception of a signal for which a trap has been set will cause the
       <b>wait</b> builtin to return immediately with an exit status greater than 128, immediately after which  the
       trap is executed.

<b>JOB</b> <b>CONTROL</b>
       <u>Job</u>  <u>control</u>  refers to the ability to selectively stop (<u>suspend</u>) the execution of processes and con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tinue&nbsp;continue</font>
       tinue (<u>resume</u>) their execution at a later point.  A user  typically  employs  this  facility  via  an
       interactive interface supplied jointly by the system's terminal driver and <b>bash</b>.

       The  shell  associates a <u>job</u> with each pipeline.  It keeps a table of currently executing jobs, which
       may be listed with the <b>jobs</b> command.  When <b>bash</b> starts a job asynchronously (in the  <u>background</u>),  it
       prints a line that looks like:

              [1] 25647

       indicating  that this job is job number 1 and that the process ID of the last process in the pipeline
       associated with this job is 25647.  All of the processes in a single pipeline are members of the same
       job.  <b>Bash</b> uses the <u>job</u> abstraction as the basis for job control.

       To facilitate the implementation of the user interface to job control, the operating system maintains
       the notion of a <u>current</u> <u>terminal</u> <u>process</u> <u>group</u> <u>ID</u>.  Members of this process  group  (processes  whose
       process  group  ID is equal to the current terminal process group ID) receive keyboard-generated sig-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nals&nbsp;signals</font>
       nals such as <b>SIGINT</b>.  These processes are said to be in the  <u>foreground</u>.   <u>Background</u>  processes  are
       those  whose process group ID differs from the terminal's; such processes are immune to keyboard-gen-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">erated&nbsp;keyboard-generated</font>
       erated signals.  Only foreground processes are allowed to read from or write to the terminal.   Back-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ground&nbsp;Background</font>
       ground processes which attempt to read from (write to) the terminal are sent a <b>SIGTTIN</b> <b>(SIGTTOU)</b> sig-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nal&nbsp;signal</font>
       nal by the terminal driver, which, unless caught, suspends the process.

       If the operating system on which <b>bash</b> is running supports job control, <b>bash</b>  contains  facilities  to
       use  it.   Typing  the  <u>suspend</u> character (typically <b>^Z</b>, Control-Z) while a process is running causes
       that process to be stopped and returns control to <b>bash</b>.  Typing the <u>delayed</u> <u>suspend</u> character  (typi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cally&nbsp;(typically</font>
       cally  <b>^Y</b>, Control-Y) causes the process to be stopped when it attempts to read input from the termi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nal,&nbsp;terminal,</font>
       nal, and control to be returned to <b>bash</b>.  The user may then manipulate the state of this  job,  using
       the  <b>bg</b> command to continue it in the background, the <b>fg</b> command to continue it in the foreground, or
       the <b>kill</b> command to kill it.  A <b>^Z</b> takes effect immediately, and has the additional  side  effect  of
       causing pending output and typeahead to be discarded.

       There  are  a  number of ways to refer to a job in the shell.  The character <b>%</b> introduces a job name.
       Job number <u>n</u> may be referred to as <b>%n</b>.  A job may also be referred to using a prefix of the name used
       to  start  it,  or  using a substring that appears in its command line.  For example, <b>%ce</b> refers to a
       stopped <b>ce</b> job.  If a prefix matches more than one job, <b>bash</b> reports an error.  Using  <b>%?ce</b>,  on  the
       other hand, refers to any job containing the string <b>ce</b> in its command line.  If the substring matches
       more than one job, <b>bash</b> reports an error.  The symbols <b>%%</b> and <b>%+</b> refer to the shell's notion  of  the
       <u>current</u>  <u>job</u>,  which  is  the last job stopped while it was in the foreground or started in the back-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ground.&nbsp;background.</font>
       ground.  The <u>previous</u> <u>job</u> may be referenced using <b>%-</b>.  In output pertaining to jobs (e.g., the output
       of  the  <b>jobs</b> command), the current job is always flagged with a <b>+</b>, and the previous job with a <b>-</b>.  A
       single % (with no accompanying job specification) also refers to the current job.

       Simply naming a job can be used to bring it into the foreground: <b>%1</b>  is  a  synonym  for  <b>``fg</b>  <b>%1''</b>,
       bringing  job  1  from  the background into the foreground.  Similarly, <b>``%1</b> <b>&amp;''</b> resumes job 1 in the
       background, equivalent to <b>``bg</b> <b>%1''</b>.

       The shell learns immediately whenever a job changes state.  Normally, <b>bash</b> waits until it is about to
       print  a  prompt  before reporting changes in a job's status so as to not interrupt any other output.
       If the <b>-b</b> option to the <b>set</b> builtin command is enabled, <b>bash</b> reports such changes  immediately.   Any
       trap on <b>SIGCHLD</b> is executed for each child that exits.

       If  an  attempt to exit <b>bash</b> is made while jobs are stopped, the shell prints a warning message.  The
       <b>jobs</b> command may then be used to inspect their status.  If a second attempt to exit is  made  without
       an  intervening  command,  the  shell does not print another warning, and the stopped jobs are termi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nated.&nbsp;terminated.</font>
       nated.

<b>PROMPTING</b>
       When executing interactively, <b>bash</b> displays the primary prompt <b>PS1</b> when it is ready to  read  a  com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand,&nbsp;command,</font>
       mand, and the secondary prompt <b>PS2</b> when it needs more input to complete a command.  <b>Bash</b> allows these
       prompt strings to be customized by inserting a number of backslash-escaped  special  characters  that
       are decoded as follows:
              <b>\a</b>     an ASCII bell character (07)
              <b>\d</b>     the date in "Weekday Month Date" format (e.g., "Tue May 26")
              <b>\D{</b><u>format</u><b>}</b>
                     the  <u>format</u> is passed to <a href="../man3/strftime.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/strftime"><u>strftime</u>(3)</a> and the result is inserted into the prompt string;
                     an empty <u>format</u> results in a  locale-specific  time  representation.   The  braces  are
                     required
              <b>\e</b>     an ASCII escape character (033)
              <b>\h</b>     the hostname up to the first `.'
              <b>\H</b>     the hostname
              <b>\j</b>     the number of jobs currently managed by the shell
              <b>\l</b>     the basename of the shell's terminal device name
              <b>\n</b>     newline
              <b>\r</b>     carriage return
              <b>\s</b>     the name of the shell, the basename of <b>$0</b> (the portion following the final slash)
              <b>\t</b>     the current time in 24-hour HH:MM:SS format
              <b>\T</b>     the current time in 12-hour HH:MM:SS format
              <b>\@</b>     the current time in 12-hour am/pm format
              <b>\A</b>     the current time in 24-hour HH:MM format
              <b>\u</b>     the username of the current user
              <b>\v</b>     the version of <b>bash</b> (e.g., 2.00)
              <b>\V</b>     the release of <b>bash</b>, version + patch level (e.g., 2.00.0)
              <b>\w</b>     the current working directory, with <b>$HOME</b> abbreviated with a tilde
              <b>\W</b>     the basename of the current working directory, with <b>$HOME</b> abbreviated with a tilde
              <b>\!</b>     the history number of this command
              <b>\#</b>     the command number of this command
              <b>\$</b>     if the effective UID is 0, a <b>#</b>, otherwise a <b>$</b>
              <b>\</b><u>nnn</u>   the character corresponding to the octal number <u>nnn</u>
              <b>\\</b>     a backslash
              <b>\[</b>     begin  a  sequence  of non-printing characters, which could be used to embed a terminal
                     control sequence into the prompt
              <b>\]</b>     end a sequence of non-printing characters

       The command number and the history number are usually different: the history number of a  command  is
       its position in the history list, which may include commands restored from the history file (see <b>HIS</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">TORY&nbsp;HISTORY</font>
       <b>TORY</b> below), while the command number is the position in the sequence of commands executed during the
       current  shell session.  After the string is decoded, it is expanded via parameter expansion, command
       substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal, subject to the value of the  <b>promptvars</b>  shell
       option (see the description of the <b>shopt</b> command under <b>SHELL</b> <b>BUILTIN</b> <b>COMMANDS</b> below).

<b>READLINE</b>
       This  is the library that handles reading input when using an interactive shell, unless the <b>--noedit</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;--noediting</font>
       <b>ing</b> option is given at shell invocation.  By default, the line editing commands are similar to  those
       of  emacs.   A vi-style line editing interface is also available.  To turn off line editing after the
       shell is running, use the <b>+o</b> <b>emacs</b> or <b>+o</b> <b>vi</b> options to the <b>set</b> builtin (see  <b>SHELL</b>  <b>BUILTIN</b>  <b>COMMANDS</b>
       below).

   <b>Readline</b> <b>Notation</b>
       In  this section, the emacs-style notation is used to denote keystrokes.  Control keys are denoted by
       C-<u>key</u>, e.g., C-n means Control-N.  Similarly, <u>meta</u> keys are denoted by M-<u>key</u>, so  M-x  means  Meta-X.
       (On  keyboards  without a <u>meta</u> key, M-<u>x</u> means ESC <u>x</u>, i.e., press the Escape key then the <u>x</u> key.  This
       makes ESC the <u>meta</u> <u>prefix</u>.  The combination M-C-<u>x</u> means ESC-Control-<u>x</u>, or press the Escape  key  then
       hold the Control key while pressing the <u>x</u> key.)

       Readline  commands  may be given numeric <u>arguments</u>, which normally act as a repeat count.  Sometimes,
       however, it is the sign of the argument that is significant.  Passing a negative argument to  a  com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
       mand  that  acts  in the forward direction (e.g., <b>kill-line</b>) causes that command to act in a backward
       direction.  Commands whose behavior with arguments deviates from this are noted below.

       When a command is described as <u>killing</u> text, the text deleted is saved for possible future  retrieval
       (<u>yanking</u>).   The killed text is saved in a <u>kill</u> <u>ring</u>.  Consecutive kills cause the text to be accumu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lated&nbsp;accumulated</font>
       lated into one unit, which can be yanked all at once.  Commands which do not kill text  separate  the
       chunks of text on the kill ring.

   <b>Readline</b> <b>Initialization</b>
       Readline is customized by putting commands in an initialization file (the <u>inputrc</u> file).  The name of
       this file is taken from the value of the <b>INPUTRC</b> variable.  If that variable is unset, the default is
       <u>~/.inputrc</u>.   When  a  program  which uses the readline library starts up, the initialization file is
       read, and the key bindings and variables are set.  There are only a few basic constructs  allowed  in
       the  readline  initialization file.  Blank lines are ignored.  Lines beginning with a <b>#</b> are comments.
       Lines beginning with a <b>$</b> indicate conditional constructs.  Other lines denote key bindings and  vari-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able&nbsp;variable</font>
       able settings.

       The  default  key-bindings may be changed with an <u>inputrc</u> file.  Other programs that use this library
       may add their own commands and bindings.

       For example, placing

              M-Control-u: universal-argument
       or
              C-Meta-u: universal-argument
       into the <u>inputrc</u> would make M-C-u execute the readline command <u>universal-argument</u>.

       The following symbolic character names are recognized: <u>RUBOUT</u>, <u>DEL</u>, <u>ESC</u>, <u>LFD</u>, <u>NEWLINE</u>,  <u>RET</u>,  <u>RETURN</u>,
       <u>SPC</u>, <u>SPACE</u>, and <u>TAB</u>.

       In  addition to command names, readline allows keys to be bound to a string that is inserted when the
       key is pressed (a <u>macro</u>).

   <b>Readline</b> <b>Key</b> <b>Bindings</b>
       The syntax for controlling key bindings in the <u>inputrc</u> file is simple.  All that is required  is  the
       name  of  the command or the text of a macro and a key sequence to which it should be bound. The name
       may be specified in one of two ways: as a symbolic key name, possibly with  <u>Meta-</u>  or  <u>Control-</u>  pre-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fixes,&nbsp;prefixes,</font>
       fixes, or as a key sequence.

       When  using  the  form  <b>keyname</b>:<u>function-name</u>  or  <u>macro</u>, <u>keyname</u> is the name of a key spelled out in
       English.  For example:

              Control-u: universal-argument
              Meta-Rubout: backward-kill-word
              Control-o: "&gt; output"

       In the above example, <u>C-u</u> is bound to the function <b>universal-argument</b>, <u>M-DEL</u> is bound to the function
       <b>backward-kill-word</b>,  and  <u>C-o</u> is bound to run the macro expressed on the right hand side (that is, to
       insert the text ``&gt; output'' into the line).

       In the second form, <b>"keyseq"</b>:<u>function-name</u> or <u>macro</u>,  <b>keyseq</b>  differs  from  <b>keyname</b>  above  in  that
       strings  denoting  an  entire  key  sequence  may  be specified by placing the sequence within double
       quotes.  Some GNU Emacs style key escapes can be used, as in the following example, but the  symbolic
       character names are not recognized.

              "\C-u": universal-argument
              "\C-x\C-r": re-read-init-file
              "\e[11~": "Function Key 1"

       In  this  example,  <u>C-u</u>  is  again bound to the function <b>universal-argument</b>.  <u>C-x</u> <u>C-r</u> is bound to the
       function <b>re-read-init-file</b>, and <u>ESC</u> <u>[</u> <u>1</u> <u>1</u> <u>~</u> is bound to insert the text ``Function Key 1''.

       The full set of GNU Emacs style escape sequences is
              <b>\C-</b>    control prefix
              <b>\M-</b>    meta prefix
              <b>\e</b>     an escape character
              <b>\\</b>     backslash
              <b>\"</b>     literal "
              <b>\'</b>     literal '

       In addition to the GNU Emacs style escape sequences, a second set of backslash escapes is available:
              <b>\a</b>     alert (bell)
              <b>\b</b>     backspace
              <b>\d</b>     delete
              <b>\f</b>     form feed
              <b>\n</b>     newline
              <b>\r</b>     carriage return
              <b>\t</b>     horizontal tab
              <b>\v</b>     vertical tab
              <b>\</b><u>nnn</u>   the eight-bit character whose value is the octal value <u>nnn</u> (one to three digits)
              <b>\x</b><u>HH</u>   the eight-bit character whose value is the hexadecimal value <u>HH</u> (one or two hex digits)

       When  entering  the text of a macro, single or double quotes must be used to indicate a macro defini-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion.&nbsp;definition.</font>
       tion.  Unquoted text is assumed to be a function name.  In the  macro  body,  the  backslash  escapes
       described  above are expanded.  Backslash will quote any other character in the macro text, including
       " and '.

       <b>Bash</b> allows the current readline key bindings to be displayed or modified with the <b>bind</b> builtin  com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand.&nbsp;command.</font>
       mand.   The  editing  mode  may  be switched during interactive use by using the <b>-o</b> option to the <b>set</b>
       builtin command (see <b>SHELL</b> <b>BUILTIN</b> <b>COMMANDS</b> below).

   <b>Readline</b> <b>Variables</b>
       Readline has variables that can be used to further customize its behavior.  A variable may be set  in
       the <u>inputrc</u> file with a statement of the form

              <b>set</b> <u>variable-name</u> <u>value</u>

       Except  where  noted,  readline  variables  can  take  the values <b>On</b> or <b>Off</b> (without regard to case).
       Unrecognized variable names are ignored.  When a variable value is read, empty or null  values,  "on"
       (case-insensitive), and "1" are equivalent to <b>On</b>.  All other values are equivalent to <b>Off</b>.  The vari-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ables&nbsp;variables</font>
       ables and their default values are:

       <b>bell-style</b> <b>(audible)</b>
              Controls what happens when readline wants to ring the terminal bell.  If set to <b>none</b>, readline
              never  rings  the  bell.  If set to <b>visible</b>, readline uses a visible bell if one is available.
              If set to <b>audible</b>, readline attempts to ring the terminal's bell.
       <b>bind-tty-special-chars</b> <b>(On)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, readline attempts to bind the control characters treated specially by  the  ker-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nel's&nbsp;kernel's</font>
              nel's terminal driver to their readline equivalents.
       <b>comment-begin</b> <b>(``#'')</b>
              The  string  that is inserted when the readline <b>insert-comment</b> command is executed.  This com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
              mand is bound to <b>M-#</b> in emacs mode and to <b>#</b> in vi command mode.
       <b>completion-ignore-case</b> <b>(Off)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, readline performs filename matching and completion in a  case-insensitive  fash-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ion.&nbsp;fashion.</font>
              ion.
       <b>completion-query-items</b> <b>(100)</b>
              This determines when the user is queried about viewing the number of possible completions gen-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">erated&nbsp;generated</font>
              erated by the <b>possible-completions</b> command.  It may be set to any integer value  greater  than
              or equal to zero.  If the number of possible completions is greater than or equal to the value
              of this variable, the user is asked whether or not he wishes to view them; otherwise they  are
              simply listed on the terminal.
       <b>convert-meta</b> <b>(On)</b>
              If  set  to  <b>On</b>,  readline  will  convert  characters  with the eighth bit set to an ASCII key
              sequence by stripping the eighth bit and prefixing  an  escape  character  (in  effect,  using
              escape as the <u>meta</u> <u>prefix</u>).
       <b>disable-completion</b> <b>(Off)</b>
              If  set  to <b>On</b>, readline will inhibit word completion.  Completion characters will be inserted
              into the line as if they had been mapped to <b>self-insert</b>.
       <b>editing-mode</b> <b>(emacs)</b>
              Controls whether readline begins with a set of key bindings similar to  <u>emacs</u>  or  <u>vi</u>.   <b>edit</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing-mode&nbsp;editing-mode</font>
              <b>ing-mode</b> can be set to either <b>emacs</b> or <b>vi</b>.
       <b>enable-keypad</b> <b>(Off)</b>
              When  set  to  <b>On</b>, readline will try to enable the application keypad when it is called.  Some
              systems need this to enable the arrow keys.
       <b>expand-tilde</b> <b>(Off)</b>
              If set to <b>on</b>, tilde expansion is performed when readline attempts word completion.
       <b>history-preserve-point</b> <b>(Off)</b>
              If set to <b>on</b>, the history code attempts to place point at the same location  on  each  history
              line retrieved with <b>previous-history</b> or <b>next-history</b>.
       <b>horizontal-scroll-mode</b> <b>(Off)</b>
              When set to <b>On</b>, makes readline use a single line for display, scrolling the input horizontally
              on a single screen line when it becomes longer than the screen width rather than wrapping to a
              new line.
       <b>input-meta</b> <b>(Off)</b>
              If  set  to  <b>On</b>, readline will enable eight-bit input (that is, it will not strip the high bit
              from the characters it reads), regardless of what the terminal claims  it  can  support.   The
              name <b>meta-flag</b> is a synonym for this variable.
       <b>isearch-terminators</b> <b>(``C-[C-J'')</b>
              The string of characters that should terminate an incremental search without subsequently exe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cuting&nbsp;executing</font>
              cuting the character as a command.  If this variable has not been given a value,  the  charac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ters&nbsp;characters</font>
              ters <u>ESC</u> and <u>C-J</u> will terminate an incremental search.
       <b>keymap</b> <b>(emacs)</b>
              Set  the  current  readline  keymap.   The set of valid keymap names is <u>emacs,</u> <u>emacs-standard,</u>
              <u>emacs-meta,</u> <u>emacs-ctlx,</u> <u>vi,</u> <u>vi-command</u>, and <u>vi-insert</u>.  <u>vi</u> is equivalent to <u>vi-command</u>;  <u>emacs</u>
              is  equivalent  to <u>emacs-standard</u>.  The default value is <u>emacs</u>; the value of <b>editing-mode</b> also
              affects the default keymap.
       <b>mark-directories</b> <b>(On)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, completed directory names have a slash appended.
       <b>mark-modified-lines</b> <b>(Off)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, history lines that have been modified are displayed with  a  preceding  asterisk
              (<b>*</b>).
       <b>mark-symlinked-directories</b> <b>(Off)</b>
              If  set  to  <b>On</b>, completed names which are symbolic links to directories have a slash appended
              (subject to the value of <b>mark-directories</b>).
       <b>match-hidden-files</b> <b>(On)</b>
              This variable, when set to <b>On</b>, causes readline to match files whose names  begin  with  a  `.'
              (hidden  files) when performing filename completion, unless the leading `.' is supplied by the
              user in the filename to be completed.
       <b>output-meta</b> <b>(Off)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, readline will display characters with the eighth bit set directly rather than as
              a meta-prefixed escape sequence.
       <b>page-completions</b> <b>(On)</b>
              If  set  to  <b>On</b>,  readline uses an internal <u>more</u>-like pager to display a screenful of possible
              completions at a time.
       <b>print-completions-horizontally</b> <b>(Off)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, readline will display completions with matches sorted horizontally in alphabeti-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cal&nbsp;alphabetical</font>
              cal order, rather than down the screen.
       <b>show-all-if-ambiguous</b> <b>(Off)</b>
              This  alters the default behavior of the completion functions.  If set to <b>on</b>, words which have
              more than one possible completion cause the matches to be listed immediately instead of  ring-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;ringing</font>
              ing the bell.
       <b>show-all-if-unmodified</b> <b>(Off)</b>
              This  alters  the  default  behavior  of  the  completion  functions  in  a fashion similar to
              <b>show-all-if-ambiguous</b>.  If set to <b>on</b>, words which have more than one possible completion with-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">out&nbsp;without</font>
              out  any  possible  partial  completion (the possible completions don't share a common prefix)
              cause the matches to be listed immediately instead of ringing the bell.
       <b>visible-stats</b> <b>(Off)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, a character denoting a file's type as reported by <a href="../man2/stat.2.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/2/stat"><u>stat</u>(2)</a>  is  appended  to  the
              filename when listing possible completions.

   <b>Readline</b> <b>Conditional</b> <b>Constructs</b>
       Readline  implements  a  facility  similar in spirit to the conditional compilation features of the C
       preprocessor which allows key bindings and variable settings to be performed as the result of  tests.
       There are four parser directives used.

       <b>$if</b>    The  <b>$if</b>  construct  allows  bindings to be made based on the editing mode, the terminal being
              used, or the application using readline.  The text of the test extends to the end of the line;
              no characters are required to isolate it.

              <b>mode</b>   The  <b>mode=</b> form of the <b>$if</b> directive is used to test whether readline is in emacs or vi
                     mode.  This may be used in conjunction with the <b>set</b> <b>keymap</b> command,  for  instance,  to
                     set  bindings in the <u>emacs-standard</u> and <u>emacs-ctlx</u> keymaps only if readline is starting
                     out in emacs mode.

              <b>term</b>   The <b>term=</b> form may be used to include terminal-specific key bindings, perhaps  to  bind
                     the  key  sequences output by the terminal's function keys.  The word on the right side
                     of the <b>=</b> is tested against the both full name of the terminal and the  portion  of  the
                     terminal  name  before the first <b>-</b>.  This allows <u>sun</u> to match both <u>sun</u> and <u>sun-cmd</u>, for
                     instance.

              <b>application</b>
                     The <b>application</b> construct is used to include application-specific settings.  Each  pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">gram&nbsp;program</font>
                     gram  using  the readline library sets the <u>application</u> <u>name</u>, and an initialization file
                     can test for a particular value.  This could be used to bind key sequences to functions
                     useful for a specific program.  For instance, the following command adds a key sequence
                     that quotes the current or previous word in Bash:

                     <b>$if</b> Bash
                     # Quote the current or previous word
                     "\C-xq": "\eb\"\ef\""
                     <b>$endif</b>

       <b>$endif</b> This command, as seen in the previous example, terminates an <b>$if</b> command.

       <b>$else</b>  Commands in this branch of the <b>$if</b> directive are executed if the test fails.

       <b>$include</b>
              This directive takes a single filename as an argument and reads  commands  and  bindings  from
              that file.  For example, the following directive would read <u>/etc/inputrc</u>:

              <b>$include</b>  <u>/etc/inputrc</u>

   <b>Searching</b>
       Readline  provides  commands  for searching through the command history (see <b>HISTORY</b> below) for lines
       containing a specified string.  There are two search modes: <u>incremental</u> and <u>non-incremental</u>.

       Incremental searches begin before the user has finished typing the search string.  As each  character
       of  the search string is typed, readline displays the next entry from the history matching the string
       typed so far.  An incremental search requires only as many characters as needed to find  the  desired
       history  entry.   The characters present in the value of the <b>isearch-terminators</b> variable are used to
       terminate an incremental search.  If that variable has not been assigned a value the Escape and  Con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">trol-J&nbsp;Control-J</font>
       trol-J  characters  will terminate an incremental search.  Control-G will abort an incremental search
       and restore the original line.  When the search is  terminated,  the  history  entry  containing  the
       search string becomes the current line.

       To find other matching entries in the history list, type Control-S or Control-R as appropriate.  This
       will search backward or forward in the history for the next entry matching the search string typed so
       far.   Any  other key sequence bound to a readline command will terminate the search and execute that
       command.  For instance, a <u>newline</u> will terminate the search and accept the  line,  thereby  executing
       the command from the history list.

       Readline  remembers  the  last  incremental  search  string.  If two Control-Rs are typed without any
       intervening characters defining a new search string, any remembered search string is used.

       Non-incremental searches read the entire search string before starting to search for matching history
       lines.  The search string may be typed by the user or be part of the contents of the current line.

   <b>Readline</b> <b>Command</b> <b>Names</b>
       The  following is a list of the names of the commands and the default key sequences to which they are
       bound.  Command names without an accompanying key sequence are unbound by default.  In the  following
       descriptions, <u>point</u> refers to the current cursor position, and <u>mark</u> refers to a cursor position saved
       by the <b>set-mark</b> command.  The text between the point and mark is referred to as the <u>region</u>.

   <b>Commands</b> <b>for</b> <b>Moving</b>
       <b>beginning-of-line</b> <b>(C-a)</b>
              Move to the start of the current line.
       <b>end-of-line</b> <b>(C-e)</b>
              Move to the end of the line.
       <b>forward-char</b> <b>(C-f)</b>
              Move forward a character.
       <b>backward-char</b> <b>(C-b)</b>
              Move back a character.
       <b>forward-word</b> <b>(M-f)</b>
              Move forward to the end of the next word.  Words are composed of alphanumeric characters (let-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ters&nbsp;(letters</font>
              ters and digits).
       <b>backward-word</b> <b>(M-b)</b>
              Move  back  to  the start of the current or previous word.  Words are composed of alphanumeric
              characters (letters and digits).
       <b>clear-screen</b> <b>(C-l)</b>
              Clear the screen leaving the current line at the top of the screen.  With an argument, refresh
              the current line without clearing the screen.
       <b>redraw-current-line</b>
              Refresh the current line.

   <b>Commands</b> <b>for</b> <b>Manipulating</b> <b>the</b> <b>History</b>
       <b>accept-line</b> <b>(Newline,</b> <b>Return)</b>
              Accept  the  line regardless of where the cursor is.  If this line is non-empty, add it to the
              history list according to the state of the <b>HISTCONTROL</b> variable.  If the line  is  a  modified
              history line, then restore the history line to its original state.
       <b>previous-history</b> <b>(C-p)</b>
              Fetch the previous command from the history list, moving back in the list.
       <b>next-history</b> <b>(C-n)</b>
              Fetch the next command from the history list, moving forward in the list.
       <b>beginning-of-history</b> <b>(M-&lt;)</b>
              Move to the first line in the history.
       <b>end-of-history</b> <b>(M-&gt;)</b>
              Move to the end of the input history, i.e., the line currently being entered.
       <b>reverse-search-history</b> <b>(C-r)</b>
              Search backward starting at the current line and moving `up' through the history as necessary.
              This is an incremental search.
       <b>forward-search-history</b> <b>(C-s)</b>
              Search forward starting at the current line and moving `down' through the  history  as  neces-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sary.&nbsp;necessary.</font>
              sary.  This is an incremental search.
       <b>non-incremental-reverse-search-history</b> <b>(M-p)</b>
              Search  backward  through  the  history  starting  at the current line using a non-incremental
              search for a string supplied by the user.
       <b>non-incremental-forward-search-history</b> <b>(M-n)</b>
              Search forward through the history using a non-incremental search for a string supplied by the
              user.
       <b>history-search-forward</b>
              Search  forward through the history for the string of characters between the start of the cur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rent&nbsp;current</font>
              rent line and the point.  This is a non-incremental search.
       <b>history-search-backward</b>
              Search backward through the history for the string of characters between the start of the cur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rent&nbsp;current</font>
              rent line and the point.  This is a non-incremental search.
       <b>yank-nth-arg</b> <b>(M-C-y)</b>
              Insert  the  first  argument  to the previous command (usually the second word on the previous
              line) at point.  With an argument <u>n</u>, insert the <u>n</u>th word from the previous command (the  words
              in the previous command begin with word 0).  A negative argument inserts the <u>n</u>th word from the
              end of the previous command.  Once the argument <u>n</u> is computed, the argument is extracted as if
              the "!<u>n</u>" history expansion had been specified.
       <b>yank-last-arg</b> <b>(M-.,</b> <b>M-_)</b>
              Insert  the  last  argument  to  the  previous  command (the last word of the previous history
              entry).   With  an  argument,  behave  exactly  like  <b>yank-nth-arg</b>.    Successive   calls   to
              <b>yank-last-arg</b>  move back through the history list, inserting the last argument of each line in
              turn.  The history expansion facilities are used to extract the last argument, as if the  "!$"
              history expansion had been specified.
       <b>shell-expand-line</b> <b>(M-C-e)</b>
              Expand  the  line as the shell does.  This performs alias and history expansion as well as all
              of the shell word expansions.  See <b>HISTORY</b> <b>EXPANSION</b> below for a description of history expan-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion.&nbsp;expansion.</font>
              sion.
       <b>history-expand-line</b> <b>(M-^)</b>
              Perform  history expansion on the current line.  See <b>HISTORY</b> <b>EXPANSION</b> below for a description
              of history expansion.
       <b>magic-space</b>
              Perform history expansion on the current line and insert a space.  See <b>HISTORY</b> <b>EXPANSION</b> below
              for a description of history expansion.
       <b>alias-expand-line</b>
              Perform  alias  expansion  on  the current line.  See <b>ALIASES</b> above for a description of alias
              expansion.
       <b>history-and-alias-expand-line</b>
              Perform history and alias expansion on the current line.
       <b>insert-last-argument</b> <b>(M-.,</b> <b>M-_)</b>
              A synonym for <b>yank-last-arg</b>.
       <b>operate-and-get-next</b> <b>(C-o)</b>
              Accept the current line for execution and fetch the next line relative  to  the  current  line
              from the history for editing.  Any argument is ignored.
       <b>edit-and-execute-command</b> <b>(C-xC-e)</b>
              Invoke  an editor on the current command line, and execute the result as shell commands.  <b>Bash</b>
              attempts to invoke <b>$FCEDIT</b>, <b>$EDITOR</b>, and <u>emacs</u> as the editor, in that order.

   <b>Commands</b> <b>for</b> <b>Changing</b> <b>Text</b>
       <b>delete-char</b> <b>(C-d)</b>
              Delete the character at point.  If point is at the beginning of the line, there are no charac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ters&nbsp;characters</font>
              ters  in the line, and the last character typed was not bound to <b>delete-char</b>, then return <b>EOF</b>.
       <b>backward-delete-char</b> <b>(Rubout)</b>
              Delete the character behind the cursor.  When given a numeric argument, save the deleted  text
              on the kill ring.
       <b>forward-backward-delete-char</b>
              Delete  the  character under the cursor, unless the cursor is at the end of the line, in which
              case the character behind the cursor is deleted.
       <b>quoted-insert</b> <b>(C-q,</b> <b>C-v)</b>
              Add the next character typed to the line verbatim.  This is how to insert characters like <b>C-q</b>,
              for example.
       <b>tab-insert</b> <b>(C-v</b> <b>TAB)</b>
              Insert a tab character.
       <b>self-insert</b> <b>(a,</b> <b>b,</b> <b>A,</b> <b>1,</b> <b>!,</b> <b>...)</b>
              Insert the character typed.
       <b>transpose-chars</b> <b>(C-t)</b>
              Drag  the  character before point forward over the character at point, moving point forward as
              well.  If point is at the end of the line, then this  transposes  the  two  characters  before
              point.  Negative arguments have no effect.
       <b>transpose-words</b> <b>(M-t)</b>
              Drag the word before point past the word after point, moving point over that word as well.  If
              point is at the end of the line, this transposes the last two words on the line.
       <b>upcase-word</b> <b>(M-u)</b>
              Uppercase the current (or following) word.  With a negative argument, uppercase  the  previous
              word, but do not move point.
       <b>downcase-word</b> <b>(M-l)</b>
              Lowercase  the  current (or following) word.  With a negative argument, lowercase the previous
              word, but do not move point.
       <b>capitalize-word</b> <b>(M-c)</b>
              Capitalize the current (or following) word.  With a negative argument, capitalize the previous
              word, but do not move point.
       <b>overwrite-mode</b>
              Toggle  overwrite  mode.   With  an  explicit positive numeric argument, switches to overwrite
              mode.  With an explicit non-positive numeric argument, switches to insert mode.  This  command
              affects  only  <b>emacs</b> mode; <b>vi</b> mode does overwrite differently.  Each call to <u>readline()</u> starts
              in insert mode.  In overwrite mode, characters bound to <b>self-insert</b> replace the text at  point
              rather  than  pushing the text to the right.  Characters bound to <b>backward-delete-char</b> replace
              the character before point with a space.  By default, this command is unbound.

   <b>Killing</b> <b>and</b> <b>Yanking</b>

              Kill all characters on the current line, no matter where point is.
       <b>kill-word</b> <b>(M-d)</b>
              Kill  from  point  to the end of the current word, or if between words, to the end of the next
              word.  Word boundaries are the same as those used by <b>forward-word</b>.
       <b>backward-kill-word</b> <b>(M-Rubout)</b>
              Kill the word behind point.  Word boundaries are the same as those used by <b>backward-word</b>.
       <b>unix-word-rubout</b> <b>(C-w)</b>
              Kill the word behind point, using white space as a word boundary.  The killed text is saved on
              the kill-ring.
       <b>unix-filename-rubout</b>
              Kill  the word behind point, using white space and the slash character as the word boundaries.
              The killed text is saved on the kill-ring.
       <b>delete-horizontal-space</b> <b>(M-\)</b>
              Delete all spaces and tabs around point.
       <b>kill-region</b>
              Kill the text in the current region.
       <b>copy-region-as-kill</b>
              Copy the text in the region to the kill buffer.
       <b>copy-backward-word</b>
              Copy the word before point to the kill buffer.  The word boundaries  are  the  same  as  <b>back</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ward-word.&nbsp;backward-word.</font>
              <b>ward-word</b>.
       <b>copy-forward-word</b>
              Copy  the  word  following point to the kill buffer.  The word boundaries are the same as <b>for</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ward-word.&nbsp;forward-word.</font>
              <b>ward-word</b>.
       <b>yank</b> <b>(C-y)</b>
              Yank the top of the kill ring into the buffer at point.
       <b>yank-pop</b> <b>(M-y)</b>
              Rotate the kill ring, and yank the new top.  Only works following <b>yank</b> or <b>yank-pop</b>.

   <b>Numeric</b> <b>Arguments</b>
       <b>digit-argument</b> <b>(M-0,</b> <b>M-1,</b> <b>...,</b> <b>M--)</b>
              Add this digit to the argument already accumulating, or start a new argument.   M--  starts  a
              negative argument.
       <b>universal-argument</b>
              This  is  another way to specify an argument.  If this command is followed by one or more dig-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">its,&nbsp;digits,</font>
              its, optionally with a leading minus sign, those digits define the argument.  If  the  command
              is  followed  by  digits, executing <b>universal-argument</b> again ends the numeric argument, but is
              otherwise ignored.  As a special case, if this command is immediately followed by a  character
              that  is  neither a digit or minus sign, the argument count for the next command is multiplied
              by four.  The argument count is initially one, so executing this function the first time makes
              the argument count four, a second time makes the argument count sixteen, and so on.

   <b>Completing</b>
       <b>complete</b> <b>(TAB)</b>
              Attempt to perform completion on the text before point.  <b>Bash</b> attempts completion treating the
              text as a variable (if the text begins with <b>$</b>), username (if the text begins with <b>~</b>), hostname
              (if the text begins with <b>@</b>), or command (including aliases and functions) in turn.  If none of
              these produces a match, filename completion is attempted.
       <b>possible-completions</b> <b>(M-?)</b>
              List the possible completions of the text before point.
       <b>insert-completions</b> <b>(M-*)</b>
              Insert all completions of the text before point that  would  have  been  generated  by  <b>possi</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ble-completions.&nbsp;possible-completions.</font>
              <b>ble-completions</b>.
       <b>menu-complete</b>
              Similar  to  <b>complete</b>, but replaces the word to be completed with a single match from the list
              of possible completions.  Repeated execution of <b>menu-complete</b> steps through the list of possi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ble&nbsp;possible</font>
              ble  completions,  inserting  each  match in turn.  At the end of the list of completions, the
              bell is rung (subject to the setting of <b>bell-style</b>) and the original  text  is  restored.   An
              argument  of  <u>n</u>  moves  <u>n</u> positions forward in the list of matches; a negative argument may be
              used to move backward through the list.  This command is intended to be bound to <b>TAB</b>,  but  is
              unbound by default.
       <b>delete-char-or-list</b>
              Deletes  the  character  under  the  cursor  if  not at the beginning or end of the line (like
              <b>delete-char</b>).  If at the end of the line, behaves identically to  <b>possible-completions</b>.   This
              command is unbound by default.

       <b>possible-username-completions</b> <b>(C-x</b> <b>~)</b>
              List the possible completions of the text before point, treating it as a username.
       <b>complete-variable</b> <b>(M-$)</b>
              Attempt completion on the text before point, treating it as a shell variable.
       <b>possible-variable-completions</b> <b>(C-x</b> <b>$)</b>
              List the possible completions of the text before point, treating it as a shell variable.

              tion attempts to match the text  against  aliases,  reserved  words,  shell  functions,  shell
              builtins, and finally executable filenames, in that order.
       <b>possible-command-completions</b> <b>(C-x</b> <b>!)</b>
              List the possible completions of the text before point, treating it as a command name.
       <b>dynamic-complete-history</b> <b>(M-TAB)</b>
              Attempt completion on the text before point, comparing the text against lines from the history
              list for possible completion matches.
       <b>complete-into-braces</b> <b>(M-{)</b>
              Perform filename completion and insert the list of possible completions enclosed within braces
              so the list is available to the shell (see <b>Brace</b> <b>Expansion</b> above).

   <b>Keyboard</b> <b>Macros</b>
       <b>start-kbd-macro</b> <b>(C-x</b> <b>()</b>

              typed at the keyboard.

   <b>Miscellaneous</b>
       <b>re-read-init-file</b> <b>(C-x</b> <b>C-r)</b>
              Read in the contents of the <u>inputrc</u> file, and incorporate any bindings or variable assignments
              found there.
       <b>abort</b> <b>(C-g)</b>
              Abort  the  current  editing  command  and ring the terminal's bell (subject to the setting of
              <b>bell-style</b>).
       <b>do-uppercase-version</b> <b>(M-a,</b> <b>M-b,</b> <b>M-</b><u>x</u><b>,</b> <b>...)</b>
              If the metafied character <u>x</u> is lowercase, run the command that is bound to  the  corresponding
              uppercase character.
       <b>prefix-meta</b> <b>(ESC)</b>
              Metafy the next character typed.  <b>ESC</b> <b>f</b> is equivalent to <b>Meta-f</b>.
       <b>undo</b> <b>(C-_,</b> <b>C-x</b> <b>C-u)</b>
              Incremental undo, separately remembered for each line.
       <b>revert-line</b> <b>(M-r)</b>
              Undo  all  changes made to this line.  This is like executing the <b>undo</b> command enough times to

       <b>tilde-expand</b> <b>(M-&amp;)</b>
              Perform tilde expansion on the current word.
       <b>set-mark</b> <b>(C-@,</b> <b>M-&lt;space&gt;)</b>
              Set the mark to the point.  If a numeric argument is supplied, the mark is set to  that  posi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion.&nbsp;position.</font>
              tion.
       <b>exchange-point-and-mark</b> <b>(C-x</b> <b>C-x)</b>
              Swap  the  point with the mark.  The current cursor position is set to the saved position, and
              the old cursor position is saved as the mark.
       <b>character-search</b> <b>(C-])</b>
              A character is read and point is moved to the next occurrence of that character.   A  negative
              count searches for previous occurrences.
       <b>character-search-backward</b> <b>(M-C-])</b>
              A  character is read and point is moved to the previous occurrence of that character.  A nega-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tive&nbsp;negative</font>
              tive count searches for subsequent occurrences.
       <b>insert-comment</b> <b>(M-#)</b>
              Without a numeric argument, the value of the readline <b>comment-begin</b> variable  is  inserted  at
              the  beginning of the current line.  If a numeric argument is supplied, this command acts as a
              toggle:  if the characters at the beginning of the  line  do  not  match  the  value  of  <b>com</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment-begin,&nbsp;comment-begin,</font>
              <b>ment-begin</b>,  the value is inserted, otherwise the characters in <b>comment-begin</b> are deleted from
              the beginning of the line.  In either case, the line is accepted as  if  a  newline  had  been
              typed.   The  default  value  of  <b>comment-begin</b> causes this command to make the current line a
              shell comment.  If a numeric argument causes the comment character to  be  removed,  the  line
              will be executed by the shell.
       <b>glob-complete-word</b> <b>(M-g)</b>
              The word before point is treated as a pattern for pathname expansion, with an asterisk implic-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">itly&nbsp;implicitly</font>
              itly appended.  This pattern is used to generate a list of matching file  names  for  possible
              completions.
       <b>glob-expand-word</b> <b>(C-x</b> <b>*)</b>
              The word before point is treated as a pattern for pathname expansion, and the list of matching
              file names is inserted, replacing the word.  If a numeric argument is supplied, an asterisk is
              appended before pathname expansion.
       <b>glob-list-expansions</b> <b>(C-x</b> <b>g)</b>
              The  list  of  expansions that would have been generated by <b>glob-expand-word</b> is displayed, and
              the line is redrawn.  If a numeric argument is supplied, an asterisk is appended before  path-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">name&nbsp;pathname</font>
              name expansion.
       <b>dump-functions</b>
              Print all of the functions and their key bindings to the readline output stream.  If a numeric
              argument is supplied, the output is formatted in such a way that it can be  made  part  of  an
              <u>inputrc</u> file.
       <b>dump-variables</b>
              Print  all  of the settable readline variables and their values to the readline output stream.
              If a numeric argument is supplied, the output is formatted in such a way that it can  be  made
              part of an <u>inputrc</u> file.
       <b>dump-macros</b>
              Print  all  of  the  readline key sequences bound to macros and the strings they output.  If a
              numeric argument is supplied, the output is formatted in such a way that it can be  made  part
              of an <u>inputrc</u> file.
       <b>display-shell-version</b> <b>(C-x</b> <b>C-v)</b>
              Display version information about the current instance of <b>bash</b>.

   <b>Programmable</b> <b>Completion</b>
       When  word  completion is attempted for an argument to a command for which a completion specification
       (a <u>compspec</u>) has been defined using the <b>complete</b> builtin (see <b>SHELL</b> <b>BUILTIN</b> <b>COMMANDS</b> below), the pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">grammable&nbsp;programmable</font>
       grammable completion facilities are invoked.

       First, the command name is identified.  If a compspec has been defined for that command, the compspec
       is used to generate the list of possible completions for the word.  If the command  word  is  a  full
       pathname,  a  compspec  for the full pathname is searched for first.  If no compspec is found for the
       full pathname, an attempt is made to find a compspec for the portion following the final slash.

       Once a compspec has been found, it is used to generate the list of matching words.  If a compspec  is
       not found, the default <b>bash</b> completion as described above under <b>Completing</b> is performed.

       First,  the  actions specified by the compspec are used.  Only matches which are prefixed by the word
       being completed are returned.  When the <b>-f</b> or <b>-d</b> option is used for filename or directory  name  com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pletion,&nbsp;completion,</font>
       pletion, the shell variable <b>FIGNORE</b> is used to filter the matches.

       Any  completions  specified by a filename expansion pattern to the <b>-G</b> option are generated next.  The
       words generated by the pattern need not match the word being completed.  The <b>GLOBIGNORE</b>  shell  vari-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able&nbsp;variable</font>
       able is not used to filter the matches, but the <b>FIGNORE</b> variable is used.

       Next, the string specified as the argument to the <b>-W</b> option is considered.  The string is first split
       using the characters in the <b>IFS</b> special variable as delimiters.  Shell quoting is honored.  Each word
       is  then  expanded  using brace expansion, tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, command
       substitution, and arithmetic expansion, as described above under <b>EXPANSION</b>.  The  results  are  split
       using  the  rules  described  above  under  <b>Word</b> <b>Splitting</b>.  The results of the expansion are prefix-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">matched&nbsp;prefixmatched</font>
       matched against the word being completed, and the matching words become the possible completions.

       After these matches have been generated, any shell function or command specified with the <b>-F</b>  and  <b>-C</b>
       options  is invoked.  When the command or function is invoked, the <b>COMP_LINE</b> and <b>COMP_POINT</b> variables
       are assigned values as described above under <b>Shell</b> <b>Variables</b>.  If a shell function is being  invoked,
       the  <b>COMP_WORDS</b>  and <b>COMP_CWORD</b> variables are also set.  When the function or command is invoked, the
       first argument is the name of the command whose arguments are being completed, the second argument is
       the  word  being  completed, and the third argument is the word preceding the word being completed on
       the current command line.  No filtering of the generated completions against the word being completed
       is performed; the function or command has complete freedom in generating the matches.

       Any  function  specified with <b>-F</b> is invoked first.  The function may use any of the shell facilities,
       including the <b>compgen</b> builtin described below, to generate the matches.  It  must  put  the  possible
       completions in the <b>COMPREPLY</b> array variable.

       Next,  any  command  specified  with the <b>-C</b> option is invoked in an environment equivalent to command
       substitution.  It should print a list of completions, one per line, to the  standard  output.   Back-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">slash&nbsp;Backslash</font>
       slash may be used to escape a newline, if necessary.

       After  all  of  the  possible  completions  are generated, any filter specified with the <b>-X</b> option is
       applied to the list.  The filter is a pattern as used for pathname expansion; a <b>&amp;</b> in the  pattern  is
       replaced with the text of the word being completed.  A literal <b>&amp;</b> may be escaped with a backslash; the
       backslash is removed before attempting a match.  Any completion that  matches  the  pattern  will  be
       removed from the list.  A leading <b>!</b> negates the pattern; in this case any completion not matching the
       pattern will be removed.

       Finally, any prefix and suffix specified with the <b>-P</b> and <b>-S</b> options are added to each member  of  the
       completion  list,  and the result is returned to the readline completion code as the list of possible
       completions.

       If the previously-applied actions do not generate any matches, and the <b>-o</b> <b>dirnames</b>  option  was  sup-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">plied&nbsp;supplied</font>
       plied to <b>complete</b> when the compspec was defined, directory name completion is attempted.

       If the <b>-o</b> <b>plusdirs</b> option was supplied to <b>complete</b> when the compspec was defined, directory name com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pletion&nbsp;completion</font>
       pletion is attempted and any matches are added to the results of the other actions.

       By default, if a compspec is found, whatever it generates is returned to the completion code  as  the
       full  set  of possible completions.  The default <b>bash</b> completions are not attempted, and the readline
       default of filename completion is disabled.  If the <b>-o</b> <b>bashdefault</b> option was  supplied  to  <b>complete</b>
       when  the  compspec was defined, the <b>bash</b> default completions are attempted if the compspec generates
       no matches.  If the <b>-o</b> <b>default</b> option was supplied to <b>complete</b> when the compspec was  defined,  read-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">line's&nbsp;readline's</font>
       line's default completion will be performed if the compspec (and, if attempted, the default <b>bash</b> com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pletions)&nbsp;completions)</font>
       pletions) generate no matches.

       When a compspec indicates that directory name completion  is  desired,  the  programmable  completion
       functions  force  readline  to append a slash to completed names which are symbolic links to directo-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ries,&nbsp;directories,</font>
       ries, subject to the value of the <b>mark-directories</b> readline variable, regardless of  the  setting  of
       the <b>mark-symlinked-directories</b> readline variable.

<b>HISTORY</b>
       When  the  <b>-o</b>  <b>history</b> option to the <b>set</b> builtin is enabled, the shell provides access to the <u>command</u>
       <u>history</u>, the list of commands previously typed.  The value of the <b>HISTSIZE</b> variable is  used  as  the
       number  of  commands to save in a history list.  The text of the last <b>HISTSIZE</b> commands (default 500)
       is saved.  The shell stores each command in the history list prior to parameter and  variable  expan-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion&nbsp;expansion</font>
       sion  (see  <b>EXPANSION</b>  above)  but after history expansion is performed, subject to the values of the
       shell variables <b>HISTIGNORE</b> and <b>HISTCONTROL</b>.

       On startup, the history is initialized  from  the  file  named  by  the  variable  <b>HISTFILE</b>  (default
       <u>~/.bash</u><b>_</b><u>history</u>).   The file named by the value of <b>HISTFILE</b> is truncated, if necessary, to contain no
       more than the number of lines specified by the value of  <b>HISTFILESIZE</b>.   When  an  interactive  shell
       exits,  the  last  <b>$HISTSIZE</b>  lines are copied from the history list to <b>$HISTFILE</b>.  If the <b>histappend</b>
       shell option is enabled (see the description of <b>shopt</b> under <b>SHELL</b> <b>BUILTIN</b> <b>COMMANDS</b> below), the  lines
       are  appended  to the history file, otherwise the history file is overwritten.  If <b>HISTFILE</b> is unset,
       or if the history file is unwritable, the history is not saved.  After saving the history,  the  his-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tory&nbsp;history</font>
       tory  file  is  truncated to contain no more than <b>HISTFILESIZE</b> lines.  If <b>HISTFILESIZE</b> is not set, no
       truncation is performed.

       The builtin command <b>fc</b> (see <b>SHELL</b> <b>BUILTIN</b> <b>COMMANDS</b> below) may be used to list or edit and  re-execute
       a portion of the history list.  The <b>history</b> builtin may be used to display or modify the history list
       and manipulate the history file.  When using command-line editing, search commands are  available  in
       each editing mode that provide access to the history list.

       The  shell  allows  control  over  which commands are saved on the history list.  The <b>HISTCONTROL</b> and
       <b>HISTIGNORE</b> variables may be set to cause the shell to save only a subset  of  the  commands  entered.
       The  <b>cmdhist</b>  shell option, if enabled, causes the shell to attempt to save each line of a multi-line
       command in the same history entry, adding semicolons where necessary to preserve  syntactic  correct-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ness.&nbsp;correctness.</font>
       ness.   The  <b>lithist</b> shell option causes the shell to save the command with embedded newlines instead
       of semicolons.  See the description of the <b>shopt</b> builtin  below  under  <b>SHELL</b>  <b>BUILTIN</b>  <b>COMMANDS</b>  for
       information on setting and unsetting shell options.

<b>HISTORY</b> <b>EXPANSION</b>
       The shell supports a history expansion feature that is similar to the history expansion in <b>csh.</b>  This
       section describes what syntax features are available.  This feature is enabled by default for  inter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">active&nbsp;interactive</font>
       active  shells, and can be disabled using the <b>+H</b> option to the <b>set</b> builtin command (see <b>SHELL</b> <b>BUILTIN</b>
       <b>COMMANDS</b> below).  Non-interactive shells do not perform history expansion by default.

       History expansions introduce words from the history list into the input stream,  making  it  easy  to
       repeat  commands,  insert  the  arguments  to  a previous command into the current input line, or fix
       errors in previous commands quickly.

       History expansion is performed immediately after a complete line is read, before the shell breaks  it
       into words.  It takes place in two parts.  The first is to determine which line from the history list
       to use during substitution.  The second is to select portions of that line  for  inclusion  into  the
       current one.  The line selected from the history is the <u>event</u>, and the portions of that line that are
       acted upon are <u>words</u>.  Various <u>modifiers</u> are available to manipulate the selected words.  The line is
       broken  into words in the same fashion as when reading input, so that several <u>metacharacter</u>-separated
       words surrounded by quotes are considered one word.  History expansions are introduced by the appear-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ance&nbsp;appearance</font>
       ance of the history expansion character, which is <b>!</b> by default.  Only backslash (<b>\</b>) and single quotes
       can quote the history expansion character.

       Several characters inhibit history expansion if found immediately  following  the  history  expansion
       character, even if it is unquoted: space, tab, newline, carriage return, and <b>=</b>.  If the <b>extglob</b> shell
       option is enabled, <b>(</b> will also inhibit expansion.

       Several shell options settable with the <b>shopt</b> builtin may be used to tailor the behavior  of  history
       expansion.  If the <b>histverify</b> shell option is enabled (see the description of the <b>shopt</b> builtin), and
       <b>readline</b> is being used, history substitutions  are  not  immediately  passed  to  the  shell  parser.
       Instead, the expanded line is reloaded into the <b>readline</b> editing buffer for further modification.  If
       <b>readline</b> is being used, and the <b>histreedit</b> shell option is enabled,  a  failed  history  substitution
       will  be  reloaded  into  the  <b>readline</b>  editing buffer for correction.  The <b>-p</b> option to the <b>history</b>
       builtin command may be used to see what a history expansion will do before using it.  The  <b>-s</b>  option
       to  the  <b>history</b>  builtin may be used to add commands to the end of the history list without actually
       executing them, so that they are available for subsequent recall.

       The shell allows control of the various characters used by the history expansion mechanism  (see  the
       description of <b>histchars</b> above under <b>Shell</b> <b>Variables</b>).

   <b>Event</b> <b>Designators</b>
       An event designator is a reference to a command line entry in the history list.

       <b>!</b>      Start  a history substitution, except when followed by a <b>blank</b>, newline, carriage return, = or
              ( (when the <b>extglob</b> shell option is enabled using the <b>shopt</b> builtin).
       <b>!</b><u>n</u>     Refer to command line <u>n</u>.
       <b>!-</b><u>n</u>    Refer to the current command line minus <u>n</u>.
       <b>!!</b>     Refer to the previous command.  This is a synonym for `!-1'.
       <b>!</b><u>string</u>
              Refer to the most recent command starting with <u>string</u>.
       <b>!?</b><u>string</u><b>[?]</b>
              Refer to the most recent command containing <u>string</u>.  The trailing <b>?</b> may be omitted  if  <u>string</u>
              is followed immediately by a newline.
       <b>^</b><u>string1</u><b>^</b><u>string2</u><b>^</b>
              Quick  substitution.   Repeat the last command, replacing <u>string1</u> with <u>string2</u>.  Equivalent to
              ``!!:s/<u>string1</u>/<u>string2</u>/'' (see <b>Modifiers</b> below).
       <b>!#</b>     The entire command line typed so far.

   <b>Word</b> <b>Designators</b>
       Word designators are used to select desired words from the event.  A <b>:</b> separates the event specifica-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;specification</font>
       tion from the word designator.  It may be omitted if the word designator begins with a <b>^</b>, <b>$</b>, <b>*</b>, <b>-</b>, or
       <b>%</b>.  Words are numbered from the beginning of the line, with the first word being denoted by 0 (zero).
       Words are inserted into the current line separated by single spaces.

       <b>0</b> <b>(zero)</b>
              The zeroth word.  For the shell, this is the command word.
       <u>n</u>      The <u>n</u>th word.
       <b>^</b>      The first argument.  That is, word 1.
       <b>$</b>      The last argument.
       <b>%</b>      The word matched by the most recent `?<u>string</u>?' search.
       <u>x</u><b>-</b><u>y</u>    A range of words; `-<u>y</u>' abbreviates `0-<u>y</u>'.
       <b>*</b>      All of the words but the zeroth.  This is a synonym for `<u>1-$</u>'.  It is not an error to use <b>*</b> if
              there is just one word in the event; the empty string is returned in that case.
       <b>x*</b>     Abbreviates <u>x-$</u>.
       <b>x-</b>     Abbreviates <u>x-$</u> like <b>x*</b>, but omits the last word.

       If a word designator is supplied without an event specification, the previous command is used as  the
       event.

   <b>Modifiers</b>
       After the optional word designator, there may appear a sequence of one or more of the following modi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fiers,&nbsp;modifiers,</font>
       fiers, each preceded by a `:'.

       <b>h</b>      Remove a trailing file name component, leaving only the head.
       <b>t</b>      Remove all leading file name components, leaving the tail.
       <b>r</b>      Remove a trailing suffix of the form <u>.xxx</u>, leaving the basename.
       <b>e</b>      Remove all but the trailing suffix.
       <b>p</b>      Print the new command but do not execute it.
       <b>q</b>      Quote the substituted words, escaping further substitutions.
       <b>x</b>      Quote the substituted words as with <b>q</b>, but break into words at <b>blanks</b> and newlines.
       <b>s/</b><u>old</u><b>/</b><u>new</u><b>/</b>
              Substitute <u>new</u> for the first occurrence of <u>old</u> in the event line.  Any delimiter can  be  used
              in place of /.  The final delimiter is optional if it is the last character of the event line.
              The delimiter may be quoted in <u>old</u> and <u>new</u> with a single backslash.  If &amp; appears in  <u>new</u>,  it
              is  replaced  by  <u>old</u>.  A single backslash will quote the &amp;.  If <u>old</u> is null, it is set to the
              last <u>old</u> substituted, or, if no previous history substitutions took place, the last <u>string</u>  in
              a <b>!?</b><u>string</u><b>[?]</b>  search.
       <b>&amp;</b>      Repeat the previous substitution.
       <b>g</b>      Cause changes to be applied over the entire event line.  This is used in conjunction with `<b>:s</b>'
              (e.g., `<b>:gs/</b><u>old</u><b>/</b><u>new</u><b>/</b>') or `<b>:&amp;</b>'.  If used with `<b>:s</b>', any delimiter can be used in place  of  /,
              and  the  final delimiter is optional if it is the last character of the event line.  An <b>a</b> may
              be used as a synonym for <b>g</b>.
       <b>G</b>      Apply the following `<b>s</b>' modifier once to each word in the event line.

<b>SHELL</b> <b>BUILTIN</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       Unless otherwise noted, each builtin command documented in this section as accepting options preceded
       by  <b>-</b>  accepts  <b>--</b>  to  signify  the  end  of the options.  For example, the <b>:</b>, <b>true</b>, <b>false</b>, and <b>test</b>
       builtins do not accept options.
       <b>:</b> [<u>arguments</u>]
              No effect; the command does nothing beyond expanding <u>arguments</u> and  performing  any  specified
              redirections.  A zero exit code is returned.

        <b>.</b>  <u>filename</u> [<u>arguments</u>]
       <b>source</b> <u>filename</u> [<u>arguments</u>]
              Read  and  execute commands from <u>filename</u> in the current shell environment and return the exit
              status of the last command executed from <u>filename</u>.  If <u>filename</u> does not contain a slash, file
              names  in  <b>PATH</b>  are used to find the directory containing <u>filename</u>.  The file searched for in
              <b>PATH</b> need not be executable.  When <b>bash</b> is  not  in  <u>posix</u>  <u>mode</u>,  the  current  directory  is
              searched  if  no file is found in <b>PATH</b>.  If the <b>sourcepath</b> option to the <b>shopt</b> builtin command
              is turned off, the <b>PATH</b> is not searched.  If any <u>arguments</u> are supplied, they become the posi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tional&nbsp;positional</font>
              tional  parameters  when  <u>filename</u>  is  executed.   Otherwise  the  positional  parameters are
              unchanged.  The return status is the status of the last command exited within the script (0 if
              no commands are executed), and false if <u>filename</u> is not found or cannot be read.

       <b>alias</b> [<b>-p</b>] [<u>name</u>[=<u>value</u>] ...]
              <b>Alias</b>  with  no  arguments  or with the <b>-p</b> option prints the list of aliases in the form <b>alias</b>
              <u>name</u>=<u>value</u> on standard output.  When arguments are supplied, an alias is defined for each <u>name</u>
              whose <u>value</u> is given.  A trailing space in  <u>value</u> causes the next word to be checked for alias
              substitution when the alias is expanded.  For each <u>name</u> in the  argument  list  for  which  no
              <u>value</u>  is  supplied,  the name and value of the alias is printed.  <b>Alias</b> returns true unless a
              <u>name</u> is given for which no alias has been defined.

       <b>bg</b> [<u>jobspec</u> ...]
              Resume each suspended job <u>jobspec</u> in the background, as if it had been  started  with  <b>&amp;</b>.   If
              <u>jobspec</u>  is  not present, the shell's notion of the <u>current</u> <u>job</u> is used.  <b>bg</b> <u>jobspec</u> returns 0
              unless run when job control is disabled or, when run with job control enabled,  any  specified
              <u>jobspec</u> was not found or was started without job control.

       <b>bind</b> [<b>-m</b> <u>keymap</u>] [<b>-lpsvPSV</b>]
       <b>bind</b> [<b>-m</b> <u>keymap</u>] [<b>-q</b> <u>function</u>] [<b>-u</b> <u>function</u>] [<b>-r</b> <u>keyseq</u>]
       <b>bind</b> [<b>-m</b> <u>keymap</u>] <b>-f</b> <u>filename</u>
       <b>bind</b> [<b>-m</b> <u>keymap</u>] <b>-x</b> <u>keyseq</u>:<u>shell-command</u>
       <b>bind</b> [<b>-m</b> <u>keymap</u>] <u>keyseq</u>:<u>function-name</u>
       <b>bind</b> <u>readline-command</u>
              Display current <b>readline</b> key and function bindings, bind a key sequence to a <b>readline</b> function
              or macro, or set a <b>readline</b> variable.  Each non-option argument  is  a  command  as  it  would
              appear  in  <u>.inputrc</u>, but each binding or command must be passed as a separate argument; e.g.,
              '"\C-x\C-r": re-read-init-file'.  Options, if supplied, have the following meanings:
              <b>-m</b> <u>keymap</u>
                     Use <u>keymap</u> as the keymap to be affected by the subsequent bindings.  Acceptable  <u>keymap</u>
                     names  are  <u>emacs,</u> <u>emacs-standard,</u> <u>emacs-meta,</u> <u>emacs-ctlx,</u> <u>vi,</u> <u>vi-move,</u> <u>vi-command</u>, and
                     <u>vi-insert</u>.  <u>vi</u> is equivalent to <u>vi-command</u>; <u>emacs</u> is equivalent to <u>emacs-standard</u>.
              <b>-l</b>     List the names of all <b>readline</b> functions.
              <b>-p</b>     Display <b>readline</b> function names and bindings in such a way that they can be re-read.
              <b>-P</b>     List current <b>readline</b> function names and bindings.
              <b>-v</b>     Display <b>readline</b> variable names and values in such a way that they can be re-read.
              <b>-V</b>     List current <b>readline</b> variable names and values.
              <b>-s</b>     Display <b>readline</b> key sequences bound to macros and the strings they output  in  such  a
                     way that they can be re-read.
              <b>-S</b>     Display <b>readline</b> key sequences bound to macros and the strings they output.
              <b>-f</b> <u>filename</u>
                     Read key bindings from <u>filename</u>.
              <b>-q</b> <u>function</u>
                     Query about which keys invoke the named <u>function</u>.
              <b>-u</b> <u>function</u>
                     Unbind all keys bound to the named <u>function</u>.
              <b>-r</b> <u>keyseq</u>
                     Remove any current binding for <u>keyseq</u>.
              <b>-x</b> <u>keyseq</u><b>:</b><u>shell-command</u>
                     Cause <u>shell-command</u> to be executed whenever <u>keyseq</u> is entered.

              The return value is 0 unless an unrecognized option is given or an error occurred.

       <b>break</b> [<u>n</u>]
              Exit  from  within a <b>for</b>, <b>while</b>, <b>until</b>, or <b>select</b> loop.  If <u>n</u> is specified, break <u>n</u> levels.  <u>n</u>
              must be &gt;= 1.  If <u>n</u> is greater than the number of enclosing loops,  all  enclosing  loops  are
              exited.   The  return  value  is 0 unless the shell is not executing a loop when <b>break</b> is exe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cuted.&nbsp;executed.</font>
              cuted.

       <b>builtin</b> <u>shell-builtin</u> [<u>arguments</u>]
              Execute the specified shell builtin, passing it <u>arguments</u>, and return its exit  status.   This
              is  useful  when  defining a function whose name is the same as a shell builtin, retaining the
              functionality of the builtin within the function.  The <b>cd</b> builtin is commonly  redefined  this
              way.  The return status is false if <u>shell-builtin</u> is not a shell builtin command.

       <b>cd</b> [<b>-L|-P</b>] [<u>dir</u>]
              Change  the  current  directory  to  <u>dir</u>.  The variable <b>HOME</b> is the default <u>dir</u>.  The variable
              <b>CDPATH</b> defines the search path for the directory containing <u>dir</u>.  Alternative directory  names
              in  <b>CDPATH</b>  are  separated by a colon (:).  A null directory name in <b>CDPATH</b> is the same as the
              current directory, i.e., ``<b>.</b>''.  If <u>dir</u> begins with a slash (/), then <b>CDPATH</b> is not used.  The
              <b>-P</b>  option  says  to  use the physical directory structure instead of following symbolic links
              (see also the <b>-P</b> option to the <b>set</b> builtin command); the <b>-L</b> option forces symbolic links to be
              followed.   An  argument  of  <b>-</b>  is equivalent to <b>$OLDPWD</b>.  If a non-empty directory name from
              <b>CDPATH</b> is used, or if <b>-</b> is the first argument, and the directory  change  is  successful,  the
              absolute  pathname of the new working directory is written to the standard output.  The return
              value is true if the directory was successfully changed; false otherwise.

       <b>caller</b> [<u>expr</u>]
              Returns the context of any active subroutine call (a shell function or a script executed  with
              the  <b>.</b>  or <b>source</b> builtins.  Without <u>expr</u>, <b>caller</b> displays the line number and source filename
              of the current subroutine call.  If a non-negative integer is supplied as  <u>expr</u>,  <b>caller</b>  dis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">plays&nbsp;displays</font>
              plays  the line number, subroutine name, and source file corresponding to that position in the
              current execution call stack.  This extra information may be used, for  example,  to  print  a
              stack  trace.   The  current  frame is frame 0.  The return value is 0 unless the shell is not
              executing a subroutine call or <u>expr</u> does not correspond to a valid position in the call stack.

       <b>command</b> [<b>-pVv</b>] <u>command</u> [<u>arg</u> ...]
              Run  <u>command</u>  with <u>args</u> suppressing the normal shell function lookup. Only builtin commands or
              commands found in the <b>PATH</b> are executed.  If the <b>-p</b> option is given, the search for <u>command</u> is
              performed using a default value for <b>PATH</b> that is guaranteed to find all of the standard utili-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ties.&nbsp;utilities.</font>
              ties.  If either the <b>-V</b> or <b>-v</b> option is supplied, a description of <u>command</u> is printed.  The <b>-v</b>
              option  causes  a single word indicating the command or file name used to invoke <u>command</u> to be
              displayed; the <b>-V</b> option produces a more verbose description.  If the <b>-V</b> or <b>-v</b> option is  sup-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">plied,&nbsp;supplied,</font>
              plied, the exit status is 0 if <u>command</u> was found, and 1 if not.  If neither option is supplied
              and an error occurred or <u>command</u> cannot be found, the exit status is 127.  Otherwise, the exit
              status of the <b>command</b> builtin is the exit status of <u>command</u>.

       <b>compgen</b> [<u>option</u>] [<u>word</u>]
              Generate  possible  completion  matches  for  <u>word</u>  according to the <u>option</u>s, which may be any
              option accepted by the <b>complete</b> builtin with the exception of <b>-p</b> and <b>-r</b>, and write the matches
              to  the  standard output.  When using the <b>-F</b> or <b>-C</b> options, the various shell variables set by
              the programmable completion facilities, while available, will not have useful values.

              The matches will be generated in the same way as if the programmable completion code had  gen-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">erated&nbsp;generated</font>
              erated  them  directly from a completion specification with the same flags.  If <u>word</u> is speci-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fied,&nbsp;specified,</font>
              fied, only those completions matching <u>word</u> will be displayed.

              The return value is true unless an invalid option is supplied, or no matches were generated.

       <b>complete</b> [<b>-abcdefgjksuv</b>] [<b>-o</b> <u>comp-option</u>] [<b>-A</b> <u>action</u>] [<b>-G</b> <u>globpat</u>] [<b>-W</b> <u>wordlist</u>] [<b>-P</b> <u>prefix</u>] [<b>-S</b> <u>suf</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fix]&nbsp;suffix]</font>
       <u>fix</u>]
              [<b>-X</b> <u>filterpat</u>] [<b>-F</b> <u>function</u>] [<b>-C</b> <u>command</u>] <u>name</u> [<u>name</u> <u>...</u>]
       <b>complete</b> <b>-pr</b> [<u>name</u> ...]
              Specify how arguments to each <u>name</u> should be completed.  If the <b>-p</b> option is supplied,  or  if
              no  options  are supplied, existing completion specifications are printed in a way that allows
              them to be reused as input.  The <b>-r</b> option removes a completion specification for  each  <u>name</u>,
              or, if no <u>name</u>s are supplied, all completion specifications.

              The  process  of applying these completion specifications when word completion is attempted is
              described above under <b>Programmable</b> <b>Completion</b>.

              Other options, if specified, have the following meanings.  The arguments to the <b>-G</b>, <b>-W</b>, and <b>-X</b>
              options  (and,  if  necessary,  the  <b>-P</b>  and <b>-S</b> options) should be quoted to protect them from
              expansion before the <b>complete</b> builtin is invoked.
              <b>-o</b> <u>comp-option</u>
                      The <u>comp-option</u> controls several aspects of the compspec's behavior beyond the  simple
                      generation of completions.  <u>comp-option</u> may be one of:
                      <b>bashdefault</b>
                              Perform  the rest of the default <b>bash</b> completions if the compspec generates no
                              matches.
                      <b>default</b> Use readline's default  filename  completion  if  the  compspec  generates  no

                              Perform directory name completion if the compspec generates no matches.
                      <b>filenames</b>
                              Tell  readline  that  the  compspec generates filenames, so it can perform any
                              filename-specific processing (like adding a slash to directory names  or  sup-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pressing&nbsp;suppressing</font>

                              pletion  is  attempted  and  any matches are added to the results of the other

              <b>-A</b> <u>action</u>
                      The <u>action</u> may be one of the following to generate a list of possible completions:

              <b>-G</b> <u>globpat</u>
                      The filename expansion pattern <u>globpat</u> is expanded to generate  the  possible  comple-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tions.&nbsp;completions.</font>
                      tions.
              <b>-W</b> <u>wordlist</u>
                      The  <u>wordlist</u> is split using the characters in the <b>IFS</b> special variable as delimiters,
                      and each resultant word is expanded.  The possible completions are the members of  the
                      resultant list which match the word being completed.
              <b>-C</b> <u>command</u>
                      <u>command</u>  is executed in a subshell environment, and its output is used as the possible
                      completions.
              <b>-F</b> <u>function</u>
                      The shell function <u>function</u> is executed in the current  shell  environment.   When  it
                      finishes, the possible completions are retrieved from the value of the <b>COMPREPLY</b> array
                      variable.
              <b>-X</b> <u>filterpat</u>
                      <u>filterpat</u> is a pattern as used for filename expansion.  It is applied to the  list  of
                      possible  completions  generated by the preceding options and arguments, and each com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pletion&nbsp;completion</font>
                      pletion matching <u>filterpat</u> is removed from the list.  A leading <b>!</b> in <u>filterpat</u> negates
                      the pattern; in this case, any completion not matching <u>filterpat</u> is removed.
              <b>-P</b> <u>prefix</u>
                      <u>prefix</u>  is  added at the beginning of each possible completion after all other options
                      have been applied.
              <b>-S</b> <u>suffix</u>
                      <u>suffix</u> is appended to each possible completion  after  all  other  options  have  been
                      applied.

              The  return  value is true unless an invalid option is supplied, an option other than <b>-p</b> or <b>-r</b>
              is supplied without a <u>name</u> argument, an attempt is made to remove a  completion  specification
              for  a <u>name</u> for which no specification exists, or an error occurs adding a completion specifi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cation.&nbsp;specification.</font>

       <b>continue</b> [<u>n</u>]
              Resume the next iteration of the enclosing <b>for</b>, <b>while</b>, <b>until</b>, or <b>select</b> loop.  If <u>n</u> is  speci-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fied,&nbsp;specified,</font>
              fied,  resume  at the <u>n</u>th enclosing loop.  <u>n</u> must be &gt;= 1.  If <u>n</u> is greater than the number of
              enclosing loops, the last enclosing loop (the ``top-level''  loop)  is  resumed.   The  return
              value is 0 unless the shell is not executing a loop when <b>continue</b> is executed.

       <b>declare</b> [<b>-afFirtx</b>] [<b>-p</b>] [<u>name</u>[=<u>value</u>] ...]
       <b>typeset</b> [<b>-afFirtx</b>] [<b>-p</b>] [<u>name</u>[=<u>value</u>] ...]
              Declare  variables and/or give them attributes.  If no <u>name</u>s are given then display the values
              of variables.  The <b>-p</b> option will display the attributes and values of each <u>name</u>.  When <b>-p</b>  is
              used,  additional options are ignored.  The <b>-F</b> option inhibits the display of function defini-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tions;&nbsp;definitions;</font>
              tions; only the function name and attributes are printed.  If the  <b>extdebug</b>  shell  option  is
              enabled  using  <b>shopt</b>,  the source file name and line number where the function is defined are
              displayed as well.  The <b>-F</b> option implies <b>-f</b>.  The following options can be used  to  restrict
              output to variables with the specified attribute or to give variables attributes:
              <b>-a</b>     Each <u>name</u> is an array variable (see <b>Arrays</b> above).
              <b>-f</b>     Use function names only.
              <b>-i</b>     The variable is treated as an integer; arithmetic evaluation (see <b>ARITHMETIC</b> <b>EVALUATION</b>
                     <b>)</b> is performed when the variable is assigned a value.
              <b>-r</b>     Make <u>name</u>s readonly.  These names cannot then be assigned values by subsequent  assign-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment&nbsp;assignment</font>
                     ment statements or unset.
              <b>-t</b>     Give  each  <u>name</u>  the  <u>trace</u>  attribute.  Traced functions inherit the <b>DEBUG</b> and <b>RETURN</b>
                     traps from the calling shell.  The trace attribute has no  special  meaning  for  vari-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ables.&nbsp;variables.</font>
                     ables.
              <b>-x</b>     Mark <u>name</u>s for export to subsequent commands via the environment.

              Using  `+'  instead of `-' turns off the attribute instead, with the exception that <b>+a</b> may not
              be used to destroy an array variable.  When used in a function, makes each <u>name</u> local, as with
              the <b>local</b> command.  If a variable name is followed by =<u>value</u>, the value of the variable is set
              to <u>value</u>.  The return value is 0 unless an invalid option is encountered, an attempt  is  made
              to  define a function using ``-f foo=bar'', an attempt is made to assign a value to a readonly
              variable, an attempt is made to assign a value to an array variable without using the compound
              assignment  syntax (see <b>Arrays</b> above), one of the <u>names</u> is not a valid shell variable name, an
              attempt is made to turn off readonly status for a readonly variable, an  attempt  is  made  to
              turn  off  array status for an array variable, or an attempt is made to display a non-existent
              function with <b>-f</b>.

       <b>dirs</b> <b>[-clpv]</b> <b>[+</b><u>n</u><b>]</b> <b>[-</b><u>n</u><b>]</b>
              Without options, displays the list of currently remembered directories.  The  default  display
              is  on  a  single line with directory names separated by spaces.  Directories are added to the
              list with the <b>pushd</b> command; the <b>popd</b> command removes entries from the list.
              <b>+</b><u>n</u>     Displays the <u>n</u>th entry counting from the left of the list shown by  <b>dirs</b>  when  invoked
                     without options, starting with zero.
              <b>-</b><u>n</u>     Displays  the  <u>n</u>th entry counting from the right of the list shown by <b>dirs</b> when invoked
                     without options, starting with zero.
              <b>-c</b>     Clears the directory stack by deleting all of the entries.
              <b>-l</b>     Produces a longer listing; the default listing format uses a tilde to denote  the  home
                     directory.
              <b>-p</b>     Print the directory stack with one entry per line.
              <b>-v</b>     Print  the directory stack with one entry per line, prefixing each entry with its index
                     in the stack.

              The return value is 0 unless an invalid option is supplied or <u>n</u> indexes beyond the end of  the
              directory stack.

       <b>disown</b> [<b>-ar</b>] [<b>-h</b>] [<u>jobspec</u> ...]
              Without  options,  each <u>jobspec</u> is removed from the table of active jobs.  If the <b>-h</b> option is
              given, each <u>jobspec</u> is not removed from the table, but is marked so that <b>SIGHUP</b> is not sent to
              the  job if the shell receives a <b>SIGHUP</b>.  If no <u>jobspec</u> is present, and neither the <b>-a</b> nor the
              <b>-r</b> option is supplied, the <u>current</u> <u>job</u> is used.  If no <u>jobspec</u>  is  supplied,  the  <b>-a</b>  option
              means to remove or mark all jobs; the <b>-r</b> option without a <u>jobspec</u> argument restricts operation
              to running jobs.  The return value is 0 unless a <u>jobspec</u> does not specify a valid job.

       <b>echo</b> [<b>-neE</b>] [<u>arg</u> ...]
              Output the <u>arg</u>s, separated by spaces, followed by a newline.  The return status is  always  0.
              If  <b>-n</b> is specified, the trailing newline is suppressed.  If the <b>-e</b> option is given, interpre-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tation&nbsp;interpretation</font>
              tation of the following backslash-escaped characters is enabled.  The <b>-E</b> option  disables  the
              interpretation  of  these  escape  characters,  even  on systems where they are interpreted by
              default.  The <b>xpg_echo</b> shell option may be used to dynamically determine whether or  not  <b>echo</b>
              expands  these  escape  characters  by default.  <b>echo</b> does not interpret <b>--</b> to mean the end of
              options.  <b>echo</b> interprets the following escape sequences:
              <b>\a</b>     alert (bell)
              <b>\b</b>     backspace
              <b>\c</b>     suppress trailing newline
              <b>\e</b>     an escape character
              <b>\f</b>     form feed
              <b>\n</b>     new line
              <b>\r</b>     carriage return
              <b>\t</b>     horizontal tab
              <b>\v</b>     vertical tab
              <b>\\</b>     backslash
              <b>\0</b><u>nnn</u>  the eight-bit character whose value is the octal value <u>nnn</u> (zero to three octal digits)
              <b>\x</b><u>HH</u>   the eight-bit character whose value is the hexadecimal value <u>HH</u> (one or two hex digits)

       <b>enable</b> [<b>-adnps</b>] [<b>-f</b> <u>filename</u>] [<u>name</u> ...]
              Enable and disable builtin shell commands.  Disabling a builtin allows a  disk  command  which
              has  the  same name as a shell builtin to be executed without specifying a full pathname, even
              though the shell normally searches for builtins before disk commands.  If  <b>-n</b>  is  used,  each
              <u>name</u> is disabled; otherwise, <u>names</u> are enabled.  For example, to use the <b>test</b> binary found via
              the <b>PATH</b> instead of the shell builtin version, run ``enable -n test''.  The <b>-f</b> option means to
              load the new builtin command <u>name</u> from shared object <u>filename</u>, on systems that support dynamic
              loading.  The <b>-d</b> option will delete a builtin previously loaded with <b>-f</b>.  If no <u>name</u> arguments
              are  given,  or  if  the  <b>-p</b> option is supplied, a list of shell builtins is printed.  With no
              other option arguments, the list consists of all enabled shell builtins.  If <b>-n</b>  is  supplied,
              only  disabled  builtins  are  printed.   If  <b>-a</b>  is  supplied,  the list printed includes all
              builtins, with an indication of whether or not each is enabled.  If <b>-s</b> is supplied, the output
              is  restricted  to  the  POSIX <u>special</u> builtins.  The return value is 0 unless a <u>name</u> is not a
              shell builtin or there is an error loading a new builtin from a shared object.

       <b>eval</b> [<u>arg</u> ...]
              The <u>arg</u>s are read and concatenated together into a single command.  This command is then  read
              and executed by the shell, and its exit status is returned as the value of <b>eval</b>.  If there are
              no <u>args</u>, or only null arguments, <b>eval</b> returns 0.

       <b>exec</b> [<b>-cl</b>] [<b>-a</b> <u>name</u>] [<u>command</u> [<u>arguments</u>]]
              If <u>command</u> is specified, it replaces the shell.  No new process  is  created.   The  <u>arguments</u>
              become the arguments to <u>command</u>.  If the <b>-l</b> option is supplied, the shell places a dash at the
              beginning of the zeroth arg passed to <u>command</u>.  This is what <a href="login.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/login"><u>login</u>(1)</a>  does.   The  <b>-c</b>  option
              causes  <u>command</u> to be executed with an empty environment.  If <b>-a</b> is supplied, the shell passes
              <u>name</u> as the zeroth argument to the executed command.  If <u>command</u> cannot be executed  for  some
              reason,  a  non-interactive shell exits, unless the shell option <b>execfail</b> is enabled, in which
              case it returns failure.  An interactive shell returns failure if the file cannot be executed.
              If <u>command</u> is not specified, any redirections take effect in the current shell, and the return
              status is 0.  If there is a redirection error, the return status is 1.

       <b>exit</b> [<u>n</u>]
              Cause the shell to exit with a status of <u>n</u>.  If <u>n</u> is omitted, the exit status is that  of  the
              last command executed.  A trap on <b>EXIT</b> is executed before the shell terminates.

       <b>export</b> [<b>-fn</b>] [<u>name</u>[=<u>word</u>]] ...
       <b>export</b> <b>-p</b>
              The supplied <u>names</u> are marked for automatic export to the environment of subsequently executed
              commands.  If the <b>-f</b> option is given, the <u>names</u> refer to functions.  If no <u>names</u> are given, or
              if  the <b>-p</b> option is supplied, a list of all names that are exported in this shell is printed.
              The <b>-n</b> option causes the export property to be removed from each <u>name</u>.  If a variable name  is
              followed by =<u>word</u>, the value of the variable is set to <u>word</u>.  <b>export</b> returns an exit status of
              0 unless an invalid option is encountered, one of the <u>names</u> is  not  a  valid  shell  variable
              name, or <b>-f</b> is supplied with a <u>name</u> that is not a function.

       <b>fc</b> [<b>-e</b> <u>ename</u>] [<b>-nlr</b>] [<u>first</u>] [<u>last</u>]
       <b>fc</b> <b>-s</b> [<u>pat</u>=<u>rep</u>] [<u>cmd</u>]
              Fix  Command.   In the first form, a range of commands from <u>first</u> to <u>last</u> is selected from the
              history list.  <u>First</u> and <u>last</u> may be specified as a string (to locate the last command  begin-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ning&nbsp;beginning</font>
              ning with that string) or as a number (an index into the history list, where a negative number
              is used as an offset from the current command number).  If <u>last</u> is not specified it is set  to
              the  current  command  for  listing (so that ``fc -l -10'' prints the last 10 commands) and to
              <u>first</u> otherwise.  If <u>first</u> is not specified it is set to the previous command for editing  and
              -16 for listing.

              The  <b>-n</b>  option suppresses the command numbers when listing.  The <b>-r</b> option reverses the order
              of the commands.  If the <b>-l</b> option is given, the commands are listed on standard output.  Oth-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">erwise,&nbsp;Otherwise,</font>
              erwise, the editor given by <u>ename</u> is invoked on a file containing those commands.  If <u>ename</u> is
              not given, the value of the <b>FCEDIT</b> variable is used, and the value of <b>EDITOR</b> if <b>FCEDIT</b> is  not
              set.   If  neither variable is set, <u>vi</u> is used.  When editing is complete, the edited commands
              are echoed and executed.

              In the second form, <u>command</u> is re-executed after each instance of <u>pat</u> is replaced by  <u>rep</u>.   A
              useful  alias to use with this is ``r="fc -s"'', so that typing ``r cc'' runs the last command
              beginning with ``cc'' and typing ``r'' re-executes the last command.

              If the first form is used, the return value is 0 unless an invalid option  is  encountered  or
              <u>first</u>  or  <u>last</u>  specify history lines out of range.  If the <b>-e</b> option is supplied, the return
              value is the value of the last command executed or failure if an error occurs with the  tempo-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rary&nbsp;temporary</font>
              rary  file  of commands.  If the second form is used, the return status is that of the command
              re-executed, unless <u>cmd</u> does not specify a valid history line, in which case <b>fc</b> returns  fail-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ure.&nbsp;failure.</font>
              ure.

       <b>fg</b> [<u>jobspec</u>]
              Resume <u>jobspec</u> in the foreground, and make it the current job.  If <u>jobspec</u> is not present, the
              shell's notion of the <u>current</u> <u>job</u> is used.  The return value is that  of  the  command  placed
              into the foreground, or failure if run when job control is disabled or, when run with job con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">trol&nbsp;control</font>
              trol enabled, if <u>jobspec</u> does not specify a valid job or <u>jobspec</u>  specifies  a  job  that  was
              started without job control.

       <b>getopts</b> <u>optstring</u> <u>name</u> [<u>args</u>]
              <b>getopts</b>  is  used  by shell procedures to parse positional parameters.  <u>optstring</u> contains the
              option characters to be recognized; if a character is followed  by  a  colon,  the  option  is
              expected to have an argument, which should be separated from it by white space.  The colon and
              question mark characters may not be used as option  characters.   Each  time  it  is  invoked,
              <b>getopts</b>  places  the  next option in the shell variable <u>name</u>, initializing <u>name</u> if it does not
              exist, and the index of the next argument to be processed into the variable <b>OPTIND</b>.  <b>OPTIND</b> is
              initialized to 1 each time the shell or a shell script is invoked.  When an option requires an
              argument, <b>getopts</b> places that argument into the variable <b>OPTARG</b>.  The  shell  does  not  reset
              <b>OPTIND</b>  automatically;  it must be manually reset between multiple calls to <b>getopts</b> within the
              same shell invocation if a new set of parameters is to be used.

              When the end of options is encountered, <b>getopts</b> exits with a return value greater  than  zero.
              <b>OPTIND</b> is set to the index of the first non-option argument, and <b>name</b> is set to ?.

              <b>getopts</b>  normally  parses  the positional parameters, but if more arguments are given in <u>args</u>,
              <b>getopts</b> parses those instead.

              <b>getopts</b> can report errors in two ways.  If the first character of <u>optstring</u> is a colon, <u>silent</u>
              error  reporting  is  used.   In normal operation diagnostic messages are printed when invalid
              options or missing option arguments are encountered.  If the variable <b>OPTERR</b> is set to  0,  no
              error messages will be displayed, even if the first character of <u>optstring</u> is not a colon.

              If  an  invalid option is seen, <b>getopts</b> places ? into <u>name</u> and, if not silent, prints an error
              message and unsets <b>OPTARG</b>.  If <b>getopts</b> is silent, the option  character  found  is  placed  in
              <b>OPTARG</b> and no diagnostic message is printed.

              If  a required argument is not found, and <b>getopts</b> is not silent, a question mark (<b>?</b>) is placed
              in <u>name</u>, <b>OPTARG</b> is unset, and a diagnostic message is printed.  If <b>getopts</b> is silent,  then  a
              colon (<b>:</b>) is placed in <u>name</u> and <b>OPTARG</b> is set to the option character found.

              <b>getopts</b>  returns  true  if an option, specified or unspecified, is found.  It returns false if
              the end of options is encountered or an error occurs.

       <b>hash</b> [<b>-lr</b>] [<b>-p</b> <u>filename</u>] [<b>-dt</b>] [<u>name</u>]
              For each <u>name</u>, the full file name of the command is determined by searching the directories in
              <b>$PATH</b> and remembered.  If the <b>-p</b> option is supplied, no path search is performed, and <u>filename</u>
              is used as the full file name of the command.  The <b>-r</b> option causes the shell  to  forget  all
              remembered  locations.   The  <b>-d</b>  option causes the shell to forget the remembered location of
              each <u>name</u>.  If the <b>-t</b> option is supplied, the full pathname to which each <u>name</u> corresponds  is
              printed.   If  multiple  <u>name</u>  arguments  are supplied with <b>-t</b>, the <u>name</u> is printed before the
              hashed full pathname.  The <b>-l</b> option causes output to be displayed in a  format  that  may  be
              reused  as  input.   If  no  arguments are given, or if only <b>-l</b> is supplied, information about
              remembered commands is printed.  The return status is true unless a <u>name</u> is not  found  or  an
              invalid option is supplied.

       <b>help</b> [<b>-s</b>] [<u>pattern</u>]
              Display  helpful  information  about  builtin  commands.   If <u>pattern</u> is specified, <b>help</b> gives
              detailed help on all commands matching <u>pattern</u>; otherwise help for all the builtins and  shell
              control  structures  is printed.  The <b>-s</b> option restricts the information displayed to a short
              usage synopsis.  The return status is 0 unless no command matches <u>pattern</u>.

       <b>history</b> <b>[</b><u>n</u><b>]</b>
       <b>history</b> <b>-c</b>
       <b>history</b> <b>-d</b> <u>offset</u>
       <b>history</b> <b>-anrw</b> [<u>filename</u>]
       <b>history</b> <b>-p</b> <u>arg</u> [<u>arg</u> <u>...</u>]
       <b>history</b> <b>-s</b> <u>arg</u> [<u>arg</u> <u>...</u>]
              With no options, display the command history list with line numbers.  Lines listed  with  a  <b>*</b>
              have  been  modified.   An  argument  of <u>n</u> lists only the last <u>n</u> lines.  If the shell variable
              <b>HISTTIMEFORMAT</b> is set and not null, it is used as a format string for <a href="../man3/strftime.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/strftime"><u>strftime</u>(3)</a>  to  display
              the  time stamp associated with each displayed history entry.  No intervening blank is printed
              between the formatted time stamp and the history line.  If <u>filename</u> is supplied, it is used as
              the  name  of  the history file; if not, the value of <b>HISTFILE</b> is used.  Options, if supplied,
              have the following meanings:
              <b>-c</b>     Clear the history list by deleting all the entries.
              <b>-d</b> <u>offset</u>
                     Delete the history entry at position <u>offset</u>.
              <b>-a</b>     Append the ``new'' history lines (history lines entered since the beginning of the cur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rent&nbsp;current</font>
                     rent <b>bash</b> session) to the history file.
              <b>-n</b>     Read  the history lines not already read from the history file into the current history
                     list.  These are lines appended to the history file since the beginning of the  current
                     <b>bash</b> session.
              <b>-r</b>     Read the contents of the history file and use them as the current history.
              <b>-w</b>     Write the current history to the history file, overwriting the history file's contents.
              <b>-p</b>     Perform history substitution on the following <u>args</u> and display the result on the  stan-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dard&nbsp;standard</font>
                     dard  output.  Does not store the results in the history list.  Each <u>arg</u> must be quoted
                     to disable normal history expansion.
              <b>-s</b>     Store the <u>args</u> in the history list as a single entry.  The last command in the  history
                     list is removed before the <u>args</u> are added.

              If the <b>HISTTIMEFORMAT</b> is set, the time stamp information associated with each history entry is
              written to the history file.  The return value is 0 unless an invalid option  is  encountered,
              an error occurs while reading or writing the history file, an invalid <u>offset</u> is supplied as an
              argument to <b>-d</b>, or the history expansion supplied as an argument to <b>-p</b> fails.

       <b>jobs</b> [<b>-lnprs</b>] [ <u>jobspec</u> ... ]
       <b>jobs</b> <b>-x</b> <u>command</u> [ <u>args</u> ... ]
              The first form lists the active jobs.  The options have the following meanings:
              <b>-l</b>     List process IDs in addition to the normal information.
              <b>-p</b>     List only the process ID of the job's process group leader.
              <b>-n</b>     Display information only about jobs that have changed status since the  user  was  last
                     notified of their status.
              <b>-r</b>     Restrict output to running jobs.
              <b>-s</b>     Restrict output to stopped jobs.

              If <u>jobspec</u> is given, output is restricted to information about that job.  The return status is
              0 unless an invalid option is encountered or an invalid <u>jobspec</u> is supplied.

              If the <b>-x</b> option is supplied, <b>jobs</b> replaces any <u>jobspec</u> found in <u>command</u> or <u>args</u> with the cor-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">responding&nbsp;corresponding</font>
              responding  process group ID, and executes <u>command</u> passing it <u>args</u>, returning its exit status.

       <b>kill</b> [<b>-s</b> <u>sigspec</u> | <b>-n</b> <u>signum</u> | <b>-</b><u>sigspec</u>] [<u>pid</u> | <u>jobspec</u>] ...
       <b>kill</b> <b>-l</b> [<u>sigspec</u> | <u>exit</u><b>_</b><u>status</u>]
              Send the signal named by <u>sigspec</u> or <u>signum</u> to the processes named by <u>pid</u> or <u>jobspec</u>.   <u>sigspec</u>
              is either a case-insensitive signal name such as <b>SIGKILL</b> (with or without the <b>SIG</b> prefix) or a
              signal number; <u>signum</u> is a signal number.  If <u>sigspec</u> is not present, then <b>SIGTERM</b> is assumed.
              An argument of <b>-l</b> lists the signal names.  If any arguments are supplied when <b>-l</b> is given, the
              names of the signals corresponding to the arguments are listed, and the return  status  is  0.
              The  <u>exit</u><b>_</b><u>status</u> argument to <b>-l</b> is a number specifying either a signal number or the exit sta-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tus&nbsp;status</font>
              tus of a process terminated by a signal.  <b>kill</b> returns true if at least one  signal  was  suc-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cessfully&nbsp;successfully</font>
              cessfully sent, or false if an error occurs or an invalid option is encountered.

       <b>let</b> <u>arg</u> [<u>arg</u> ...]
              Each <u>arg</u> is an arithmetic expression to be evaluated (see <b>ARITHMETIC</b> <b>EVALUATION</b>).  If the last
              <u>arg</u> evaluates to 0, <b>let</b> returns 1; 0 is returned otherwise.

       <b>local</b> [<u>option</u>] [<u>name</u>[=<u>value</u>] ...]
              For each argument, a local variable named <u>name</u> is created, and assigned <u>value</u>.  The <u>option</u> can
              be  any  of  the options accepted by <b>declare</b>.  When <b>local</b> is used within a function, it causes
              the variable <u>name</u> to have a visible scope restricted to that function and its children.   With
              no operands, <b>local</b> writes a list of local variables to the standard output.  It is an error to
              use <b>local</b> when not within a function.  The return status is 0 unless <b>local</b> is used  outside  a
              function, an invalid <u>name</u> is supplied, or <u>name</u> is a readonly variable.

       <b>logout</b> Exit a login shell.

       <b>popd</b> [-<b>n</b>] [+<u>n</u>] [-<u>n</u>]
              Removes  entries  from the directory stack.  With no arguments, removes the top directory from
              the stack, and performs a <b>cd</b> to the new top directory.  Arguments, if supplied, have the  fol-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lowing&nbsp;following</font>
              lowing meanings:
              <b>+</b><u>n</u>     Removes  the  <u>n</u>th entry counting from the left of the list shown by <b>dirs</b>, starting with
                     zero.  For example: ``popd +0'' removes the first directory, ``popd +1'' the second.
              <b>-</b><u>n</u>     Removes the <u>n</u>th entry counting from the right of the list shown by <b>dirs</b>, starting  with
                     zero.   For  example:  ``popd  -0'' removes the last directory, ``popd -1'' the next to
                     last.
              <b>-n</b>     Suppresses the normal change of directory when removing directories from the stack,  so
                     that only the stack is manipulated.

              If  the  <b>popd</b>  command is successful, a <b>dirs</b> is performed as well, and the return status is 0.
              <b>popd</b> returns false if an invalid option is encountered, the directory stack is empty,  a  non-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">existent&nbsp;nonexistent</font>
              existent directory stack entry is specified, or the directory change fails.

       <b>printf</b> [<b>-v</b> <u>var</u>] <u>format</u> [<u>arguments</u>]
              Write  the  formatted  <u>arguments</u>  to the standard output under the control of the <u>format</u>.  The
              <u>format</u> is a character string which contains three types of objects:  plain  characters,  which
              are  simply  copied  to  standard  output, character escape sequences, which are converted and
              copied to the standard output, and format specifications, each of which causes printing of the
              next  successive <u>argument</u>.  In addition to the standard <a href="printf.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/printf"><u>printf</u>(1)</a> formats, <b>%b</b> causes <b>printf</b> to
              expand backslash escape sequences in the corresponding <u>argument</u>  (except  that  <b>\c</b>  terminates
              output, backslashes in <b>\'</b>, <b>\"</b>, and <b>\?</b> are not removed, and octal escapes beginning with <b>\0</b> may
              contain up to four digits), and <b>%q</b> causes <b>printf</b> to output the  corresponding  <u>argument</u>  in  a
              format that can be reused as shell input.

              The  <b>-v</b>  option causes the output to be assigned to the variable <u>var</u> rather than being printed
              to the standard output.

              The <u>format</u> is reused as necessary to consume all of the <u>arguments</u>.   If  the  <u>format</u>  requires
              more <u>arguments</u> than are supplied, the extra format specifications behave as if a zero value or
              null string, as appropriate, had been supplied.  The return value is zero on success, non-zero
              on failure.

       <b>pushd</b> [<b>-n</b>] [<u>dir</u>]
       <b>pushd</b> [<b>-n</b>] [+<u>n</u>] [-<u>n</u>]
              Adds  a  directory to the top of the directory stack, or rotates the stack, making the new top
              of the stack the current working directory.  With no arguments, exchanges the top two directo-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ries&nbsp;directories</font>
              ries  and  returns  0,  unless the directory stack is empty.  Arguments, if supplied, have the
              following meanings:
              <b>+</b><u>n</u>     Rotates the stack so that the <u>n</u>th directory (counting from the left of the  list  shown
                     by <b>dirs</b>, starting with zero) is at the top.
              <b>-</b><u>n</u>     Rotates  the stack so that the <u>n</u>th directory (counting from the right of the list shown
                     by <b>dirs</b>, starting with zero) is at the top.
              <b>-n</b>     Suppresses the normal change of directory when adding directories to the stack, so that
                     only the stack is manipulated.
              <u>dir</u>    Adds  <u>dir</u>  to  the directory stack at the top, making it the new current working direc-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tory.&nbsp;directory.</font>
                     tory.

              If the <b>pushd</b> command is successful, a <b>dirs</b> is performed as well.  If the first form  is  used,
              <b>pushd</b>  returns 0 unless the cd to <u>dir</u> fails.  With the second form, <b>pushd</b> returns 0 unless the
              directory stack is empty, a non-existent directory stack element is specified, or  the  direc-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tory&nbsp;directory</font>
              tory change to the specified new current directory fails.

       <b>pwd</b> [<b>-LP</b>]
              Print  the  absolute pathname of the current working directory.  The pathname printed contains
              no symbolic links if the <b>-P</b> option is supplied or the <b>-o</b> <b>physical</b> option to  the  <b>set</b>  builtin
              command  is  enabled.   If  the  <b>-L</b>  option is used, the pathname printed may contain symbolic
              links.  The return status is 0 unless an error occurs while reading the name  of  the  current
              directory or an invalid option is supplied.

       <b>read</b> [<b>-ers</b>] [<b>-u</b> <u>fd</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>timeout</u>] [<b>-a</b> <u>aname</u>] [<b>-p</b> <u>prompt</u>] [<b>-n</b> <u>nchars</u>] [<b>-d</b> <u>delim</u>] [<u>name</u> ...]
              One  line is read from the standard input, or from the file descriptor <u>fd</u> supplied as an argu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment&nbsp;argument</font>
              ment to the <b>-u</b> option, and the first word is assigned to the first <u>name</u>, the  second  word  to
              the  second  <u>name</u>, and so on, with leftover words and their intervening separators assigned to
              the last <u>name</u>.  If there are fewer words read from the input stream than names, the  remaining
              names are assigned empty values.  The characters in <b>IFS</b> are used to split the line into words.
              The backslash character (<b>\</b>) may be used to remove any special meaning for the  next  character
              read and for line continuation.  Options, if supplied, have the following meanings:
              <b>-a</b> <u>aname</u>
                     The  words  are assigned to sequential indices of the array variable <u>aname</u>, starting at
                     0.  <u>aname</u> is unset before any new  values  are  assigned.   Other  <u>name</u>  arguments  are
                     ignored.
              <b>-d</b> <u>delim</u>
                     The  first character of <u>delim</u> is used to terminate the input line, rather than newline.
              <b>-e</b>     If the standard input is coming from a terminal, <b>readline</b> (see <b>READLINE</b> above) is  used
                     to obtain the line.
              <b>-n</b> <u>nchars</u>
                     <b>read</b> returns after reading <u>nchars</u> characters rather than waiting for a complete line of
                     input.
              <b>-p</b> <u>prompt</u>
                     Display <u>prompt</u> on standard error, without a trailing newline, before attempting to read
                     any input.  The prompt is displayed only if input is coming from a terminal.
              <b>-r</b>     Backslash  does not act as an escape character.  The backslash is considered to be part
                     of the line.  In particular, a backslash-newline pair may not be used as a line contin-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">uation.&nbsp;continuation.</font>
                     uation.
              <b>-s</b>     Silent mode.  If input is coming from a terminal, characters are not echoed.
              <b>-t</b> <u>timeout</u>
                     Cause  <b>read</b>  to  time  out  and  return failure if a complete line of input is not read
                     within <u>timeout</u> seconds.  This option has no effect if <b>read</b> is not  reading  input  from
                     the terminal or a pipe.
              <b>-u</b> <u>fd</u>  Read input from file descriptor <u>fd</u>.

              If no <u>names</u> are supplied, the line read is assigned to the variable <b>REPLY</b>.  The return code is
              zero, unless end-of-file is encountered, <b>read</b> times out, or an invalid file descriptor is sup-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">plied&nbsp;supplied</font>
              plied as the argument to <b>-u</b>.

       <b>readonly</b> [<b>-apf</b>] [<u>name</u>[=<u>word</u>] ...]
              The  given  <u>names</u>  are marked readonly; the values of these <u>names</u> may not be changed by subse-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">quent&nbsp;subsequent</font>
              quent assignment.  If the <b>-f</b> option is supplied, the functions corresponding to the <u>names</u>  are
              so  marked.  The <b>-a</b> option restricts the variables to arrays.  If no <u>name</u> arguments are given,
              or if the <b>-p</b> option is supplied, a list of all readonly  names  is  printed.   The  <b>-p</b>  option
              causes  output to be displayed in a format that may be reused as input.  If a variable name is
              followed by =<u>word</u>, the value of the variable is set to <u>word</u>.  The return status is 0 unless an
              invalid  option  is encountered, one of the <u>names</u> is not a valid shell variable name, or <b>-f</b> is
              supplied with a <u>name</u> that is not a function.

       <b>return</b> [<u>n</u>]
              Causes a function to exit with the return value specified by <u>n</u>.  If <u>n</u> is omitted,  the  return
              status is that of the last command executed in the function body.  If used outside a function,
              but during execution of a script by the <b>.</b>  (<b>source</b>) command, it causes the shell to stop  exe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cuting&nbsp;executing</font>
              cuting  that script and return either <u>n</u> or the exit status of the last command executed within
              the script as the exit status of the script.  If used outside a function and not during execu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;execution</font>
              tion  of  a  script  by <b>.</b>, the return status is false.  Any command associated with the <b>RETURN</b>
              trap is executed before execution resumes after the function or script.

       <b>set</b> [<b>--abefhkmnptuvxBCHP</b>] [<b>-o</b> <u>option</u>] [<u>arg</u> ...]
              Without options, the name and value of each shell variable are displayed in a format that  can
              be  reused as input for setting or resetting the currently-set variables.  Read-only variables
              cannot be reset.  In <u>posix</u> <u>mode</u>, only shell  variables  are  listed.   The  output  is  sorted
              according  to  the  current  locale.   When  options  are  specified,  they set or unset shell
              attributes.  Any arguments remaining after the options are processed are treated as values for
              the  positional parameters and are assigned, in order, to <b>$1</b>, <b>$2</b>, <b>...</b>  <b>$</b><u>n</u>.  Options, if speci-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fied,&nbsp;specified,</font>
              fied, have the following meanings:
              <b>-a</b>      Automatically mark variables and functions which are modified or created for export to
                      the environment of subsequent commands.
              <b>-b</b>      Report  the  status  of terminated background jobs immediately, rather than before the
                      next primary prompt.  This is effective only when job control is enabled.
              <b>-e</b>      Exit immediately if a <u>simple</u> <u>command</u> (see <b>SHELL</b> <b>GRAMMAR</b> above) exits with  a  non-zero
                      status.  The shell does not exit if the command that fails is part of the command list
                      immediately following a <b>while</b> or <b>until</b> keyword, part of the test in an  <u>if</u>  statement,
                      part  of a <b>&amp;&amp;</b> or <b>||</b> list, or if the command's return value is being inverted via <b>!</b>.  A
                      trap on <b>ERR</b>, if set, is executed before the shell exits.
              <b>-f</b>      Disable pathname expansion.
              <b>-h</b>      Remember the location of commands as they  are  looked  up  for  execution.   This  is
                      enabled by default.
              <b>-k</b>      All arguments in the form of assignment statements are placed in the environment for a
                      command, not just those that precede the command name.
              <b>-m</b>      Monitor mode.  Job control is enabled.  This option is on by default  for  interactive
                      shells  on  systems that support it (see <b>JOB</b> <b>CONTROL</b> above).  Background processes run
                      in a separate process group and a line containing their exit status  is  printed  upon
                      their completion.
              <b>-n</b>      Read  commands  but do not execute them.  This may be used to check a shell script for
                      syntax errors.  This is ignored by interactive shells.
              <b>-o</b> <u>option-name</u>
                      The <u>option-name</u> can be one of the following:

                      <b>emacs</b>   Use an emacs-style command line editing interface.  This is enabled by default
                              when  the shell is interactive, unless the shell is started with the <b>--noedit</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;--noediting</font>

                              by default in interactive shells.
                      <b>ignoreeof</b>
                              The  effect is as if the shell command ``IGNOREEOF=10'' had been executed (see
                              <b>Shell</b> <b>Variables</b> above).

                      <b>pipefail</b>
                              If set, the return value of a pipeline is the value of  the  last  (rightmost)
                              command  to  exit with a non-zero status, or zero if all commands in the pipe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">line&nbsp;pipeline</font>

                      <b>posix</b>   Change the behavior of <b>bash</b> where the default operation differs from the POSIX
                              standard to match the standard (<u>posix</u> <u>mode</u>).

                      If  <b>-o</b> is supplied with no <u>option-name</u>, the values of the current options are printed.

                      rent option settings is displayed on the standard output.
              <b>-p</b>      Turn  on  <u>privileged</u>  mode.   In  this mode, the <b>$ENV</b> and <b>$BASH_ENV</b> files are not pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cessed,&nbsp;processed,</font>
                      cessed, shell functions are not inherited from  the  environment,  and  the  <b>SHELLOPTS</b>
                      variable,  if it appears in the environment, is ignored.  If the shell is started with
                      the effective user (group) id not equal to the real user (group) id, and the <b>-p</b> option
                      is  not supplied, these actions are taken and the effective user id is set to the real
                      user id.  If the <b>-p</b> option is supplied at startup, the effective user id is not reset.
                      Turning  this option off causes the effective user and group ids to be set to the real
                      user and group ids.
              <b>-t</b>      Exit after reading and executing one command.
              <b>-u</b>      Treat unset variables as an error when performing parameter expansion.   If  expansion
                      is  attempted  on  an  unset  variable, the shell prints an error message, and, if not
                      interactive, exits with a non-zero status.
              <b>-v</b>      Print shell input lines as they are read.
              <b>-x</b>      After expanding each <u>simple</u> <u>command</u>, <b>for</b> command, <b>case</b>  command,  <b>select</b>  command,  or
                      arithmetic <b>for</b> command, display the expanded value of <b>PS4</b>, followed by the command and
                      its expanded arguments or associated word list.
              <b>-B</b>      The shell performs brace expansion  (see  <b>Brace</b>  <b>Expansion</b>  above).   This  is  on  by
                      default.
              <b>-C</b>      If  set,  <b>bash</b>  does not overwrite an existing file with the <b>&gt;</b>, <b>&gt;&amp;</b>, and <b>&lt;&gt;</b> redirection
                      operators.  This may be overridden when creating output files by using the redirection
                      operator <b>&gt;|</b> instead of <b>&gt;</b>.
              <b>-E</b>      If  set,  any  trap on <b>ERR</b> is inherited by shell functions, command substitutions, and
                      commands executed in a subshell environment.  The <b>ERR</b> trap is normally  not  inherited
                      in such cases.
              <b>-H</b>      Enable  <b>!</b>  style history substitution.  This option is on by default when the shell is
                      interactive.
              <b>-P</b>      If set, the shell does not follow symbolic links when executing commands  such  as  <b>cd</b>
                      that  change  the current working directory.  It uses the physical directory structure
                      instead.  By default, <b>bash</b> follows the logical chain of  directories  when  performing
                      commands which change the current directory.
              <b>-T</b>      If  set,  any traps on <b>DEBUG</b> and <b>RETURN</b> are inherited by shell functions, command sub-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">stitutions,&nbsp;substitutions,</font>
                      stitutions, and commands executed in a subshell environment.   The  <b>DEBUG</b>  and  <b>RETURN</b>
                      traps are normally not inherited in such cases.
              <b>--</b>      If  no arguments follow this option, then the positional parameters are unset.  Other-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">wise,&nbsp;Otherwise,</font>
                      wise, the positional parameters are set to the <u>arg</u>s, even if some of them begin with a
                      <b>-</b>.
              <b>-</b>       Signal  the  end of options, cause all remaining <u>arg</u>s to be assigned to the positional
                      parameters.  The <b>-x</b> and <b>-v</b> options are turned off.  If there are no  <u>arg</u>s,  the  posi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tional&nbsp;positional</font>
                      tional parameters remain unchanged.

              The  options  are  off  by default unless otherwise noted.  Using + rather than - causes these
              options to be turned off.  The options can also be specified as arguments to an invocation  of
              the  shell.   The current set of options may be found in <b>$-</b>.  The return status is always true
              unless an invalid option is encountered.

       <b>shift</b> [<u>n</u>]
              The positional parameters from <u>n</u>+1 ... are renamed to <b>$1</b> <b>....</b>  Parameters represented  by  the
              numbers  <b>$#</b>  down  to <b>$#</b>-<u>n</u>+1 are unset.  <u>n</u> must be a non-negative number less than or equal to
              <b>$#</b>.  If <u>n</u> is 0, no parameters are changed.  If <u>n</u> is not given, it is assumed to be 1.  If <u>n</u> is
              greater than <b>$#</b>, the positional parameters are not changed.  The return status is greater than
              zero if <u>n</u> is greater than <b>$#</b> or less than zero; otherwise 0.

       <b>shopt</b> [<b>-pqsu</b>] [<b>-o</b>] [<u>optname</u> ...]
              Toggle the values of variables controlling optional shell behavior.  With no options, or  with
              the  <b>-p</b>  option, a list of all settable options is displayed, with an indication of whether or
              not each is set.  The <b>-p</b> option causes output to be displayed in a form that may be reused  as
              input.  Other options have the following meanings:
              <b>-s</b>     Enable (set) each <u>optname</u>.
              <b>-u</b>     Disable (unset) each <u>optname</u>.
              <b>-q</b>     Suppresses  normal output (quiet mode); the return status indicates whether the <u>optname</u>
                     is set or unset.  If multiple <u>optname</u> arguments are given with <b>-q</b>, the return status is
                     zero if all <u>optnames</u> are enabled; non-zero otherwise.
              <b>-o</b>     Restricts  the  values  of  <u>optname</u>  to  be  those defined for the <b>-o</b> option to the <b>set</b>
                     builtin.

              If either <b>-s</b> or <b>-u</b> is used with no <u>optname</u> arguments, the display is limited to those  options
              which  are set or unset, respectively.  Unless otherwise noted, the <b>shopt</b> options are disabled
              (unset) by default.

              The return status when listing options is zero if all <u>optnames</u> are  enabled,  non-zero  other-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">wise.&nbsp;otherwise.</font>
              wise.  When setting or unsetting options, the return status is zero unless an <u>optname</u> is not a
              valid shell option.

              The list of <b>shopt</b> options is:

              <b>cdable_vars</b>
                      If set, an argument to the <b>cd</b> builtin command that is not a directory is assumed to be
                      the name of a variable whose value is the directory to change to.
              <b>cdspell</b> If  set, minor errors in the spelling of a directory component in a <b>cd</b> command will be
                      corrected.  The errors checked for are transposed characters, a missing character, and
                      one character too many.  If a correction is found, the corrected file name is printed,
                      and the command proceeds.  This option is only used by interactive shells.
              <b>checkhash</b>
                      If set, <b>bash</b> checks that a command found in the hash table  exists  before  trying  to
                      execute  it.  If a hashed command no longer exists, a normal path search is performed.
              <b>checkwinsize</b>
                      If set, <b>bash</b> checks the window size after each command and, if necessary, updates  the
                      values of <b>LINES</b> and <b>COLUMNS</b>.
              <b>cmdhist</b> If set, <b>bash</b> attempts to save all lines of a multiple-line command in the same history
                      entry.  This allows easy re-editing of multi-line commands.
              <b>dotglob</b> If set, <b>bash</b> includes filenames beginning with a `.' in the results of pathname expan-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion.&nbsp;expansion.</font>
                      sion.
              <b>execfail</b>
                      If  set, a non-interactive shell will not exit if it cannot execute the file specified
                      as an argument to the <b>exec</b> builtin command.  An interactive shell  does  not  exit  if
                      <b>exec</b> fails.
              <b>expand_aliases</b>
                      If set, aliases are expanded as described above under <b>ALIASES</b>.  This option is enabled
                      by default for interactive shells.
              <b>extdebug</b>
                      If set, behavior intended for use by debuggers is enabled:
                      <b>1.</b>     The <b>-F</b> option to the <b>declare</b> builtin displays the source  file  name  and  line
                             number corresponding to each function name supplied as an argument.
                      <b>2.</b>     If the command run by the <b>DEBUG</b> trap returns a non-zero value, the next command
                             is skipped and not executed.
                      <b>3.</b>     If the command run by the <b>DEBUG</b> trap returns a value of 2,  and  the  shell  is
                             executing in a subroutine (a shell function or a shell script executed by the <b>.</b>
                             or <b>source</b> builtins), a call to <b>return</b> is simulated.
                      <b>4.</b>     <b>BASH_ARGC</b> and <b>BASH_ARGV</b> are updated as described in their descriptions above.

                      If  set,  <b>$</b>'<u>string</u>'  and <b>$</b>"<u>string</u>" quoting is performed within <b>${</b><u>parameter</u><b>}</b> expansions
                      enclosed in double quotes.  This option is enabled by default.
              <b>failglob</b>
                      If set, patterns which fail to match filenames during pathname expansion result in  an

              <b>force_fignore</b>
                      If set, the suffixes specified by the <b>FIGNORE</b> shell variable cause words to be ignored
                      when performing word completion even if the ignored words are the only  possible  com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pletions.&nbsp;completions.</font>

                      enabled by default.
              <b>gnu_errfmt</b>
                      If set, shell error messages are written in the standard GNU error message format.
              <b>histappend</b>
                      If set, the history list is appended to the file named by the value  of  the  <b>HISTFILE</b>
                      variable when the shell exits, rather than overwriting the file.
              <b>histreedit</b>
                      If  set,  and  <b>readline</b>  is  being  used, a user is given the opportunity to re-edit a
                      failed history substitution.
              <b>histverify</b>
                      If set, and <b>readline</b> is being used, the results of history substitution are not  imme-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">diately&nbsp;immediately</font>
                      diately  passed  to  the shell parser.  Instead, the resulting line is loaded into the
                      <b>readline</b> editing buffer, allowing further modification.
              <b>hostcomplete</b>
                      If set, and <b>readline</b> is being used, <b>bash</b> will attempt to perform  hostname  completion
                      when  a  word containing a <b>@</b> is being completed (see <b>Completing</b> under <b>READLINE</b> above).
                      This is enabled by default.
              <b>huponexit</b>
                      If set, <b>bash</b> will send <b>SIGHUP</b> to all jobs when an interactive login shell exits.
              <b>interactive_comments</b>
                      If set, allow a word beginning with <b>#</b> to cause that word and all remaining  characters
                      on  that line to be ignored in an interactive shell (see <b>COMMENTS</b> above).  This option
                      is enabled by default.

              <b>login_shell</b>
                      The  shell  sets this option if it is started as a login shell (see <b>INVOCATION</b> above).
                      The value may not be changed.
              <b>mailwarn</b>
                      If set, and a file that <b>bash</b> is checking for mail has been  accessed  since  the  last
                      time  it was checked, the message ``The mail in <u>mailfile</u> has been read'' is displayed.
              <b>no_empty_cmd_completion</b>
                      If set, and <b>readline</b> is being used, <b>bash</b> will not attempt to search the <b>PATH</b> for  pos-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sible&nbsp;possible</font>
                      sible completions when completion is attempted on an empty line.
              <b>nocaseglob</b>
                      If  set, <b>bash</b> matches filenames in a case-insensitive fashion when performing pathname
                      expansion (see <b>Pathname</b> <b>Expansion</b> above).
              <b>nocasematch</b>
                      If set, <b>bash</b> matches patterns in a case-insensitive fashion when  performing  matching
                      while executing <b>case</b> or <b>[[</b> conditional commands.
              <b>nullglob</b>
                      If  set,  <b>bash</b>  allows patterns which match no files (see <b>Pathname</b> <b>Expansion</b> above) to
                      expand to a null string, rather than themselves.
              <b>progcomp</b>
                      If set, the programmable completion facilities (see <b>Programmable</b> <b>Completion</b> above) are
                      enabled.  This option is enabled by default.
              <b>promptvars</b>
                      If  set,  prompt strings undergo parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic
                      expansion, and quote removal after being expanded as  described  in  <b>PROMPTING</b>  above.
                      This option is enabled by default.
              <b>restricted_shell</b>
                      The  shell  sets this option if it is started in restricted mode (see <b>RESTRICTED</b> <b>SHELL</b>
                      below).  The value may not be changed.  This is not reset when the startup  files  are
                      executed, allowing the startup files to discover whether or not a shell is restricted.
              <b>shift_verbose</b>
                      If set, the <b>shift</b> builtin prints an error message when the  shift  count  exceeds  the
                      number of positional parameters.
              <b>sourcepath</b>
                      If set, the <b>source</b> (<b>.</b>) builtin uses the value of <b>PATH</b> to find the directory containing
                      the file supplied as an argument.  This option is enabled by default.
              <b>xpg_echo</b>
                      If set, the <b>echo</b> builtin expands backslash-escape sequences by default.
       <b>suspend</b> [<b>-f</b>]
              Suspend the execution of this shell until it receives a <b>SIGCONT</b> signal.  The  <b>-f</b>  option  says
              not  to complain if this is a login shell; just suspend anyway.  The return status is 0 unless
              the shell is a login shell and <b>-f</b> is not supplied, or if job control is not enabled.
       <b>test</b> <u>expr</u>
       <b>[</b> <u>expr</u> <b>]</b>
              Return a status of 0 or 1 depending on the evaluation  of  the  conditional  expression  <u>expr</u>.

              Expressions  may  be  combined  using  the  following operators, listed in decreasing order of
              precedence.
              <b>!</b> <u>expr</u> True if <u>expr</u> is false.
              <b>(</b> <u>expr</u> <b>)</b>
                     Returns the value of <u>expr</u>.  This may be used to override the normal precedence of oper-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ators.&nbsp;operators.</font>
                     ators.

                     True if both <u>expr1</u> and <u>expr2</u> are true.
              <u>expr1</u> -<b>o</b> <u>expr2</u>
                     True if either <u>expr1</u> or <u>expr2</u> is true.

              ments.

              0 arguments
                     The expression is false.
              1 argument
                     The expression is true if and only if the argument is not null.
              2 arguments
                     If the first argument is <b>!</b>, the expression is true if and only if the  second  argument
                     is  null.  If the first argument is one of the unary conditional operators listed above
                     under <b>CONDITIONAL</b> <b>EXPRESSIONS</b>, the expression is true if the unary test  is  true.   If
                     the  first argument is not a valid unary conditional operator, the expression is false.
              3 arguments
                     If the second argument is one of the binary conditional operators  listed  above  under
                     <b>CONDITIONAL</b>  <b>EXPRESSIONS</b>, the result of the expression is the result of the binary test
                     using the first and third arguments as operands.  If the first argument is <b>!</b>, the value
                     is  the negation of the two-argument test using the second and third arguments.  If the
                     first argument is exactly <b>(</b> and the third argument is exactly <b>)</b>, the result is the one-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">argument&nbsp;oneargument</font>
                     argument  test of the second argument.  Otherwise, the expression is false.  The <b>-a</b> and
                     <b>-o</b> operators are considered binary operators in this case.
              4 arguments
                     If the first argument is <b>!</b>, the result is the negation of the three-argument expression
                     composed of the remaining arguments.  Otherwise, the expression is parsed and evaluated
                     according to precedence using the rules listed above.
              5 or more arguments
                     The expression is parsed and evaluated according to precedence using the  rules  listed
                     above.

       <b>times</b>  Print  the  accumulated  user  and  system  times for the shell and for processes run from the
              shell.  The return status is 0.

       <b>trap</b> [<b>-lp</b>] [[<u>arg</u>] <u>sigspec</u> ...]
              The command <u>arg</u> is to be read and executed when the shell receives <!-- a -->signal(s)<!-- /a --> <u>sigspec</u>.  If  <u>arg</u>
              is absent (and there is a single <u>sigspec</u>) or <b>-</b>, each specified signal is reset to its original
              disposition (the value it had upon entrance to the shell).  If <u>arg</u> is the null string the sig-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nal&nbsp;signal</font>
              nal  specified by each <u>sigspec</u> is ignored by the shell and by the commands it invokes.  If <u>arg</u>
              is not present and <b>-p</b> has been supplied, then the trap commands associated with  each  <u>sigspec</u>
              are  displayed.   If no arguments are supplied or if only <b>-p</b> is given, <b>trap</b> prints the list of
              commands associated with each signal.  The <b>-l</b> option causes the shell to print a list of  sig-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nal&nbsp;signal</font>
              nal  names  and  their corresponding numbers.  Each <u>sigspec</u> is either a signal name defined in
              &lt;<u>signal.h&gt;</u>, or a signal number.  Signal names are case  insensitive  and  the  SIG  prefix  is
              optional.   If a <u>sigspec</u> is <b>EXIT</b> (0) the command <u>arg</u> is executed on exit from the shell.  If a
              <u>sigspec</u> is <b>DEBUG</b>, the command <u>arg</u> is executed before every <u>simple</u> <u>command</u>, <u>for</u>  command,  <u>case</u>
              command,  <u>select</u>  command, every arithmetic <u>for</u> command, and before the first command executes
              in a shell function (see <b>SHELL</b> <b>GRAMMAR</b> above).  Refer  to  the  description  of  the  <b>extdebug</b>
              option to the <b>shopt</b> builtin for details of its effect on the <b>DEBUG</b> trap.  If a <u>sigspec</u> is <b>ERR</b>,
              the command <u>arg</u> is executed whenever a simple command has a non-zero exit status,  subject  to
              the  following  conditions.  The <b>ERR</b> trap is not executed if the failed command is part of the
              command list immediately following a <b>while</b> or <b>until</b> keyword, part of the test in an <u>if</u>  state-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment,&nbsp;statement,</font>
              ment,  part  of  a  <b>&amp;&amp;</b>  or  <b>||</b> list, or if the command's return value is being inverted via <b>!</b>.
              These are the same conditions obeyed by the <b>errexit</b> option.  If a <u>sigspec</u> is <b>RETURN</b>, the  com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
              mand  <u>arg</u>  is  executed  each  time a shell function or a script executed with the <b>.</b> or <b>source</b>
              builtins finishes executing.  Signals ignored upon entry to the shell  cannot  be  trapped  or
              reset.   Trapped  signals  that  are not being ignored are reset to their original values in a
              child process when it is created.  The return status is false if any <u>sigspec</u> is invalid;  oth-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">erwise&nbsp;otherwise</font>
              erwise <b>trap</b> returns true.

       <b>type</b> [<b>-aftpP</b>] <u>name</u> [<u>name</u> ...]
              With  no  options,  indicate how each <u>name</u> would be interpreted if used as a command name.  If
              the <b>-t</b> option is used, <b>type</b> prints a string which is one of <u>alias</u>, <u>keyword</u>, <u>function</u>, <u>builtin</u>,
              or  <u>file</u>  if  <u>name</u>  is an alias, shell reserved word, function, builtin, or disk file, respec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tively.&nbsp;respectively.</font>
              tively.  If the <u>name</u> is not found, then nothing is printed, and an exit  status  of  false  is
              returned.   If the <b>-p</b> option is used, <b>type</b> either returns the name of the disk file that would
              be executed if <u>name</u> were specified as a command name, or nothing if ``type -t name'' would not
              return <u>file</u>.  The <b>-P</b> option forces a <b>PATH</b> search for each <u>name</u>, even if ``type -t name'' would
              not return <u>file</u>.  If a command is hashed, <b>-p</b> and <b>-P</b> print the hashed  value,  not  necessarily
              the  file that appears first in <b>PATH</b>.  If the <b>-a</b> option is used, <b>type</b> prints all of the places
              that contain an executable named <u>name</u>.  This includes aliases and functions, if  and  only  if
              the  <b>-p</b> option is not also used.  The table of hashed commands is not consulted when using <b>-a</b>.
              The <b>-f</b> option suppresses shell function lookup, as with the  <b>command</b>  builtin.   <b>type</b>  returns
              true if any of the arguments are found, false if none are found.

       <b>ulimit</b> [<b>-SHacdefilmnpqrstuvx</b> [<u>limit</u>]]
              Provides  control over the resources available to the shell and to processes started by it, on
              systems that allow such control.  The <b>-H</b> and <b>-S</b> options specify that the hard or soft limit is
              set for the given resource.  A hard limit cannot be increased once it is set; a soft limit may
              be increased up to the value of the hard limit.  If neither <b>-H</b> nor <b>-S</b> is specified,  both  the
              soft  and  hard  limits are set.  The value of <u>limit</u> can be a number in the unit specified for
              the resource or one of the special values <b>hard</b>, <b>soft</b>, or <b>unlimited</b>, which stand for  the  cur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rent&nbsp;current</font>
              rent hard limit, the current soft limit, and no limit, respectively.  If <u>limit</u> is omitted, the
              current value of the soft limit of the resource is printed, unless the  <b>-H</b>  option  is  given.
              When  more  than  one  resource  is  specified, the limit name and unit are printed before the
              value.  Other options are interpreted as follows:
              <b>-a</b>     All current limits are reported
              <b>-c</b>     The maximum size of core files created
              <b>-d</b>     The maximum size of a process's data segment
              <b>-e</b>     The maximum scheduling priority ("nice")
              <b>-f</b>     The maximum size of files written by the shell and its children
              <b>-i</b>     The maximum number of pending signals
              <b>-l</b>     The maximum size that may be locked into memory
              <b>-m</b>     The maximum resident set size
              <b>-n</b>     The maximum number of open file descriptors (most systems do not allow this value to be
                     set)
              <b>-p</b>     The pipe size in 512-byte blocks (this may not be set)
              <b>-q</b>     The maximum number of bytes in POSIX message queues
              <b>-r</b>     The maximum real-time scheduling priority
              <b>-s</b>     The maximum stack size
              <b>-t</b>     The maximum amount of cpu time in seconds
              <b>-u</b>     The maximum number of processes available to a single user
              <b>-v</b>     The maximum amount of virtual memory available to the shell
              <b>-x</b>     The maximum number of file locks

              If  <u>limit</u>  is  given,  it is the new value of the specified resource (the <b>-a</b> option is display
              only).  If no option is given, then <b>-f</b> is assumed.  Values are in 1024-byte increments, except
              for  <b>-t</b>,  which  is in seconds, <b>-p</b>, which is in units of 512-byte blocks, and <b>-n</b> and <b>-u</b>, which
              are unscaled values.  The return status is 0 unless an invalid option or argument is supplied,
              or an error occurs while setting a new limit.

       <b>umask</b> [<b>-p</b>] [<b>-S</b>] [<u>mode</u>]
              The user file-creation mask is set to <u>mode</u>.  If <u>mode</u> begins with a digit, it is interpreted as
              an octal number; otherwise it is interpreted as a symbolic mode mask similar to that  accepted
              by  <a href="chmod.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/chmod"><u>chmod</u>(1)</a>.   If  <u>mode</u>  is omitted, the current value of the mask is printed.  The <b>-S</b> option
              causes the mask to be printed in symbolic form; the default output is an octal number.  If the
              <b>-p</b>  option  is  supplied,  and  <u>mode</u> is omitted, the output is in a form that may be reused as
              input.  The return status is 0 if the mode was successfully changed or if no <u>mode</u> argument was
              supplied, and false otherwise.

       <b>unalias</b> [-<b>a</b>] [<u>name</u> ...]
              Remove  each  <u>name</u> from the list of defined aliases.  If <b>-a</b> is supplied, all alias definitions
              are removed.  The return value is true unless a supplied <u>name</u> is not a defined alias.

       <b>unset</b> [-<b>fv</b>] [<u>name</u> ...]
              For each <u>name</u>, remove the corresponding variable or function.  If no options are supplied,  or
              the  <b>-v</b> option is given, each <u>name</u> refers to a shell variable.  Read-only variables may not be
              unset.  If <b>-f</b> is specified, each <u>name</u> refers to a shell function, and the function  definition

       <b>wait</b> [<u>n</u> <u>...</u>]
              Wait for each specified process and return its termination status.  Each <u>n</u> may be a process ID
              or  a  job  specification;  if  a  job spec is given, all processes in that job's pipeline are
              waited for.  If <u>n</u> is not given, all currently active child processes are waited for,  and  the
              return  status  is  zero.   If <u>n</u> specifies a non-existent process or job, the return status is
              127.  Otherwise, the return status is the exit status of the last process or job waited for.

<b>RESTRICTED</b> <b>SHELL</b>
       If <b>bash</b> is started with the name <b>rbash</b>, or the <b>-r</b> option is supplied at invocation, the shell becomes
       restricted.   A  restricted  shell is used to set up an environment more controlled than the standard
       shell.  It behaves identically to <b>bash</b> with the exception that the following are  disallowed  or  not
       performed:

             changing directories with <b>cd</b>

             setting or unsetting the values of <b>SHELL</b>, <b>PATH</b>, <b>ENV</b>, or <b>BASH_ENV</b>

             specifying command names containing <b>/</b>

             specifying a file name containing a <b>/</b> as an argument to the <b>.</b>  builtin command

             Specifying  a  filename containing a slash as an argument to the <b>-p</b> option to the <b>hash</b> builtin
              command

             importing function definitions from the shell environment at startup

             parsing the value of <b>SHELLOPTS</b> from the shell environment at startup

             redirecting output using the &gt;, &gt;|, &lt;&gt;, &gt;&amp;, &amp;&gt;, and &gt;&gt; redirection operators

             using the <b>exec</b> builtin command to replace the shell with another command

             adding or deleting builtin commands with the <b>-f</b> and <b>-d</b> options to the <b>enable</b> builtin command

             Using the <b>enable</b> builtin command to enable disabled shell builtins

             specifying the <b>-p</b> option to the <b>command</b> builtin command

             turning off restricted mode with <b>set</b> <b>+r</b> or <b>set</b> <b>+o</b> <b>restricted</b>.

       These restrictions are enforced after any startup files are read.

       When a command that is found to be a shell script is executed (see <b>COMMAND</b>  <b>EXECUTION</b>  above),  <b>rbash</b>
       turns off any restrictions in the shell spawned to execute the script.

<b>BUG</b> <b>REPORTS</b>
       If you find a bug in <b>bash,</b> you should report it.  But first, you should make sure that it really is a
       bug, and that it appears in the latest version of <b>bash</b>.  The latest version is always available  from
       <u>ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/bash/</u>.

       Once  you have determined that a bug actually exists, use the <u>bashbug</u> command to submit a bug report.
       If you have a fix, you are encouraged to mail that as  well!   Suggestions  and  `philosophical'  bug
       reports may be mailed to <u>bug-bash@gnu.org</u> or posted to the Usenet newsgroup <b>gnu.bash.bug</b>.

       ALL bug reports should include:

       The version number of <b>bash</b>
       The hardware and operating system
       The compiler used to compile
       A description of the bug behaviour
       A short script or `recipe' which exercises the bug

       <u>bashbug</u>  inserts  the  first three items automatically into the template it provides for filing a bug
       report.

       Comments and bug reports concerning this manual page should be directed to <u>chet@po.cwru.edu</u>.

<b>BUGS</b>
       It's too big and too slow.

       There are some subtle differences between <b>bash</b> and traditional versions of <b>sh</b>, mostly because of  the
       <b>POSIX</b> specification.

       Aliases are confusing in some uses.

       Shell builtin commands and functions are not stoppable/restartable.

       Compound  commands  and  command  sequences  of  the form `a ; b ; c' are not handled gracefully when
       process suspension is attempted.  When a process is stopped, the shell immediately executes the  next
       command  in the sequence.  It suffices to place the sequence of commands between parentheses to force
       it into a subshell, which may be stopped as a unit.

       Commands inside of <b>$(</b>...<b>)</b> command substitution are not parsed until substitution is attempted.   This
       will  delay  error  reporting  until  some time after the command is entered.  For example, unmatched
       parentheses, even inside shell comments, will result in error messages while the construct  is  being
       read.

       Array variables may not (yet) be exported.
