<pre class="sourcecodebox">CheckExecutableArchitecture

This sample deals with the problem of determining in advance whether a
particular Mach-O executable contains a version suitable for executing on a
given processor architecture.  

For example, an application running on an Intel-based Macintosh may wish to
examine a set of potential plugins, because it suspects that some of them may
be PowerPC-only and thus not suitable for loading.  Note that this sort of
preflighting is not absolutely necessary; one might simply attempt to load a
plugin and let the operation fail if the executable is not suitable.  However,
for user interface reasons, preflighting may often be desirable.

Future versions of Mac OS X may contain APIs that will make this sort of
determination much simpler, and thus supersede the techniques presented in this
sample.  However, the code here may still be instructive and relevant for those
who wish to understand the structure of Mach-O executables.

There are actually two different sorts of files that will be accepted and used
as executables with Mach-O content:  (a) those that are individual Mach-O
files, as described in
&lt;http://developer.apple.com/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/MachORuntime/index.html&gt;,
and (b) those that contain a collection of Mach-O files for different processor
architectures, often known as universal binaries, as described in
&lt;http://developer.apple.com/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/MachORuntime/FileStructure/chapter_2.1_section_7.html&gt;.
 Both types contain processor architecture specifications--only one, in the
first case, or many, in the second case.

For those who are working at the command line, /usr/bin/file can be used to
immediately identify these different sorts of files, and determine briefly
which architectures they support.  For more detailed information, or to
manipulate the contents of a universal binary, use /usr/bin/lipo.

The problem examined in this sample is that of programmatically determining
whether a given file of either type matches a specified architecture. 
Architectures are specified by numeric constants that specify not only the
processor type, but optionally also a more specific processor subtype.  For a
detailed list of the possible specifications, see &quot;man 3 arch&quot;, or
&lt;http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man3/arch.3.html&gt;.

The most important consequence for this sample is that one should not iterate
over the list of architectures in a file, seeking an exact match.  Instead, the
correct procedure is to create an architecture specification, and then apply a
standard API, NXFindBestFatArch(), to try to find a match for that
specification from the given list of architectures.  NXFindBestFatArch() will
return a pointer to the best match in the list, or NULL if no match is found. 
Here we are interested only in whether a match exists, so we detect only
whether the result is non-NULL.

The creation of an architecture specification is done using
NXGetLocalArchInfo() to obtain a specification for the current architecture
(whatever it may be), or using NXGetArchInfoFromName() to obtain a
specification for some other architecture, using a name such as &quot;ppc&quot;, &quot;i386&quot;,
and so on.  In the case mentioned above, in which a process is looking for
plugins suitable for loading, one would properly use NXGetLocalArchInfo() to
avoid hard-coding any specific alternatives.  More information about all of
these functions and names can be found on the &quot;arch&quot; manpage referred to above.

The sample is presented here in the form of a command-line tool using
CoreFoundation.  It should be compiled with &quot;cc -o
check_executable_architecture -framework CoreFoundation
check_executable_architecture.c&quot;.  The result will be a tool that takes any
number of file or directory names as arguments.  Files are directly checked to
determine whether they are of any Mach-O types, and if so they are checked to
see whether they match the current architecture, whether they match &quot;ppc&quot;, and
whether they match &quot;i386&quot;.  Directories are assumed to be bundles, and for them
CFBundle is used to locate their executables, which are then checked as files.

There are a number of salient points here.  Files are checked by reading in
their first 512 bytes.  It is important to check the type of the file with
stat() before open()ing it for reading, and to open only regular files, since
some types of special files can cause the process to hang immediately on open()
or read().  

The type of the file is determined by examining the first four bytes for one of
six different magic numbers.  The magic number determines whether the file is
Mach-O, 64-bit Mach-O, or a universal binary, and whether its endianness
matches the current architecture or differs from it.  If the endianness does
not match, then the bytes read must be swapped in four-byte blocks (the
relevant portions of the headers consist entirely of four-byte quantities on
four-byte boundaries).

If the file is a universal binary, then the bytes read will contain a list of
fat_arch structures.  If not, then a single fat_arch structure is created based
on the architecture specification in the Mach-O header.  NXFindBestFatArch() is
used, as described above, to determine whether the file matches the current
architecture, whether it matches &quot;ppc&quot;, and whether it matches &quot;i386&quot;. 

It is possible that some executables of interest might not be Mach-O at all,
but of some other type, notably PEF/CFM.  This sample does not directly deal
with such files, merely noting them as not being Mach-O.  For Mac OS X, there
is only one architecture for which PEF/CFM executables are relevant.  Also,
PEF/CFM executables cannot reliably be identified from the first few bytes of
their content, so in general the appropriate assumption (for applications that
deal with CFM) is that non-Mach-O executables might be PEF/CFM.
