<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001249-TPXREF134" title="What Is AppleScript Studio?"></a><h2>What Is AppleScript Studio?</h2><p>AppleScript Studio is a combination of application framework and development environment. It combines features from AppleScript, Xcode, Interface Builder, and the Cocoa application framework. Together, these components provide a sophisticated environment for creating AppleScript solutions. Using AppleScript Studio:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Scripters can build native Mac OS X applications that execute AppleScript scripts, have access to a wide range of user interface objects, and can control scriptable applications and scriptable parts of the Mac OS. These applications are referred to as <strong>AppleScript Studio applications</strong>.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Cocoa developers can take advantage of AppleScript’s many features, including controlling other applications, and can add sophisticated scripting capabilities (not currently available in Cocoa alone) to their applications.</p></li></ul><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001249-TPXREF129" title="What Makes AppleScript Studio Special?"></a><h2>What Makes AppleScript Studio Special?</h2><p>AppleScript Studio is special because it makes it easier to create Mac OS X applications with complex user interfaces that can communicate with and control other applications. The following sections describe additional features that help make AppleScript Studio one of a kind.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001249-TPXREF159" title="AppleScript"></a><h3>AppleScript</h3><p>AppleScript provides the powerful ability to control multiple applications, including many parts of the Mac OS itself. That allows scripters to set up workflow solutions with a combined power that exceeds that of any individual application. </p><p>In addition to the ability to control multiple applications, AppleScript’s strengths include:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>an English-like language that makes scripts easier to write and understand</p></li><li class="li"><p>powerful language features, including list and record manipulation, as well as script objects that provide features such as inheritance and encapsulation; script objects are described in <span class="content_text"><a href="../chapter07/studio_ms_design_app.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001254-BCICFHJC">“Additional Handlers and Scripts in Mail Search”</a></span></p></li><li class="li"><p>the ability to target applications on remote machines</p></li><li class="li"><p>with the addition of support for <strong>SOAP</strong> (simple object access protocol) and <strong>XML-RPC</strong> (a simple protocol for making remote procedure requests to Internet-based servers) in Mac OS X version 10.1, the ability to target Internet servers with remote procedure calls</p></li></ul><p>With AppleScript Studio, script developers can take advantage of all these features, while quickly creating applications that include complex user interfaces. For example, <span class="content_text">Figure 1-1</span> shows Drawer, one of many sample applications distributed with AppleScript Studio. Drawer demonstrates how to use a number of interface classes, including buttons, text fields, radio buttons, steppers, and even its namesake, a drawer. Other sample applications display file and folder information in windows similar to the Finder’s column and list view. See <span class="content_text"><a href="studio_about_book.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001249-CJBJBFAA">“AppleScript Studio Sample Applications”</a></span> for a complete list of sample applications.</p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001249-CJBBHFFB" title="Figure 1-1The Drawer sample application"></a><p><strong>Figure 1-1&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The Drawer sample application</p><img src = "../art/drawer.gif" alt = "The Drawer sample application" width="711" height="349"></div><br/><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001249-TPXREF188" title="Integrated Development Environment"></a><h3>Integrated Development Environment</h3><p>Because it is integrated with Apple’s development environment, AppleScript Studio can take advantage of powerful features provided by Xcode and Interface Builder. These include:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>use of Cocoa’s rich set of user interface classes; layout tools include built-in support for Aqua interface guidelines</p></li><li class="li"><p>tools that simplify building and maintaining complex projects with multiple targets and build steps</p></li><li class="li"><p>easy customization of application menus, icons, and About windows</p></li></ul><p>AppleScript Studio supports a number of scripting features that are also available in the Script Editor application distributed with Mac OS X version 10.3, but were not available in previous versions of the Script Editor. These include:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>creation of arbitrarily large scripts</p></li><li class="li"><p>search and replace in scripts</p></li><li class="li"><p>easy access to handlers and properties in scripts (through a pop-up menu)</p></li><li class="li"><p>a flexible dictionary viewer for working with application scripting terminologies</p></li></ul><p>For more information, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../chapter03/studio_components.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001250-TPXREF136">“Xcode Features for AppleScript Studio”</a></span> and <span class="content_text"><a href="../chapter03/studio_components.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001250-TPXREF137">“Interface Builder Features for AppleScript Studio.”</a></span></p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001249-TPXREF187" title="Application Framework"></a><h3>Application Framework</h3><p>Because AppleScript Studio applications are Cocoa applications, they benefit from Cocoa’s full-featured application framework. As a result, an AppleScript Studio application can perform many operations automatically, without any additional Objective-C code from the developer. Built-in features allow users to open multiple windows, resize and minimize windows, display an About window, enter text in text fields, and even shuffle column positions in a table view.</p><div class="notebox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001249-DontLinkElementID_5" title="Note"></a><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;Objective-C is Cocoa’s native programming language, but you can use other kinds of code within an AppleScript Studio application. For more information, see the section <span class="content_text"><a href="../chapter04/studio_detail.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001251-TPXREF175">“Accessing Code From AppleScript Studio Scripts”</a></span> and the description of the Multi-Language application in <span class="content_text"><a href="studio_about_book.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001249-CJBJBFAA">“AppleScript Studio Sample Applications.”</a></span></p></div><p>To experiment with the features you get in the simplest document-based AppleScript Studio application, even before adding any code or scripts, see the steps in <span class="content_text"><a href="../chapter08/studio_ms_create_intf.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001255-TPXREF153">“Create a Project.”</a></span></p><p>Users with previous Cocoa experience will also find a lot to like in AppleScript Studio, including the ability to</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>use AppleScript to control other applications</p></li><li class="li"><p>do quick prototyping, with scripts taking the place of unimplemented methods</p></li><li class="li"><p>perform simple automated testing, using AppleScript Studio’s ability to script Cocoa user interface objects (not available in Cocoa alone); for more information, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../chapter04/studio_detail.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001251-TPXREF178">“Scripting AppleScript Studio Applications”</a></span></p></li></ul><div class="notebox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001249-DontLinkElementID_6" title="Note"></a><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;AppleScript Studio also supports calling code directly from scripts. For more information, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../chapter04/studio_detail.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001251-TPXREF175">“Accessing Code From AppleScript Studio Scripts.”</a></span></p></div><p>Although you can create applications that perform virtually all of their operations by executing AppleScript scripts, you are free to include additional Cocoa code in applications. You may find it useful to learn more about the Cocoa code working behind the scenes—to do so, see the information provided in <span class="content_text"><a href="../chapter03/studio_components.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001250-TPXREF138">“Cocoa Framework Overview,”</a></span> as well as the Cocoa documentation described in <span class="content_text"><a href="../chapter01/studio_intro_book.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001248-CIHDAGAF">“See Also.”</a></span></p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001249-TPXREF160" title="Strengths and Limitations"></a><h3>Strengths and Limitations</h3><p>AppleScript Studio offers a number of powerful features. However, for scripting tasks that don’t require a complex user interface, such as adjusting your workspace or automating repetitive tasks, the Script Editor (distributed with the Mac OS) or a third-party scripting application is usually a more appropriate tool. You’ll have access to AppleScript’s key features without the overhead that comes with AppleScript Studio’s additional power.</p><p>AppleScript Studio shows its strength for tasks that require:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>a complex user interface</p></li><li class="li"><p>manipulation of information associated with user interface elements</p></li><li class="li"><p>display of information provided or manipulated by other processes (including information gathered from databases)</p></li><li class="li"><p>the ability to take advantage of features written in standard programming languages (which you can access from AppleScript Studio scripts, as shown in the Multi-Language sample application, described in <span class="content_text"><a href="studio_about_book.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001249-CJBJBFAA">“AppleScript Studio Sample Applications”</a></span>)</p></li><li class="li"><p>a fully functional build environment</p></li></ul><p>AppleScript Studio is less appropriate for tasks that require:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>display of large amounts of data (such as massive tables)</p></li><li class="li"><p>intensive computation or manipulation of large amounts of data in AppleScript Studio scripts</p></li><li class="li"><p>intensive interaction with a file system (such as displaying large numbers of files; you can try the Browser sample application, described in <span class="content_text"><a href="studio_about_book.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001249-CJBJBFAA">“AppleScript Studio Sample Applications,”</a></span> to experiment with the performance of an application that browses the file system)</p></li><li class="li"><p>simple scripting operations, especially those with little or no user interface</p></li></ul><p>You may notice that AppleScript Studio performs poorly when you use AppleScript scripts to perform computation-intensive operations. This reflects the limits of the processing power of the AppleScript language, which was not designed for those kinds of tasks. One way to work around these issues is to have your scripts call into C, C++, Objective-C, or Java code to perform computation-intensive operations. The Multi-Language sample application, distributed with AppleScript Studio, demonstrates how to access code written in various languages from an AppleScript Studio application.</p><p>AppleScript Studio does not support building non-Cocoa applications, or applications that must run in Mac OS 9, or in versions of Mac OS X before version 10.1.2.</p><p>AppleScript Studio applications, like other Cocoa applications, can access frameworks and libraries outside the Cocoa framework, including the Carbon framework, although detailed steps for doing so are not described in this document.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001249-TPXREF161" title="How AppleScript Studio Works"></a><h2>How AppleScript Studio Works</h2><p>This section provides a brief description of AppleScript Studio’s components, introduces key concepts, and lists the steps required to create an AppleScript Studio application.

You also use Interface Builder to link user actions, such as clicking a button or choosing an item in a pop-up menu, to specific handlers in scripts. (Handlers are described in <span class="content_text"><a href="studio_about_book.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001249-CJBGGJHD">“Connecting Actions to Scripts.”</a></span>) For more information, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../chapter03/studio_components.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001250-TPXREF137">“Interface Builder Features for AppleScript Studio.”</a></span></p></li><li class="li"><p><strong>Xcode:</strong> Provides the development environment to edit, build, and debug AppleScript Studio applications, as well as to display dictionaries of scripting terms.

However, there is very little visible Cocoa code required for an AppleScript Studio application (see <span class="content_text"><a href="../chapter03/studio_components.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001250-CJBDAACD">Listing 2-1</a></span>. As a result, scripters gain the ability to create complex interfaces and work in a powerful development environment, while still being able to use AppleScript script statements to control applications.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001249-CJBGGJHD" title="Connecting Actions to Scripts"></a><h3>Connecting Actions to Scripts</h3><p>The ability to connect application events to scripts is a key concept in understanding AppleScript Studio. In every AppleScript Studio application you write, you will connect actions involving the application’s user interface objects to event handlers in its script files, the result of which is shown in <span class="content_text">Figure 1-3</span>. </p><p>A <strong>handler</strong> is a series of one or more script statements that are executed in response to an action or condition. In the case of a simple subroutine, a handler is similar to a function. Handlers that respond to action events in the application are called <strong>event handlers</strong> to distinguish them from other handlers.</p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001249-CJBIDCDC" title="Figure 1-3Connections between user interface items and scripts in an AppleScript Studio application"></a><p><strong>Figure 1-3&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Connections between user interface items and scripts in an AppleScript Studio application</p><img src = "../art/applescptstudioapp.gif" alt = "Connections between user interface items and scripts in an AppleScript Studio application" width="222" height="242"></div><br/><p>Handlers can have zero or more parameters. <span class="content_text">Listing 1-1</span> shows a simple event handler, where <code>(*Add your script here.*)</code> is an AppleScript comment. All event handlers start with the keyword <code>on</code>. The <code>clicked</code> handler has one parameter, <code>theObject</code>, which represents the user interface object that received the <code>clicked</code> message. Most event handlers in AppleScript Studio have this same parameter.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001249-CJBBGEGA" title="Listing 1-1A simple event handler"></a><p class="codesample"><strong>Listing 1-1&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>A simple event handler</p><div class="codesample"><table><tr><td scope="row"><pre>on clicked theObject<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>    (*Add your script here.*)<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>end clicked<span></span></pre></td></tr></table></div><p>You’ll see the full details later in this chapter, but in brief, the process of connecting actions to event handlers consists of these steps:</p><ol class="ol"><li class="li"><p>Use Interface Builder to create a new user interface resource file (or nib file), or to open an existing nib file. The default nib file in an AppleScript Studio project, called <code>MainMenu.nib</code>, automatically contains one window object.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Add interface objects (such as buttons and text views) in Interface Builder. <span class="content_text">Figure 1-4</span> shows one of the palettes of objects available in Interface Builder. </p><div class="item_figure"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001249-CJBDFFFF" title="Figure 1-4Interface Builder&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Palette window, showing the Cocoa-Controls palette"></a><p><strong>Figure 1-4&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Interface Builder’s Palette window, showing the Cocoa-Controls palette</p><img src = "../art/ib_controls_palette.gif" alt = "Interface Builder’s Palette window, showing the Cocoa-Controls palette" width="393" height="254"></div><p><span class="content_text">Figure 1-5</span> shows the results of dragging a button object from the palette to a window.</p><div class="item_figure"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001249-CJBBBDED" title="Figure 1-5A window containing a button"></a><p><strong>Figure 1-5&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>A window containing a button</p><img src = "../art/hw_plain_button.gif" alt = "A window containing a button" width="383" height="259"></div></li><li class="li"><p>Select an interface item (such as a button) in Interface Builder and open the Info window. <span class="content_text">Figure 1-6</span> shows the Info window for a button, with the AppleScript pane visible, showing the possible event handler groups for the object.
