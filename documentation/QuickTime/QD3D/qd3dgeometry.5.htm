NURB curves and patches are especially useful in 3D imaging because they are invariant under scale, rotate, translation, and perspective transformations of their control points.<A NAME="marker=36713"> </A></P><P CLASS="T1.Text1"><A NAME="pgfId=3244"> </A>A <B CLASS="bold">parametric curve</B> is any curve whose points are represented by one or more functions of a single parameter (usually denoted by the letter t or u). The Cartesian coordinates (x,&nbsp;y) of a two-dimensional parametric curve can be represented generally by these two equations:<A NAME="marker=3249"> </A></P><DIV><IMG SRC="qd3dgeometry-4.gif"></DIV><P CLASS="T1.Text1"><A NAME="pgfId=3250"> </A>The Cartesian coordinates (x,&nbsp;y,&nbsp;z) of a three-dimensional parametric curve can be represented generally by these three equations:</P><DIV><IMG SRC="qd3dgeometry-5.gif"></DIV><P CLASS="T1.Text1"><A NAME="pgfId=3256"> </A>For compactness, the two- or three-dimensional point is usually represented as a vector. A two-dimensional point has this vector:</P><DIV><IMG SRC="qd3dgeometry-6.gif"></DIV><P CLASS="T1.Text1"><A NAME="pgfId=3264"> </A>For example, a circle can be defined parametrically by a pair of equations:</P><DIV><IMG SRC="qd3dgeometry-7.gif"></DIV><P CLASS="T1.Text1"><A NAME="pgfId=3268"> </A>Alternatively, a circle can be defined parametrically by this vector equation:</P><DIV><IMG SRC="qd3dgeometry-8.gif"></DIV><P CLASS="T1.Text1"><A NAME="pgfId=3273"> </A>A <B CLASS="bold">B-spline polynomial</B> is a parametric equation of this form:<A NAME="marker=3272"> </A></P><DIV><IMG SRC="qd3dgeometry-9.gif"></DIV><P CLASS="T1.Text1"><A NAME="pgfId=3277"> </A>where</P><DIV><IMG SRC="qd3dgeometry-10.gif"></DIV><P CLASS="T1.Text1"><A NAME="pgfId=3281"> </A>In these equations, the x<EM CLASS="Subscript">i</EM> are elements of an array of real numbers, known as the <B CLASS="bold">knot vector,</B> where each element is greater than or equal to the previous (that is, they are nondecreasing).

Geometrically, they are the (x,&nbsp;y) positions (in a two-dimensional curve) of <B CLASS="bold">control points,</B> which (together with the knot vector) define the shape of the particular curve of which they are a part. The control points and the knots define the curve's shape in this way: a position of a point on the curve at some parametric value <I CLASS="italics">u</I> is a weighted combination of the positions of a subset of all the control points; the &quot;weighting&quot; is determined by the relative values of the knot vector.<A NAME="marker=3285"> </A><A NAME="marker=3286"> </A><A NAME="marker=3287"> </A></P><P CLASS="T1.Text1"><A NAME="pgfId=3288"> </A>Finally, a NURB curve is a curve defined by ratios of B-spline polynomials, where the values assigned to the parameter can be nonuniform. A NURB patch is a surface defined by ratios of B-spline surfaces, which are three-dimensional analogs of B-spline curves. A <B CLASS="bold">B-spline surface</B> is a surface defined by a parametric equation of this form:<A NAME="marker=3292"> </A></P><DIV><IMG SRC="qd3dgeometry-11.gif"></DIV><P CLASS="T1.Text1"><A NAME="pgfId=3296"> </A>where</P><DIV><IMG SRC="qd3dgeometry-12.gif"></DIV><P CLASS="T1.Text1"><A NAME="pgfId=3301"> </A>and<A NAME="marker=3300"> </A></P><DIV><IMG SRC="qd3dgeometry-13.gif"></DIV><P CLASS="T1.Text1"><A NAME="pgfId=6815"> </A>In these equations, the factors B<EM CLASS="Subscript">i</EM>,<EM CLASS="Subscript">j</EM> are, algebraically, the coefficients of the polynomial representing the surface.
