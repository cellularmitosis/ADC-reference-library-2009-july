The Sumatran tiger is found solely on the Island of Sumatra in Indonesia in habitat that ranges from lowland forest to mountain forest. Only about 400-500 tigers exist in the wild and the population is in an extremely vulnerableand precarious state.Sumatran tigers are the biggest cats in the world, averaging 8 feet in length from head to tail and weigh up to 264 pounds. Females are slightly smaller and lighter. Being carnivores, the tiger lives on a diet of wild pig, and small deer and can eat as much as 40 pounds of meat in one sitting.Tigers give birth to a litter of 2 to 3 cubs although litter sizes can be aslarge as five. One usually dies at birth. The cubs are born blind and weigh2 to 3 pounds. They live off their mother's milk for 6-8 weeks and begin making their own kills at 18 months of age.The animals are extremely territorial and solitary except for mothers with cubs.
