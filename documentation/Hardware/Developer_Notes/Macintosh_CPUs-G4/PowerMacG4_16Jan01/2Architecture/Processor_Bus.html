In addition to the increased busclock speed, the bus uses MaxBus protocols, supported by the Uni-NIC, for improved performance. </p><p>The MaxBus protocol includes enhancements that improve busefficiency and throughput over the 60x bus. The enhancements include </p><ul><li>out of ordercompletion </font></li><li>address bus streaming</font></li><li>intervention</font></li></ul><p>Out of order completion allows the memory controller to optimizethe data bus efficiency by transferring whichever data is ready,rather than having to pass data across the bus in the order thetransactions were posted on the bus. This means that a fast DRAMread can pass a slow PCI read, potentially enabling the processorto do more before it has to wait on the PCI data. </p><p>Address bus streaming allows a single master on the bus toissue multiple address transactions back-to-back. This means thata single master can post addresses at the rate of one every twoclocks, as opposed to one every three clocks, as it is in the 60xbus protocol.</p><p>Intervention is a cache coherency optimization that improvesperformance for dual processor systems. If one processor modifiessome data, that data first gets stored only in that processor'scache. If the other processor then wants that data, it needs toget the new modified values. In previous systems, the first processormust write the modified data to memory and then the second processorcan read the correct values from memory. With intervention, thefirst processor sends the data directly to the second processor,reducing latency by a factor of ten or more. </p><br>    <br><a href="Uni_N_Bridg__Controller.html" target="content"><img src="../images/previous.gif" border="0"></a><a href="Main_Memory_Bus.html" target="content"><img src="../images/next.gif" border="0"></a>&nbsp;<br><br><p><hr><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">&#169; 2002 Apple Computer, Inc.
