$Log: MoreSetup.pprefix,v $
Revision 1.2  2001/11/07 15:55:20         
Tidy up headers, add CVS logs, update copyright.

Revision 1.1  2001/10/08 13:51:43         
Used to be MoreSetup.prefix. Renamed it and moved it here.


         <2>      5/6/00    Quinn   Set up PROCTYPE because the latest UI uses it correctly (and
                                    hence expects it to be set up).

(*
	IMPORTANT:
	
	This file is used as the Pascal prefix file, as specified "Pascal Language"
	preferences panel.  It only contains compiler variable definitions.  These
	have to be in a prefix file because of the way the Pascal compiler works.
	
	Other global definitions go into the "MoreSetup.p" unit, which code must
	explicitly use, just like C code has to explicitly include "MoreSetup.h".

(*
	//	We never want to use old names or locations.
	//	Since these settings must be consistent all the way through
	//	a compilation unit, and since we don't want to silently
	//	change them out from under a developer who uses a prefix
	//	file (C/C++ panel of Target Settings), we simply complain
	//	if they are already set in a way we don't like.

	The latest version of Universal Interfaces actually uses PROCTYPE
	correctly if we’re compiling for Metrowerks, so we have to set it 
	up in the prefix file if it’s not already set up.
