        <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004652-CH9-SW1" title="Instruments Quick Start"></a><h1>Instruments Quick Start</h1><p>Instruments is a powerful tool you can use to collect data about the performance and behavior of one or more processes on the system and track that data over time. Unlike most other performance and debugging tools, Instruments lets you gather widely disparate types of data and view them side by side. In this way you can spot trends that might otherwise be hard to spot with other tools. For example, previously you had to sample a program and analyze its memory behavior during two separate execution runs. In Instruments, you can perform these tasks at the same time. You can then use the resulting data to spot trends between the code being run by your program and its corresponding memory usage. </p><p>The Instruments application uses <strong>instruments</strong> to collect data about a process over time. Each instrument collects and displays a different type of information, such as file access, memory use, and so forth.  Instruments includes a library of standard instruments, which you can use as-is to examine various aspects of your code. You can configure instruments to gather data about the same process or about different processes on the system. You can build new instruments using the custom instrument builder interface, which uses the DTrace program to gather the data you want.</p><div class="notebox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004652-CH9-SW7" title="Note"></a><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;Several Apple applications—namely iTunes, DVD Player, and Front Row, and applications that use QuickTime—prevent the collection of data through DTrace (either temporarily or permanently) in order to protect sensitive data. Therefore, you should not run those applications when performing systemwide data collection.</p></div><p>All work in Instruments is done in a trace document. A <strong>trace document</strong> collects the data gathered by the instruments associated with that document. Each trace document typically holds a single session’s worth of data, which is also referred to as a single <strong>trace</strong>. You can save a trace document to preserve the trace data you have gathered and open them again later to view that data.  </p><p>Although most instruments are geared towards gathering trace data, one of the most sophisticated instruments helps automate the collection of data. Using the User Interface instrument, you can record user events while you gather your trace data. You can use this recording to reliably reproduce the same sequence of events over and over again. Each time you run through this sequence, your trace document gathers a new set of trace data from the other instruments in the document and presents that data side by side with previous runs. This feature lets you compare trace data as you make improvements to your code and verify that the changes you make are having the desired impact. </p>

<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004652-CH9-SW8" title="Launching Instruments"></a><h2>Launching Instruments</h2><p>Instruments is available as part of the Xcode Tools installation. There are several ways to launch Instruments: </p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>You can launch Instruments by double-clicking its application icon in the Finder. The Instruments application is located in <em>&lt;Xcode></em><code>/Applications</code>, where <em>&lt;Xcode></em> is the root directory of your Xcode installation. (The default root directory for an Xcode installation is the <code>/Developer</code> directory.)</p></li><li class="li"><p>You can use Xcode to launch Instruments and target an executable in your project. Choose an Instruments template from the Run > Start with Performance Tool menu in Xcode. Instruments launches with the specified template ready to run the current executable, as configured in Xcode.</p><div class="notebox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004652-CH9-SW9" title="Note"></a><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;When launching your program from an Instruments template in this manner, you must explicitly stop your executable—either from the program or from Instruments—after tracing is complete. This does not close the Instruments trace document. Instead, if you relaunch the executable, Instruments displays the new session alongside the previous one, as shown in <span class="content_text"><a href="../WorkingWithaMasterTrack/WorkingWithaMasterTrack.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004652-CH8-SW6">Figure 4-2</a></span>. This lets you change your code in Xcode, rebuild, run, and compare the resulting trace data to the data generated before the change.   </p></div></li><li class="li"><p>You can launch Instruments by double-clicking an Instruments template or trace document. See <span class="content_text"><a href="../SavingTraceTemplates/SavingTraceTemplates.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004652-CH10-SW1">“Saving and Importing Trace Data”</a></span> to learn how to save an instrument configuration or user interface recording as a trace template document.</p></li></ul><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004652-CH9-SW10" title="Creating a Trace Document"></a><h2>Creating a Trace Document</h2><p>When you launch Instruments, the application automatically creates a new document for you. You can also create new documents by choosing File > New. </p><p>For each new document you create, Instruments prompts you to select a starting template. These templates define the initial set of instruments you plan to use in your trace document. Instruments provides several different templates, listed in <span class="content_text">Table 1-1</span>, each geared toward different goals. You can use the Blank template if you want to add a specific set of instruments to your trace document manually. For any of the templates, you can also remove instruments you do not want. </p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004652-CH9-SW6" title="Table 1-1Instruments starting templates"></a><div class="tableholder"><table class="graybox" border = "0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><caption class="tablecaption"><strong>Table 1-1&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Instruments starting templates</caption><tr><th scope="col" align="left" style="font-weight: bold" bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><p>Template</p></th><th scope="col" align="left" style="font-weight: bold" bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><p>Description</p></th></tr><tr><td  scope="row"><p>Blank</p></td><td ><p>Creates an empty trace document to which you can add your own combination of instruments.

The remaining chapters provide more in-depth coverage of Instruments features, including how to add and configure instruments, how to record a user interface track, how to analyze the data that you gather, and how to save the data you gather for later use. </p><p>Remember that program analysis is both an art and a science. On the scientific side, there are some guidelines that can be followed to find problems. For example, if your application has a large memory footprint, it is likely that the application will experience paging at some point, which leads to poor performance. The art comes in determining how to reduce the memory footprint because the answer for every application is different. Is the application caching too much data? Is it loading too many libraries at launch time and then not using them? Is it leaking memory? These are the questions you need to ask yourself, and Instruments is the tool you can use to find the answers.  </p>
