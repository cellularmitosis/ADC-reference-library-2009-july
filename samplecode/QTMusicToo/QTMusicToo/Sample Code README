___________________________QuickTime Music ArchitectureSample Source Code___________________________In this folder are four applications and their source code and Symantec C 7.0 project files. Hopefully, they will compile with the public versions of Movies.h and QuickTimeComponents.h that are included with QuickTime 2.0. If not, you'll have to do your usual software engineering nonsense. (I think some of applications may have menu items for features that don't exist in QuickTime 2.0, such as Looping Test in the QTMusic SampleSequencer. So it goes, consider it a priveleged preview of future features.)All four applications exercise parts of the QuickTime Music Architecture. Following, is a brief description of each. - David Van Brink   Apple Computer   9 December 1994___________________________Instrument Picker Test  This application lets you experiment with a standard user interface provided in QTMA for selecting musical instruments. It offers a selection to the user of the available synthesizers and the available instruments on each synthesizer. You can alter the fields in the ToneDescription structure which is passed to the Instrument Picker by clicking on that field.Major calls used: NAPickInstrument().___________________________Instrument Editor  This application shows in a window all of the “knobs” associated with a particular synthesizer, and lets the user alter them and save the new instrument patches in a file, for later use. The Software Synthesizer in QuickTime 2.0 does support a small number of both instrument and global knobs, but these will change  in the next version of QuickTime! The mechanism for accessing them, however, will not.Major calls used: NANewNoteChannel(), MusicGetKnobDescription(), MusicGetInstrumentKnob(), MusicSetInstrumentKnob().___________________________QTMusic Sample Keyboards  This application draws three musical keyboards in a window, and lets the user click on them to play three different musical instruments. A nice routine for drawing keyboards and tracking clicks on them is included, feel free to borrow it.Major calls used: NANewNoteChannel(), NAPlayNote().___________________________QTMusic Sample Sequencer  This application is a complete sequence editor and player program. It lets the user compose a short musical piece containing four different instruments, in 64 time steps. Code is present which demonstrates the construction of a QuickTime Movie File, as well as calls to the TunePlayer to play sequences without application intervention.Major calls used: TuneQueue().___________________________
