<b>NAME</b>
       perl5005delta - what's new for perl5.005

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       This document describes differences between the 5.004 release and this one.

<b>About</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>versioning</b> <b>system</b>
       Perl is now developed on two tracks: a maintenance track that makes small, safe updates to released
       production versions with emphasis on compatibility; and a development track that pursues more aggres-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sive&nbsp;aggressive</font>
       sive evolution.  Maintenance releases (which should be considered production quality) have subversion
       numbers that run from 1 to 49, and development releases (which should be considered "alpha" quality)
       run from 50 to 99.

       Perl 5.005 is the combined product of the new dual-track development scheme.

<b>Incompatible</b> <b>Changes</b>
       <b>WARNING:</b>  <b>This</b> <b>version</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>binary</b> <b>compatible</b> <b>with</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>5.004.</b>

       Starting with Perl 5.004_50 there were many deep and far-reaching changes to the language internals.
       If you have dynamically loaded extensions that you built under perl 5.003 or 5.004, you can continue
       to use them with 5.004, but you will need to rebuild and reinstall those extensions to use them
       5.005.  See <u>INSTALL</u> for detailed instructions on how to upgrade.

       <b>Default</b> <b>installation</b> <b>structure</b> <b>has</b> <b>changed</b>

       The new Configure defaults are designed to allow a smooth upgrade from 5.004 to 5.005, but you should
       read <u>INSTALL</u> for a detailed discussion of the changes in order to adapt them to your system.

       <b>Perl</b> <b>Source</b> <b>Compatibility</b>

       When none of the experimental features are enabled, there should be very few user-visible Perl source
       compatibility issues.

       If threads are enabled, then some caveats apply. @_ and $_ become lexical variables.  The effect of
       this should be largely transparent to the user, but there are some boundary conditions under which
       user will need to be aware of the issues.  For example, "local(@_)" results in a "Can't localize lex-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ical&nbsp;lexical</font>
       ical variable @_ ..." message.  This may be enabled in a future version.

       Some new keywords have been introduced.  These are generally expected to have very little impact on
       compatibility.  See "New "INIT" keyword", "New "lock" keyword", and "New "qr//" operator".

       Certain barewords are now reserved.  Use of these will provoke a warning if you have asked for them
       with the "-w" switch.  See ""our" is now a reserved word".

       <b>C</b> <b>Source</b> <b>Compatibility</b>

       There have been a large number of changes in the internals to support the new features in this
       release.

          Core sources now require ANSI C compiler

           An ANSI C compiler is now <b>required</b> to build perl.  See <u>INSTALL</u>.

          All Perl global variables must now be referenced with an explicit prefix

           All Perl global variables that are visible for use by extensions now have a "PL_" prefix.  New
           extensions should "not" refer to perl globals by their unqualified names.  To preserve sanity, we
           provide limited backward compatibility for globals that are being widely used like "sv_undef" and
           "na" (which should now be written as "PL_sv_undef", "PL_na" etc.)

           If you find that your XS extension does not compile anymore because a perl global is not visible,
           try adding a "PL_" prefix to the global and rebuild.

           It is strongly recommended that all functions in the Perl API that don't begin with "perl" be
           referenced with a "Perl_" prefix.  The bare function names without the "Perl_" prefix are sup-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ported&nbsp;supported</font>
           ported with macros, but this support may cease in a future release.

           See perlapi.

          Enabling threads has source compatibility issues

           Perl built with threading enabled requires extensions to use the new "dTHR" macro to initialize
           the handle to access per-thread data.  If you see a compiler error that talks about the variable
           "thr" not being declared (when building a module that has XS code),  you need to add "dTHR;" at
           the beginning of the block that elicited the error.

           The API function "perl_get_sv("@",FALSE)" should be used instead of directly accessing perl glob-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">als&nbsp;globals</font>
           als as "GvSV(errgv)".  The API call is backward compatible with existing perls and provides
           source compatibility with threading is enabled.

           See "C Source Compatibility" for more information.

       <b>Binary</b> <b>Compatibility</b>

       This version is NOT binary compatible with older versions.  All extensions will need to be recom-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">piled.&nbsp;recompiled.</font>
       piled.  Further binaries built with threads enabled are incompatible with binaries built without.
       This should largely be transparent to the user, as all binary incompatible configurations have their
       own unique architecture name, and extension binaries get installed at unique locations.  This allows
       coexistence of several configurations in the same directory hierarchy.  See <u>INSTALL</u>.

       <b>Security</b> <b>fixes</b> <b>may</b> <b>affect</b> <b>compatibility</b>

       A few taint leaks and taint omissions have been corrected.  This may lead to "failure" of scripts
       that used to work with older versions.  Compiling with -DINCOMPLETE_TAINTS provides a perl with mini-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mal&nbsp;minimal</font>
       mal amounts of changes to the tainting behavior.  But note that the resulting perl will have known
       insecurities.

       Oneliners with the "-e" switch do not create temporary files anymore.

       <b>Relaxed</b> <b>new</b> <b>mandatory</b> <b>warnings</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>in</b> <b>5.004</b>

       Many new warnings that were introduced in 5.004 have been made optional.  Some of these warnings are
       still present, but perl's new features make them less often a problem.  See "New Diagnostics".

       <b>Licensing</b>

       Perl has a new Social Contract for contributors.  See <u>Porting/Contract</u>.

       The license included in much of the Perl documentation has changed.  Most of the Perl documentation
       was previously under the implicit GNU General Public License or the Artistic License (at the user's
       choice).  Now much of the documentation unambiguously states the terms under which it may be distrib-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">uted.&nbsp;distributed.</font>
       uted.  Those terms are in general much less restrictive than the GNU GPL.  See perl and the individ-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ual&nbsp;individual</font>
       ual perl manpages listed therein.

<b>Core</b> <b>Changes</b>
       <b>Threads</b>

       WARNING: Threading is considered an <b>experimental</b> feature.  Details of the implementation may change
       without notice.  There are known limitations and some bugs.  These are expected to be fixed in future
       versions.

       See <u>README.threads</u>.

       <b>Compiler</b>

       WARNING: The Compiler and related tools are considered <b>experimental</b>.  Features may change without
       notice, and there are known limitations and bugs.  Since the compiler is fully external to perl, the
       default configuration will build and install it.

       The Compiler produces three different types of transformations of a perl program.  The C backend gen-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">erates&nbsp;generates</font>
       erates C code that captures perl's state just before execution begins.  It eliminates the compile-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">time&nbsp;compiletime</font>
       time overheads of the regular perl interpreter, but the run-time performance remains comparatively
       the same.  The CC backend generates optimized C code equivalent to the code path at run-time.  The CC
       backend has greater potential for big optimizations, but only a few optimizations are implemented
       currently.  The Bytecode backend generates a platform independent bytecode representation of the
       interpreter's state just before execution.  Thus, the Bytecode back end also eliminates much of the
       compilation overhead of the interpreter.

       The compiler comes with several valuable utilities.

       "B::Lint" is an experimental module to detect and warn about suspicious code, especially the cases
       that the "-w" switch does not detect.

       "B::Deparse" can be used to demystify perl code, and understand how perl optimizes certain con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">structs.&nbsp;constructs.</font>
       structs.

       "B::Xref" generates cross reference reports of all definition and use of variables, subroutines and
       formats in a program.

       "B::Showlex" show the lexical variables used by a subroutine or file at a glance.

       "perlcc" is a simple frontend for compiling perl.

       See "ext/B/README", B, and the respective compiler modules.

       <b>Regular</b> <b>Expressions</b>

       Perl's regular expression engine has been seriously overhauled, and many new constructs are sup-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ported.&nbsp;supported.</font>
       ported.  Several bugs have been fixed.

       Here is an itemized summary:

       Many new and improved optimizations
           Changes in the RE engine:

                   Unneeded nodes removed;
                   Substrings merged together;
                   New types of nodes to process (SUBEXPR)* and similar expressions
                       quickly, used if the SUBEXPR has no side effects and matches
                       strings of the same length;
                   Better optimizations by lookup for constant substrings;
                   Better search for constants substrings anchored by $ ;

           Changes in Perl code using RE engine:

                   More optimizations to s/longer/short/;
                   study() was not working;
                   /blah/ may be optimized to an analogue of index() if $&amp; $` $' not seen;
                   Unneeded copying of matched-against string removed;
                   Only matched part of the string is copying if $` $' were not seen;

       Many bug fixes
           Note that only the major bug fixes are listed here.  See <u>Changes</u> for others.

                   Backtracking might not restore start of $3.
                   No feedback if max count for * or + on "complex" subexpression
                       was reached, similarly (but at compile time) for {3,34567}
                   Primitive restrictions on max count introduced to decrease a
                       possibility of a segfault;
                   (ZERO-LENGTH)* could segfault;
                   (ZERO-LENGTH)* was prohibited;
                   Long REs were not allowed;
                   /RE/g could skip matches at the same position after a
                     zero-length match;

       New regular expression constructs
           The following new syntax elements are supported:

                   (?&lt;=RE)
                   (?&lt;!RE)
                   (?{ CODE })
                   (?i-x)
                   (?i:RE)
                   (?(COND)YES_RE|NO_RE)
                   (?&gt;RE)
                   \z

       New operator for precompiled regular expressions
           See "New "qr//" operator".

       Other improvements
                   Better debugging output (possibly with colors),
                       even from non-debugging Perl;
                   RE engine code now looks like C, not like assembler;
                   Behaviour of RE modifiable by `use re' directive;
                   Improved documentation;
                   Test suite significantly extended;
                   Syntax [:^upper:] etc., reserved inside character classes;

       Incompatible changes
                   (?i) localized inside enclosing group;
                   $( is not interpolated into RE any more;
                   /RE/g may match at the same position (with non-zero length)
                       after a zero-length match (bug fix).

       See perlre and perlop.

       <b>Improved</b> <u>malloc()</u>

       See banner at the beginning of "malloc.c" for details.

       <b>Quicksort</b> <b>is</b> <b>internally</b> <b>implemented</b>

       Perl now contains its own highly optimized <u>qsort()</u> routine.  The new <u>qsort()</u> is resistant to incon-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sistent&nbsp;inconsistent</font>
       sistent comparison functions, so Perl's "sort()" will not provoke coredumps any more when given
       poorly written sort subroutines.  (Some C library "qsort()"s that were being used before used to have
       this problem.)  In our testing, the new "qsort()" required the minimal number of pair-wise compares
       on average, among all known "qsort()" implementations.

       See "perlfunc/sort".

       <b>Reliable</b> <b>signals</b>

       Perl's signal handling is susceptible to random crashes, because signals arrive asynchronously, and
       the Perl runtime is not reentrant at arbitrary times.

       However, one experimental implementation of reliable signals is available when threads are enabled.
       See "Thread::Signal".  Also see <u>INSTALL</u> for how to build a Perl capable of threads.

       <b>Reliable</b> <b>stack</b> <b>pointers</b>

       The internals now reallocate the perl stack only at predictable times.  In particular, magic calls
       never trigger reallocations of the stack, because all reentrancy of the runtime is handled using a
       "stack of stacks".  This should improve reliability of cached stack pointers in the internals and in
       XSUBs.

       <b>More</b> <b>generous</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> <b>returns</b>

       Perl used to complain if it encountered literal carriage returns in scripts.  Now they are mostly
       treated like whitespace within program text.  Inside string literals and here documents, literal car-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">riage&nbsp;carriage</font>
       riage returns are ignored if they occur paired with linefeeds, or get interpreted as whitespace if
       they stand alone.  This behavior means that literal carriage returns in files should be avoided.  You
       can get the older, more compatible (but less generous) behavior by defining the preprocessor symbol
       "PERL_STRICT_CR" when building perl.  Of course, all this has nothing whatever to do with how escapes
       like "\r" are handled within strings.

       Note that this doesn't somehow magically allow you to keep all text files in DOS format.  The gener-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ous&nbsp;generous</font>
       ous treatment only applies to files that perl itself parses.  If your C compiler doesn't allow car-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">riage&nbsp;carriage</font>
       riage returns in files, you may still be unable to build modules that need a C compiler.

       <b>Memory</b> <b>leaks</b>

       "substr", "pos" and "vec" don't leak memory anymore when used in lvalue context.  Many small leaks
       that impacted applications that embed multiple interpreters have been fixed.

       <b>Better</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>interpreters</b>

       The build-time option "-DMULTIPLICITY" has had many of the details reworked.  Some previously global
       variables that should have been per-interpreter now are.  With care, this allows interpreters to call
       each other.  See the "PerlInterp" extension on CPAN.

       <b>Behavior</b> <b>of</b> <u>local()</u> <b>on</b> <b>array</b> <b>and</b> <b>hash</b> <b>elements</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>well-defined</b>

       See "Temporary Values via <u>local()</u>" in perlsub.

       <b>"%!"</b> <b>is</b> <b>transparently</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Errno</b> <b>module</b>

       See perlvar, and Errno.

       <b>Pseudo-hashes</b> <b>are</b> <b>supported</b>

       See perlref.

       <b>"EXPR</b> <b>foreach</b> <b>EXPR"</b> <b>is</b> <b>supported</b>

       See perlsyn.

       <b>Keywords</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>globally</b> <b>overridden</b>

       See perlsub.

       <b>$^E</b> <b>is</b> <b>meaningful</b> <b>on</b> <b>Win32</b>

       See perlvar.

       <b>"foreach</b> <b>(1..1000000)"</b> <b>optimized</b>

       "foreach (1..1000000)" is now optimized into a counting loop.  It does not try to allocate a
       1000000-size list anymore.

       <b>"Foo::"</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> <b>implicitly</b> <b>quoted</b> <b>package</b> <b>name</b>

       Barewords caused unintuitive behavior when a subroutine with the same name as a package happened to
       be defined.  Thus, "new Foo @args", use the result of the call to "Foo()" instead of "Foo" being
       treated as a literal.  The recommended way to write barewords in the indirect object slot is "new
       Foo:: @args".  Note that the method "new()" is called with a first argument of "Foo", not "Foo::"
       when you do that.

       <b>"exists</b> <b>$Foo::{Bar::}"</b> <b>tests</b> <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>package</b>

       It was impossible to test for the existence of a package without actually creating it before.  Now
       "exists $Foo::{Bar::}" can be used to test if the "Foo::Bar" namespace has been created.

       <b>Better</b> <b>locale</b> <b>support</b>

       See perllocale.

       <b>Experimental</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>64-bit</b> <b>platforms</b>

       Perl5 has always had 64-bit support on systems with 64-bit longs.  Starting with 5.005, the begin-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nings&nbsp;beginnings</font>
       nings of experimental support for systems with 32-bit long and 64-bit 'long long' integers has been
       added.  If you add -DUSE_LONG_LONG to your ccflags in config.sh (or manually define it in perl.h)
       then perl will be built with 'long long' support.  There will be many compiler warnings, and the
       resultant perl may not work on all systems.  There are many other issues related to third-party
       extensions and libraries.  This option exists to allow people to work on those issues.

       <u>prototype()</u> <b>returns</b> <b>useful</b> <b>results</b> <b>on</b> <b>builtins</b>

       See "prototype" in perlfunc.

       <b>Extended</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>exception</b> <b>handling</b>

       "die()" now accepts a reference value, and $@ gets set to that value in exception traps.  This makes
       it possible to propagate exception objects.  This is an undocumented <b>experimental</b> feature.

       <b>Re-blessing</b> <b>in</b> <u>DESTROY()</u> <b>supported</b> <b>for</b> <b>chaining</b> <u>DESTROY()</u> <b>methods</b>

       See "Destructors" in perlobj.

       <b>All</b> <b>"printf"</b> <b>format</b> <b>conversions</b> <b>are</b> <b>handled</b> <b>internally</b>

       See "printf" in perlfunc.

       <b>New</b> <b>"INIT"</b> <b>keyword</b>

       "INIT" subs are like "BEGIN" and "END", but they get run just before the perl runtime begins execu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion.&nbsp;execution.</font>
       tion.  e.g., the Perl Compiler makes use of "INIT" blocks to initialize and resolve pointers to
       XSUBs.

       <b>New</b> <b>"lock"</b> <b>keyword</b>

       The "lock" keyword is the fundamental synchronization primitive in threaded perl.  When threads are
       not enabled, it is currently a noop.

       To minimize impact on source compatibility this keyword is "weak", i.e., any user-defined subroutine
       of the same name overrides it, unless a "use Thread" has been seen.

       <b>New</b> <b>"qr//"</b> <b>operator</b>

       The "qr//" operator, which is syntactically similar to the other quote-like operators, is used to
       create precompiled regular expressions.  This compiled form can now be explicitly passed around in
       variables, and interpolated in other regular expressions.  See perlop.

       <b>"our"</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> <b>reserved</b> <b>word</b>

       Calling a subroutine with the name "our" will now provoke a warning when using the "-w" switch.

       <b>Tied</b> <b>arrays</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>fully</b> <b>supported</b>

       See Tie::Array.

       <b>Tied</b> <b>handles</b> <b>support</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b>

       Several missing hooks have been added.  There is also a new base class for TIEARRAY implementations.
       See Tie::Array.

       <b>4th</b> <b>argument</b> <b>to</b> <b>substr</b>

       <u>substr()</u> can now both return and replace in one operation.  The optional 4th argument is the replace-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment&nbsp;replacement</font>
       ment string.  See "substr" in perlfunc.

       <b>Negative</b> <b>LENGTH</b> <b>argument</b> <b>to</b> <b>splice</b>

       <u>splice()</u> with a negative LENGTH argument now work similar to what the LENGTH did for <u>substr()</u>.  Pre-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">viously&nbsp;Previously</font>
       viously a negative LENGTH was treated as 0.  See "splice" in perlfunc.

       <b>Magic</b> <b>lvalues</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>more</b> <b>magical</b>

       When you say something like "substr($x, 5) = "hi"", the scalar returned by <u>substr()</u> is special, in
       that any modifications to it affect $x.  (This is called a 'magic lvalue' because an 'lvalue' is
       something on the left side of an assignment.)  Normally, this is exactly what you would expect to
       happen, but Perl uses the same magic if you use <u>substr()</u>, <u>pos()</u>, or <u>vec()</u> in a context where they
       might be modified, like taking a reference with "\" or as an argument to a sub that modifies @_.  In
       previous versions, this 'magic' only went one way, but now changes to the scalar the magic refers to
       ($x in the above example) affect the magic lvalue too. For instance, this code now acts differently:

           $x = "hello";
           sub printit {
               $x = "g'bye";
               print $_[0], "\n";
           }
           printit(substr($x, 0, 5));

       In previous versions, this would print "hello", but it now prints "g'bye".

       <b>&lt;&gt;</b> <b>now</b> <b>reads</b> <b>in</b> <b>records</b>

       If $/ is a reference to an integer, or a scalar that holds an integer, &lt;&gt; will read in records
       instead of lines. For more info, see "$/" in perlvar.

<b>Supported</b> <b>Platforms</b>
       Configure has many incremental improvements.  Site-wide policy for building perl can now be made per-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sistent,&nbsp;persistent,</font>
       sistent, via Policy.sh.  Configure also records the command-line arguments used in <u>config.sh</u>.

       <b>New</b> <b>Platforms</b>

       <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>existing</b> <b>modules</b>


       Benchmark
           You can now run tests for <u>x</u> seconds instead of guessing the right number of tests to run.

           Keeps better time.

       Carp
           Carp has a new function <u>cluck()</u>. <u>cluck()</u> warns, like <u>carp()</u>, but also adds a stack backtrace to
           the error message, like <u>confess()</u>.

       CGI CGI has been updated to version 2.42.

       Fcntl
           More Fcntl constants added: F_SETLK64, F_SETLKW64, O_LARGEFILE for large (more than 4G) file
           access (the 64-bit support is not yet working, though, so no need to get overly excited),
           Free/Net/OpenBSD locking behaviour flags F_FLOCK, F_POSIX, Linux F_SHLCK, and O_ACCMODE: the mask
           of O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, and O_RDWR.

       Math::Complex
           The accessors methods Re, Im, arg, abs, rho, theta, methods can ($z-&gt;<u>Re()</u>) now also act as muta-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tors&nbsp;mutators</font>
           tors ($z-&gt;<u>Re</u>(3)).

       Math::Trig
           A little bit of radial trigonometry (cylindrical and spherical) added, for example the great cir-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cle&nbsp;circle</font>
           cle distance.

       POSIX
           POSIX now has its own platform-specific hints files.

       DB_File
           DB_File supports version 2.x of Berkeley DB.  See "ext/DB_File/Changes".

       MakeMaker
           MakeMaker now supports writing empty makefiles, provides a way to specify that site <u>umask()</u> pol-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">icy&nbsp;policy</font>
           icy should be honored.  There is also better support for manipulation of .packlist files, and
           getting information about installed modules.

           Extensions that have both architecture-dependent and architecture-independent files are now
           always installed completely in the architecture-dependent locations.  Previously, the shareable
           parts were shared both across architectures and across perl versions and were therefore liable to
           be overwritten with newer versions that might have subtle incompatibilities.

       CPAN
           See perlmodinstall and CPAN.

       Cwd Cwd::cwd is faster on most platforms.

<b>Utility</b> <b>Changes</b>
       "h2ph" and related utilities have been vastly overhauled.

       "perlcc", a new experimental front end for the compiler is available.

       The crude GNU "configure" emulator is now called "configure.gnu" to avoid trampling on "Configure"
       under case-insensitive filesystems.

       "perldoc" used to be rather slow.  The slower features are now optional.  In particular, case-insen-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sitive&nbsp;case-insensitive</font>
       sitive searches need the "-i" switch, and recursive searches need "-r".  You can set these switches
       in the "PERLDOC" environment variable to get the old behavior.

<b>Documentation</b> <b>Changes</b>
       Config.pm now has a glossary of variables.

       <u>Porting/patching.pod</u> has detailed instructions on how to create and submit patches for perl.

       perlport specifies guidelines on how to write portably.

       perlmodinstall describes how to fetch and install modules from "CPAN" sites.

       Some more Perl traps are documented now.  See perltrap.

       perlopentut gives a tutorial on using <u>open()</u>.

       perlreftut gives a tutorial on references.

       perlthrtut gives a tutorial on threads.

<b>New</b> <b>Diagnostics</b>
       Ambiguous call resolved as CORE::%s(), qualify as such or use &amp;
           (W) A subroutine you have declared has the same name as a Perl keyword, and you have used the
           name without qualification for calling one or the other.  Perl decided to call the builtin
           because the subroutine is not imported.

           To force interpretation as a subroutine call, either put an ampersand before the subroutine name,
           or qualify the name with its package.  Alternatively, you can import the subroutine (or pretend
           that it's imported with the "use subs" pragma).

           To silently interpret it as the Perl operator, use the "CORE::" prefix on the operator (e.g.
           "CORE::log($x)") or by declaring the subroutine to be an object method (see attrs).

       Bad index while coercing array into hash
           (F) The index looked up in the hash found as the 0'th element of a pseudo-hash is not legal.
           Index values must be at 1 or greater.  See perlref.

       Bareword "%s" refers to nonexistent package
           (W) You used a qualified bareword of the form "Foo::", but the compiler saw no other uses of that
           namespace before that point.  Perhaps you need to predeclare a package?

       Can't call method "%s" on an undefined value
           (F) You used the syntax of a method call, but the slot filled by the object reference or package
           name contains an undefined value.  Something like this will reproduce the error:

               $BADREF = 42;
               process $BADREF 1,2,3;
               $BADREF-&gt;process(1,2,3);

       Can't check filesystem of script "%s" for nosuid
           (P) For some reason you can't check the filesystem of the script for nosuid.

       Can't coerce array into hash
           (F) You used an array where a hash was expected, but the array has no information on how to map
           from keys to array indices.  You can do that only with arrays that have a hash reference at index
           0.

       Can't goto subroutine from an eval-string
           (F) The "goto subroutine" call can't be used to jump out of an eval "string".  (You can use it to
           jump out of an eval {BLOCK}, but you probably don't want to.)

       Can't localize pseudo-hash element
           (F) You said something like "local $ar-&gt;{'key'}", where $ar is a reference to a pseudo-hash.
           That hasn't been implemented yet, but you can get a similar effect by localizing the correspond-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;corresponding</font>
           ing array element directly -- "local $ar-&gt;[$ar-&gt;[0]{'key'}]".

       Can't use %%! because Errno.pm is not available
           (F) The first time the %! hash is used, perl automatically loads the Errno.pm module. The Errno
           module is expected to tie the %! hash to provide symbolic names for $! errno values.

       Cannot find an opnumber for "%s"
           (F) A string of a form "CORE::word" was given to <u>prototype()</u>, but there is no builtin with the
           name "word".

       Character class syntax [. .] is reserved for future extensions
           (W) Within regular expression character classes ([]) the syntax beginning with "[." and ending
           with ".]" is reserved for future extensions.  If you need to represent those character sequences
           inside a regular expression character class, just quote the square brackets with the backslash:
           "\[." and ".\]".

       Character class syntax [: :] is reserved for future extensions
           (W) Within regular expression character classes ([]) the syntax beginning with "[:" and ending
           with ":]" is reserved for future extensions.  If you need to represent those character sequences
           inside a regular expression character class, just quote the square brackets with the backslash:
           "\[:" and ":\]".

       Character class syntax [= =] is reserved for future extensions
           (W) Within regular expression character classes ([]) the syntax beginning with "[=" and ending
           with "=]" is reserved for future extensions.  If you need to represent those character sequences
           inside a regular expression character class, just quote the square brackets with the backslash:
           "\[=" and "=\]".

       %s: Eval-group in insecure regular expression
           (F) Perl detected tainted data when trying to compile a regular expression that contains the "(?{
           ... })" zero-width assertion, which is unsafe.  See "(?{ code })" in perlre, and perlsec.

       %s: Eval-group not allowed, use re 'eval'
           (F) A regular expression contained the "(?{ ... })" zero-width assertion, but that construct is
           only allowed when the "use re 'eval'" pragma is in effect.  See "(?{ code })" in perlre.

       %s: Eval-group not allowed at run time
           (F) Perl tried to compile a regular expression containing the "(?{ ... })" zero-width assertion
           at run time, as it would when the pattern contains interpolated values.  Since that is a security
           risk, it is not allowed.  If you insist, you may still do this by explicitly building the pattern
           from an interpolated string at run time and using that in an <u>eval()</u>.  See "(?{ code })" in
           perlre.

       Explicit blessing to '' (assuming package main)
           (W) You are blessing a reference to a zero length string.  This has the effect of blessing the
           reference into the package main.  This is usually not what you want.  Consider providing a
           default target package, e.g. bless($ref, $p || 'MyPackage');

       Illegal hex digit ignored
           (W) You may have tried to use a character other than 0 - 9 or A - F in a hexadecimal number.
           Interpretation of the hexadecimal number stopped before the illegal character.

       No such array field
           (F) You tried to access an array as a hash, but the field name used is not defined.  The hash at
           index 0 should map all valid field names to array indices for that to work.

       No such field "%s" in variable %s of type %s
           (F) You tried to access a field of a typed variable where the type does not know about the field
           name.  The field names are looked up in the %FIELDS hash in the type package at compile time.
           The %FIELDS hash is usually set up with the 'fields' pragma.

       Out of memory during ridiculously large request
           (F) You can't allocate more than 2^31+"small amount" bytes.  This error is most likely to be
           caused by a typo in the Perl program. e.g., $arr[time] instead of $arr[$time].

       Range iterator outside integer range
           (F) One (or both) of the numeric arguments to the range operator ".."  are outside the range
           which can be represented by integers internally.  One possible workaround is to force Perl to use
           magical string increment by prepending "0" to your numbers.

       Recursive inheritance detected while looking for method '%s' %s
           (F) More than 100 levels of inheritance were encountered while invoking a method.  Probably indi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cates&nbsp;indicates</font>
           cates an unintended loop in your inheritance hierarchy.

       Reference found where even-sized list expected
           (W) You gave a single reference where Perl was expecting a list with an even number of elements
           (for assignment to a hash). This usually means that you used the anon hash constructor when you
           meant to use parens. In any case, a hash requires key/value <b>pairs</b>.

               %hash = { one =&gt; 1, two =&gt; 2, };   # WRONG
               %hash = [ qw/ an anon array / ];   # WRONG
               %hash = ( one =&gt; 1, two =&gt; 2, );   # right
               %hash = qw( one 1 two 2 );                 # also fine

       Undefined value assigned to typeglob
           (W) An undefined value was assigned to a typeglob, a la "*foo = undef".  This does nothing.  It's
           possible that you really mean "undef *foo".

       Use of reserved word "%s" is deprecated
           (D) The indicated bareword is a reserved word.  Future versions of perl may use it as a keyword,
           so you're better off either explicitly quoting the word in a manner appropriate for its context
           of use, or using a different name altogether.  The warning can be suppressed for subroutine names
           by either adding a "&amp;" prefix, or using a package qualifier, e.g. "&amp;our()", or "Foo::our()".

       perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
           (S) The whole warning message will look something like:

                  perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
                  perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
                          LC_ALL = "En_US",
                          LANG = (unset)
                      are supported and installed on your system.
                  perl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale ("C").

           Exactly what were the failed locale settings varies.  In the above the settings were that the
           LC_ALL was "En_US" and the LANG had no value.  This error means that Perl detected that you
           and/or your system administrator have set up the so-called variable system but Perl could not use
           those settings.  This was not dead serious, fortunately: there is a "default locale" called "C"
           that Perl can and will use, the script will be run.  Before you really fix the problem, however,
           you will get the same error message each time you run Perl.  How to really fix the problem can be
           found in "LOCALE PROBLEMS" in perllocale.

<b>Obsolete</b> <b>Diagnostics</b>
       Can't <u>mktemp()</u>
           (F) The <u>mktemp()</u> routine failed for some reason while trying to process a <b>-e</b> switch.  Maybe your
           /tmp partition is full, or clobbered.

           Removed because <b>-e</b> doesn't use temporary files any more.

       Can't write to temp file for <b>-e</b>: %s
           (F) The write routine failed for some reason while trying to process a <b>-e</b> switch.  Maybe your
           /tmp partition is full, or clobbered.

           Removed because <b>-e</b> doesn't use temporary files any more.

       Cannot open temporary file
           (F) The create routine failed for some reason while trying to process a <b>-e</b> switch.  Maybe your
           /tmp partition is full, or clobbered.

           Removed because <b>-e</b> doesn't use temporary files any more.

       regexp too big
           (F) The current implementation of regular expressions uses shorts as address offsets within a
           string.  Unfortunately this means that if the regular expression compiles to longer than 32767,
           it'll blow up.  Usually when you want a regular expression this big, there is a better way to do
           it with multiple statements.  See perlre.

<b>Configuration</b> <b>Changes</b>
       You can use "Configure -Uinstallusrbinperl" which causes installperl to skip installing perl also as
       /usr/bin/perl.  This is useful if you prefer not to modify /usr/bin for some reason or another but
       harmful because many scripts assume to find Perl in /usr/bin/perl.

<b>BUGS</b>
       If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the headers of recently posted articles in the
       comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup.  There may also be information at <a href="http://www.perl.com/perl/">http://www.perl.com/perl/</a> , the Perl
       Home Page.

       Make sure you trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
       output of "perl -V", will be sent off to &lt;<u>perlbug@perl.com&gt;</u> to be analysed by the Perl porting team.
