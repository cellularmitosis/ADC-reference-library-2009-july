This guide itself         is a Mac OS 9 package, and the application being used to         view it is a package as well.</P>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE></P><P>Packages provide a convenient way to group related files togetherin a directory that is treated as if it were a single mirroring theexternal qualities of the package's main file. Using packages isanother way to simplify your development efforts and provide a simpleuser interface for your products. </P><P>Packages are a new concept for Mac OS 9 and they are documented in<A HREF="tn1188/tn1188.html">Technote 1188</A>. This technote definespackages and discusses several implementation issues related topackages.</P><P>You can use the <A HREF="PackageTool">Package Tool</A> to to makeyour own packages once you have formatted a directory as described inTechnote 1188. Be aware, it is important that file sharing be turnedoff when you create a package so the alias file will not containserver information when it is created.</P><P>The source code for the HTMLSample application illustrates how youcan recognize package type documents and open them in yourapplication. It also shows how you can instruct Navigation Servicesto display package type documents in its windows so users can openthem using that interface.</P><P>Source code for the PackageTool illustrates how you can recognizeand accept package documents in drag commands.</P><P></P></BODY></HTML>
