TclResource(n)                                Extension for Tcl                               TclResource(n)



<b>NAME</b>
       resource - Manipulate Macintosh resources

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
               package require resource 1.1
               resource option ?arg arg ...?


<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
       The resource command provides some  generic  operations  for  dealing  with Macintosh resources. This
       command  is  only  supported  on  the  Macintosh platform. Prior to system OSX, each  Macintosh  file
       consisted  of  two  forks: a data fork and a resource fork. Since the advent of system OSX, resources
       can also be stored in the  data  fork  (this  is  the  recommended  format  for portability  reasons:
       resource  forks  tend  to  be  otherwise deleted when copied on another platform). You use the normal
       open, puts, close, etc. commands to manipulate the data fork but you must use this command,  however,
       to  interact  with  the  resource  map,  even  if  it  is stored in the data fork. In a resource map,
       resources are categorized by type and, in each type, are designated by an ID and possibly a name. See
       RESOURCE TYPES and RESOURCE  IDS  below  for details.  On OSX, the resource command is not a built-in
       command of Tcl anymore. It is made available by this extension  which  much  be  explicitely   loaded
       with  a package require instruction like this:

               package require resource 1.1

       Subcommand  indicates  what  resource  operation  to  perform. Any unique  abbreviation for option is
       acceptable. The valid  options  are  explained  in  the  next sections.

<b>resource</b> <b>attributes</b> <b>resourceRef</b> <b>?option</b> <b>resourceType?</b> <b>?value?</b>
          This command is used to get or set the attributes of the resource map or
          the attributes of a particular resource in the resource map. It has four
          different syntaxes:

   <b>resource</b> <b>attributes</b> <b>resourceRef</b>
          To get the attributes of the resource map specified by  the  resourceRef
          argument.

   <b>resource</b> <b>attributes</b> <b>resourceRef</b> <b>value</b>
          To give the value value to the attributes of the resource map  specified
          by the resourceRef argument.

   <b>resource</b> <b>attributes</b> <b>resourceRef</b> <b>option</b> <b>resourceType</b>
          To get the attributes of the resource specified by the  argument  option
          in the resource map designated by the resourceRef argument.  The  option
          can be one of:

       <b>-id</b> <b>resourceId</b>
                    If the -id option is given, the id resourceId (see RESOURCE  IDS  below)
                    is used to specify the resource whose attributes must be returned or set.
                    The id must be a number: to specify a name use the -name option.

       <b>-name</b> <b>resourceName</b>
                    If the -name option is specified, the  resource  named  resourceName  is
                    used.

   <b>resource</b> <b>attributes</b> <b>resourceRef</b> <b>option</b> <b>resourceType</b> <b>value</b>
          To give the value value to the attributes of the resource  specified  by
          the argument option in the resource map designated  by  the  resourceRef
          argument. The resource can be specified using either the -id or the
          -name as indicated above.
          Note that the [resource attributes]  command  is  available  only  since
          version 1.1 of the Tclresource extension. See RESOURCE ATTRIBUTES  below
          for details about the possible values for attributes.

<b>resource</b> <b>close</b> <b>resourceRef</b>
          Closes the given  resource  reference  (obtained  from  resource  open).
          Resources from that resource file will no longer be available.

<b>resource</b> <b>delete</b> <b>?options?</b> <b>resourceType</b>
          This command will delete the resource  specified  by  options  and  type
          resourceType (see RESOURCE TYPES below). The options  give  you  several
          ways to specify the resource to be deleted.

       <b>-id</b> <b>resourceId</b>
                    If the -id option is given the id resourceId (see RESOURCE IDS below) is
                    used to specify the resource to be deleted. The id must be a number:  to
                    specify a name use the -name option.

       <b>-name</b> <b>resourceName</b>
                    If -name is specified, the resource named resourceName will be  deleted.
                    If the -id is also provided, then there must be a resource with BOTH this
                    name and this id. If no name is provided,  then  the  id  will  be  used
                    regardless of the name of the actual resource.

       <b>-file</b> <b>resourceRef</b>
                    If the -file option is specified then the resource will be deleted  from
                    the file pointed to by resourceRef. Otherwise the first resource with the
                    given resourceName and or resourceId which is found on the resource file
                    path will be deleted. To inspect the file path, use the  resource  files
                    command.

<b>resource</b> <b>fork</b> <b>resourceRef</b>
          Returns which fork (either data fork or resource  fork)  contains
          the resource map specified by the argument resourceRef. The return value
          will be datafork, resourcefork or unknown. The unknown value is returned
          for the resource maps listed by the command resource list which were not
          opened explicitely by a resource open command but were already in memory.
          Note that the [resource fork] command is available only since version 1.1
          of the Tclresource extension.

<b>resource</b> <b>files</b> <b>?resourceRef?</b>
          If resourceRef is not provided, this command returns a Tcl  list  of  the
          resource references for all the currently open resource files. The  list
          is in the normal Macintosh search order for resources. If resourceRef is
          specified, the command will return the path to the file  whose  resource
          fork is represented by that token.

<b>resource</b> <b>id</b> <b>resourceType</b> <b>resourceName</b> <b>resourceRef</b>
          Returns the id of the resource of   type    resourceType    with    name
          resourceName in the resource map designated by the argument resourceRef.
          This is the reverse of command [resource name].

<b>resource</b> <b>list</b> <b>?-ids?</b> <b>resourceType</b> <b>?resourceRef?</b>
          List all of the resources ids of type resourceType (see  RESOURCE  TYPES
          below). If resourceRef is specified then  the  command  will  limit  the
          search to that particular resource file. Otherwise, all  resource  files
          currently opened by the application will be  searched.  A  Tcl  list  of
          either the resource name's or resource id's of the found resources  will
          be returned: each time the name of the resource is not empty, it is used
          preferably to the id, unless the -ids  option  has  been  specified,  in
          which case only id's are returned. See the RESOURCE IDS section below for
          more details about what a resource id is.
          Note that the -ids option is only available since  version  1.1  of  the
          Tclresource extension.

<b>resource</b> <b>name</b> <b>resourceType</b> <b>resourceId</b> <b>resourceRef</b>
          Returns the (possibly empty) name of the resource of  type  resourceType
          with ID resourceId in  the  resource  map  designated  by  the  argument
          resourceRef. This is the reverse of command [resource id].

<b>resource</b> <b>open</b> <b>?(-datafork|-resourcefork)?</b> <b>fileName</b> <b>?access?</b>
          Open the resource map for the file fileName. On OSX,  resources  can  be
          stored either in the resource fork of the file or in the data fork of the
          file. By default, resource open will try to find resources in  the  data
          fork of the file, then, if none is found, in  its  resource  fork.  This
          behavior can be modified with one  of  the  -datafork  or  -resourcefork
          switches which force the command to search only in the data fork or  the
          resource fork respectively. Standard file access permissions may also be
          specified with the access optional argument (see the  manual  entry  for
          open for details). A resource reference (resourceRef) is  returned  that
          can be used by the other resource  commands  to  refer  to  this  opened
          resource map.
          An error can occur if the file doesn't exist or the file does  not  have
          resources in the data or the resource fork. However, if you open the file
          with write permissions the file and/or resource  fork  will  be  created
          instead of generating an error: the -datafork or -resourcefork  switches
          let you specify which kind of resource file should be created (data fork
          resource file or resource fork resource file). If neither -datafork  nor
          -resourcefork are specified, a data fork resource  file  is  created  by
          default.
          Note that the -datafork and -resourcefork switches  are  only  available
          since version 1.1 of the Tclresource extension.

<b>resource</b> <b>read</b> <b>resourceType</b> <b>resourceId</b> <b>?resourceRef?</b>
          Read the entire resource of type resourceType (see RESOURCE TYPES below)
          and the name or id of resourceId (see RESOURCE IDS below) into memory and
          return the result. If resourceRef is specified we limit  our  search  to
          that resource file, otherwise we search all open resource forks  in  the
          application. It is important to note that most Macintosh resource use  a
          binary format and the data returned from this command may have  embedded
          NULLs or other non-ASCII data.

<b>resource</b> <b>types</b> <b>?resourceRef?</b>
          This command returns a Tcl list of  all  resource  types  (see  RESOURCE
          TYPES below) found in the resource file pointed to  by  resourceRef.  If
          resourceRef is not specified it will return all the resource types found
          in every resource file currently opened by the application.

<b>resource</b> <b>update</b> <b>resourceRef</b>
          This command updates the resource  map  designated  by  the  resourceRef
          argument. It performs three tasks:

              *   changing, adding, or removing resource data in the fork on disk to
                        match the resource map in memory;

              *   compacting the resource fork, closing up any empty space created when
                        a resource was removed, made smaller, or made larger;

              *   writing the resource map in memory to the resource fork.
          Because the [resource close] command calls [resource update]  before  it
          closes the resource fork, you need to call it directly only if you  want
          to update the file without closing it.
          Note that the [resource update] command is available only since  version
          1.1 of the Tclresource extension.

<b>resource</b> <b>write</b> <b>?options?</b> <b>resourceType</b> <b>data</b>
          This command will write the passed in data as a  new  resource  of  type
          resourceType (see RESOURCE TYPES below). Several options  are  available
          that describe where and how the resource is stored.

       <b>-id</b> <b>resourceId</b>
                    If the -id option is given the id resourceId (see RESOURCE IDS below) is
                    used for the new resource, otherwise a unique id will be generated  that
                    will not conflict with any existing resource. However, the id must be  a
                    number: to specify a name use the -name option.

       <b>-name</b> <b>resourceName</b>
                    If -name is specified the resource will be named resourceName, otherwise
                    it will have the empty string as the name.

       <b>-file</b> <b>resourceRef</b>
                    If the -file option is specified then the resource will  be  written  in
                    the file pointed to by resourceRef, otherwise  the  most  recently  open
                    resource will be used.

       <b>-force</b>       If the target resource already exists, then  by  default  Tcl  will  not
                    overwrite it, but raise an error instead. Use the -force flag  to  force
                    overwriting the existant resource.

<b>RESOURCE</b> <b>TYPES</b>
       Resource types are defined as a four character string that is then mapped to an  underlying  id.  For
       example,  TEXT  refers  to  the  Macintosh   resource   type for text. The type STR#  is  a  list  of
       counted  strings.  All  Macintosh resources must be of some type. See  Macintosh  documentation   for
       a  more complete list of resource types that are commonly used.

<b>RESOURCE</b> <b>IDS</b>
       For  this  command  the  notion of a resource id actually refers to two ideas in Macintosh resources.
       Every place you can use a  resource  Id  you  can  use either the resource name or a resource number.
       Names are always searched or returned in preference to numbers. For example, the resource  list  com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
       mand will return names if they exist or numbers if the name is NULL.

<b>RESOURCE</b> <b>ATTRIBUTES</b>
       Resource maps and individual resources have attributes. The attributes  for resource maps are:

                        +-------------+-----+---------------------------------------------+
                        | mapChanged  | 32  | Write map out at update                     |
                        | mapCompact  | 64  | Compact resource file when writing to disk  |
                        | mapReadOnly | 128 | Resource file is read-only                  |
       The attributes ar--+------------ed attributes for
       the resource map with reference resourceRef,  one would write:

               resource attributes resourceRef 160

       The allowable attributes for individual resources are:

                                +--------------+----+-----------------------------+
                                | resChanged   | 2  | Resource changed            |
                                | resPreload   | 4  | Load in on OpenResFile      |
                                | resProtected | 8  | Protected                   |
                                | resLocked    | 16 | Load it in locked           |
                                | resPurgeable | 32 | Purgeable resource          |
                                | resSysHeap   | 64 | System or application heap  |
                                +--------------+----+-----------------------------+
<b>PORTABILITY</b> <b>ISSUES</b>
       The resource command is only available on Macintosh. On systems older  than OSX, the resource command
       was built in Tcl but  it  was  removed  from  the versions of Tcl compiled for OSX. It  is  now  made
       available as an  extension which should be loaded in the scripts with the following instruction:

               package require resource 1.1

       Version  1.0 of the extension is simply a port to OSX of the old resource command: it does not handle
       data fork resource files. Support for data fork resource files is introduced in version 1.1.

<b>VERSION</b> <b>HISTORY</b>
              *   1.0 - 03/09/25 -  First release of the extension for OSX.

              *   1.1 - 03/10/05 -  Support for data fork resources, attributes, update, name.

<b>KNOW</b> <b>ISSUES</b>
       The resource command has been ported to OSX as a Tcl extension by Bernard Desgraupes.  Please  e-mail
       any  bug  or problem you encounter: &lt;bdesgraupes@easyconnect.fr&gt; ((p Version 1.0 corresponds strictly
       to the code provided in the Tcl source code (tclMacResource.c). Version 1.1  added  several  improve-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ments:&nbsp;improvements:</font>
       ments:

              *   possibility of opening and writing to datafork resource files as well
                    as resource fork resource files.

              *   new subcommand [resource attributes] to get/set the attributes of a resource
                    map or an individual resource.

              *   new subcommand [resource update] to update a resource map without closing it.

              *   new subcommand [resource fork] to indicate which fork a resource map was opened from.

              *   new  subcommands  [resource name] and [resource id] returning the name of a resource given
                  its ID, and vice versa.

              *   new -ids option for the [resource list] command
       The Tclresource folder (Tclresource1.0, Tclresource1.1  etc)  contains the extension  compiled  as  a
       dynamic  library.  For  the  Tcl  interpreter to find it  automatically,  it  should  be  located  on
       your  system  in /Library/Tcl/ (administrator  password  required)  or   in   your   personal  folder
       ~/Library/Tcl/.
