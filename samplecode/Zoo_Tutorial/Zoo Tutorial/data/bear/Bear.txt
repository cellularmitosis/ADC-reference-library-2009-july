Of all the carnivores, the Kodiak or Alaskan brown bear is the largest and most powerful. One swipe from its immense paw can fell an adult bull moose. Growing as tall as nine feet and weighing up to 1,650 pounds, Kodiaks are not normally aggressive towards man unless provoked, injured or protecting a cub.Though classified as meat eaters, bears are omnivorous, feeding on meat, insects, grubs, berries, vegetables, honey and fish. Master fisherman, Kodiaks flip salmonfrom river shallows with great dexterity. Found along the Alaskan peninsula, Kodiak and the nearby islands, they breed at about three years of age.Like most other bears, Kodiaks are loners. During the mating season, males andfemales may pair up and mate frequently for up to two weeks. Kodiaks give birth to a liter of 1-4 cubs which may not all have the same father. The young cubsstay with the mother for almost three years. Although solitary, bears do not attack other bears that wander into their range.
