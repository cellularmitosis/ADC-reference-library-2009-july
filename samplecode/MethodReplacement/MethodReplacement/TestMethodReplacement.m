 Abstract:

 Objective C 2.0 Compatible class_poseAs() replacement. This
 demonstrates how to replace a method in an existing Objective C class,
 and how to call the old version without having to store IMP function
 pointers in a global. The trick is to define a category on the class
 whose method you want to replace. In the category, declare and
 implement a method with the same signature as the replaced method. In
 the +load method of the category, look up the original and replacement
 methods using class_getInstanceMethod(), then call
 method_exchangeImplementations(). Subsequent calls to the original
 method will call the replacement method, and an apparently recursive
 call to the replacement method will call the original method. Voila.
