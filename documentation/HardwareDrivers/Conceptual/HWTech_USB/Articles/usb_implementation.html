<h3>iMac G5 Computer (October 2005)</h3>
<p>The iMac G5 has three external USB 2.0 ports on the enclosure. An internal connection supports the Bluetooth module and a USB2 hub that supports the built-in iSight camera and the IR receiver. The external USB 2.0 ports are off of the USB controller connected to the PCI bus, bridged by the Shasta ASIC. <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003902-DontLinkElementID_14"></a>

</p>
<p>The three external USB ports on the iMac G5 are fully compliant with the USB 2.0 specification, including support for high-speed (480 Mbps) devices using an Enhanced Host Controller Interface (EHCI) that complies with the EHCI specification. Ports are automatically routed to a companion OHCI controller (that complies with the OHCI specification) when a classic-speed (full-speed or low-speed) USB device is attached to a root hub port.</p>
<p>The two USB 1.1 ports on the keyboard comply with the Universal Serial Bus Specification 1.1 Final Draft Revision. <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003902-DontLinkElementID_15"></a>

</p>
<div class="notebox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003902-SW7" title="Note"></a>

<h4>Power</h4>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003902-DontLinkElementID_16"></a>

<p>The iMac G5 provides 5-volt power to the USB 2.0 ports. The maximum current available is 500 mA on each port. </p>

<h4>Connect and Resume </h4>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003902-DontLinkElementID_17"></a>

<p>The Shasta ASIC contains special circuitry that allows the computer to wake from sleep mode on connect, disconnect, and resume events. Compatible USB devices should support the USB-suspend mode defined in the USB specification. </p>

<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003902-SW15_1200331179" title="Wake Up From Sleep"></a>
<h4>Wake Up From Sleep</h4>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003902-DontLinkElementID_18"></a>

<p>USB devices can provide a remote wakeup function for the computer. The USB root hub in the computer is set to support remote wakeup whenever a device is attached to or disconnected from the bus. The Apple remote and keyboard that come with the computer use this method to wake the computer at the press of a button or key. </p>

<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003902-SW29_1200331179" title="Power Mac G5 Computers (October 2005) "></a>
<h3>Power Mac G5 Computers (October 2005) </h3>
<p>The Power Mac G5 computer has three external Universal Serial Bus (USB) 2.0 ports on the back and one on the front of the enclosure, providing support for high-speed (480 Mbps) devices using an Enhanced Host Controller Interface (EHCI).  Ports are automatically routed to a companion OHCI controller (that complies with the OHCI specification) when a classic-speed (full-speed or low-speed) USB device is attached to a root hub port.  </p>
<p>The external USB ports are off of the USB 2.0 controller connected to the PCI bus, bridged by the South Bridge IC. In addition, there are two USB 1.1 ports on the keyboard, which are used for connecting the mouse as well as additional I/O devices such as printers, scanners, and storage devices.</p>
<p>The Power Mac G5 computer provides 5 V power for the USB ports and up to 500 mA on each port. The power is provided in both run and sleep mode. The ports share the same power supply; a short circuit on one disables all ports until the short has been removed. </p>
