UNIT StubLDEF;(*	File:		StubLDEF.p	Contains:	An LDEF that simply routes the call through the list's				refCon, thereby allowing us to have the actual code in				the main body of the application.	Written by:	Forrest Tanaka	Copyright:	© 1988-1997 by Apple Computer, Inc., all rights reserved.	Change History (most recent first):	You may incorporate this sample code into your applications without	restriction, though the sample code has been provided "AS IS" and the	responsibility for its operation is 100% yours.  However, what you are	not permitted to do is to redistribute the source as "DSC Sample Code"	after having made changes. If you're going to re-distribute the source,	we require that you make it clear in the source that the code was	descended from Apple Sample Code, but that you've made changes.*)INTERFACE	USES		Types,		Lists;		{$main}	PROCEDURE StubLDEF (message:    Integer;	                       selectCell: Boolean;	                       cellRect:   Rect;	                       theCell:    Cell;	                       dataOffset: Integer;	                       dataLength: Integer;	                       theList:    ListHandle);IMPLEMENTATION	PROCEDURE CallProc (message:    Integer;	                       selectCell: Boolean;	                       cellRect:   Rect;	                       theCell:    Cell;	                       dataOffset: Integer;	                       dataLength: Integer;	                       theList:    ListHandle;	                       proc:	   ProcPtr);		INLINE			$205F,			(* move.l	(sp)+,a0	*)			$4E90;			(* jmp		(a0)		*)	PROCEDURE StubLDEF (message:    Integer;	                       selectCell: Boolean;	                       cellRect:   Rect;	                       theCell:    Cell;	                       dataOffset: Integer;	                       dataLength: Integer;	                       theList:    ListHandle);		VAR			proc: ProcPtr;	BEGIN		proc := ProcPtr(theList^^.refCon);		IF proc <> nil THEN BEGIN			CallProc(message, selectCell, cellRect, theCell, dataOffset, dataLength, theList, proc);		END;	END; (* StubLDEF *)END.
