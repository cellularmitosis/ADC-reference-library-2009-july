<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH205-BABJIAIE" title="Help Viewer"></a><h2>Help Viewer</h2><p>Users view online help in Help Viewer, a browser-like application designed to display HTML help content. Help Viewer displays files adhering to the HTML 4.01 specification. In addition, Help Viewer supports QuickTime media and AppleScript automation. </p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH205-BABGBEIJ" title="The Help Viewer Window"></a><h3>The Help Viewer Window</h3><p>Users typically launch Help Viewer by choosing the application help item from the Help menu, or by typing a query in the Spotlight For Help text field in the Help menu (see <span class="content_text"><a href="apple_help_concepts.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH205-BABBDDJC">“How Users Access Your Help”</a></span> ). When Help Viewer launches, it brings up a window displaying help for the application from which the user requested assistance. In <span class="content_text">Figure 1-1</span>, the Help Viewer window displays the system help book, Mac Help.</p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH205-BABFDHBB" title="Figure 1-1The Help Viewer window"></a><p><strong>Figure 1-1&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The Help Viewer window</p><img src = "../Art/help_viewer_window.jpg" alt = "The Help Viewer opening window for Mac Help" ></div><br/><p>There are four user interface elements in the toolbar at the top of the Help Viewer window: the Back and Forward buttons, the Home button, the Action menu button, and the search field. The Back and Forward buttons on the left side of the toolbar allow users to view their navigation history and navigate through previously visited help pages. Clicking the Home button opens the landing page of the currently open help book; if the user presses this button, a menu of all the available help books appears. The Action menu provides items such as Make Text Larger (or smaller), Find (which finds text strings on the current page), and Print. The search field allows users to search all help in the current book or all help on the system—they click the magnifying glass at the left of the search field to choose which. The magnifying-glass menu also allows the user to choose whether to include product support searches—that is, search results from Apple’s Knowledge Base support web site or from your own support site.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH205-TPXREF101" title="Searching in Help Viewer"></a><h3>Searching in Help Viewer</h3><p>One of the primary advantages of Help Viewer for viewing online help is its ability to quickly and accurately search an installed set of help content. Users often arrive at online help with an idea of what they want to accomplish; help should allow them to get the information they need as quickly as possible and get on with their tasks. Especially for large help systems, searching is often the most efficient and effective way for users to obtain help.</p><p>The text entry field at the right side of the Help Viewer window’s toolbar allows users to search the available help content on the system. Users enter the term or concept for which they want to obtain help into the text field.  <span class="content_text">Figure 1-2</span> shows a query entered in the text field of the Help Viewer window, with Search All Help selected. </p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH205-SW1" title="Figure 1-2A query entered in the search field of Help Viewer"></a><p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH205-BABGGCIA" title="Figure 1-2A query entered in the search field of Help Viewer"></a><strong>Figure 1-2&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>A query entered in the search field of Help Viewer</p><img src = "../Art/question_in_help_viewer.jpg" alt = "A question entered in the search field of Help Viewer" ></div><br/><p>When the user presses Return, Help Viewer searches the help books installed on the system (if the user selected Search All Help) or in the selected help book (if they selected that option) for the relevant term or terms. It returns up to 25 help topics and up to 25 support articles (if the user selected that option) from the AppleCare website or from your support site (if you’ve set up support site searching—see <span class="content_text"><a href="../authoring_help/authoring_help_book.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH206-SW12">“Providing Your Own Online Support Articles”</a></span>).  <span class="content_text">Figure 1-3</span> shows the search results returned by Help Viewer in response to the query entered in <span class="content_text">Figure 1-2</span>. Help Viewer sorts the help topics in order of relevancy (as determined by Search Kit). Support articles are listed alphabetically by title.</p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH205-BABEJFBE" title="Figure 1-3Search results displayed in Help Viewer"></a><p><strong>Figure 1-3&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Search results displayed in Help Viewer</p><img src = "../Art/search_results.jpg" alt = "Search results displayed in Help Viewer" ></div><br/><p>Help Viewer displays the title of each relevant help topic in a table of search results, along with the help book in which that topic is found (if the user selected Search All Help). When the user moves their cursor over a topic from the search results, an abstract of the help topic appears, if available. The user can view the selected topic by double-clicking the topic in the search results table or by clicking the Show button at the bottom of the Help Viewer window. <span class="content_text">Figure 1-4</span> shows the abstract for a help topic returned as a search result for the query entered in <span class="content_text"><a href="apple_help_concepts.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH205-SW1">Figure 1-2</a></span>. For information on how to provide abstracts for help topics, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../authoring_help/authoring_help_book.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH206-CHDJIBBI">“Adding Abstracts.”</a></span></p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH205-CIHIJFHB" title="Figure 1-4A topic abstract displayed for a search result in Help Viewer"></a><p><strong>Figure 1-4&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>A topic abstract displayed for a search result in Help Viewer</p><img src = "../Art/topic_in_search_results.jpg" alt = "A topic summary displayed for a search result in Help Viewer" ></div><br/><p>To ensure that certain queries return the most relevant results regardless of the search term’s occurrence in the text, you can provide a list of search terms and corresponding search results to be displayed. This is referred to as <em>exact match</em> searching. You can use an exact match search list, for example, to provide responses to search terms too short to normally be used in a search (such as “CD”), to make sure that a particular help topic is included in the responses when there are likely to be more than 25 matches to a query, or to make sure that the most relevant results receive the highest relevancy rating regardless of the algorithm used to rank results. Exact match searches are described in more detail in <span class="content_text"><a href="../authoring_help/authoring_help_book.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH206-SW5">“Setting Up Exact Match Searching.”</a></span> </p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH205-DontLinkElementID_5" title="Cross-References and Index Lists"></a><h3>Cross-References and Index Lists</h3><p>There are Apple Help–specific URLs that you can use to create links to help pages in your help book. You can create individual links to specific locations in your book, and you can generate lists of links to use for index pages or for “see also” lists at the end of help topics. See <span class="content_text"><a href="../appendix_b/appendixb.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH210-BGBBGBDC">“Apple Help URLs”</a></span> for a list of these URLs and cross-references to their descriptions in this document.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH205-BABDJCCF" title="The Library Menu"></a><h3>The Library Menu</h3><p>The Library menu lists all of the help books currently registered on the user’s system. A help book is registered when an application calls the <code>AHRegisterHelpBook</code> function during application startup or (if the help book is listed in the application’s <code>Info.plist</code> file) when the user chooses application help from the Help menu or from a help button.</p><p>With the Library menu, users can easily access and browse all of the help available to them. The Library menu is accessed by pressing the Home button, as shown in <span class="content_text">Figure 1-5</span>. </p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH205-BABFDIDE" title="Figure 1-5The Library menu"></a><p><strong>Figure 1-5&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The Library menu</p><img src = "../Art/help_center.jpg" alt = "The Help Center" ></div><br/><p>Because the Library menu is available to the user at any time, no matter what help book they are currently viewing, users can conveniently switch between help books without switching applications. When the user chooses a help book from the Library menu, Help Viewer loads that help book.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH205-TPXREF102" title="Help Books"></a><h2>Help Books</h2><p>To display help in Help Viewer, you must create and register a help book. A help book is the collection of HTML files that constitute your help content plus a help index file. In addition to HTML files, help books can contain graphics, AppleScript scripts, QuickTime movies, and other resources used in the help pages. A help book can be simple or complex, depending upon the complexity of the software product it describes. In addition to any help content, a help book must contain these two items:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>A default, or title, page. This is the XHTML page that is displayed by default when Help Viewer first opens the help book. The title page is identified by the <code>AppleTitle</code> meta tag in its header. The <code>AppleTitle</code> meta tag is one of the help-specific meta tags described in <span class="content_text"><a href="apple_help_concepts.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH205-BABGBEII">“Help-Specific Meta Tags.”</a></span> Without this page, Help Viewer cannot locate and automatically access the help book. Title pages are described in more detail in <span class="content_text"><a href="../authoring_help/authoring_help_book.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH206-CIHJEAEF">“Creating a Title Page.”</a></span></p></li><li class="li"><p>An index file. For a help book to be searchable, it must have an index file. You can create index files using the Help Indexer utility, described in <span class="content_text"><a href="../authoring_help/authoring_help_book.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH206-CIHHFHAF">“Indexing Your Help Book.”</a></span></p></li></ul><p>All of the content referenced by your help book must reside in a single folder, although a help book folder can contain any number of subfolders. If you localize your help book, you need a folder for each language—see <span class="content_text"><a href="../authoring_help/authoring_help_book.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH206-BEJIGBGJ">“Localizing Your Help Book”</a></span> for more information. </p><div class="notebox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH205-DontLinkElementID_25" title="Note"></a><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp; If you keep all or portions of your help content on a remote server, the help folder you store locally need not contain all of the content used by your help book. For more information, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../authoring_help/authoring_help_book.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH206-CHDGIECE">“Storing Pages on Remote Servers.”</a></span></p></div><p>When you register your help book, Help Viewer locates your help book folder, searches the folder for the title page and index file or files for your help book, and caches the location of those files. When users choose your help book in the Library menu or choose the application help item from the Help menu in your application, Help Viewer opens the title page of your help book. When users enter a search in Help Viewer, Help Viewer searches the index files in your help book and displays the relevant results in the table view shown in <span class="content_text"><a href="apple_help_concepts.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH205-BABEJFBE">Figure 1-3</a></span>. </p><div class="importantbox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH205-DontLinkElementID_26" title="Important:"></a><p><strong>Important:</strong>&nbsp;You must register your help book for it to appear in the Library menu, be searchable in Help Viewer, and be accessible through the Apple Help API. For information on registering a help book, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../registering_help/registering_help.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH207-CHDGHHDF">“Help Book Registration.”</a></span></p><p></p></div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH205-CIHECHIB" title="Internet-Based Help Book Content"></a><h2>Internet-Based Help Book Content</h2><p>Help Viewer supports Internet-based help book content: You can store help pages on a remote server and Help Viewer downloads them as needed. This allows you to keep your help content up to date easily and without inconvenience to your users. There are several strategies you can use to provide help:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Internet-only: Only a small percentage of the pages are installed locally. If the Internet isn’t available, the help is not available. This strategy is used, for example, by Mac OS X Server Help.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Internet-primary: Most or all help pages are installed locally, but Help Viewer checks the server to determine whether a newer version of each page is available before displaying the page. If the server isn’t available, or if the page has not been updated, then the local version is used. This strategy is used by Mac Help and most Apple application help books.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Local-primary: Local pages are used if available. If the requested page is not available locally, then Help Viewer looks for it on the remote server.</p></li></ul><p>When you index your help book, you specify the server from which Help Viewer should retrieve content. You also specify whether Internet-based help pages should take priority over local help pages. When the user opens your help book, Help Viewer loads your title page. When the user follows a link to another page, Help Viewer checks the index to see whether you specified local-primary or Internet-primary help. If you specified local-primary help, Help viewer loads the page in the local help book folder. If the page is not present in the local help folder, then Help Viewer contacts the server specified in the index and downloads the page. On the other hand, if you specified Internet-primary help, Help Viewer checks first for content on your remote server and downloads the page from there. If the page is not present on the server, but is present locally, then Help Viewer loads the page from the local help book folder.</p><p>Local-primary help has the advantage of loading quickly while still allowing you to add help content by providing new topics on an Internet server. Using Internet-primary help, you can update help content at any time without requiring the user to install an updated version of the help book, while still providing a complete help book locally in case the user is not connected to a network. With Internet-only help, the user must be connected to the Internet to access help. This method is most appropriate for applications that must be connected to the Internet in order to function.</p><p>Help Viewer also supports updating indexes over the Internet. </p><p>To learn more about supplying content remotely, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../authoring_help/authoring_help_book.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH206-CHDGIECE">“Storing Pages on Remote Servers.”</a></span></p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH205-BABBDDJC" title="How Users Access Your Help"></a><h2>How Users Access Your Help</h2><p>Users access your application’s help book— and other help resources—in any of the following three ways:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Choosing the application help item from the Help menu or typing a query into the Spotlight For Help text field in the Help menu. This is the most visible means of accessing user help, and your application must provide Help menu access to its help book. If you register your help book, the system automatically makes your help book accessible from the Help menu and automatically indexes your help book in Spotlight For Help. </p></li><li class="li"><p>Clicking a help button. Where appropriate—for example, in a dialog requesting a user action—your application may supply a help button. Clicking this button should bring up a relevant page in your application’s user help.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Choosing a help item from a contextual menu. If contextually relevant help exists for a part of your application’s user interface, the first item in a contextual menu should be a help item. If the user chooses the help item, your application should bring up the relevant help.</p></li></ul><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH205-CIHEGEDD" title="The Help Menu"></a><h3>The Help Menu</h3><p>Users access your application’s help book and other help resources through the Help menu, normally the rightmost menu in the application region of the menu bar. Although your application may also provide additional means of obtaining help, such as contextual menu items or help buttons, the Help menu is the most obvious means of obtaining assistance for the majority of users. Because the Help menu is easily visible, remains in a consistent location, and is always accessible, it is the first place users go when they have a question. Help menu items are not context-sensitive. </p><p><span class="content_text">Figure 1-6</span> shows the Help menu in Mail.</p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH205-BABBAFEI" title="Figure 1-6The Help menu"></a><p><strong>Figure 1-6&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The Help menu</p><img src = "../Art/help_menu.jpg" alt = "The Help menu" ></div><br/><p>The Help menu is supplied by the system. If you have registered your help book, the system not only creates the Help menu, it also adds an application help menu item and opens Help Viewer to the home page of your application’s registered help book when the user chooses your application help. In Mac OS X v10.5 and later, the user can also use the Spotlight For Help search field to search the content of your help book. When they do so and choose one of the returned search items, the system opens the appropriate page in your help file. </p><div class="notebox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH205-DontLinkElementID_27" title="Note"></a><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;If you do not register your help book, you need to add an <em>ApplicationName</em> Help item to the Help menu, where <em>ApplicationName</em> is the name of your software product. When the user chooses this item from the menu, you should open Help Viewer to the first page of your application’s primary help book. In this case, Spotlight For Help cannot return items from your help book in response to a query, and the user will see only choices returned from Mac Help and other help books on their system.</p></div><p>In addition to your application’s primary help book, you may want to include in the Help menu items for other help resources, such as links to support or customer service websites or tutorials.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH205-BABHDCJG" title="Help Buttons"></a><h3>Help Buttons</h3><p>A help button is a small round button displaying the standard help icon—a question mark. This button is available in Interface Builder. </p><p>When contextually relevant help is available, you can use a help button in a window or dialog to take users directly to the pertinent information. For example, you can use a help button in a Preferences window to take users directly to information about setting preferences for your application. The button is customarily placed in the lower-right corner of the window when there are no other buttons in that location and in the lower-left corner otherwise.</p><p><span class="content_text">Figure 1-7</span> shows a typical help button, in the lower-right corner of a Mail preferences window. </p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH205-BABBECGF" title="Figure 1-7A help button"></a><p><strong>Figure 1-7&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>A help button</p><img src = "../Art/help_button_whole_dialog.jpg" alt = "A help button" ></div><br/><p>You should use help buttons only when contextually relevant help exists for the current window or dialog. Help buttons should allow users to obtain assistance for the task at hand without searching through your help book. </p><p>When the user clicks the help button, your application should load the relevant help topic in Help Viewer, using the Apple Help function <code>AHLookupAnchor</code>. See <span class="content_text"><a href="apple_help_concepts.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH205-BABBDDAC">“The Apple Help Application Programming Interface”</a></span> for more information on using this function.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH205-BABHEGHA" title="Help Viewer HTML Items"></a><h2>Help Viewer HTML Items</h2><p>Help Viewer recognizes a number of help-specific items in the HTML file, which you can use in your help book to control how Help Viewer displays and accesses your help. These items fall into three categories:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Metadata. Help Viewer uses this metadata to recognize your help book and determine how it should be displayed.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Help URLs.

You can also use these meta tags to control how your help is indexed. <span class="content_text"><a href="../authoring_help/authoring_help_book.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH206-CIHEAADH">“Authoring Apple Help”</a></span> describes many of these meta tags and how you can use them. For a complete list of the help-specific metadata recognized by Help Viewer, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../appendix_a/appendixa.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH209-CHDHFAFG">Table A-1</a></span>. </p><div class="notebox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH205-DontLinkElementID_28" title="Note"></a><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp; Most of the metadata recognized by Help Viewer is optional. However, you must include the <code>AppleTitle</code> meta tag on one page in the root of your help book for Help Viewer to properly identify and display your help book.</p></div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH205-TPXREF104" title="Help URLs"></a><h3>Help URLs</h3><p>There are several URLs, using the Help Viewer <code>help:</code> protocol, that you can use in your help book to create links to additional help content. You use the standard <code>a href</code> syntax for a source link with these help URLs. Although you can use help URLs to link to HTML help pages, you can use standard hyperlinks for that purpose as well. The main advantage of the help URLs is that they allow you to create hyperlinks that, when clicked, initiate searches in Help Viewer, run AppleScript scripts, and perform anchor lookup.</p><p>The help URLs are listed in <span class="content_text"><a href="../appendix_b/appendixb.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH210-TPXREF101">Table B-1</a></span>. That table includes cross-references to discussions of these URLs in this document.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH205-TPXREF105" title="Apple Help Segments"></a><h3>Apple Help Segments</h3><p>Help Viewer also recognizes certain HTML comments that you can use to split your help book into subsections, called segments. Segments can be returned as individual hits in a search, each with its own description, title, and search keywords. You may find it useful to use segments if you have a particularly large help book and wish to reduce the file count without loading too much help content into a single help page. <span class="content_text"><a href="../authoring_help/authoring_help_book.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH206-CHDDBGAA">“Creating Segments in Help Files”</a></span> describes segments in more detail. See <span class="content_text"><a href="../appendix_c/appendixc.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH211-BABDFIAH">Table C-1</a></span> for a complete list of the comments denoting segments.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH205-DontLinkElementID_6" title="VoiceOver Summaries"></a><h3>VoiceOver Summaries</h3><p>To support readers with visual disabilities, the W3C document <em>HTML Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0</em> (<span class="content_text"><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-WCAG10-HTML-TECHS-20001106/" target="_blank">http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-WCAG10-HTML-TECHS-20001106/</a></span>) defines a <code>summary</code> attribute for the <code>table</code> element. You can use this, for example, to provide VoiceOver with a description of the relationships among cells in a table.

You can call this interface from Cocoa as well as Carbon applications. When users choose an item from the Help menu, click a help button, or choose Help from a contextual menu, your application must respond by displaying the appropriate help material. If this help material is in an Apple Help book, your application must open the relevant page of the help book in Help Viewer.</p><div class="notebox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903-CH205-DontLinkElementID_29" title="Note"></a><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;If your help book is registered, the system opens the book in Help Viewer for you when the user chooses your application’s help from the Help menu. However, you are responsible for providing access to help through help buttons, contextual menus, or additional Help menu items.
