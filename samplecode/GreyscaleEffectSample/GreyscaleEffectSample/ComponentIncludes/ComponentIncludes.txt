File: ComponentIncludes.txtDate: Jan 7, 2002Mac OS X Version: 10.1.2NOTE: These files are required only for the Mach-O samples.Although these k.h files from Universal Interfaces ComponentIncludes are now availablein the QuickTime Framework on Mac OS X, the plumbing regarding path names is stillbroken. If you're building a Mac OS X Mach-O component, it's much easier to use thek.h files you need locally until the Framework is fixed.The versions included here are from Universal Interfaces 3.4.1 with #include changes forProject Builder and Metrowerks Mach-O.Included in this project:    ComponentDispatchHelper.c    Components.k.h    ImageCompression.k.h    QuickTimeComponents.k.h    ImageCodec.k.h    If you require others to build your own components, copy them from the latest version ofUniversal Interfaces available from www.developer.apple.com/sdk
