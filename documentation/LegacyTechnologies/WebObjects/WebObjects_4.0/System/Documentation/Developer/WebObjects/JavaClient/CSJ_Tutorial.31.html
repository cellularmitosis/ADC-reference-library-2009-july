adaptor</h4>

<A NAME="pgfId=998771">

A mechanism that connects your application to a particular database server. For each type of server you use, you need a separate adaptor. Enterprise Objects Framework provides adaptors for Informix, Oracle, and Sybase servers, and for any server that is ODBC compliant.</P>

<A NAME="pgfId=998773">

In Entity-Relationship modeling, an identifiable characteristic of an entity. For example, <B>lastName</B>
 can be an attribute of an <B>Employee</B>
 entity. An attribute typically corresponds to a column in a database table. See <EM CLASS="Italic">
flattened attribute, entity,</EM>

class property</h4>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId=998775">
 </A>
An instance variable in an enterprise object that meets two criteria: it's based on an attribute in your model, and it can be fetched from the database. &quot;Class property&quot; can either refer to an attribute or a relationship. In EOModeler you can specify class properties for server enterprise-object classes and class properties for client classes.</P>

entity</H4>

<A NAME="pgfId=998787">
 </A>
In Entity-Relationship modeling, a distinguishable object about which data is kept. For example, you can have an Employee entity with attributes such as lastName, firstName, address, and so on. An entity typically corresponds to a table in a relational database; an entity's attributes in turn correspond to a table's columns. See <EM CLASS="Italic">

Entity-Relationship modeling</h4>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId=998789">
 </A>
A discipline for examining and representing the components and interrelationships in a database system. Also known as E-R modeling, this discipline factors a database system into entities, attributes, and relationships.</P>

<H4>
<A NAME="pgfId=998792">
 </A>
flattened attribute</H4>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId=998793">
 </A>
A special kind of attribute that you add from one entity to another by traversing a relationship. For example, employees work for departments; you can add an attribute (such as departmentName) from the Department entity to the Employee entity as a flattened attribute. A flattened attribute is normally implemented by joining the tables corresponding to the source and destination entities whenever the attribute's data is fetched. See <EM CLASS="Italic">
relationship</EM>

<A NAME="pgfId=998794">
 </A>
foreign key</H4>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId=998795">
 </A>
An attribute in an entity that gives it access to rows in another entity. This attribute must be the primary key of the related entity. For example, an Employee entity can contain the foreign key deptID, which matches the primary key in the entity Department. You can then use deptID as the source attribute in Employee and as the destination attribute in Department to form a relationship between the entities. See <EM CLASS="Italic">
key, primary key,</EM>

relationship</EM>

generic record</H4>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId=998840">
 </A>
An instance of the EOGenericRecord default enterprise object class. A generic record has properties that map to stored data, but unlike a custom enterprise object, it adds no behavior to that data. Like custom enterprise objects, generic records conform to the key-value coding protocol; see <EM CLASS="Italic">

many-to-many relationship</H4>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId=998846">
 </A>
A relationship in which each record in the source entity may correspond to more than one record in the destination entity, and each record in the destination may correspond to more than one record in the source. For example, an employee can work on many projects, and a project can be staffed by many employees. See <EM CLASS="Italic">

relationship</H4>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId=998854">
 </A>
A link between two entities that's based on attributes of the entities. For example, the Department and Employee entities can have a relationship based on the deptID attribute as a foreign key in Employee, and as the primary key in Department (note that though the join attribute deptID is the same for the source and destination entities in this example, it doesn't have to be). This relationship would make it possible to find the employees for a given department. See <EM CLASS="GlossTerm">
