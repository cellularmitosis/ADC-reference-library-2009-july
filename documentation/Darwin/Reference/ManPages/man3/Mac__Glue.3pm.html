<b>NAME</b>
       Mac::Glue - Control Mac apps with Apple event terminology

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
               use Mac::Glue;
               my $glue = Mac::Glue-&gt;new('Finder');
               $glue-&gt;prop('System Folder')-&gt;open;
               # see rest of docs for lots more info

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       "Mac::Glue does AppleScript so you don't have to."

       If you have MacPerl <u>earlier</u> than 5.6, you should have the latest cpan-mac distribution:

               <a href="http://sf.net/projects/cpan-mac/">http://sf.net/projects/cpan-mac/</a>

       For Mac OS X, you should have the latest Mac::Carbon distribution:

               <a href="http://projects.pudge.net/">http://projects.pudge.net/</a>

       Also see projects.pudge.net for more information, support, CVS, etc.

       Mac OS apps speak to each other with a <u>lingua</u> <u>franca</u> called <b>Apple</b> <b>events</b>.  The most common way to do
       Apple events (aside from doaing them in a precompiled application with C, Pascal, etc.) is with
       AppleScript.  Other languages can do Apple events too, like Frontier and even Python.  But we like
       Perl.

       MacPerl has for a few years had an interface to Apple events, with the Mac::AppleEvents module, which
       is the basis for everything we'll do here.  Mac::AppleEvents::Simple was made to simplify the process
       of doing Apple events in MacPerl, but even that can be too much trouble to use.  One has to find out
       the class and event IDs, find out the keywords and data types for each parameter, etc.

       So the vision was born for a framework that wouldn't take much significant work.  An application's
       AETE resource would provide the names to match to the cryptic four-character codes we had been using.
       Compare.

       Raw Mac::AppleEvents method
                   use Mac::AppleEvents;
                   use Mac::Errors '$MacError';

                   $evt = AEBuildAppleEvent('aevt', 'odoc', typeApplSignature, 'MACS',
                           kAutoGenerateReturnID, kAnyTransactionID,
                           "'----': obj{want:type(prop), from:'null'()," .
                           "form:prop, seld:type(macs)}"
                   ) or die $MacError;
                   $rep = AESend($evt, kAEWaitReply) or die $MacError;

                   AEDisposeDesc($evt);
                   AEDisposeDesc($rep);

       Easier Mac::AppleEvents::Simple method
                   use Mac::AppleEvents::Simple;
                   do_event(qw(aevt odoc MACS),
                           "'----': obj{want:type(prop), from:'null'()," .
                           "form:prop, seld:type(macs)}"
                   );

       Cool Mac::Glue method
                   use Mac::Glue;
                   my $glue = Mac::Glue-&gt;new('Finder');
                   $glue-&gt;open( $glue-&gt;prop('System Folder') );

       The latter is much simpler to understand, to read, to write.  It leverages the user's understanding
       of AppleScript.  And it is just more natural.

       There are downsides.  Mac::Glue is less powerful than the Mac::AppleEvents raw interfaces, because it
       offers less flexibility in how events are called.  It is also slower to start a script, because the
       glue structures need to be loaded in.  However, once a script has started, a difference in speed from
       the raw interfaces should be minimal (though not a lot of testing has been done on that).  With the
       code above, on a PowerBook G3/292, running Mac OS 8.6:

           Benchmark: timing 100 iterations of glue, glue2, raw, simple...
                 glue: 10 secs ( 9.98 usr  0.00 sys =  9.98 cpu)
                glue2:  8 secs ( 8.35 usr  0.00 sys =  8.35 cpu)
                  raw:  8 secs ( 7.88 usr  0.00 sys =  7.88 cpu)
               simple:  7 secs ( 7.50 usr  0.00 sys =  7.50 cpu)

       The "glue2" entry is the same as "glue" entry, but it creates a glue object only once instead of each
       time through, cutting down on the overhead.  It appears that Mac::Glue is a bit slower than the other
       methods, but not substantially, and it is cooler and easier.  The one place where performance is the
       biggest problem is on initial execution of the program, but once it starts it is plenty fast.  We'll
       work to cut down that start time, too.

       So, now that you are convinced this is cool, let's continue.

       <b>Mac</b> <b>OS</b> <b>X</b>

       Mac OS X is supported by Mac::Glue now.  Note that some glues and methods will behave differently,
       due to differences in application implementation (for example, the Finder's "clean up" event is not
       supported in Mac OS X at this writing).

       <b>Creating</b> <b>a</b> <b>Glue</b>

       In order to script an application with Mac::Glue, a glue must be created first.  For that, the
       application is passed to the <u>gluemac</u> script.  A distribution called Mac::AETE, created by David
       Schooley, is used to parse an application's AETE resource, and the glue is written out to a file
       using Storable, DB_File, and MLDBM.  Glues are saved in $ENV{MACGLUEDIR} (which is defined when
       Mac::Glue is used if it is not defined already).  By default for MacPerl, glues are stored in
       <u>:site</u><b>_</b><u>perl:Mac:Glue:glues:</u>, or in <u>./Glue/glues</u> relative to <u>Glue.pm</u> for Unix (Mac OS X).

       All glues have access to the global scripting additions and dialect information.  Glues for these
       must be created as well, and are created with the <u>gluescriptadds</u> and <u>gluedialect</u> programs, which are
       similar to the <u>gluemac</u> program.  They are saved in the directories <u>$ENV{MACGLUEDIR}additions</u> and
       <u>$ENV{MACGLUEDIR}dialects</u>.

       Along with the glue file is a POD file containing documentation for the glue, listing all the events
       (with parameters), classes (with properties), and enumerators, and descriptions of each.

       <b>Using</b> <b>a</b> <b>Glue</b>

       The first thing you do is call the module.

               use Mac::Glue;

       Then you create an object for your app by passing the "new" function the name of the glue (you may
       include or omit underscores in the name if you like).

               my $glue = Mac::Glue-&gt;new('My App');  # or My_App

       You can also pass in additional parameters for the type of target to use.

          Bundle ID (Mac OS X only)

                   Mac::Glue-&gt;new('My App', bundle =&gt; 'com.example.MyApp');

          Process Serial Number

                   Mac::Glue-&gt;new('My App', psn =&gt; $psn);

          Process ID (Mac OS X only)

                   Mac::Glue-&gt;new('My App', pid =&gt; $pid);

          Application path

                   Mac::Glue-&gt;new('My App', path =&gt; $path_to_file_or_bundle);

          AppleTalk (Mac OS only)

                   Mac::Glue-&gt;new('My App', ppc =&gt; 'My App Name',
                           'Server Name', 'Zone');

          Application URL

                   Mac::Glue-&gt;new('My App', eppc =&gt; 'My App Name', 'mac.example.com',
                           $uid, $pid, $user, $pass);

           UID, PID, user, pass are optional (and ignored entirely for Mac OS 9).  It is recommended to use
           the Keychain to handle user/pass (just omit them, and you'll be prompted in a dialog box for
           them, with an option for the Keychain to remember them).

           UID and PID are used if there's more than one target application, though these don't currently
           work in my tests.

       Addresses can be changed after the fact:

               $glue-&gt;ADDRESS(eppc =&gt; 'My App Name', 'mac.example.com');

       And to reset the address to the default, call the method with no parameters:

               $glue-&gt;ADDRESS;

       Once you have your glue set up, you start calling events, as they are documented in the POD file for
       the glue.  The events can be called case-insensitively, with the exception of those that match the
       names of the special methods (see "Special parameters and methods").  In that case, since the special
       methods are in all caps, the event methods can be called case-insensitively except for all caps.
       e.g., for an event named "reply", it could be called with:

               $glue-&gt;Reply;
               $glue-&gt;reply;
               $glue-&gt;RePLY;

       However, it could not be called with "$glue-&gt;REPLY", since that is reserved.

       All applications respond to events differently.  Something that works for one application might not
       work for another, so don't use any of these examples as a way you should script a specific
       application.  They are just hyopthetical examples, for the most part.

       Events sometimes accept parameters, sometimes they don't.  The primary parameter of most events is a
       special parameter called the <u>direct</u> <u>object</u> parameter.  In your event call, pass the data for that
       parameter first:

               $glue-&gt;open($file);

       Other parameters must be named and must be provided as key-value pairs, with the key as the name of
       the parameter, and the value as the parameter's data:

               $glue-&gt;open($file, using =&gt; $myapp);

       Note that the direct object parameter is the only parameter that doesn't need a name in front of it,
       and must come first in the list if it is supplied at all.

       Mac::Glue will attempt to coerce passed data into the expected type.  For example, if "open" expects
       an alias, the file specification in $file will be turned into an alias before being added to the
       event.

       You can override this behavior with the "param_type" function.  If "open" expects an alias
       ("typeAlias"), but you want to pass text, you can do:

               $glue-&gt;open( param_type(typeChar, $path) );

       Each datum can be a simple scalar as above, an AEDesc object, an Mac::AEObjDesc object (returned by
       "obj", "prop", and event methods), an Mac::AEEnum object (returned by the "enum" function, see
       EXPORT), or an array or hash reference, corresponding to AE lists and records.  In this example, we
       nest them, with an arrayref as one of the values in the hashref, so the AE list is a datum for one of
       the keys in the AE record:

               $glue-&gt;make(new =&gt; 'window', with_properties =&gt;
                       { name =&gt; "New Window", position =&gt; [100, 200] });

       The words "name" and "position" will be changed into the proper corresponding AE IDs.  And on return,
       record keys will be changed back from the AE IDs into the English words.

       Events return direct object parameters, turned into suitable data for use in the program.  Aliases
       are resolved into file specifications, AE records and lists are turned into Perl hashes and arrays
       (recursively, for nested lists), etc.

               my @urls = $sherlock-&gt;search_internet('AltaVista',
                       for =&gt; 'Mac::Glue');

       AE objects (which will be discussed later) are returned as "Mac::AEObjDesc" objects, so they may be
       used again by being passed back to another event.

               my $window_object = $glue-&gt;get( window =&gt; 1 );
               $glue-&gt;save($window_object);

       This allows AppleScript-like loops:

               my @selection = $glue-&gt;get( $glue-&gt;prop(selection =&gt; of =&gt; window) );
               my @owners;
               for my $item (@selection) {
                       push @owners, $glue-&gt;get( $glue-&gt;obj(cell =&gt; 'Owners' =&gt; $item) );
               }

       Some objects may allow an easy way to get a human-readable form, with the "as" parameter:

               my $item = $glue-&gt;get( file =&gt; 1, as =&gt; 'string' );

       Errors are returned in the special variable $^E, which should be checked immediately after an event
       call (for portability with Mac OS X, use $MacError instead for the value):

               $glue-&gt;close(window =&gt; 1);
               if ($^E) {
                       warn "Couldn't close window: $MacError\n";
               }

       Or, if a value is expected and none is returned:

               my $file = $glue-&gt;choose_file('Select a file, please.')
                       or die "No file chosen: $MacError";

       Checking $^E only works if the error returned is an error number.  If it isn't, the actual error is
       available from the reply event, which can be accessed by using the "RETOBJ" parameter (described
       below in "Special parameters and methods").

       You can also handle errors with the "ERRORS" handlers (also described below in "Special parameters
       and methods").

       <b>Creating</b> <b>object</b> <b>specifier</b> <b>records</b>

       This is one of the more complex parts of Apple events, and it is only partially implemented (though
       full implementation is expected eventually, and most of it is implemented now).

       Object specifier records are created by the "obj" method, and have four components to them.

       class
       container
       form
       data

       The class and data are passed as key-value pairs, like in AE records or parameter lists.  The form
       and the type of the data are determined by the glue data or a good guess.  The container is
       determined by the order of the key-value pairs: each pair is contained by the pair or object that
       follows it.

               my $obj = $glue-&gt;obj(file =&gt; 'foo', folder =&gt; 'bar', disk =&gt; 'buz');

       So you have three pairs.  The key of each pair ("file", "folder", "disk") is the class.  The value of
       each pair ("foo", "bar", "baz") is the data.  Because the data are each text, the form defaults to
       formName, and the data type defaults to typeChar (TEXT).  If the data is a number, then the form
       would be formAbsolutePosition, and the data type would be typeLongInteger.

       So that leaves only the container.  Each pair is contained by the pair following it.  The disk
       contains the folder, the folder contains the file.  The disk has no container (its container is
       null).

       Easy, right?  I hope so.  That's the idea.  But let's go back to the forms, since that is the only
       tough part left.

       The primary forms are types, names, unique IDs, absolute positions, relative positions, tests, and
       ranges.  Normally, text data has form name and type TEXT.  Integer data has absolute position form,
       and integer type.  The "obj_form" function (see EXPORT) accepts three parameters, which allows you to
       set the form and data, or form, type, and data, in case you want to send data different from how
       Mac::Glue would guess.

       These two are the same, since in the second case, the other is assumed:

               use Mac::Glue ':glue';

               $obj1 = $glue-&gt;obj(window =&gt;
                       obj_form(formAbsolutePostion, typeLongInteger, 1));

               $obj2 = $glue-&gt;obj(window =&gt; 1);

       Special constants are exported that specify relative positions and absolute positions.

               $first  = $glue-&gt;obj(file =&gt; gFirst, property =&gt; 'Desktop');
               $second = $glue-&gt;obj(file =&gt; gNext, $first);

               for ($first, $second) {
                       print $glue-&gt;get($_, as =&gt; 'string');
               }

       "of" and "in" are synonyms of "property":

               $glue-&gt;obj(file =&gt; gFirst, property =&gt; 'Desktop');
               $glue-&gt;obj(file =&gt; gFirst, of =&gt; 'Desktop');
               $glue-&gt;obj(file =&gt; gFirst, in =&gt; 'Desktop');

       The "as" parameter above has a form of type, such as:

               obj_form(formPropertyID, typeType, 'string');

       Then "string" is turned into a four-character ID behind the scenes (in this case, it is "TEXT").

       A special method called "prop" is for specifying properties.  These are equivalent:

               $glue-&gt;obj(property =&gt; 'Desktop');
               $glue-&gt;prop('Desktop');

       <b>Descriptor</b> <b>types</b> <b>for</b> <b>object</b> <b>specifier</b> <b>records</b>


       Property IDs
           Normally, the glue will know a property is expected and coerce whatever string you provide into
           its four-character ID.  Sometimes "obj_form(formPropertyID, typeType, 'property_name')" may be
           appropriate.

       Name
           Just pass the data as text.  If there is some ambiguity, you may explicitly use
           "obj_form(formName, typeChar, 'string')".

       Unique IDs
           Could be any type.  Usually you will need to use obj_form, else name or absolute position will be
           used.  Use "obj_form(formUniqueID, TYPE, DATA)".

       Absolute position
           As discussed above, if it is an index number, you can just pass the number, as in "window =&gt; 1",
           or you can explicitly mark it with "window =&gt; obj_form(formAbsolutePosition, typeLongInteger,
           1)".

           For other absolutes, you may use constants, such as "window =&gt; gLast".  Choices are "gFirst",
           "gMiddle", "gLast", "gAny", "gAll".

           These are just shortcuts for explicit forms like "obj_form(formAbsolutePosition,
           typeAbsoluteOrdinal, kAEAll)".

           Note that if there is a plural form of the class name, you may use it to mean the same thing as
           "<u>class</u> =&gt; gAll".  These are all the same:

                   $f-&gt;obj(files =&gt; of =&gt; 'System Folder');
                   $f-&gt;obj(files =&gt; gAll, of =&gt; 'System Folder');
                   $f-&gt;obj(file =&gt; gAll, of =&gt; 'System Folder');

       Relative position
           Similar to absolute position, but an additional object must be specified, such as "file =" gNext,
           file =&gt; gMiddle&gt;, which would return the file after the middle file.  Available constants are
           "gNext" and "gPrevious".

           The explicit form is "obj_form(formRelativePosition, typeEnumerated, kAENext)".

       Ranges
           The "range" function accepts two arguments, the start and stop ranges.

                   range(START, STOP)

           (See EXPORT.)

           Each can be a number index, an absolute position constant, a string, or another data type passed
           with "obj_form".  Here are a few ways to specify files in the System Folder:

                   $f-&gt;obj(files =&gt; range(1, 5), of =&gt; 'System Folder');
                   $f-&gt;obj(files =&gt; range(1, "System"), of =&gt; 'System Folder');
                   $f-&gt;obj(files =&gt; range("Finder", "System"), of =&gt; 'System Folder');
                   $f-&gt;obj(files =&gt; range(gFirst, "System"), of =&gt; 'System Folder');

       Whose tests
           The "whose" function accepts either logical records or comparison records.

                   # comparison record
                   $f-&gt;obj(CLASS =&gt; whose(CLASS =&gt; VALUE, OPERATOR, VALUE));
                   $f-&gt;obj(CLASS =&gt; whose(PROPERTY, OPERATOR, VALUE));

           (See EXPORT.)

           PROPERTY and CLASS =&gt; VALUE work like <u>prop()</u> and <u>obj()</u>.  The PROPERTY form is the same as
           "property =&gt; VALUE".

           OPERATOR is "contains", "equals", "begins_with", "ends_with", "l_t", "l_e", "g_t", or "g_e".
           VALUE is the value to compare to.

                   # files whose name begins with "foo"
                   $f-&gt;obj(files =&gt; whose(name =&gt; begins_with =&gt; 'foo'));

                   # rows whose first cell equals "bar"
                   $f-&gt;obj(rows =&gt; whose(cell =&gt; 1 =&gt; equals =&gt; 'bar'));

           Then there is the logical record type, for use when more than one comparison record is needed.

                   # logical record
                   $f-&gt;obj(CLASS =&gt; whose(OPERATOR, LIST));

           OPERATOR is "AND", "OR", or "NOT".  LIST is any number of other logical records or comparison
           records, contained in anonymous arrays.  So you can join any number of records together:

                   # words where it contains "e" and it begins with "p" and it does not end with "s"
                   $aw-&gt;obj(
                           words =&gt; whose(AND =&gt;
                                   [it =&gt; contains =&gt; 'e'], [it =&gt; begins_with =&gt; 'p'],
                                   [NOT =&gt; [it =&gt; ends_with =&gt; 's']]
                           ), $text)

           Note how each logical record and comparison record following each logical operator is in an
           anonymous array.  Also not how the special word "it" refers to the object being examined.

       There's one more record type that works similarly to the above object specifier records, but is not
       exactly the same thing.  It's called an <u>insertion</u> <u>location</u> <u>record</u>, and is created like this:

               location(POSITION[, OBJECT])

       (See EXPORT.)

       POSITION is a string, and can be one of "before", "after", "beginning", or "end".  "front" is a
       synonym for "beginning", and "back" and "behind" are synonyms for "after".

       OBJECT is the object to be positioned against, and will be the null object if not supplied.

               my $aw = new Mac::Glue 'AppleWorks';
               my $text = $aw-&gt;prop(text_body =&gt; document =&gt; 1);
               $aw-&gt;activate;

               # note null object in location()
               $aw-&gt;make(new =&gt; 'document', at =&gt; location('front'));
               $aw-&gt;set($text, to =&gt; "foo bar buz baz.");

               $aw-&gt;move(
                       $aw-&gt;obj(word =&gt; 4 =&gt; $text),
                       to =&gt; location(after =&gt; $aw-&gt;obj(word =&gt; 2 =&gt; $text))
               );

       <b>Shortcuts</b> <b>for</b> <b>object</b> <b>specifier</b> <b>records</b>

       Object specifier records objects in Mac::Glue can be called with any method from the record's parent
       glue, and it will be passed to that method as the direct object.  Examples:

               $tracks = $itunes-&gt;obj(tracks =&gt; $library);
               $tracks = $library-&gt;obj('tracks');

               @tracks = $itunes-&gt;get($tracks);
               @tracks = $tracks-&gt;get;

               $itunes-&gt;play($tracks[0]);
               $tracks[0]-&gt;play;

       In the first example, the record $library is the direct object in the <u>obj()</u> method, and so it can be
       flipped around with "$library-"obj('tracks')&gt;.

       Then, in the second example, the resulting record, $tracks, is called as the direct object of <u>get()</u>.

       Similar is the third example, where the track we wish to play is the direct object of <u>play()</u>.

       <b>Data</b> <b>from</b> <b>object</b> <b>specifier</b> <b>records</b>

       Sometimes data will be returned from an application in an object specifier record, and you want to
       get the data underneath.  This isn't usually necessary, but it came up in the case of iPhoto, where
       iPhoto would return a 64-bit integer, but want a 32-bit integer or float to be sent back to it.

       Normally, just using the object specifier record the app returned should be sufficient, but in this
       case, it isn't.

       Example:

               # how it should work
               my $sel = $iphoto-&gt;prop('selection');
               for my $photo ($sel-&gt;get) {
                       # ... do stuff with $photo
               }

               # how it works
               my $sel = $iphoto-&gt;prop('selection');
               for my $photo ($sel-&gt;get) {
                       my $id = $photo-&gt;getdata; # get data in usable form
                       my $newphoto = $iphoto-&gt;obj(photo =&gt;
                               obj_form(formUniqueID, typeFloat, $id)
                       );
                       # ... do stuff with $newphoto
               }

       Another workaround is to merely act on the object without fetching it.

               my $sel = $iphoto-&gt;prop('selection');
               # ... do stuff with $sel

       Results may vary.

       <b>Special</b> <b>parameters</b> <b>and</b> <b>methods</b>

       Special parameters can be passed in the event which control certain aspects of the event call's
       behavior.  They can be passed as parameters (affecting only the one event), or called as methods
       (which affect every call made from that object).  They are all upper case.

               $glue-&gt;REPLY(1);                # wait for reply on all events
               $glue-&gt;close(REPLY =&gt; 0);       # don't wait for this one event

       REPLY
           Boolean, for whether or not to wait for a reply.  Default is to wait.

       MODE
           Set other modes, such as "kAENeverInteract".  This value is OR'd together with the REPLY value.
           Default is "kAECanSwitchLayer".

       SWITCH
           Switch to the application being called.  Usually more efficient to use the "activate" event:

                   $glue-&gt;activate;

       PRIORITY
           Set the event priority.  Default is "kAENormalPriority".

       TIMEOUT
           Number of seconds to wait before timing out.  Default is a couple hundred thousand seconds or so.

       RETOBJ
           Boolean, for whether or not the event call will return the direct object data (the default), or a
           Mac::AppleEvents::Simple object, containing references to the actual event and reply, so you can
           do more advanced things with the data if you want to.

       ERRORS
           A subroutine reference that will handle any errors (that is, will be executed only if $^E is
           true) after the event is executed.  Your handler will be passed a hashref as its first argument,
           containing basic information about the event and error, followed by whatever arguments were
           passed to the event.  The hashref keys are:

                   _glue     actual glue object
                   _event    Mac::AppleEvents::Simple object that produced the error
                   glue      name of the application glue
                   event     name of the event
                   errs      error string
                   errn      error number
                   line      line of the error
                   filename  filename of the error
                   package   package of the error

           If ERRORS is passed a value of 1, then the default error handler will be used.  It is the same as
           the example error handler below.

           Example:

                   sub error_handler {
                           my($err, @args) = @_;
                           my $args = join ', ', @args;
                           warn sprintf("%s-&gt;%s(%s) event failed:\n%s (%d)\n%s\n",
                                   $err-&gt;{glue}, $err-&gt;{event}, $args,
                                   $err-&gt;{errc}, $err-&gt;{errn}, $err-&gt;{errs}
                           );
                   }

                   $finder-&gt;open(
                           $finder-&gt;obj( item =&gt; 'HD' ), # nothing named HD in Finder
                           ERRORS =&gt; \&amp;error_handler
                   );

           Result:

                   Finder-&gt;(DOBJ, Mac::AEObjDesc=HASH(0xb0dc30)) event failed (-1728):
                   errAENoSuchObject
                   e.g.,: specifier asked for the 3rd, but there are only 2. Basically,
                   this indicates a run-time resolution error.

       launch
           "launch()" will launch the app, if it is not already launched.  This is rarely necessary, as it
           is done automatically when needed.

       version
           "version()" gets the application's version, unpacking the data as necessary, because the data is
           sometimes returned in a binary format.

       app_process
           "app_process()" returns the reference to the application process object in the System Events
           application.  See "gluedoc System_Events" for more information.  Example to hide the application:

                   $glue-&gt;app_process-&gt;prop('visible')-&gt;set(to =&gt; 0);

       <b>Editing</b> <b>a</b> <b>Glue</b>

       There is an included droplet, <u>glueedit</u>, for editing glues.  Drop a created glue on the droplet, and
       it will make a text file on the Desktop.  Edit it, and then drop the text file back on the droplet.
       Be careful; this obviously can be dangerous.  If you break something, you can use <u>gluemac</u> to recreate
       the original glue, of course.

       Why would you edit a glue?  Well, sometimes AETE resources are wrong.  :)

<b>EXPORT</b>
       Mac::Glue has two export sets.  "glue" exports the constants and functions beginning with "glue"
       listed in "Creating Object Specifier Records", as well as the functions "obj_form", "enum",
       "location", "range", and "whose".  "all" exports everything from Mac::AppleEvents and
       Mac::AppleEvents::Simple, including all functions and constants.  Nothing is exported by default.

               use Mac::Glue ':glue';  # good for most things
               use Mac::Glue ':all';   # for more advanced things

<b>TIPS</b>
       <b>Hide</b> <b>background</b> <b>apps</b>

               use Mac::Glue;
               use Mac::Apps::Launch;
               $a = new Mac::Glue 'Acrobat Exchange';
               $a-&gt;launch;
               Hide($a-&gt;{ID});

               # now do your thing ...

       (This won't work on Mac OS X for now.)

       <b>Updating</b> <b>Glues</b>

       Use the -c and -r flags in <u>gluemac</u> to update glues, either updating all (with -r) glues, or just
       those apps with versions different from those stored in the glues.

       To update scripting additions or the dialect (which probably should be done when adding new scripting
       additions, or updating the system software), run <u>gluescriptadds</u> and <u>gluedialect</u>.

       <b>Scripting</b> <b>Addition</b> <b>Maintenance</b>

       If you have a lot of scripting additions, it can slow down Mac::Glue (on startup) and take up more
       RAM.  Same thing goes for Mac OS in general; each installed additions takes up more RAM and has to be
       loaded into the system, taking up extra time.  So only keep installed the ones you want installed.

       If you have a huge scripting addition and you only want to use a small part of its functionality, you
       could also edit the glue and strip out portions you don't want.  This is not recommended for those
       who don't know precisely what they are doing, and the gains may be unnoticable anyway.

<b>GOTCHAS</b>
          MAKE SURE <u>site</u><b>_</b><u>perl</u> COMES FIRST IN YOUR LIBRARY PREFERENCES FOR OLD VERSIONS OF MACPERL.  Thank
           you.  :-)

          Do NOT send an event to the MacPerl application itself and expect a reply.  Instead, try
           "$macperlglue-&gt;REPLY(0)".  Similarly, do not drop MacPerl onto <u>gluemac</u>.  Instead, you can make a
           copy of the MacPerl application, and drop that on <u>gluemac</u>.

          You should have the latest cpan-mac distribution is installed, for old versions of MacPerl.

          You should delete old dialect glue files manually if running Mac OS 9.

<b>TODO</b> <b>/</b> <b>BUGS</b>
          Specifying other attributes (transactions, etc.)

          Add more coercions etc. to Mac::AppleEvents::Simple (feedback wanted on this, let me know what I
           missed)

          Add comparison operators from glues ?

          "tell" objects to do events

          New AETE flags in Mac OS 8.5, Mac OS 9?  Anything else new?  Anything missing in backward
           compatibility to 7.5?

          MacPerl (I think) needs a new idle function for waiting for replies

          MacPerl hangs if it waits for a reply after sending an event to itself

          Handlers (on foo ...) ?

          Callbacks (some support exists, Cameron Ashby &lt;cameron@evolution.com&gt;, see
           Mac::AppleEvents::Simple) ?

          Add dynamic fetching of glues?

          Make makefile stuff work with MacPerl (5.2 and 5.6 ?)

          More POD in modules

          More examples (iCal, iPhoto, iTunes)

          A real test suite (though just making sure it loads is a pretty good test :-)

          Update glueedit
