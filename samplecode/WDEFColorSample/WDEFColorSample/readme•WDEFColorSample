    This sample was written as a response to developers who found the system 7 WDEF    too obscure an example when trying to create their own WDEFs. The part    that seems to be more difficult is the colorization part.    This sample ONLY shows how to obtain the colors that embellish the new windows,     although I tried to make it resemble the WDEF organization it is not to a sample     on how to write one. All the code pertinent to the color is contained in the file    WDEFColorSampleWDEF.c, this is all you want to look at from the point of view of     this sample, the other stuff comes from the Traffic Lights sample and it is better    commented there.    Please read the accompanying technical note #298 "Color, Windows and 7.0" for more    details.    NOTE: Clicking on the window shows the grow and goaway boxes in the highlited state.
