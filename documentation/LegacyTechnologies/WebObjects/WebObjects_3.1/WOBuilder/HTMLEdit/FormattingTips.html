<TABLE><TR><TD WIDTH=75><TD WIDTH=400><HR WIDTH=400> <H1><CENTER><A NAME="REF45640">Formatting Tips</A></CENTER></H1>                                                                      
 <P>Web pages are text flows, and WebObjects Builder edits Web pages as text flows.         
 Because the page is a text flow, you can't just drag an element to any coordinates      
 in the window. Instead you must place the cursor before you add the element.            
 <P>Here are some tips that might come in handy when you're trying to get the page to       
 look the way you want it to:                                                            
 <UL><LI>Create space above an element by placing the cursor above the element and           
 pressing Enter to insert some blank lines.                                              
 <P><LI>To <A HREF="SelectElements.html">select an element</A>, you must select both the text inside the element and the      
 element itself. That is, you must see the dotted border around the element, and         
 all of the text inside the dotted border must be visible.                               
  <P><LI>To center an element on the page, select the element, and click the centering       
 icon.                                                                                   
  <P><LI>You can delete just the element tags but leave the text intact. See "<A HREF="ChangeDeleteTags.html#REF33196">Changing or    
 Deleting Tags</A>."                                                                         
  <P><LI>If you make a mistake, choose Edit-&gt;Undo. Executing Undo twice undoes the           
 last two commands. To undo an undo, choose Redo.
