README - QTMissingCompQTMissingComp illustrates the preferred method, in QuickTime 4.0 and later, of checking to see whether a particular component is available. The only change from previous versions of QuickTime is that QuickTime 4.0 supports the cmpIsMissing flag for the componentFlagsMask field. Enjoy,QuickTime Team
