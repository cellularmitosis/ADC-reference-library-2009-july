PERLARTISTIC(1)                       Perl Programmers Reference Guide                       PERLARTISTIC(1)



<b>NAME</b>
       perlartistic - the Perl Artistic License

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
        You can refer to this document in Pod via "L&lt;perlartistic&gt;"
        Or you can see this document by entering "perldoc perlartistic"

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       This is <b>"The</b> <b>Artistic</b> <b>License"</b>. It's here so that modules, programs, etc., that want to declare this
       as their distribution license, can link to it.

       It is also one of the two licenses Perl allows itself to be redistributed and/or modified; for the
       other one, the GNU General Public License, see the perlgpl.

<b>The</b> <b>"Artistic</b> <b>License"</b>
       <b>Preamble</b>

       The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that
       the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the pack-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">age,&nbsp;package,</font>
       age, while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">less&nbsp;more-orless</font>
       less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.

       <b>Definitions</b>


       "Package"
           refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that
           collection of files created through textual modification.

       "Standard Version"
           refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the
           wishes of the Copyright Holder as specified below.

       "Copyright Holder"
           is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.

       "You"
           is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package.

       "Reasonable copying fee"
           is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people
           involved, and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only
           to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)

       "Freely Available"
           means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling
           the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions
           they received it.

       <b>Conditions</b>


       1.  You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this
           Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices
           and associated disclaimers.

       2.  You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain
           or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the
           Standard Version.

       3.  You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a promi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nent&nbsp;prominent</font>
           nent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that
           you do at least ONE of the following:

           a)  place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such
               as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifica-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tions&nbsp;modifications</font>
               tions on a major archive site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to
               include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

           b)  use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

           c)  rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard executables,
               which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard exe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cutable&nbsp;executable</font>
               cutable that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

           d)  make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

       4.  You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that
           you do at least ONE of the following:

           a)  distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together with instruc-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tions&nbsp;instructions</font>
               tions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.

           b)  accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cations.&nbsp;modifications.</font>
               cations.

           c)  give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly document the differences in
               manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Ver-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion.&nbsp;Version.</font>
               sion.

           d)  make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

       5.  You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package.  You may charge any
           fee you choose for support of this Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.
           However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs
           as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not adver-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tise&nbsp;advertise</font>
           tise this Package as a product of your own.  You may embed this Package's interpreter within an
           executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere form of aggregation, provided
           that the complete Standard Version of the interpreter is so embedded.

       6.  The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of
           this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever
           generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.  If such
           scripts or library files are aggregated with this Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec"
           methods of producing a binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall neither
           be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it fall under the restrictions of Para-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">graphs&nbsp;Paragraphs</font>
           graphs 3 and 4, provided that you do not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version
           of this Package.

       7.  C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other languages) supplied by you and linked
           into this Package in order to emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this
           Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the equivalent of input as in Para-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">graph&nbsp;Paragraph</font>
           graph 6, provided these subroutines do not change the language in any way that would cause it to
           fail the regression tests for the language.

       8.  Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always permitted provided that the
           use of this Package is embedded; that is, when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's
           interfaces visible to the end user of the commercial distribution.  Such use shall not be con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">strued&nbsp;construed</font>
           strued as a distribution of this Package.

       9.  The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from this
           software without specific prior written permission.

       10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITH-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">OUT&nbsp;WITHOUT</font>
           OUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

       The End
