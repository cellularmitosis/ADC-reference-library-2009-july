When compared only against server-side dynamic elements, client-side components have these advantages:<p></a><ul><a name="2109"><p><li>Client-side components allow you to update UI elements without reloading the page. </a><a name="2118"><p>WebObjects applications are event driven. The events that trigger actions are HTTP requests. A WebObjects application receives an &#32;HTTP request from the client, processes it, and returns a response page. That is, the only communication that takes place between the client and the WebObjects application on the server results in a page being redrawn (or a new page being generated). <p></a><a name="2126"><p>When client-side components are used, an HTTP request can result in either the re-synchronization of state or the return of a &#32;new page. Thus, state can be synchronized without the page having to be redrawn (see <a href="DynamicElements6.html#3333">Figure 13</a>). <p></a><a name="3331"><p><img src="DynamicElements4.gif"><p></a><a name="3333"><p>Figure 13.	  Client-Side Java Components<p></a><a name="3859"><p><li>Client-side components are more flexible than server-side dynamic &#32;elements.</a><a name="3860"><p>Server-side dynamic elements always generate HTML, which means that they are limited to what HTML looks like and what HTML can do. You can create client-side components that look like just about any imaginable control: a dynamic calendar, a spreadsheet, or a graphing tool. <p></a></ul><a name="3855">One disadvantage to using client-side components is that they require a &#32;Java-enabled browser. Thus, you can use client-side components only when you can be certain all of your users will have Java-enabled browsers. If you can't guarantee this, you should limit your application to server-side dynamic elements. <p></a><P> <a href="DynElTOC.html"><IMG SRC="ArrowUp.gif">Table of Contents</a> <a href="DynamicElements7.html"><IMG SRC="ArrowRight.gif">Next Section</a><P></body></html>
