QTVR Flattener Read MeQuickTime VR (Virtual Reality) is a compelling technology for deliveringinteractive object and panorama movies.  QTVR has always been well-suited for webdelivery because of its compact size.  But over low-bandwidth connections,large movies take time to download.  A Streaming VR movie compensates for slow-bandwidth connections in one of two ways:  either by first rapidly downloadinga low-resolution preview of the VR movie, or by resequencingthe data so that the panorama data loads in and displays a tile at a time.  Eitherway, users on slow-bandwidth connections are quickly presented with data they canuse to determine if they want to continue the download. This flattening is accomplished using the QTVR Flattener extension. Currently (as of QuickTime version 4.1.2) this extension is not automatically installed when you install QuickTime; it is likely however that it will be included in some future version.Your application can call the QTVR Flattener directly. That's what is sample code snippetillustrates.Enjoy,QuickTime Team
