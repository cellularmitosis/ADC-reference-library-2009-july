<HTML><HEAD>   <TITLE>Read Me</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><H1>Read Me About OTClassicContext</H1><P>1.0b4</P><P>OTClassicContext provides the glue necessary to call the Carbon"InContext" Open Transport APIs in an InterfaceLib environment. Thegoal is to allow you to build a Carbon and non-Carbon application (orextension) from the same source base without conditionalcompilation.</P><P>Open Transport tracks assets, like memory and endpoints, in a veryByzantine fashion. See DTS Technote 1173 <A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn/tn1173.html">UnderstandingOpen Transport Asset Tracking</A> for a full description. To makethis clearer Carbon introduced a new set of Open Transport APIs, withthe suffix "InContext", which explicitly describe the context towhich assets are assigned. For example, in Carbon you must call<CODE>OTOpenEndpointInContext</CODE> rather than<CODE>OTOpenEndpoint</CODE> so that the system knows which clientowns the endpoint.</P><P>The main problem with this technique is that it is hard tomaintain a source base that compiles for both Carbon and non-Carbonapplications and extensions. This glue is a way around thatproblem.</P><P>The glue in this sample supports PowerPC code compiled for OT1.1.1 and above. See the <A HREF="#Caveats">Caveats</A> section foran explanation of these restrictions.</P><P>A future version of the OT SDK will contain a final release ofthis glue.</P><H2>Packing List</H2><P>The sample contains the following items:</P><UL>   <LI>ReadMeOTClassicContext.html -- This document.</LI>      <LI>OTClassicContext.h -- Most of the important "InContext" APIs   are defined in the standard Open Transport headers. However, some   APIs that logically operate within a context are not defined in   the Open Transport headers because they are not part of Carbon. If   you're building non-Carbon code you may need access to these APIs,   so they are defined in this file.</LI>      <LI>OpenTransportClientPPC.o -- The OT classic context glue   itself. Use this version for your production builds.</LI>      <LI>OpenTransportClientPPC.debug.o -- The OT classic context glue   itself. Use this version for your debug builds.</LI>      <LI>OTClassicContextTest -- A simple program that was used to test   the glue.</LI></UL><H2>Using the Glue</H2><P>To use this glue within your project, take the followingsteps.</P><OL>   <LI>Remove any Open Transport "PPC.o" files from your project.   This includes "OpenTransportAppPPC.o", "OpenTransportExtnPPC.o",   "OpenTptATalkPPC.o", "OpenTptInetPPC.o", "OpenTptUtilsAppPPC.o",   and "OpenTptUtilsExtnPPC.o", and their debug variants.</LI>      <LI>Add the "OpenTransportClientPPC.o" file to your production   build and "OpenTransportClientPPC.debug.o" to your debug   build.</LI>      <LI>Convert your source code to use the "InContext" versions of   the Open Transport routines that create assets. See the Carbon   documentation for details on these routines. If you use routines   that create assets that aren't part of Carbon, for example   <CODE>OTStreamOpen</CODE>, you must include "OTClassicContext.h"   in your source.</LI></OL><H2><A NAME=Caveats></A>Caveats</H2><P>You should be aware of the caveats associated with this glue.</P><UL>   <LI>This glue only works for PowerPC binaries. Making this work   for 68K binaries would be tricky because OT uses ASLM linkage for   68K code.</LI>      <LI>This glue only works for OT 1.1.1 and above. Earlier version   of OT used a slightly different linkage scheme for client code.   This should not be a limitation unless you were previously linking   with "OpenTptClientCompat11PPC.o".</LI>      <LI>This library does not let you initialize just the Open   Transport utilities. There is no equivalent of calling   <CODE>InitOpenTransportUtilities</CODE>, a call which is much   misunderstood. What it does is create a client connection to Open   Transport without loading the OT kernel. This reduced memory usage   in old machines where certain OT components might want to use OT   utilities without loading the entire OT kernel into memory. On   modern systems the OT kernel is always loaded (either because OT   doesn't unload the kernel any more, or because the kernel was   loaded at system startup by one of many potential network   clients), so this restriction should not cause any problems.</LI>      <LI>If you connect to Open Transport using this glue you no longer   have access to ASLM functions. In general this is A Good Thing   (tm).</LI>      <LI>The glue does not support the UNIX-style OT entry points (for   example, <CODE>t_open</CODE>). In general this is a A Good Thing   (tm), although retrofitting that capability would be relatively   easy.</LI>      <LI>The fact that a routine is declared "InContext" does not   necessarily guarantee that OT tracks the asset created by that   routine. For example, OT on traditional Mac OS does not currently   track deferred tasks, timer tasks, system tasks, or raw streams.   &#91;As an aside, the OT compatibility library in Mac OS X does   track these assets.&#93; The "InContext" routine just provides a   way for a future version of OT to track those assets.</LI>      <LI>Certain OT utility routines, listed below, are implemented in   the statically linked OT libraries. If you link with this glue you   will not be able to use those routines. Fortunately, most of these   routines are sufficiently obscure that this does not present a   serious problem.<TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH=300>      <TR>         <TD>            <PRE>OTLoadCFMLibrary</PRE>         </TD>      </TR>      <TR>         <TD>            <PRE>OTGetCFMSymbol</PRE>         </TD>      </TR>      <TR>         <TD>            <PRE>OTGetCFMPointer</PRE>         </TD>      </TR>      <TR>         <TD>            <PRE>OTFindCFMLibraries</PRE>         </TD>      </TR>      <TR>         <TD>            <PRE>OTReleaseCFMConnection</PRE>         </TD>      </TR>      <TR>         <TD>            <PRE>OTHoldThisCFMLibrary</PRE>         </TD>      </TR>      <TR>         <TD>            <PRE>OTUnholdThisCFMLibrary</PRE>         </TD>      </TR>      <TR>         <TD>            <PRE>OTLoadASLMLibrary</PRE>         </TD>      </TR>      <TR>         <TD>            <PRE>OTUnloadASLMLibrary</PRE>         </TD>      </TR>      <TR>         <TD>            <PRE>InitASLMForCFMLibrary</PRE>         </TD>      </TR>      <TR>         <TD>            <PRE>TeardownASLMForCFMLibrary</PRE>         </TD>      </TR>      <TR>         <TD>            <PRE>TrapAvailable</PRE>         </TD>      </TR>      <TR>         <TD>            <P>other miscellaneous C and C++ runtime routines</P>         </TD>      </TR>   </TABLE>   </LI></UL><H2>Credits and Version History</H2><P>If you find any problems with this sample, mail&lt;DTS@apple.com&gt; and I'll try to fix them up.</P><P>1.0b1 (Sep 2000) was distributed to a small number of Appleengineers for review purposes.</P><P>1.0b2 (Oct 2000) was distributed to a small number of Appleengineers for review purposes.
