/*	File:		Optimization.h		Description:The Optimization changes to MoreFiles source and header files, along with				this file and OptimizationEnd.h, let you optimize the code produced				by MoreFiles in several ways.				1 -- MoreFiles contains extra code so that many routines can run under				Mac OS systems back to System 6. If your program requires a specific				version of Mac OS and your program checks for that version before				calling MoreFiles routines, then you can remove a lot of compatibility				code by defining one of the following to 1:					__MACOSSEVENFIVEONEORLATER	// assume Mac OS 7.5.1 or later				__MACOSSEVENFIVEORLATER		// assume Mac OS 7.5 or later				__MACOSSEVENORLATER			// assume Mac OS 7.0 or later				By default, all compatibility code is ON.					2 -- You may disable Pascal calling conventions in all MoreFiles routines				except for system callbacks that require Pascal calling conventions.				This will make C programs both smaller and faster.				Just define __WANTPASCALELIMINATION to be 1 to turn this optimization on				when building MoreFiles for use from C programs (you'll need to keep				Pascal calling conventions when linking MoreFiles routines with Pascal				programs).					3 -- If Metrowerks compiler is used, "#pragma internal on" may help produce				better code. However, this option can also cause problems if you're				trying to build MoreFiles as a shared library, so it is by default not used.				Just define __USEPRAGMAINTERNAL to be 1 to turn this optimization on.	Author:		FO	Copyright: 	Copyright: © 1992-1999 by Apple Computer, Inc.				all rights reserved.		Disclaimer:	You may incorporate this sample code into your applications without				restriction, though the sample code has been provided "AS IS" and the				responsibility for its operation is 100% yours.
