<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001067-CH273-SW5" title="Drawing Technologies"></a><h2>Drawing Technologies</h2><p>Mac OS X includes numerous technologies for rendering 2D and 3D content and for animating that content dynamically at runtime.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001067-CH273-BBCEADBC" title="Quartz"></a><h3>Quartz</h3><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001067-CH273-DontLinkElementID_277"></a><p>Quartz is at the heart of the Mac OS X graphics and windowing environment. Quartz provides rendering support for 2D content and combines a rich imaging model with on-the-fly rendering, compositing, and anti-aliasing of content. It also implements the windowing system for Mac OS X and provides low-level services such as event routing and cursor management.</p><p>Quartz comprises both a client API (Quartz 2D) and a window server (Quartz Compositor). The client API provides commands for managing the graphics context and for drawing primitive shapes, images, text, and other content. The window server manages the display and device driver environment and provides essential services to clients, including basic window management, event routing, and cursor management behaviors.  </p><p>The Quartz 2D client API is implemented as part of the Application Services umbrella framework (<code>ApplicationServices.framework</code>), which is what you include in your projects when you want to use Quartz. This umbrella framework includes the Core Graphics framework<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001067-CH273-DontLinkElementID_278"></a> (<code>CoreGraphics.framework</code>), which defines the Quartz 2D interfaces, types, and constants you use in your applications.</p><p>The Quartz Services<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001067-CH273-DontLinkElementID_279"></a> API (which is also part of the Core Graphics framework) provides direct access to some low-level features of the window server. You can use this API to get information about the currently connected display hardware, capture a display for exclusive use, or adjust display attributes, such as its resolution, pixel depth, and refresh rate. Quartz Services also provides some support for operating a Mac OS X system remotely.</p><p>For information about the Quartz 2D API, see <em><a href="../../../../GraphicsImaging/Conceptual/drawingwithquartz2d/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001066" target="_top">Quartz 2D Programming Guide</a></em>. For information about the Quartz Services API, see <em><a href="../../../../GraphicsImaging/Conceptual/QuartzDisplayServicesConceptual/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004316" target="_top">Quartz Display Services Programming Topics</a></em>. </p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001067-CH273-TPXREF176" title="Digital Paper Metaphor"></a><h4>Digital Paper Metaphor</h4><p>The Quartz imaging architecture is based on a digital paper<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001067-CH273-DontLinkElementID_280"></a> metaphor. In this case, the digital paper is <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001067-CH273-DontLinkElementID_281"></a>PDF, which is also the internal model used by Quartz to store rendered content. Content stored in this medium has a very high fidelity and can be reproduced on many different types of devices, including displays, printers, and fax machines. This content can also be written to a PDF file and viewed by any number of applications that display the PDF format. </p><p>The PDF model gives application developers much more control over the final appearance of their content. PDF takes into account the application’s choice of color space, fonts, image compression, and resolution. Vector artwork can be scaled and manipulated during rendering to implement unique effects, such as those that occur when the system transitions between users with the fast user switching feature. </p><p>Mac OS X also takes advantage of the flexibility of PDF in implementing some system features. For example, in addition to printing, the standard printing dialogs offer options to save a document as PDF, preview the document before printing, or transmit the document using a fax machine. The PDF used for all of these operations comes from the same source: the pages formatted for printing by the application’s rendering code. The only difference is the device to which that content is sent. </p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001067-CH273-TPXREF158" title="Quartz 2D Features"></a><h4>Quartz 2D Features</h4><p>Quartz 2D provides many important features to user applications, including the following:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>High-quality rendering on the screen </p></li><li class="li"><p>Resolution independent<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001067-CH273-DontLinkElementID_282"></a> UI support</p></li><li class="li"><p>Anti-aliasing<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001067-CH273-DontLinkElementID_283"></a> for all graphics and text</p></li><li class="li"><p>Support for adding transparency<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001067-CH273-DontLinkElementID_284"></a> information to windows</p></li><li class="li"><p>Internal compression of data</p></li><li class="li"><p>A consistent feature set for all printers </p></li><li class="li"><p>Automatic PDF generation and support for printing, faxing, and saving as PDF</p></li><li class="li"><p>Color management through ColorSync</p></li></ul><p><span class="content_text">Table 3-1</span> describes some of technical specifications for Quartz.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001067-CH273-BBCCCHAB" title="Table 3-1Quartz technical specifications "></a><div class="tableholder"><table class="graybox" border = "0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><caption class="tablecaption"><strong>Table 3-1&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Quartz technical specifications </caption><tr><td  scope="row"><p>Bit depth</p></td><td ><p>A minimum bit depth of 16 bits for typical users.

It manages the displays available on the user’s system, interacting with the necessary device drivers. It also provides window management, event-routing, and cursor management behaviors. </p><p>In addition to window management<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001067-CH273-DontLinkElementID_288"></a>, Quartz Compositor handles the compositing of all visible content on the user’s desktop. It supports transparency effects through the use of alpha channel information, which makes it possible to display drop shadows, cutouts, and other effects that add a more realistic and dimensional texture to the windows. </p><p>The performance of Quartz Compositor remains consistently high because of several factors. To improve window redrawing performance, Quartz Compositor supports buffered windows and the layered compositing of windows and window content. Thus, windows that are hidden behind opaque content are never composited. Quartz Compositor also incorporates Quartz Extreme<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001067-CH273-DontLinkElementID_289"></a>, which speeds up rendering calls by handing them off to graphics hardware whenever possible. </p><p><span class="content_text">Figure 3-1</span> shows the high-level relationships between Quartz Compositor and the rendering technologies available on Mac OS X. QuickTime and OpenGL have fewer dependencies on Quartz Compositor because they implement their own versions of certain windowing capabilities. <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001067-CH273-DontLinkElementID_290"></a></p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001067-CH273-BCIIEAGD" title="Figure 3-1Quartz Compositor and the rendering APIs in Mac OS X"></a><p><strong>Figure 3-1&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Quartz Compositor and the rendering APIs in Mac OS X</p><img src = "../art/graphicswindowing.jpg" alt = "Quartz Compositor and the rendering APIs in Mac OS X" ></div><br/><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001067-CH273-SW6" title="Cocoa Drawing"></a><h3>Cocoa Drawing</h3><p>The Cocoa application environment provides object-oriented wrappers for many of the features found in Quartz. Cocoa provides support for drawing primitive shapes such as lines, rectangles, ovals, arcs, and Bezier paths. It supports drawing in both standard and custom color spaces and it supports content manipulations using graphics transforms. Because it is built on top of Quartz, drawing calls made from Cocoa are composited along with all other Quartz 2D content. You can even mix Quartz drawing calls (and drawing calls from other system graphics technologies) with Cocoa calls in your code if you wish.</p><p>For more information on how to draw using Cocoa, see <em><a href="../../../../Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaDrawingGuide/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003290" target="_top">Cocoa Drawing Guide</a></em>.  </p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001067-CH273-SW8" title="OpenGL"></a><h3>OpenGL</h3><p>OpenGL<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001067-CH273-DontLinkElementID_291"></a> is an industry-wide standard for developing portable three-dimensional (3D) graphics applications. It is specifically designed for games, animation, CAD/CAM, medical imaging, and other applications that need a rich, robust framework for visualizing shapes in two and three dimensions. The OpenGL API is one of the most widely adopted graphics API standards, which makes code written for OpenGL portable and consistent across platforms. The OpenGL framework (<code>OpenGL.framework</code>) in Mac OS X includes a highly optimized implementation of the OpenGL libraries that provides high-quality graphics at a consistently high level of performance. </p><p>OpenGL offers a broad and powerful set of imaging functions, including texture mapping, hidden surface removal, alpha blending (transparency), anti-aliasing, pixel operations, viewing and modeling transformations, atmospheric effects (fog, smoke, and haze), and other special effects. Each OpenGL command directs a drawing action or causes a special effect, and developers can create lists of these commands for repetitive effects. Although OpenGL is largely independent of the windowing characteristics of each operating system, the standard defines special glue routines to enable OpenGL to work in an operating system’s windowing environment. The Mac OS X implementation of OpenGL implements these glue routines to enable operation with the Quartz Compositor.</p><p>In Mac OS X v10.5 and later, OpenGL supports the ability to use multiple threads to process graphics data. OpenGL also supports pixel buffer objects, color managed texture images in the sRGB color space, support for 64-bit addressing, and improvements in the shader programming API. You can also attach an AGL context to <code>WindowRef</code> and <code>HIView</code> objects and thereby avoid using QuickDraw ports. </p><p>For information about using OpenGL in Mac OS X, see <em><a href="../../../../GraphicsImaging/Conceptual/OpenGL-MacProgGuide/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001987" target="_top">OpenGL Programming Guide for Mac OS X</a></em>. </p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001067-CH273-SW7" title="Core Animation"></a><h3>Core Animation</h3><p>Introduced in Mac OS X v10.5, Core Animation is a set of Objective-C classes for doing sophisticated 2D rendering and animation. Using Core Animation, you can create everything from basic window content to Front Row–style user interfaces, and achieve respectable animation performance, without having to tune your code using OpenGL or other low-level drawing routines. This performance is achieved using server-side content caching, which restricts the compositing operations performed by the server to only those parts of a view or window whose contents actually changed.  </p><p>At the heart of the Core Animation programming model are layer objects, which are similar in many ways to Cocoa views. Like views, you can arrange layers in hierarchies, change their size and position, and tell them to draw themselves. Unlike views, layers do not support event-handling, accessibility, or drag and drop. You can also manipulate the layout of layers in more ways than traditional Cocoa views. In addition to positioning layers using a layout manager, you can apply 3D transforms to layers to rotate, scale, skew, or translate them in relation to their parent layer. </p><p>Layer content can be animated implicitly or explicitly depending on the actions you take. Modifying specific properties of a layer, such as its geometry, visual attributes, or children, typically triggers an implicit animation to transition from the old state to the new state of the property. For example, adding a child layer triggers an animation that causes the child layer to fade gradually into view. You can also trigger animations explicitly in a layer by modifying its transformation matrix. </p><p>You can manipulate layers independent of, or in conjunction with, the views and windows of your application. Both Cocoa and Carbon applications can take advantage of the Core Animation’s integration with the <code>NSView</code> class to add animation effects to windows. Layers can also support the following types of content: </p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Quartz Composer compositions</p></li><li class="li"><p>OpenGL content</p></li><li class="li"><p>Core Image filter effects</p></li><li class="li"><p>Quartz and Cocoa drawing content</p></li><li class="li"><p>QuickTime playback and capture</p></li></ul><p>The Core Animation features are part of the Quartz Core framework (<code>QuartzCore.framework</code>). For information about Core Animation, see <em><a href="../../../../GraphicsImaging/Conceptual/Animation_Overview/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004952" target="_top">Animation Overview</a></em>.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001067-CH273-SW4" title="Core Image"></a><h3>Core Image</h3><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001067-CH273-DontLinkElementID_292"></a><p>Introduced in Mac OS X version 10.4, Core Image extends the basic graphics capabilities of the system to provide a framework for implementing complex visual behaviors in your application. Core Image uses GPU-based acceleration and 32-bit floating-point support to provide fast image processing and pixel-level accurate content. The plug-in based architecture lets you expand the capabilities of Core Image through the creation of image units, which implement the desired visual effects.</p><p>Core Image includes built-in image units that allow you to:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Crop images<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001067-CH273-DontLinkElementID_293"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001067-CH273-DontLinkElementID_294"></a></p></li><li class="li"><p>Correct color, including perform white-point adjustments</p></li><li class="li"><p>Apply color effects, such as sepia tone</p></li><li class="li"><p>Blur or sharpen images</p></li><li class="li"><p>Composite images</p></li><li class="li"><p>Warp the geometry of an image by applying an affine transform or a displacement effect</p></li><li class="li"><p>Generate color, checkerboard patterns, Gaussian gradients, and other pattern images</p></li><li class="li"><p>Add transition effects to images or video</p></li><li class="li"><p>Provide real-time control, such as color adjustment and support for sports, vivid, and other video modes</p></li><li class="li"><p>Apply linear lighting effects, such as spotlight effects</p></li></ul><p>You define custom image units using the classes of the Core Image framework. You can use both the built-in and custom image units in your application to implement special effects and perform other types of image manipulations. Image units take full advantage of hardware vector units, Quartz, OpenGL, and QuickTime to optimize the processing of video and image data. Rasterization of the data is ultimately handled by OpenGL, which takes advantage of graphics hardware acceleration whenever it is available. </p><p>Core Image is part of the Quartz Core framework (<code>QuartzCore.framework</code><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001067-CH273-DontLinkElementID_295"></a>).

Because it is a legacy technology, QuickDraw should not be used for any active development. Instead, you should use Quartz. </p><p>If your code currently uses QuickDraw, you should begin converting it to Quartz 2D as soon as possible. The QuickDraw API includes features to make transitioning your code easier. For example, QuickDraw includes interfaces for getting a Quartz graphics context from a <code>GrafPort</code> structure. You can use these interfaces to transition your QuickDraw code in stages without radically impacting the stability of your builds. </p><div class="importantbox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001067-CH273-DontLinkElementID_2" title="Important:"></a><p><strong>Important:</strong>&nbsp;QuickDraw is deprecated in Mac OS X v10.5 and later.

Based on Core Text, the Cocoa text<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001067-CH273-DontLinkElementID_297"></a> system provides a multilayered approach to implementing a full-featured text system using Objective-C. This layered approach lets you customize portions of the system that are relevant to your needs while using the default behavior for the rest of the system. You can use Cocoa Text to display small or large amounts of text and can customize the default layout manager classes to support custom layout. </p><p>Although part of Cocoa, the Cocoa text system can also be used in Carbon-based applications. If your Carbon application displays moderate amounts of read-only or editable text, you can use <code>HIView</code> wrappers for the <code>NSString</code>, <code>NSTextField</code>, and <code>NSTextView</code> classes to implement that support. Using wrappers is much easier than trying to implement the same behavior using lower-level APIs, such as Core Text, ATSUI, or MLTE.

Core Text also provides optimized configurations for common scenarios, saving setup time in your application. Designed for performance, Core Text is up to twice as fast as ATSUI (see <span class="content_text"><a href="GraphicsTechnologies.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001067-CH273-TPXREF182">“Apple Type Services for Unicode Imaging”</a></span>), the text-handling technology that it replaces. </p><p>The Core Text font API is complementary to the Core Text layout engine. Core Text font technology is designed to handle Unicode fonts natively and comprehensively, unifying disparate Mac OS X font facilities so that developers can do everything they need to do without resorting to other APIs. </p><p>Carbon and Cocoa developers who want a high-level text layout API should consider using the Cocoa text system and the supporting Cocoa text views. Unless you need low-level access to the layout manager routines, the Cocoa text system should provide most of the features and performance you need. If you need a lower-level API for drawing any kind of text into a <code>CGContext</code>, then you should consider using the Core Text API.</p><p>For more information about Core Text, see <em><a href="../../../../Carbon/Conceptual/CoreText_Programming/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40005533" target="_top">Core Text Programming Guide</a></em> and <em><a href="../../../../Carbon/Reference/CoreText_Framework_Ref/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40005304" target="_top">Core Text Reference Collection</a></em>.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001067-CH273-SW11" title="Apple Type Services"></a><h3>Apple Type Services</h3><p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001067-CH273-DontLinkElementID_298"></a>Apple Type Services (ATS<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001067-CH273-DontLinkElementID_299"></a>) is an engine for the systemwide management, layout, and rendering of fonts.

In the case of repetitive tasks operating on large data sets, Mac OS X uses the vector-oriented extensions provided by the processor. (Mac OS X currently supports the PowerPC AltiVec extensions and the Intel x86 SSE extensions.) Hardware-based vector units boost the performance of any application that exploits data parallelism, such as those that perform 3D graphic imaging, image processing, video processing, audio compression, and software-based cell telephony. Quartz and QuickTime incorporate vector capabilities, thus any application using these APIs can tap into this hardware acceleration without making any changes. </p><p>In Mac OS X v10.3 and later, you can use the Accelerate framework<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001067-CH273-DontLinkElementID_344"></a> (<code>Accelerate.framework</code>) to accelerate complex operations using the available vector unit. This framework supports both the PowerPC AltiVec and Intel x86 SSE extensions internally but provides a single interface for you to use in your application. The advantage of using this framework is that you can simply write your code once without having to code different execution paths for each hardware platform. The functions of this framework are highly tuned for the specific platforms supported by Mac OS X and in many cases can offer better performance than hand-rolled code. </p><p>The Accelerate framework is an umbrella framework that wraps the vecLib and vImage frameworks into a single package. The vecLib framework contains vector-optimized routines for doing digital signal processing, linear algebra, and other computationally expensive mathematical operations. (The vecLib framework is also a top-level framework for applications running on versions of Mac OS X up to and including version 10.5.) The vImage framework supports the visual realm, adding routines for morphing, alpha-channel processing, and other image-buffer manipulations. </p><p>For information on how to use the components of the Accelerate framework, see <em><a href="../../../../Performance/Conceptual/vImage/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001001" target="_top">vImage Programming Guide</a></em>, <em><a href="../../../../GraphicsImaging/Reference/vImageRefCollecton/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40005536" target="_top">vImage Reference Collection</a></em>, and <em><a href="../../../../Performance/Conceptual/vecLib/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002498" target="_top">vecLib Framework Reference</a></em>.
