Typically this// is of the form:////		GET <x> HTTP/1.0\0x13\0x10\0x13\0x10//// where <x> is the URL path.  destFileRefNum is the file// reference number to which the results of the HTTP command// are written.  This routine does not parse the returned HTTP// header in any way.  The entire incoming stream goes into// the file verbatim.//// For example, if you were asked to download a URL like:////		http://devworld.apple.com/dev/technotes.shtml//// you would set://// 		o hostName to "devworld.apple.com:80" (80 is the//		  default port for HTTP.//		o httpCommand to "GET /dev/technotes.shtml HTTP/1.0\0x13\0x10\0x13\0x10"
