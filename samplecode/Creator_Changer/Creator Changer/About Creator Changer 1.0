ðAbout Creator Changer 1.0November 6, 1998About Creator Changer 1.0This drag and drop Macintosh application contains many examples of various technologies presented in MRJ EA3 and later.When files and/or folders are dropped on this application, it will recursively scan folder hierarchies and change the creator of all files of a certain type to a predetermined value, using the MRJToolkit APIs.Taking advantage of AppleScript for Java, this application provides the potential to script its functionality.  In its scriptability it presents the option to specify search file type and target creator information for jobs spawed from AppleScript. Each drop, or AppleScript command spawns a new job, with a new progress bar, etc. During its progress it displays and updates a progress bar for each batch, and allows user interaction.  This is a polished Macintosh application, demonstrating that good looking, speedy, and useful applications can be written for the Macintosh in Java.  _______________________________© 1995-1998 Apple Computer.
