// MOKit is a collection of useful and general objects.  Permission is

// including the right to sell these objects as part of a LIBRARY or as
// SOURCE CODE.  In plain English, I wish to retain rights to these
// objects as objects, but allow the use of the objects as pieces in a
// fully functional program.  NO WARRANTY is expressed or implied.  The author
// will under no circumstances be held responsible for ANY consequences to
// you or others from the use of these objects.  Since you don't have to pay for
// them, and full source is provided, I think this is perfectly fair.
