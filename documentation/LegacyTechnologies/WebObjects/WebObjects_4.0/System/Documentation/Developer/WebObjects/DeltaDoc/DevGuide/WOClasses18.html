<h2> Component Actions vs. Direct Actions</h2>
</a><a name="9351">
<a href="WOClasses18.html#8923">Figure &#32;28</a> shows the sequence of events in processing a component action request and compares it to the sequence of events for processing the direct action. Note that in both component actions and direct actions, the &#32;bulk of the time is spent in the generate response phase, in which the &#32;component performs <strong>appendToResponse:inContext:</strong> and sends each &#32;of its dynamic elements <strong>appendToResponse:inContext:</strong>. This &#32;step &#32;is &#32;the same in component actions and direct actions.

<p>Figure 28.	  Comparison of Component Action and Direct Action request processing.<p>
</a><a name="9485">
The major differences between component actions and direct actions are:<p>
</a><ul><a name="8160">
<p><li>Component actions require state, primarily so that they can determine which component should perform the action. 
</a><a name="8151">
<p>Direct actions are stateless actions. They do not require any state to be preserved between requests. For this reason, direct actions do not create session objects by default. WODirectAction defines a method that does create a session, so direct actions can create a session and store state if necessary.<p>
</a><a name="8171">
<p><li>Component actions extract input values from the request without requiring you to write any code to do so.
</a><a name="8172">
<p>Direct actions do not automatically extract input values from the request. If there are input values, the HTML element places them in the HTTP request, and the action method must explicitly request them from the WORequest object.<p>
</a><a name="8173">
<p><li>Component actions have dynamic, unpredictable URLs because the URL contains the session ID and context ID, which are unique to each session.
</a><a name="9165">
<p>Direct actions have static, predictable URLs. Regardless of which session is performing the action, the URL for the action always refers to a specific action-one that was determined when the current page was generated (not when the request is handled). <p>
</a><a name="8175">
<p>Because their URLs are static and because they do not require state, direct action requests can be bookmarked by your application's users and can be revisited at any time. <p>
</a></ul>
