<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
     These routines provide an interface to the Apple System Log facility.  They are intended to be a
     replacement for the <a href="syslog.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/syslog">syslog(3)</a> API, which will continue to be supported for backwards compatibility.
     The new API allows client applications to create flexible, structured messages and send them to the
     <b>syslogd</b> server, where they may undergo additional processing.  Messages received by the server are
     saved in a data store (subject to input filtering constraints).  This API permits clients to create
     queries and search the message data store for matching messages.

   <b>MESSAGES</b>
     At the core of this API is the aslmsg structure.  Although the structure is opaque and may not be
     directly manipulated, it contains a list of key/value pairs.  All keys and values are NULL-terminated C
     language character strings.  UTF-8 encoding may be used for non-ASCII characters.

     Message structures are generally used to send log messages, and are created thusly:

         aslmsg m = asl_new(ASL_TYPE_MSG);

     Another message type, ASL_TYPE_QUERY, is used to create queries when searching the data store.  Query
     type messages and searching are described in detail in the <u>SEARCHING</u> section below.  For the remainder
     of this section, the messages described will be of the ASL_TYPE_MSG variety.

     Each aslmsg contains a default set of keys and values that are associated with them.  These keys are
     listed in the asl.h header file.  They are:

         #define ASL_KEY_TIME      "Time"
         #define ASL_KEY_HOST      "Host"
         #define ASL_KEY_SENDER    "Sender"
         #define ASL_KEY_FACILITY  "Facility"
         #define ASL_KEY_PID       "PID"
         #define ASL_KEY_UID       "UID"
         #define ASL_KEY_GID       "GID"
         #define ASL_KEY_LEVEL     "Level"
         #define ASL_KEY_MSG       "Message"

     Many of these correspond to equivalent parts of messages described in the <a href="syslog.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/syslog">syslog(3)</a> API.  Values asso-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ciated&nbsp;associated</font>
     ciated with these message keys are assigned appropriate defaults.  The value for ASL_KEY_HOST is the
     local host name, the value associated with ASL_KEY_SENDER is the process name, the ASL_KEY_PID is the
     client's process ID number, and so on.

     Note the addition of the UID and GID keys.  The values for UID and GID are set in library code by the
     message sender.  The server will attempt to confirm the values, but no claim is made that these values
     cannot be maliciously overridden in an attempt to deceive a log message reader as to the identity of
     the sender of a message.  The contents of log messages must be regarded as insecure.

     The <a href="asl.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/asl">asl(3)</a> API does not require a process to choose a facility name.  The <b>syslogd</b> server will use a
     default value of ``user'' if a facility is not set.  However, a client may set a facility name as an
     argument in the <b>asl_open</b> call, or by setting a specific value for the ASL_KEY_FACILITY in a message:

         asl_set(m, ASL_KEY_FACILITY, "com.somename.greatservice");

     An application may choose any facility name at will.  Different facility names may be attached to dif-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ferent&nbsp;different</font>
     ferent messages, perhaps to distinguish different subsystems in log messages.  Developers are encour-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">aged&nbsp;encouraged</font>
     aged to adopt a ``Reverse ICANN'' naming convention to avoid conflicting facility names.

     Default values are set in the message for each of the keys listed above, except for ASL_KEY_MSG, which
     may be explicitly set at any time using the <b>asl_set</b> routine, or implicitly set at the time the message
     is sent using the <b>asl_log</b> or <b>asl_vlog</b> routines.  These two routines also have an integer-level parame-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ter&nbsp;parameter</font>
     ter for specifying the log priority.  The ASL_KEY_LEVEL value is set accordingly.  Finally, the value
     associated with ASL_KEY_TIME is set in the sending routine.

     Although it may appear that there is significant overhead required to send a log message using this
     API, the opposite is actually true.  A simple ``Hello World'' program requires only:

         #include &lt;asl.h&gt;
         ...
         asl_log(NULL, NULL, ASL_LEVEL_INFO, "Hello World!");

     Both <b>asl_log</b> and <b>asl_vlog</b> will provide the appropriate default values when passed a NULL aslmsg argu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment.&nbsp;argument.</font>
     ment.

     In this example, the aslclient argument is NULL.  This is sufficient for a single-threaded application,
     or for an application which only sends log messages from a single thread.  When logging from multiple
     threads, each thread must open a separate client handle using <b>asl_open</b>.  The client handle may then be
     closed when it is no longer required using <b>asl_close</b>.

     When an application requires additional keys and values to be associated with each log message, a sin-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">gle&nbsp;single</font>
     gle message structure may be allocated and set up as ``template'' message of sorts:

         aslmsg m = asl_new(ASL_TYPE_MSG);
         asl_set(m, ASL_KEY_FACILITY, "com.secrets.r.us");
         asl_set(m, "Clearance", "Top Secret");
         ...
         asl_log(NULL, m, ASL_LEVEL_NOTICE, "Message One");
         ...
         asl_log(NULL, m, ASL_LEVEL_ERR, "Message Two");

     The message structure will carry the values set for the ``Facility'' and ``Clearance'' keys so that
     they are used in each call to <b>asl_log</b>, while the log level and the message text are taken from the
     calling parameters.

     The <u>format</u> argument to <b>asl_log</b> and <b>asl_vlog</b> is identical to <a href="printf.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/printf">printf(3)</a>, and may include `%m', which is
     replaced by the current error message (as denoted by the global variable <u>errno</u>; see <a href="strerror.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/strerror">strerror(3)</a>.)

     Key/value pairs may be removed from a message structure with <b>asl_unset</b>.  A message may be freed using
     <b>asl_free</b>.

     The <b>asl_send</b> routine is used by <b>asl_log</b> and <b>asl_vlog</b> to transmit a message to the server.  This routine
     sets the value associated with ASL_KEY_TIME and sends the message.  It may be called directly if all of
     a message's key/value pairs have been created using <b>asl_set</b>.

   <b>SECURITY</b>
     Messages that are sent to the <b>syslogd</b> server may be saved in a message store.  The store may be
     searched using <b>asl_search</b>, as described below.  By default, all messages are readable by any user.
     However, some applications may wish to restrict read access for some messages.  To accomodate this, a
     client may set a value for the "ReadUID" and "ReadGID" keys.  These keys may be associated with a value
     containing an ASCII representation of a numeric UID or GID.  Only the root user (UID 0), the user with
     the given UID, or a member of the group with the given GID may fetch access-controlled messages from
     the database.

     Although the ASL system does not require a "Facility" key in a message, many processes specify a
     "Facility" value similar to the common usage of the BSD <b>syslog</b> API, although developers are encouraged
     to adopt facility names that make sense for their application.  A ``Reverse ICANN'' naming convention
     (e.g. "com.apple.system.syslog") should be adopted to avoid conflicting names.  The ASL system gener-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ally&nbsp;generally</font>
     ally allows any string to be used as a facility value, with one exception.  The value "com.apple.sys-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tem",&nbsp;"com.apple.system",</font>
     tem", or any string that has "com.apple.system" as a prefix, may only be used by processes running with
     the UID 0.  This allows system processes to log messages that can not be "spoofed" by user processes.
     Non-UID 0 client processes that specify "com.apple.system" as a facility, will be assigned the value
     "user" by the <b>syslogd</b> server.

   <b>CLIENT</b> <b>HANDLES</b>
     When logging is done from a single thread, a NULL value may be used in any of the routines that require
     an aslclient argument.  In this case, the library will open an internal client handle on behalf of the
     application.

     If multiple threads must do logging, or if client options are desired, then the application should call
     <b>asl_open</b> to create a client handle for each thread.  As a convenience, the <b>asl_open</b> routine may be
     given an ident argument, which becomes the default value for the ASL_KEY_SENDER key, and a facility
     argument, which becomes the value associated with the ASL_KEY_FACILITY key.

     Several options are available when creating a client handle.  They are:

     ASL_OPT_STDERR     adds stderr as an output file descriptor
     ASL_OPT_NO_DELAY   connects to the server immediately
     ASL_OPT_NO_REMOTE  disables remote-control filter adjustment

     See the FILTERING section below, and the <a href="../man1/syslog.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/syslog">syslog(1)</a> for additional details on filter controls.

     A client handle is closed and it's resources released using <b>asl_close</b>.  Note that if additional file
     descriptors were added to the handle, either using the ASL_OPT_STDERR option or afterwards with the
     <b>asl_add_log_file</b> routine, those file descriptors are not closed by <b>asl_close</b>.

   <b>LOGGING</b> <b>TO</b> <b>ADDITIONAL</b> <b>FILES</b>
     If a client handle is opened with the ASL_OPT_STDERR option to <b>asl_open</b>, a copy of each log message
     will be sent to stderr.  Additional output streams may be include using <b>asl_add_log_file</b>.

     Messages sent to stderr or other files are printed in the "standard" message format also used as a
     default format by the <a href="../man1/syslog.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/syslog">syslog(1)</a> command line utility.  The <a href="strvis.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/strvis">strvis(3)</a> encoding with the VIS_CSTYLE,
     VIS_TAB, and VIS_NL options is used to print the message.

     File descriptors may be removed from the list of outputs associated with a client handle with
     <b>asl_remove_log_file</b>.  This routine simply removes the file descriptor from the output list.  The file
     is not closed as a result.

     The ASL_OPT_STDERR option may not be unset after a client handle has been opened.

     In the present release of Mac OS X, a ``raw'' format is used to format messages that are sent to file
     descriptors that have been added to a client handle.  Each message is preceded by a 10-character field
     containing a message length.  The message length is padded with leading white space.  The length gives
     the string length of the remainder of the output string.  Following the length is a space character,
     and then the message.  The message is encoded as a set of key/value pairs enclosed in square brackets,
     which are themselves separated by a space character.  The key is separated from the value by space
     character.  Embedded closing square brackets are escaped by a backslash.  Embedded space characters in
     keys are escaped by a backslash; Embedded newlines are summarily turned into semicolons.  The output is
     terminated by a trailing newline and a NUL character.

   <b>SEARCHING</b>
     The <b>syslogd</b> server archives received messages in a data store that may be searched using the
     <b>asl_search</b>, <b>aslresponse_next</b>, and <b>aslresponse_free</b> routines.  A query message is created using:

         aslmsg q = asl_new(ASL_TYPE_QUERY);

     Search settings are made in the query using <b>asl_set_query</b>.  A search is performed on the data store
     with <b>asl_search</b>.  It returns an <u>aslresponse</u> structure.  The caller may then call <b>aslresponse_next</b> to
     iterate through matching messages.  The <u>aslresponse</u> structure may be freed with <b>aslresponse_free</b>.

     Like other messages, ASL_TYPE_QUERY messages contain keys and values.  They also associate an operation
     with each key and value.  The operation is used to decide if a message matches the query.  The simplest
     operation is ASL_QUERY_OP_EQUAL, which tests for equality.  For example, the following code snippet
     searches for messages with a Sender value equal to ``MyApp''.

         aslmsg m;
         aslresponse r;
         q = asl_new(ASL_TYPE_QUERY);
         asl_set_query(q, ASL_KEY_SENDER, "MyApp", ASL_QUERY_OP_EQUAL);
         r = asl_search(NULL, q);

     More complex searches may be performed using other query operations.

     ASL_QUERY_OP_EQUAL          value equality
     ASL_QUERY_OP_GREATER        value greater than
     ASL_QUERY_OP_GREATER_EQUAL  value greater than or equal to
     ASL_QUERY_OP_LESS           value less than
     ASL_QUERY_OP_LESS_EQUAL     value less than or equal to
     ASL_QUERY_OP_NOT_EQUAL      value not equal
     ASL_QUERY_OP_REGEX          regular expression search
     ASL_QUERY_OP_TRUE           always true - use to test for the existence of a key

     Regular expression search uses <a href="regex.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/regex">regex(3)</a> library.  Patterns are compiled using the REG_EXTENDED and
     REG_NOSUB options.

     Modifiers that change the behavior of these operations may also be specified by ORing the modifier
     value with the operation.  The modifiers are:

     ASL_QUERY_OP_CASEFOLD   string comparisons are case-folded
     ASL_QUERY_OP_PREFIX     match a leading substring
     ASL_QUERY_OP_SUFFIX     match a trailing substring
     ASL_QUERY_OP_SUBSTRING  match any substring
     ASL_QUERY_OP_NUMERIC    values are converted to integer using <b>atoi</b>

     The only modifier that is checked for ASL_QUERY_OP_REGEX search is ASL_QUERY_OP_CASEFOLD.  This causes
     the regular expression to be compiled with the REG_ICASE option.

     If a query message contains more than one set of key/value/operation triples, the result will be a log-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ical&nbsp;logical</font>
     ical AND.  For example, to find messages from ``MyApp'' with a priority level less than or equal to
     ``3'':

         aslmsg q;
         aslresponse r;
         q = asl_new(ASL_TYPE_QUERY);
         asl_set_query(q, ASL_KEY_SENDER, "MyApp", ASL_QUERY_OP_EQUAL);
         asl_set_query(q, ASL_KEY_LEVEL, "3",
                 ASL_QUERY_OP_LESS_EQUAL | ASL_QUERY_OP_NUMERIC);
         r = asl_search(NULL, q);

     After calling <b>asl_search</b> to get an <u>aslresponse</u> structure, use <b>aslresponse_next</b> to iterate through all
     matching messages.  To iterate through the keys and values in a message, use <b>asl_key</b> to iterate through
     the keys, then call <b>asl_get</b> to get the value associated with each key.

         aslmsg q, m;
         int i;
         const char *key, *val;

         ...
         r = asl_search(NULL, q);
         while (NULL != (m = <!-- a -->aslresponse_next(r)<!-- /a -->))
         {
             for (i = 0; (NULL != (key = asl_key(m, i))); i++)
             {
                 val = asl_get(m, key);
                 ...
             }
         }
         <!-- a -->aslresponse_free(r)<!-- /a -->;

   <b>FILTERING</b> <b>AND</b> <b>REMOTE</b> <b>CONTROL</b>
     Clients may set a filter mask value with <b>asl_set_filter</b>.  The mask specifies which messages should be
     sent to the <b>syslogd</b> daemon by specifying a yes/no setting for each priority level.  Clients typically
     set a filter mask to avoid sending relatively unimportant messages.  For example, Debug or Info prior-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ity&nbsp;priority</font>
     ity level messages are generally only useful for debugging operations.  By setting a filter mask, a
     process can improve performance by avoiding sending messages that are in most cases unnecessary.

     <b>asl_set_filter</b> <b>returns</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>filter,</b> <b>i.e.</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b>
     <b>routine</b> <b>was</b> <b>called.</b>

     As a convenience, the macros ASL_FILTER_MASK(level) and ASL_FILTER_MASK_UPTO(level) may be used to con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">struct&nbsp;construct</font>
     struct a bit mask corresponding to a given priority level, or corresponding to a bit mask for all pri-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ority&nbsp;priority</font>
     ority levels from ASL_LEVEL_EMERG to a given input level.

     The default filter mask is ASL_FILTER_MASK_UPTO(ASL_LEVEL_NOTICE).  This means that by default, and in
     the absence of remote-control changes (described below), ASL_LEVEL_DEBUG and ASL_LEVEL_INFO priority
     level messages are not sent to the server.

     Three different filters exist for each application.  The first is the filter mask set using
     <b>asl_set_filter</b> as described above.  The Apple System Log facility also manages a ``master'' filter
     mask.  The master filter mask usually has a value that indicates to the library that it is ``off'', and
     thus it has no effect.  However, the mask filter mask may be enabled by giving it a value using the
     <b>syslog</b> command, using the <b>-c</b> 0 option.  When the master filter mask has been set, it takes precedence
     over the client's filter mask.  The client's mask is unmodified, and will become active again if
     remote-control filtering is disabled.

     In addition to the master filter mask, The Apple System Log facility also manages a per-client remote-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">control&nbsp;remotecontrol</font>
     control filter mask.  Like the master filter mask, the per-client mask is usually ``off'', having no
     effect on a client.  If a per-client filter mask is set using the <b>syslog</b> command, using the <b>-c</b> <u>process</u>
     option, then it takes precedence over both the client's filter mask and the master filter mask.  As is
     the case with the master filter mask, a per-client mask ceases having any effect when if is disabled.

     The ASL_OPT_NO_REMOTE option to <b>asl_open</b> causes both the master and per-client remote-control masks to
     be ignored in the library.  In that case, only the client's own filter mask is used to determine which
     messages are sent to the server.  This may be useful for Applications that produce log messages that
     should never be filtered, due to security considerations.  Note that root (administrator) access is
     required to set or change the master filter mask, and that only root may change a per-client remote-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">control&nbsp;remotecontrol</font>
     control filter mask for a root (UID 0) process.
