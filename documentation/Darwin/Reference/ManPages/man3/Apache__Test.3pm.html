Apache::Test(3)                      User Contributed Perl Documentation                     Apache::Test(3)



<b>NAME</b>
       Apache::Test - Test.pm wrapper with helpers for testing Apache

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
           use Apache::Test;

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       <b>Apache::Test</b> is a wrapper around the standard "Test.pm" with helpers for testing an Apache server.

<b>FUNCTIONS</b>
       plan
           This function is a wrapper around "Test::plan":

               plan tests =&gt; 3;

           just like using Test.pm, plan 3 tests.

           If the first argument is an object, such as an "Apache::RequestRec" object, "STDOUT" will be tied
           to it. The "Test.pm" global state will also be refreshed by calling
           "Apache::Test::test_pm_refresh". For example:

               plan $r, tests =&gt; 7;

           ties STDOUT to the request object $r.

           If there is a last argument that doesn't belong to "Test::plan" (which expects a balanced hash),
           it's used to decide whether to continue with the test or to skip it all-together. This last
           argument can be:

              a "SCALAR"

               the test is skipped if the scalar has a false value. For example:

                 plan tests =&gt; 5, 0;

               But this won't hint the reason for skipping therefore it's better to use <u>need()</u>:

                 plan tests =&gt; 5,
                     need 'LWP',
                          { "not Win32" =&gt; sub { $^O eq 'MSWin32'} };

               see "need()" for more info.

              an "ARRAY" reference

               <u>need</u><b>_</b><u>module()</u> is called for each value in this array. The test is skipped if <u>need</u><b>_</b><u>module()</u>
               returns false (which happens when at least one C or Perl module from the list cannot be
               found).

              a "CODE" reference

               the tests will be skipped if the function returns a false value. For example:

                   plan tests =&gt; 5, need_lwp;

               the test will be skipped if LWP is not available

           All other arguments are passed through to <u>Test::plan</u> as is.

       ok  Same as <u>Test::ok</u>, see <u>Test.pm</u> documentation.

       sok Allows to skip a sub-test, controlled from the command line.  The argument to <u>sok()</u> is a CODE
           reference or a BLOCK whose return value will be passed to <u>ok()</u>. By default behaves like <u>ok()</u>. If
           all sub-tests of the same test are written using <u>sok()</u>, and a test is executed as:

             % ./t/TEST -v skip_subtest 1 3

           only sub-tests 1 and 3 will be run, the rest will be skipped.

       skip
           Same as <u>Test::skip</u>, see <u>Test.pm</u> documentation.

       test_pm_refresh
           Normally called by <u>Apache::Test::plan</u>, this function will refresh the global state maintained by
           <u>Test.pm</u>, allowing "plan" and friends to be called more than once per-process.  This function is
           not exported.

       Functions that can be used as a last argument to the extended <u>plan()</u>.  Note that for each "need_*"
       function there is a "have_*" equivalent that performs the exact same function except that it is
       designed to be used outside of "plan()".  "need_*" functions have the side effect of generating skip
       messages, if the test is skipped.  "have_*" functions don't have this side effect.  In other words,
       use "need_apache()" with "plan()" to decide whether a test will run, but "have_apache()" within test
       logic to adjust expectations based on older or newer server versions.

       need_http11
             plan tests =&gt; 5, need_http11;

           Require HTTP/1.1 support.

       need_ssl
             plan tests =&gt; 5, need_ssl;

           Require SSL support.

           Not exported by default.

       need_lwp
             plan tests =&gt; 5, need_lwp;

           Require LWP support.

       need_cgi
             plan tests =&gt; 5, need_cgi;

           Requires mod_cgi or mod_cgid to be installed.

       need_php
             plan tests =&gt; 5, need_php;

           Requires a PHP module to be installed (version 4 or 5).

       need_php4
             plan tests =&gt; 5, need_php4;

           Requires a PHP version 4 module to be installed.

       need_apache
             plan tests =&gt; 5, need_apache 2;

           Requires Apache 2nd generation httpd-2.x.xx

             plan tests =&gt; 5, need_apache 1;

           Requires Apache 1st generation (apache-1.3.xx)

           See also "need_min_apache_version()".

       need_min_apache_version
           Used to require a minimum version of Apache.

           For example:

             plan tests =&gt; 5, need_min_apache_version("2.0.40");

           requires Apache 2.0.40 or higher.

       need_apache_version
           Used to require a specific version of Apache.

           For example:

             plan tests =&gt; 5, need_apache_version("2.0.40");

           requires Apache 2.0.40.

       need_apache_mpm
           Used to require a specific Apache Multi-Processing Module.

           For example:

             plan tests =&gt; 5, need_apache_mpm('prefork');

           requires the prefork MPM.

       need_perl
             plan tests =&gt; 5, need_perl 'iolayers';
             plan tests =&gt; 5, need_perl 'ithreads';

           Requires a perl extension to be present, or perl compiled with certain capabilities.

           The first example tests whether "PerlIO" is available, the second whether:

             $Config{useithread} eq 'define';

       need_min_perl_version
           Used to require a minimum version of Perl.

           For example:

             plan tests =&gt; 5, need_min_perl_version("5.008001");

           requires Perl 5.8.1 or higher.

       need_module
             plan tests =&gt; 5, need_module 'CGI';
             plan tests =&gt; 5, need_module qw(CGI Find::File);
             plan tests =&gt; 5, need_module ['CGI', 'Find::File', 'cgid'];

           Requires Apache C and Perl modules. The function accept a list of arguments or a reference to a
           list.

           In case of C modules, depending on how the module name was passed it may pass through the
           following completions:

           1 need_module 'proxy_http.c'
               If there is the <u>.c</u> extension, the module name will be looked up as is, i.e. <u>'proxy</u><b>_</b><u>http.c'</u>.

           2 need_module 'mod_cgi'
               The <u>.c</u> extension will be appended before the lookup, turning it into <u>'mod</u><b>_</b><u>cgi.c'</u>.

           3 need_module 'cgi'
               The <u>.c</u> extension and <u>mod</u><b>_</b> prefix will be added before the lookup, turning it into
               <u>'mod</u><b>_</b><u>cgi.c'</u>.

       need_min_module_version
           Used to require a minimum version of a module

           For example:

             plan tests =&gt; 5, need_min_module_version(CGI =&gt; 2.81);

           requires "CGI.pm" version 2.81 or higher.

           Currently works only for perl modules.

       need
             plan tests =&gt; 5,
                 need 'LWP',
                      { "perl &gt;= 5.8.0 and w/ithreads is required" =&gt;
                        ($Config{useperlio} &amp;&amp; $] &gt;= 5.008) },
                      { "not Win32"                 =&gt; sub { $^O eq 'MSWin32' },
                        "foo is disabled"           =&gt; \&amp;is_foo_enabled,
                      },
                      'cgid';

           <u>need()</u> is more generic function which can impose multiple requirements at once. All requirements
           must be satisfied.

           <u>need()</u>'s argument is a list of things to test. The list can include scalars, which are passed to
           <u>need</u><b>_</b><u>module()</u>, and hash references. If hash references are used, the keys, are strings,
           containing a reason for a failure to satisfy this particular entry, the values are the condition,
           which are satisfaction if they return true. If the value is 0 or 1, it used to decide whether the
           requirements very satisfied, so you can mix special "need_*()" functions that return 0 or 1. For
           example:

             plan tests =&gt; 1, need 'Compress::Zlib', 'deflate',
                 need_min_apache_version("2.0.49");

           If the scalar value is a string, different from 0 or 1, it's passed to <u>need</u><b>_</b><u>module()</u>.  If the
           value is a code reference, it gets executed at the time of check and its return value is used to
           check the condition. If the condition check fails, the provided (in a key) reason is used to tell
           user why the test was skipped.

           In the presented example, we require the presence of the "LWP" Perl module, "mod_cgid", that we
           run under perl &gt;= 5.7.3 on Win32.

           It's possible to put more than one requirement into a single hash reference, but be careful that
           the keys will be different.

           It's also important to mention to avoid using:

             plan tests =&gt; 1, requirement1 &amp;&amp; requirement2;

           technique. While test-wise that technique is equivalent to:

             plan tests =&gt; 1, need requirement1, requirement2;

           since the test will be skipped, unless all the rules are satisfied, it's not equivalent for the
           end users. The second technique, deploying "need()" and a list of requirements, always runs all
           the requirement checks and reports all the missing requirements. In the case of the first
           technique, if the first requirement fails, the second is not run, and the missing requirement is
           not reported. So let's say all the requirements are missing Apache modules, and a user wants to
           satisfy all of these and run the test suite again. If all the unsatisfied requirements are
           reported at once, she will need to rebuild Apache once. If only one requirement is reported at a
           time, she will have to rebuild Apache as many times as there are elements in the "&amp;&amp;" statement.

           Also see <u>plan()</u>.

       under_construction
             plan tests =&gt; 5, under_construction;

           skip all tests, noting that the tests are under construction

       skip_reason
             plan tests =&gt; 5, skip_reason('my custom reason');

           skip all tests.  the reason you specify will be given at runtime.  if no reason is given a
           default reason will be used.

<b>Additional</b> <b>Configuration</b> <b>Variables</b>
       basic_config
             my $basic_cfg = Apache::Test::basic_config();
             $basic_cfg-&gt;write_perlscript($file, $content);

           "basic_config()" is similar to "config()", but doesn't contain any httpd-specific information and
           should be used for operations that don't require any httpd-specific knowledge.

       config
             my $cfg = Apache::Test::config();
             my $server_rev = $cfg-&gt;{server}-&gt;{rev};
             ...

           "config()" gives an access to the configuration object.

       vars
             my $serverroot = Apache::Test::vars-&gt;{serverroot};
             my $serverroot = Apache::Test::vars('serverroot');
             my($top_dir, $t_dir) = Apache::Test::vars(qw(top_dir t_dir));

           "vars()" gives an access to the configuration variables, otherwise accessible as:

             $vars = Apache::Test::config()-&gt;{vars};

           If no arguments are passed, the reference to the variables hash is returned. If one or more
           arguments are passed the corresponding values are returned.

<b>Test::More</b> <b>Integration</b>
       There are a few caveats if you want to use <u>Apache::Test</u> with <u>Test::More</u> instead of the default <u>Test</u>
       backend.  The first is that <u>Test::More</u> requires you to use its own "plan()" function and not the one
       that ships with <u>Apache::Test</u>.  <u>Test::More</u> also defines "ok()" and "skip()" functions that are
       different, and simply "use"ing both modules in your test script will lead to redefined warnings for
       these subroutines.

       To assist <u>Test::More</u> users we have created a special <u>Apache::Test</u> import tag, ":withtestmore", which
       will export all of the standard <u>Apache::Test</u> symbols into your namespace except the ones that collide
       with <u>Test::More</u>.

           use Apache::Test qw(:withtestmore);
           use Test::More;

           plan tests =&gt; 1;           # Test::More::plan()

           ok ('yes', 'testing ok');  # Test::More::ok()

       Now, while this works fine for standard client-side tests (such as "t/basic.t"), the more advanced
       features of <u>Apache::Test</u> require using <u>Test::More</u> as the sole driver behind the scenes.

       Should you choose to use <u>Test::More</u> as the backend for server-based tests (such as
       "t/response/TestMe/basic.pm") you will need to use the "-withtestmore" action tag:

           use Apache::Test qw(-withtestmore);

           sub handler {

               my $r = shift;

               plan $r, tests =&gt; 1;           # Test::More::plan() with
                                              # Apache::Test features

               ok ('yes', 'testing ok');      # Test::More::ok()
           }

       "-withtestmore" tells <u>Apache::Test</u> to use <u>Test::More</u> instead of <u>Test.pm</u> behind the scenes.  Note that
       you are not required to "use Test::More" yourself with the "-withtestmore" option and that the "use
       Test::More tests =&gt; 1" syntax may have unexpected results.

       Note that <u>Test::More</u> version 0.49, available within the <u>Test::Simple</u> 0.49 distribution on CPAN, or
       greater is required to use this feature.

       Because <u>Apache:Test</u> was initially developed using <u>Test</u> as the framework driver, complete <u>Test::More</u>
       integration is considered experimental at this time - it is supported as best as possible but is not
       guaranteed to be as stable as the default <u>Test</u> interface at this time.

<b>Apache::TestToString</b> <b>Class</b>
       The <u>Apache::TestToString</u> class is used to capture <u>Test.pm</u> output into a string.  Example:

           Apache::TestToString-&gt;start;

           plan tests =&gt; 4;

           ok $data eq 'foo';

           ...

           # $tests will contain the Test.pm output: 1..4\nok 1\n...
           my $tests = Apache::TestToString-&gt;finish;

<b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b>
       The Apache-Test tutorial: &lt;<a href="http://perl.apache.org/docs/general/testing/testing.html">http://perl.apache.org/docs/general/testing/testing.html</a>.

       Apache::TestRequest subclasses LWP::UserAgent and exports a number of useful functions for sending
       request to the Apache test server. You can then test the results of those requests.

       Use Apache::TestMM in your <u>Makefile.PL</u> to set up your distribution for testing.
