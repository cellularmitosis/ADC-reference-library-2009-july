your work in Xcode. The project window displays and organizes your
source files, targets, and executables. It allows you to access and
edit all of the pieces of your project. To work effectively in Xcode,
you need to recognize the parts of the project window and understand
how to use them to navigate your project&#8217;s contents. </p>
<p>Of course, everyone has their own way of organizing their
workspace. To help you be as efficient and productive as possible,
Xcode provides several different project window configurations or <strong>layouts</strong>. A project
window layout specifies a particular project window configuration,
as well as ancillary task-specific windows.</p>
<p>This chapter introduces the basic project window components
and describes the available project window layouts. It also introduces
other important Xcode windows and provides tips on effectively using
the Xcode interface to locate information on project items. </p>

<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-BABJGBAF" title="The Project Window and its Components"></a><h2>The Project Window and its Components</h2>
<p>When you first launch Xcode as a new user, Xcode displays
the default project window configuration, shown here.</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-DontLinkElementID_366" title="Figure 4-1Xcode&amp;#8217;s default project window"></a><p><strong>Figure 4-1&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Xcode&#8217;s
default project window</p><img src = "../Art/projectwindow.gif" alt = "" width="629" height="350"></div><br/>
<p>The project window contains the following key tools for navigating
your project:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>The Groups
&amp; Files list provides an outline view of your project contents.
You can move files and folders around and organize your project
contents in this list. The current selection in the Groups &amp;
Files list controls the contents displayed in the detail view.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>The detail view shows the item or items selected in the Groups
&amp; Files list. You can browse your project&#8217;s contents in the
detail view, search them using the Search field, or sort them according
to column. The detail view helps you rapidly find and access your project&#8217;s contents.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>The toolbar provides quick access to the most common Xcode commands.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>The status bar displays status messages for the project. During
an operation&#8212;such as building or indexing&#8212;Xcode displays a progress
indicator in the status bar to show the progress of the current
task.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>The Favorites bar optionally lets you store and quickly return
to commonly accessed locations in your project. The Favorites bar
is described in <span class="content_text"><a href="../pr_organizing/pr_organizing.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH248-BABDJIBF">“The Favorites Bar.”</a></span></p></li></ul>
<p>The project window can also contain an attached editor that
lets you edit files directly in the project window. You can navigate
through the views in a window, including the attached editor, by
pressing the Tab key. To take the focus away from the editor, press Control-Tab.</p>
<p>The exact configuration of the project window depends on the
current layout; nonetheless, each layout uses these components help
you view and access project items. For a description of each of
the available project window layouts, see <span class="content_text"><a href="pr_project_window.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-BCIFGAAH">“Project Window Layouts.”</a></span></p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-BABHBAIF" title="The Groups &amp;amp; Files List"></a><h3>The Groups &amp; Files List</h3>
<p>The Groups &amp; Files list provides an outline view of your
project&#8217;s contents. The contents of your project&#8212;files, folders,
targets, executables, and other project information&#8212;are organized
into groups. A <strong>group</strong> lets you collect related
files or information together. The Groups &amp; Files list gives
you a hierarchical view of these groups. </p>
<p>Using the Groups &amp; Files list, you can:</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>View your
project&#8217;s contents, organized hierarchically. You can have as
much or as little of your project&#8217;s contents as you want visible
at once.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Create additional Groups &amp; Files list views to focus on
multiple groups at once.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Drag files, folders, groups, and other project items to rearrange
and organize them.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Rename files, folders, and other project items. To do so,
Option-click the item and type the new name; or Control-click and
choose Rename from the menu.</p></li></ul>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-BABCBIGA" title="Groups in Xcode"></a><h4>Groups in Xcode</h4>
<p>Xcode supports two types of groups; you can view and edit
groups of either type in the Groups &amp; Files list:</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p><strong>Source
groups</strong> organize your project&#8217;s source files, including
implementation files, resources, frameworks, headers, and other
files. A source group, indicated by a yellow folder icon, can contain
any number of files and other source groups. Source groups help
you organize the files in your project into more manageable chunks.
The project group, represented by the project icon at the top of
the Groups &amp; Files list, is a source group that contains all
of the files, frameworks, and libraries included in your project.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p><strong>Smart groups</strong> collect files or information
that match a certain rule or pattern. Xcode provides several built-in
smart groups:</p><ul class="nested">
<li class="nested li"><p>The Targets group contains all of the targets in your project.
As mentioned earlier, a target contains the instructions for creating
a single software product. Targets are described in more detail
in <span class="content_text"><a href="../bs_targets/bs_targets.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH227-CIHEHECG">“Targets.”</a></span></p></li>
<li class="nested li"><p>The Executables group contains all of the executables defined
in your project. </p></li>
<li class="nested li"><p>The Errors and Warnings smart group lists the errors and warnings
generated when you build. This group is described further in <span class="content_text"><a href="../bs_building_product/bs_building_product.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000833-BAJBHEFI">“Viewing Errors and Warnings.”</a></span></p></li>
<li class="nested li"><p>The Find Results smart group contains the results of any searches
you perform in your project. Each search creates a new entry in
this group. For more information on the Find Results group, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../pr_navigate/pr_navigate.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-CJBJIHCB">“Viewing Search Results.”</a></span></p></li>
<li class="nested li"><p>The Bookmarks smart group lists those commonly accessed locations&#8212;files
or specific locations within a file&#8212;that you have saved in order
to return to them easily. For more information on the Bookmarks
smart group, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../pr_organizing/pr_organizing.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH248-BBCFHACH">“Saving Commonly Accessed Locations as Bookmarks.”</a></span></p></li>
<li class="nested li"><p>The SCM smart group lists all of the files that have source
control information. This group is described further in <span class="content_text"><a href="../SCMManagingFiles/SCMManagingFiles.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH270-CJBEFJFE">“Viewing File Status.”</a></span></p></li>
<li class="nested li"><p>The Project Symbols smart group lists all of the symbols defined
in your project. This group is described further in <span class="content_text"><a href="../pr_navigate/pr_navigate.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-CJBJCHJD">“Viewing the Symbols in Your Project.”</a></span></p></li></ul></li></ul>
<p>Xcode also lets you create your own smart groups and define
your own rules for what they contain; these smart groups are indicated
with a purple folder icon. For more information on using smart groups
and source groups to organize your project contents, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../pr_organizing/pr_organizing.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH248-BCIEAIAJ">“Organizing Files.”</a></span></p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-DontLinkElementID_217" title="Hiding and Showing Groups"></a><h4>Hiding
and Showing Groups</h4>
<p>Xcode provides a number of smart groups to help you organize
and find information; however, you may not need all of those smart
groups all of the time. You can customize the display of the current
Groups &amp; Files list to show only those smart groups that you currently
need. You can rearrange or delete any of the smart groups that appear
in a Groups &amp; Files list view, including those that Xcode supplies. </p>
<p>To rearrange a smart group, drag it to its new position in
the Groups &amp; Files list. To hide a smart group in the current
Groups &amp; Files list, select it and press Delete or choose Edit
&gt; Delete. To view the smart group again, choose it from the View
&gt; Show menu, as described in the next section.</p>
<p>Xcode also provides contextual menu items to show and hide
smart groups in the Groups &amp; Files list. Control-click in the
Groups &amp; Files list to show the contextual menu and choose the
smart group from the Preferences menu. If the smart group is currently
visible, choosing it from this menu hides the smart group. Otherwise,
it shows the smart group in the Groups &amp; Files list. A checkmark
next to the smart group&#8217;s name in the Preferences menu indicates
that the smart group is currently visible. You can show and hide
Xcode&#8217;s built-in smart groups, as well as any smart groups that
you have defined for your projects.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-DontLinkElementID_218" title="Viewing the Contents of a Group"></a><h4>Viewing
the Contents of a Group</h4>
<p>You have a couple of options for viewing the contents of a
group in the Groups &amp; Files list. If you prefer the outline
view, you can disclose the group&#8217;s contents directly in the Groups
&amp; Files list. You can also select one or more groups to view
their contents in a simple, searchable list in the detail view,
described in <span class="content_text"><a href="pr_project_window.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-BCIJFHCB">“The Detail View.”</a></span></p>
<p>To view the contents of a group in the Groups &amp; Files
list you can:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><p>Double-click
the group to expand its contents in the outline view, shown below. Double-clicking
the group a second time closes the group.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Click the disclosure triangle next to the group to show its
contents in the outline view.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Choose any of Xcode&#8217;s built-in smart groups from the View
&gt; Show menu to disclose that group&#8217;s contents in the outline
view. Xcode also selects the group and displays its contents in
the detail view. Choosing View &gt; Show &gt; All Files discloses
the contents of the project group. You can use the Vie w &gt; Show
menu to display a smart group, even if you had previously deleted
from the current Groups &amp; Files list.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Select the group to show the contents of the group, and of
any other groups it contains, in the detail view.</p></li></ol>
<p>You can sort the contents of a source group in the Groups
&amp; Files list by choosing an item from the View &gt; Sort menu.
You can sort by name or by file types. Xcode sorts the contents of
the currently selected group. </p>
<p>The Groups &amp; Files list can display additional information
for files in the list. You can view status for files under version
control or see whether a file is included in the active target.
To see this information in the Groups &amp; Files list, choose View
&gt; Groups &amp; Files Columns &gt; SCM or View &gt; Groups &amp;
Files Columns &gt; Target Membership, respectively.</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-DontLinkElementID_367" title="Figure 4-2Outline view of the project"></a><p><strong>Figure 4-2&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Outline
view of the project</p><img src = "../Art/outlineview.gif" alt = "" width="361" height="478"></div><br/>
<p>To view more information on any item in the Groups &amp; Files
list, select that item. Xcode displays additional information about
that item in the associated detail view, if one is open.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-BABJHJIG" title="Splitting the Groups &amp;amp; Files View"></a><h4>Splitting the Groups &amp;
Files View</h4>
<p>In large projects, the Groups &amp; Files list can get quite
long, making it difficult to move items around. You can split the
Groups &amp; Files view by clicking the icon in the scrollbar next
to the Groups &amp; Files list, as shown here. You can also split
a view by choosing View &gt; Split 'Files' Vertically or typing
Command&#8211;double-quote. Xcode splits the view that currently has
focus. </p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-DontLinkElementID_368" title="Figure 4-3Splitting the Groups &amp;amp; Files view"></a><p><strong>Figure 4-3&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Splitting
the Groups &amp; Files view</p><img src = "../Art/splittingview.gif" alt = "" width="278" height="385"></div><br/>
<p>Each view can display a different location, making it easy
to keep commonly accessed groups handy or to move items between
groups. You can drag the resize control between the Groups &amp;
Files views to repartition the space between them as you see fit.
Each view has its own split-view button; you can split each of these
views, creating as many split-views as you need. After you create
a split, a new button appears below the split-view button; to close
a split Groups &amp; Files view, click this second button. You can
also close a split view by choosing View &gt; Close Split 'Files'.</p>
<p>By default, Xcode splits the view vertically. However, you
can also split a view horizontally. To split a view horizontally,
hold down the Option key while clicking the split-view button or
choosing View &gt; Split 'Files' Horizontally. You can also type Option&#8211;Command&#8211;double-quote.</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-DontLinkElementID_369" title="Figure 4-4The split Groups &amp;amp; Files view"></a><p><strong>Figure 4-4&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The
split Groups &amp; Files view</p><img src = "../Art/splitgroupsandfiles.gif" alt = "" width="352" height="479"></div><br/>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-BCIJFHCB" title="The Detail View"></a><h3>The Detail View</h3>
<p>As you learned, the Groups &amp; Files view lets you see the
contents of your project in an organized outline. In contrast, the
detail view shows you items in a flat list. You can quickly search
and sort the items in this list, gaining rapid access to important
information in your project.</p>
<p>You control the scope of the information shown in the detail
view with your selection in the Groups &amp; Files list. If the
selected item is a group, the detail view displays information for
all of the members of that group and of any sub-groups that it contains.
You can select multiple items in the Groups &amp; Files list; the
detail view displays all of the selected items and their members.
This applies to both contiguous selections and to selections of
items that are not adjacent. </p><div class="notebox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-DontLinkElementID_370" title="Note"></a><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp; Note
that the content of groups such as frameworks and bundles are only
shown in the detail view when that framework or bundle is directly
selected in the Groups &amp; Files view, to avoid mixing items such
as external framework headers and project headers.</p></div>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-DontLinkElementID_219" title="The Information Displayed in the Detail View"></a><h4>The
Information Displayed in the Detail View</h4>
<p>The type of information displayed in the detail view varies,
depending on the item selected in the Groups &amp; Files list. For
example, if you select a group of source files in the Groups &amp;
Files list, the detail view displays each of the files in that group,
along with information about those files, such as the file&#8217;s build
status or code size. However, build status and code size make no
sense for errors and warnings, so when you select the Errors and
Warnings group, you see a list of error and warning messages and
the locations at which they occurred.</p>
<p>You can choose what information Xcode shows in the detail
view by choosing which columns are visible. To make a column visible,
choose it from the View &gt; Detail View Columns menu. You can also
Control-click any of the column headings; Xcode brings up a menu
like the one shown below, which allows you to choose which columns
are visible. </p><div class="notebox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-DontLinkElementID_371" title="Note"></a><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp; Some
columns in the detail view are required, depending on the currently selected
group. These columns do not appear in the View &gt; Detail View
Columns menu or in the contextual menu.</p></div>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-DontLinkElementID_372" title="Figure 4-5Choosing the type of information to display in the Detail view"></a><p><strong>Figure 4-5&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Choosing
the type of information to display in the Detail view</p>
<img src = "../Art/choosingdetailview.gif" alt = "" width="597" height="245"></div><br/>
<p>You can display the columns of the detail view in any order.
To reorder the columns, drag the heading of any column to its new
position.</p>
<p>You can use the menu items View &gt; Previous Detail and View
&gt; Next Detail, or their keyboard shortcuts, to move the selection
up or down in the detail view. To disclose the currently selected
detail in the Groups &amp; Files list, choose View &gt; Reveal in
Group Tree. For example, if the current selection in the detail
view is an individual source file, Xcode selects that file in the
Groups &amp; Files list, disclosing the contents of any source groups
that the file belongs to, as necessary.</p>
<p>To rename an item in the detail view, Option-click the item
and type the new name; or Control-click the item and choose Rename
from the menu.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-BABBBHIE" title="Searching and Sorting in the Detail View"></a><h4>Searching and Sorting in the
Detail View</h4>
<p>With the detail view you have a couple of ways to find and
view information. You can sort the contents of the detail view according
to the information in any of the visible categories simply by clicking
on the column heading for that category. For example, to sort by
file name, click the File Name heading.</p>
<p>Using the search field in the toolbar, you can quickly search
the contents of the detail view. As you type, Xcode filters the
contents of the detail view, displaying only those items that have
matching text in at least one of the columns. </p>
<p>The Search field supports several different types of search;
you can choose the search type from the pop-up menu in the Search
field. Xcode supports the following searches:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><p>String Matching.
Xcode determines a match using simple string comparison, filtering out
items that do not match the string in the Search field. This is
the default type of search for the Search field. It is also the
fastest.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Regular Expression. Xcode uses the regular expression in the
Search field to find matching items. For example, to find all C
implementation and header files in a source group, enter <code>\.(c|h)$</code></p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Wildcard Pattern. Xcode uses the wildcard pattern in the Search
field to find items that contain the specified characters anywhere
in any of the visible columns. For example, enter *View*.h to find
all header files with &#8220;View&#8221; in their name.</p></li></ol>
<p>For example, in a large list of source files, you can find
all of the files with the word &#8220;dialog&#8221; in their title by choosing
a String Matching search and typing &#8220;dialog&#8221; in the Search field,
as shown here.</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-DontLinkElementID_373" title="Figure 4-6Searching for files with &amp;#8220;dialog&amp;#8221; in their name"></a><p><strong>Figure 4-6&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Searching
for files with &#8220;dialog&#8221; in their name</p><img src = "../Art/filterdetailview.gif" alt = "" width="689" height="504"></div><br/>
<p>As you type, the status bar displays the scope of the search&#8212;the
current selection in the Groups &amp; Files list&#8212;and the number
of items found. Pressing the &#8220;Home&#8221; key or choosing the project
item (indicated by the project icon) from the search field&#8217;s pop-up
menu changes the focus of the search field to the whole project.</p>
<p>By default, Xcode clears the Search field when you select
a different smart group in the Groups &amp; Files list. To tell

<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-BABDFEDA" title="The Project Window Toolbar"></a><h3>The Project Window Toolbar</h3>
<p>The project window toolbar gives you quick access to the most
common Xcode commands. The project window toolbar for the Default
layout contains the following items:</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-DontLinkElementID_374" title="Figure 4-7The project window toolbar"></a><p><strong>Figure 4-7&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The
project window toolbar</p><img src = "../Art/toolbar.gif" alt = "" width="809" height="82"></div><br/>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Active Target
pop-up menu. The target menu lists the <strong>active target</strong>,
which is the target that is used whenever you build the project.
You can change the active target using this menu.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>The Action button. The Action button lets you perform common
operations on the currently selected item in the project window.
The actions available from this button are those appropriate for
the selected item; they are the same actions available in the contextual
menu that appears when you Control-click the selected item. For
example, when the current selection is a file, available operations
include opening the file in a separate editor, performing version
control operations, and grouping files.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>The Build buttons. The Build buttons initiate common build
actions, such as building, cleaning, and running. The triangle at
the bottom of the Build buttons indicates that there are multiple
actions associated with them. A single click on one of these buttons performs
the action represented by the button&#8217;s icon. If you press and
hold the mouse button over one of these buttons, you get a pull
down menu of all of the actions associated with the button. You
can initiate any of these actions by selecting it.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Tasks button. The Tasks button allows you to stop any operation
that is currently in progress in your project. The badge in the
lower right corner of the Tasks button indicates the operation that
is stopped when you click the button. If more than one operation
is in progress, the Tasks button lets you select the one you want
to stop. For example, if you have both a build and a search running,
you can stop either operation by pressing and holding the Tasks
button. Xcode displays a pop-up list of the tasks currently in operation;
choose a task to stop it. </p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Editor button. The Editor button shows and hides the code
editor in the project window. Using this editor, you can view and
edit files directly in the project window. You can also view the
source associated with an error or warning or with a search result.
The editing features of Xcode are described further in <span class="content_text"><a href="../editing/editing.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH251-CEGEGFHB">“Editing Source Files.”</a></span></p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Info button. The Info button brings up an Info window, allowing
you to examine and edit groups, files, targets, and other items
in your project. See <span class="content_text"><a href="pr_project_window.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-BCIFGDIG">“Inspector and Info Windows”</a></span> for more information on inspecting
items in your project.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>The Search field. The Search field allows you to search the
items currently displayed in the detail view. As you type, Xcode
filters the list of items in the detail view to include only those
items with matching content in one of the visible columns. See <span class="content_text"><a href="pr_project_window.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-BCIJFHCB">“The Detail View”</a></span> for
more information on using the Search field to find items in the
detail view.</p></li></ul>
<p>You can customize the project window&#8217;s toolbar by choosing
View &gt; Customize Toolbar. Drag one or more toolbar items to or
from the toolbar to get the set that is most useful to you.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-BABGJHAC" title="The Project Window Status Bar"></a><h3>The Project Window Status Bar</h3>
<p>The project window status bar lets you view the progress of
the current operation in Xcode. It gives you feedback during potentially
lengthy tasks, such as building, as well as displaying the results
of those tasks. In particular, the status bar lets you quickly access important
information about project operations. From the status bar, you can:</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Click the
progress indicator during an operation to open a more detailed account
of the currently running operations in the Activity Viewer window,
described in <span class="content_text"><a href="pr_project_window.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-BABBFDDD">“Viewing the Progress of Operations in Xcode.”</a></span></p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Click the build result message, or error or warning icon,
to open the Build Results window and view build system commands
and output. For more information on the ways in which Xcode displays
the status of build operations, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../bs_building_product/bs_building_product.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000833-BAJGIFGI">“Viewing Build Status.”</a></span></p></li></ul>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-BCIFGAAH" title="Project Window Layouts"></a><h2>Project Window Layouts</h2>
<p>There are many factors affecting the optimal workspace arrangement
for you. How much screen real estate do you have? What do you spend
most of your time working on? How many projects do you normally
have open at once? </p>
<p>Configuring your development environment to allow you to be
as productive as possible is critical. Whatever your preferred workflow,
Xcode provides several different project window layouts for you
to choose from. Xcode defines the following layouts:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Default. This
configuration provides the traditional Xcode project window experience,
described in the previous section. This is Xcode&#8217;s default layout,
combining outline and detail views to let you quickly navigate your
project.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Condensed. This layout provides a smaller, simpler project
window with an outline view of your project contents and separate
windows for common development tasks, such as debugging and building. </p></li>
<li class="li"><p>All-in-One. This layout provides a single project window that
lets you perform all of the tasks typical of software development&#8212;such
as debugging, viewing build results, searching, and so forth&#8212;within
a single window.</p></li></ul>
<p>This section describes each project window layout and the
differences between them.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-BCIEFIFH" title="The Default Layout"></a><h3>The Default Layout</h3>
<p>Xcode&#8217;s default layout provides the project window described
in <span class="content_text"><a href="pr_project_window.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-BABJGBAF">“The Project Window and its Components.”</a></span> As mentioned there, the default project
window contains:</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-DontLinkElementID_375" title="Figure 4-8The Default Workspace project window"></a><p><strong>Figure 4-8&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The
Default Workspace project window</p><img src = "../Art/project_window_default.gif" alt = "" width="727" height="534"></div><br/>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><p>The Groups
&amp; Files list gives you an outline view of your project contents,
as described in <span class="content_text"><a href="pr_project_window.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-BABHBAIF">“The Groups &amp; Files List.”</a></span></p></li>
<li class="li"><p>The detail view shows a flat list of the items selected in
the Groups &amp; Files list, as described in <span class="content_text"><a href="pr_project_window.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-BCIJFHCB">“The Detail View.”</a></span> In the Default
layout, you can hide the detail view by collapsing the project window.
To collapse the detail view, double-click the button above the split-view
control in the Groups &amp; Files list. Double-clicking the button
a second time shows the detail view again.</p><p>In addition, you
can customize the toolbar shown for the project window in each of these
states, both collapsed and uncollapsed. To do so, collapse or expand
the project window to the appropriate state and customize the toolbar
in the usual way, described in <span class="content_text"><a href="pr_project_window.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-BABDFEDA">“The Project Window Toolbar.”</a></span>
Xcode stores the contents of the toolbar for each state separately.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>An optional attached editor. In the Default layout, you can
choose to view and edit all files within the project window, using
the attached editor. Or, you can choose to have Xcode use a separate
editor window, and use only the Groups &amp; Files list and the
detail view in the project window.</p></li></ol>
<p>Although you can accomplish most of your daily development
tasks in the project window, Xcode also provides a number of other
task-specific windows that let you focus on a particular part of
the development process. <span class="content_text">Table 4-1</span> shows the separate
windows available in the Default layout.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-BABFJEDA" title="Table 4-1Additional windows available with the Default project window layout"></a><div class="tableholder"><table class="graybox" border = "0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">

<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-DontLinkElementID_220" title="The Condensed Layout"></a><h3>The Condensed Layout</h3>
<p>The Condensed layout provides a smaller, more compact version
of the project window. In this configuration, the project window
contains several views, each showing a different subset of the items
in your project in the Groups &amp; Files list. You can switch between
these outline views using the tabs at the top of the project window. </p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-DontLinkElementID_376" title="Figure 4-9The Condensed Project Workspace project window"></a><p><strong>Figure 4-9&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The
Condensed Project Workspace project window</p><img src = "../Art/project_window_condensed.gif" alt = "" width="382" height="506"></div><br/>
<p>The condensed project window contains:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><p>The Files pane
shows your project and all of the source groups and files in your project.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>The Targets pane shows the targets and executables defined
in your project.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>The Other pane shows all of the remaining smart groups. This
includes the standard smart groups defined by Xcode, as well as
any smart groups you have added to the project.</p></li></ol>
<p>You can show any of the built-in smart groups, opening the
appropriate pane if necessary, by choosing an item from the View
&gt; Show menu. </p>
<p>The toolbar of the Condensed project window layout is also
simpler than that of the other available layouts. By default, the
condensed project window toolbar contains only the Build buttons,
Tasks button, and Info button. These buttons are described in <span class="content_text"><a href="pr_project_window.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-BABDFEDA">“The Project Window Toolbar.”</a></span></p>

<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-DontLinkElementID_221" title="The All-In-One Layout"></a><h3>The All-In-One Layout</h3>
<p>The All-In-One project window layout provides a single project
window in which you can perform all of the tasks necessary for software
development. In this project window, you can edit files, view project
items in an outline view or detail view, view build system output,
run and debug your executable, search and more. The project window
of the all-in-one configuration provides three different views, or <strong>pages</strong>. To
switch between pages, use the Page control in the project window
toolbar, shown in <span class="content_text">Figure 4-10</span>. The available pages are:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><p>Project.
This page lets you perform general project management tasks, such
as searching, sorting and viewing SCM status. To open the project
page, click the project icon.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Build. This page lets you view build results and the run log. To
open the build page, click the hammer icon.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Debug. This page includes an integrated debugger view, similar
to the standalone debugger window available with the other layouts.
To open the debug page, click the spray can icon. For a description
of the debugger interface, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../db_set_up_debug/db_set_up_debug.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH239-BABHJEJD">“The Debugger Window.”</a></span></p></li></ol>
<p>In addition to using the Page control, choosing any of the
menu items for opening other Xcode windows will, in the All-In-One
layout, open the appropriate page to the correct pane. For example,
choosing Build &gt; Build Results opens the Build page and selects
the Build pane.</p>
<p>Each page of the All-In-One layout has a different project
window toolbar, that contains items specific to the development
tasks performed in that page.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-DontLinkElementID_222" title="The Project Page"></a><h4>The
Project Page</h4>
<p>The project page, shown here, lets you perform typical project
management tasks. You can view the contents of your project in outline
view, search for project items in the detail view, perform a project-wide
find, and view status for the files under version control in your project.</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-BABGJEJB" title="Figure 4-10The project page of the All-In-One project window"></a><p><strong>Figure 4-10&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The project page of the All-In-One
project window</p><img src = "../Art/all_in_one_project.gif" alt = "" width="724" height="494"></div><br/>
<p>The project page contains a Groups &amp; Files list, which
shows all of the contents of your project in outline view; an attached
editor, which lets you edit source files right in the project window;
and a tabbed view, which lets you switch between several panes,
each of which provides an interface for a common project management
task. These panes are:</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>The Detail
pane includes a detail view, which lets you view additional information about
project items selected in the Group &amp; Files list or quickly
filter project items. The detail view is described in <span class="content_text"><a href="pr_project_window.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-BCIJFHCB">“The Detail View.”</a></span></p></li>
<li class="li"><p>The Project Find pane lets you perform project-wide searches
and view search results. The interface is the same as that provided
by the Project Find window in other layouts. See <span class="content_text"><a href="../pr_navigate/pr_navigate.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-BABFCHDJ">“Searching in a Project.”</a></span></p></li>
<li class="li"><p>The SCM Results pane opens a dedicated view displaying only
those project items under version control and their status. It is
similar to what you see in the SCM window with other layouts. See <span class="content_text"><a href="../SCMManagingFiles/SCMManagingFiles.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH270-CJBEFJFE">“Viewing File Status.”</a></span></p></li></ul>
<p>The default toolbar for the project page of the All-In-One
layout is the same as that of the Default project window, described
in <span class="content_text"><a href="pr_project_window.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-BABDFEDA">“The Project Window Toolbar,”</a></span>
with the addition of the Page control.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-DontLinkElementID_223" title="The Build Page"></a><h4>The
Build Page</h4>
<p>The build page, shown here, provides an interface for common
build tasks. It lets you see the progress of your build, view errors
and warnings, and see the run log.</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-DontLinkElementID_378" title="Figure 4-11The build page of the All-In-One project window"></a><p><strong>Figure 4-11&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The
build page of the All-In-One project window</p><img src = "../Art/all_in_one_build.gif" alt = "" width="723" height="494"></div><br/>
<p>The build page contains an attached editor, that lets you
view source code and jump to the location of any build errors; a
Groups &amp; Files list that shows your project contents in an outline;
and tabs that let you switch between:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><p>The Build
pane displays the commands used to build your project and the output
of the build system. This is the same information as that in the
Build Results window available with the other layouts. See <span class="content_text"><a href="../bs_building_product/bs_building_product.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000833-BAJGIFGI">“Viewing Build Status.”</a></span></p></li>
<li class="li"><p>The Run pane displays any information logged by your program
while running in Xcode.</p></li></ol>
<p>If the outline view is not visible in the build page, you
can open it by dragging or double-clicking the splitter at the far
left side of the window, or by choosing an item from the View &gt;
Show menu.</p>
<p>The default toolbar of the build page contains items that
give you easy access to commands you commonly use when building

Layout</h3>
<p>You can change the current project window layout in the General
pane of Xcode Preferences. From the Layout menu, choose the Default,
Condensed, or All-In-One layouts. Selecting a layout from this menu
shows a brief description of the layout below the menu. Note that
you cannot change the project window layout when any projects are open;
you must first close all open projects. The project window layout
is a user-specific setting; it applies to all projects that you
open. </p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-DontLinkElementID_226" title="Saving Changes to the Current Layout"></a><h3>Saving Changes to the Current
Layout</h3>
<p>Xcode&#8217;s available project window layouts give you the flexibility
to choose the configuration that best suits your preferred workflow.
You can further customize your work environment by saving the changes
that you make to the windows in an open project and applying them
to all projects using that layout.</p>
<p>For example, the project window of the condensed layout shows
three different outline views, each of them focused on a different
subset of a project&#8217;s groups. By default, the Files view shows
only the project group, which contains all files and folders in
the project. The Other view shows all smart groups. If you want
access to both your project files and your bookmarked locations
in the same view, you could add the Bookmarks smart group to the Files
view by choosing View &gt; Show &gt; Bookmarks. </p><div class="notebox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-DontLinkElementID_379" title="Note"></a><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp; If
the Bookm arks smart group exists in another pane, choosing View
&gt; Show &gt; Bookmarks opens that pane in the project window.
However, if you have previously deleted the smart group from the
project window, choosing View &gt; Show &gt; Bookmarks adds that
smart group to the current pane.</p></div>
<p>To save this change, and have the Bookmarks smart group appear
in the Files pane for all projects using the Condensed layout, choose
Window &gt; Defaults.</p>
<p>In the dialog that Xcode displays, click Make Layout Default
to save your changes to the current layout. Clicking Restore to
Factory Default discards all of your changes&#8212;both current changes
and those you&#8217;ve previously saved&#8212;to the current layout. Xcode
restores the original configuration settings for the layout.</p>
<p>You can save changes to:</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Window size
and position.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Visibility of views&#8212;whether they are hidden or revealed&#8212;in
a window.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Contents and visibility of outline views. </p></li>
<li class="li"><p>The default set of toolbar items.</p></li></ul>
<p>If the &#8220;Save window state&#8221; option in the General pane
of Xcode Preferences is enabled, Xcode saves the state of the open
windows for each project when you close that project. However, when
you choose Window &gt; Defaults, you save configuration changes
that apply to all projects when you open them using the modified
layout.</p>

on Project Items and Operations</h2>
<p>Knowing how to use Xcode&#8217;s user interface to find and view
project items and information is essential to working efficiently
in Xcode. Xcode gives you a number of different ways to find and
access project contents. In previous sections, you&#8217;ve learned how
to use the Groups &amp; Files list to see an organized outline view
of your project and how to use the detail view to quickly filter
project contents. Using these tools, you can view as wide or as
narrow a cross-section of your project as you choose. However, these
tools aren&#8217;t as useful when you wish to view or modify individual
items in your project. For this, Xcode provides inspector and Info
windows.</p>
<p>In previous chapters you also learned how the project window
status bar lets you view the progress and results of operations
in Xcode. However, the amount of information visible in the status
bar is limited and it reflects only operations in the current project.
To let you view a more detailed account of all operations in Xcode,
Xcode provides the Activity Viewer window.</p>
<p>This section describes the Info and inspector windows, as
well as the Activity Viewer and shows you how to use them to obtain
additional information on project items and Xcode operations.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-BCIFGDIG" title=" Inspector and Info Windows"></a><h3> Inspector and Info Windows</h3>
<p>Xcode includes two special types of windows that you will
use frequently to view and modify items that appear in your project
window. These are the Info window and the inspector window. The
Info and inspector windows allow you to examine the components of
your project in detail and make changes to them. You can inspect
any item that is selected in the project window or is open in the
active editor window. Xcode provides inspectors for the following
project items: </p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>File and
folder references</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>User-defined smart groups</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Localized file variants</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Targets</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Executables</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Build phases</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>The project itself</p></li></ul>
<p>The type of information displayed in the inspector and Info
windows changes, depending on the type of item you are inspecting.
For example, here is the Info window for a target:</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-DontLinkElementID_380" title="Figure 4-12An Info window"></a><p><strong>Figure 4-12&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>An
Info window</p><img src = "../Art/inspector.gif" alt = "" width="366" height="499"></div><br/>
<p>For any particular item in your project, the Info window and
inspector window both display the same information. However, the
two windows behave differently. The Info window continues to display
information about the item that was selected in the project window
when you opened it, regardless of the current selection. You can
have multiple Info windows open at any time, each describing a different
component of your project, and that information will continue to
be visible until you close those windows. To open an Info window,
choose File &gt; Get Info, click the Info button in the project
window toolbar, or double-click the item to inspect.</p>
<p>The inspector window tracks the current selection in the project
window. As you select different files, targets, and groups in the
project window, the inspector window changes to show information
about that item. To open an inspector window, hold down the Option key
and choose File &gt; Show Inspector or click the Inspector button.
The Inspector button is not in the project window toolbar by default;
to add it to the toolbar, choose View &gt; Customize Toolbar.</p>
<p>Specific inspector and Info windows are described in more
detail later in this document, when the objects that they modify&#8212;files,
targets, projects, groups, and so forth&#8212;are discussed. In general,
however, if you are at a loss as to how to make a change to a basic project
component, try inspecting it. Throughout this document, wherever
an inspector window is used, remember that you can also use an Info
window, and vice versa. </p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-BABBFDDD" title="Viewing the Progress of Operations in Xcode"></a><h3>Viewing the Progress of Operations
in Xcode</h3>
<p>The Activity Viewer window lets you watch the operations currently
in progress in Xcode. While the Tasks button in the project window
toolbar lets you control the progress of tasks in the current project,
the Activity Viewer lets you see the progress of all Xcode operations
across all open projects. The Activity Viewer provides a single,
persistent window which you can leave open to monitor the progress
of all running tasks. To open the Activity Window, shown here, choose
Window &gt; Activity Viewer or click the progress indicator in the
project window status bar. </p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-DontLinkElementID_381" title="Figure 4-13The Activity Viewer Window"></a><p><strong>Figure 4-13&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The
Activity Viewer Window</p><img src = "../Art/activityviewer.gif" alt = "" width="368" height="197"></div><br/>
<p>The operations in the Activity Viewer are grouped by project;
you can show or hide the operations specific to any project by clicking
the disclosure triangle next to the project name. To stop any of
the tasks shown in the Activity Viewer, simply click the Stop sign
icon next to that task. You can cancel the most recently initiated
operation in the active project by choosing Project &gt; Stop <em>&lt;task
name&gt;</em> or typing Command&#8212;period.</p>
