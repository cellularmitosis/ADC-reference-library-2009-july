Sample: MP3 PlayerDescription: This example contains two targets:1) MP3 Player FillBuffer shows how to play VBR and Non-VBR MP3 encoded sound files using the SoundConverterFillBuffer APIs and QuickTime. This sample will also import System 7 Sound files for anyone curious as to how a non-in-place import is done with QuickTime.2) MP3 Player ConvertBuffer shows how to play Non-VBR MP3 encoded sound files using the SoundConverterConvertBuffer APIs and QuickTime.Beyond this obvious difference both targets demonstrate the use of the GetSoundDescriptionExtension, and SoundConverterSetInfo APIs to retrieve and use the siDecompressorSettings atom.The SoundConverterFillBuffer APIs available in CarbonLib 1.1 and higher are now the preferred set of APIs to use with the SoundConverter.For more information consult the Technical Documentation:http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/quicktime/qtdevdocs/RM/sndframe.htm#soundVersion: 1.1Date: October 31, 2000Requirements: Mac OS 9.0.4+, Carbon 1.1+, QuickTime 4.1.2+, Universal Interfaces 3.4+.Project Requirements: This project was built with CodeWarrior Pro 5 (IDE 4.0.4), Universal Interfaces 3.4a6 and Carbon 1.1.Note:  You may need to modify the projects access paths to point to an updated Universal Interfaces folder. The projects paths for this sample were set up as follows:{Compiler}:MacOS Support:Universal 3.4:{Compiler}:MacOS Support:Libraries:{Compiler}:MSL:If you have an updated Universal Interfaces folder (3.4 or greater), simply change the first path to reflect this:{Compiler}:MacOS Support:Universal InterfacesPlease direct questions and or comments to http://developer.apple.com/contact/feedback.html
