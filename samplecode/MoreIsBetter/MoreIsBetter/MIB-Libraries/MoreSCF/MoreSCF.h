	Change History (most recent first):

$Log: MoreSCF.h,v $
Revision 1.3  2002/11/09 00:00:48         
Added compile time environment check. When using framework includes, explicitly include the frameworks we need. Convert nil to NULL.

Revision 1.2  2002/01/22 06:21:07         
Changed API of MoreSCNewService to use a dictionary, which makes for a better match with the results from MoreSCFPortScanner. Also added a lot of comments about the meaning of various dictionary keys.

Revision 1.1  2002/01/16 22:52:21         
First checked in.

extern pascal OSStatus MoreSCToOSStatus(int scErr);
	// Maps an SCF error (positive integers defined in 
	// <SystemConfiguration/SystemConfiguration.h>) to an 
	// OSStatus.  Currently we just cast one to the other 
	// (so this routine returns a positive OSStatus that 
	// has the same value as scErr) but, hey, one day I 
	// might come up with an appropriate mapping.
	
extern pascal OSStatus MoreSCErrorBoolean(Boolean mustBeTrue);
	// If mustBeTrue is true, this routine returns noErr.
	// If mustBeTrue is false, it calls SCError (to get the 
	// most recent SCF error), maps it to an OSStatus using 
	// MoreSCToOSStatus, and returns it.  Typically you use 
	// this routine in concert with an SCF routine that returns 
	// a Boolean result (for example, SCPreferencesPathSetValue).

extern pascal OSStatus MoreSCError(const void *value);
	// If value is not NULL, this routine returns noErr.
	// If value is NULL, it calls SCError (to get the 
	// most recent SCF error), maps it to an OSStatus using 
	// MoreSCToOSStatus, and returns it.  Typically you use 
	// this routine in concert with an SCF routine that returns 
	// a pointer result (for example, SCPreferencesPathGetValue).

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Open/Close

// Sequencing
// ----------
// The correct sequence to call these routines is as follows.
//
// (void) MoreSCSetClient(CFSTR("MyClientName")); -- optional
// 
// err = MoreSCOpen(false, false);
// if (err == noErr) {
//     MoreSCGetSCPreferencesRef and do stuff with it
// }
// MoreSCClose(&err, dirty);
//
// You must call MoreSCSetClient first so that the client name is set 
// up before the connection to SCPreferences is created.  You must 
// always  call MoreSCClose, even if the MoreSCOpen failed.  You must 
// not call MoreSCGetSCPreferencesRef outside of the context of 
// a MoreSCOpen/MoreSCClose pair.
//
// It's Optional
// -------------
// All of the MoreSCF public routines will automatically open 
// and close a connection to SCPreferences if you haven't done 
// so already.  The primary reason why you might use 
// MoreSCOpen/MoreSCClose are:
//
// o You want to enforce a locking policy (see below).
//
// o You want to get access to the SCPreferencesRef so that you 
//   can call SCPreferences routines that aren't adequately 
//   wrapped by more MoreSCF.
// 
// Locking
// -------
// By default MoreSCF does *no* locking at all.  Whenever 
// MoreSCF calls MoreSCOpen internally, it passes (false, false) as 
// the parameters.  If you want to do locking (and this 
// is advisable in many circumstances), you must call MoreSCOpen 
// yourself and pass appropriate locking parameters.
//
// Locking is important even if you're calling high-level routines. 
// For example, let's say you're a classic ISP setup program.  
// You call MoreSCFindSetByUserVisibleNameAndCopyID to see whether 
// a specific named set currently exists; if it doesn't, you create it 
// using MoreSCMakeNewDialupSet.  [Both of these routines are defined 
// in "MoreSCFHelpers.h".] To do this safely you should get the 
// SCPreferences lock before calling MoreSCFindSetByUserVisibleNameAndCopyID 
// and release it after calling MoreSCMakeNewDialupSet.  Otherwise its 
// remotely possible that someone could create the set between your 
// calls to MoreSCFindSetByUserVisibleNameAndCopyID and 
// MoreSCMakeNewDialupSet.
//
// The sequence you would use is something like:
//
// Boolean dirty;
//
// dirty = false;
// err = MoreSCOpen(true, true);
// if (err == noErr) {
//     MoreSCFindSetByUserVisibleNameAndCopyID(...);
//     if (! found) {
//         MoreSCMakeNewDialupSet(...);
//         dirty = true;
//     }
// }
// MoreSCClose(&err, dirty);

extern pascal OSStatus MoreSCSetClient(CFStringRef clientName);
	// Sets the client name that MoreSCF passes to routines 
	// like SCPreferencesCreate.  By default this name is 
	// "MoreSCF".  You can override this by calling this routine 
	// and passing in a more appropriate name.
	//
	// clientName can be NULL, in which case MoreSCF returns to 
	// using its default value.
	//
	// clientName is retained by MoreSCF.

extern pascal CFStringRef MoreSCGetClient(void);
	// Gets the client name currently being used by MoreSCF. 
	// If you haven't set a client name using MoreSCSetClient, this 
	// will return NULL.

extern pascal OSStatus MoreSCOpen(Boolean lockThePrefs, Boolean waitForLock);
	// Opens a connection to the SCPreferences.  All of MoreSCF 
	// shares the same actual connection, however the connection 
	// is reference counted so that you can call MoreSCOpen 
	// multiple times without causing any confusion.
	// 
	// If you pass true to lockThePrefs then the routine will 
	// ensure that the preferences are locked.  No other process 
	// will be able to make changes while the lock is held. 
	// The lock will be released when the SCPreferences reference 
	// count drops to 0.  This is not necessarily when you call 
	// MoreSCClose; if some other routine has called MoreSCOpen 
	// then the lock will be released when all calls to MoreSCClose 
	// have been made.  The is explained in more detail in the 
	// comments to MoreSCClose.
	//
	// You must be running as root (have an effective user ID 
	// of 0) to lock the preferences.
	//
	// If waitForLock is true then your thread will block waiting 
	// for the SCPreferences lock if some other SCPreferencesRef 
	// has it locked. If waitForLock is false then this call will 
	// fail with an error if the lock is already held.
	//
	// It is illegal to pass true to waitForLock without also 
	// passing true to lockThePrefs.

extern pascal SCPreferencesRef MoreSCGetSCPreferencesRef(void);
	// Returns the actual SCPreferencesRef that MoreSCF is using. 
	// You should not call this routine outside of a MoreSCOpen/
	// MoreSCClose pair. 

extern pascal void     MoreSCClose(OSStatus *err, Boolean dirty);
	// Closes a connection to the SCPreferences.  If dirty is true 
	// then this records that the preferences have been changed 
	// (assuming *err is not noErr).  If this drops the reference count 
	// to 0 then certain special actions are taken:
	//
	// o If the preferences have been changed, MoreSCF attempts to 
	//   commit those changes.  Any error occuring during the commit 
	//   is recorded in *err if *err is noErr.  If *err is not noErr, 
	//   its initial value is preserved.
	//
	// o If the preferences are locked, MoreSCF releases the lock after 
	//   committing the changes.
	//
	// Note that the dirty and locked atttributes were not necessarily 
	// set for this instance of MoreSCOpen/Close. If an enclosing instance 
	// has either dirtied or locked the preferences, the commit or unlock 
	// is delayed until the reference count hits 0.  For example:
	//
	// err = MoreSCOpen(false, false);
	// if (err == noErr) {
	//     err = MoreSCOpen(true, true);    -- lock happens here
	//     if (err == noErr) {
	//         ...
	//     }
	//     MoreSCClose(&err, true);         -- dirty recorded, but commit and unlock deferred
	// }
	// MoreSCClose(&err, false);			-- commit and unlocked happens here
	//
	// You must be running as root (have an effective user ID 
	// of 0) to commit preference changes.
	// 
	// err must not be NULL.
