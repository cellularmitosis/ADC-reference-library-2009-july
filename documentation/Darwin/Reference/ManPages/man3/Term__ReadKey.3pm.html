<b>NAME</b>
       Term::ReadKey - A perl module for simple terminal control

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
               use Term::ReadKey;
               ReadMode 4; # Turn off controls keys
               while (not defined ($key = ReadKey(-1))) {
                       # No key yet
               }
               print "Get key $key\n";
               ReadMode 0; # Reset tty mode before exiting

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       Term::ReadKey is a compiled perl module dedicated to providing simple control over terminal driver
       modes (cbreak, raw, cooked, etc.,) support for non-blocking reads, if the architecture allows, and
       some generalized handy functions for working with terminals. One of the main goals is to have the
       functions as portable as possible, so you can just plug in "use Term::ReadKey" on any architecture
       and have a good likelyhood of it working.

       ReadMode MODE [, Filehandle]
               Takes an integer argument, which can currently be one of the following values:

                   0    Restore original settings.
                   1    Change to cooked mode.
                   2    Change to cooked mode with echo off.
                         (Good for passwords)
                   3    Change to cbreak mode.
                   4    Change to raw mode.
                   5    Change to ultra-raw mode.
                         (LF to CR/LF translation turned off)

                   Or, you may use the synonyms:

                   restore
                   normal
                   noecho
                   cbreak
                   raw
                   ultra-raw

               These functions are automatically applied to the STDIN handle if no other handle is supplied.
               Modes 0 and 5 have some special properties worth mentioning: not only will mode 0 restore
               original settings, but it cause the next ReadMode call to save a new set of default settings.
               Mode 5 is similar to mode 4, except no CR/LF translation is performed, and if possible,
               parity will be disabled (only if not being used by the terminal, however. It is no different
               from mode 4 under Windows.)

               If you are executing another program that may be changing the terminal mode, you will either
               want to say

                   ReadMode 1
                   system('someprogram');
                   ReadMode 1;

               which resets the settings after the program has run, or:

                   $somemode=1;
                   ReadMode 0;
                   system('someprogram');
                   ReadMode 1;

               which records any changes the program may have made, before resetting the mode.

       ReadKey MODE [, Filehandle]
               Takes an integer argument, which can currently be one of the following values:

                   0    Perform a normal read using getc
                   -1   Perform a non-blocked read
                   &gt;0   Perform a timed read

               (If the filehandle is not supplied, it will default to STDIN.) If there is nothing waiting in
               the buffer during a non-blocked read, then undef will be returned. Note that if the OS does
               not provide any known mechanism for non-blocking reads, then a "ReadKey -1" can die with a
               fatal error. This will hopefully not be common.

               If MODE is greater then zero, then ReadKey will use it as a timeout value in seconds
               (fractional seconds are allowed), and won't return "undef" until that time expires. (Note,
               again, that some OS's may not support this timeout behaviour.) If MODE is less then zero,
               then this is treated as a timeout of zero, and thus will return immediately if no character
               is waiting. A MODE of zero, however, will act like a normal getc.

               There are currently some limitations with this call under Windows. It may be possible that
               non-blocking reads will fail when reading repeating keys from more then one console.

       ReadLine MODE [, Filehandle]
               Takes an integer argument, which can currently be one of the following values:

                   0    Perform a normal read using scalar(&lt;FileHandle&gt;)
                   -1   Perform a non-blocked read
                   &gt;0   Perform a timed read

               If there is nothing waiting in the buffer during a non-blocked read, then undef will be
               returned. Note that if the OS does not provide any known mechanism for non-blocking reads,
               then a "ReadLine 1" can die with a fatal error. This will hopefully not be common. Note that
               a non-blocking test is only performed for the first character in the line, not the entire
               line.  This call will probably <b>not</b> do what you assume, especially with ReadMode's higher then
               1. For example, pressing Space and then Backspace would appear to leave you where you
               started, but any timeouts would now be suspended.

               This call is currently not available under Windows.

       GetTerminalSize [Filehandle]
               Returns either an empty array if this operation is unsupported, or a four element array
               containing: the width of the terminal in characters, the height of the terminal in character,
               the width in pixels, and the height in pixels. (The pixel size will only be valid in some
               environments.)

               Under Windows, this function must be called with an "output" filehandle, such as STDOUT, or a
               handle opened to CONOUT$.

       SetTerminalSize WIDTH,HEIGHT,XPIX,YPIX [, Filehandle]
               Return -1 on failure, 0 otherwise. Note that this terminal size is only for <b>informative</b>
               value, and changing the size via this mechanism will <b>not</b> change the size of the screen. For
               example, XTerm uses a call like this when it resizes the screen. If any of the new
               measurements vary from the old, the OS will probably send a SIGWINCH signal to anything
               reading that tty or pty.

               This call does not work under Windows.

       GetSpeeds [, Filehandle]
               Returns either an empty array if the operation is unsupported, or a two value array
               containing the terminal in and out speeds, in <b>decimal</b>. E.g, an in speed of 9600 baud and an
               out speed of 4800 baud would be returned as (9600,4800). Note that currently the in and out
               speeds will always be identical in some OS's. No speeds are reported under Windows.

       GetControlChars [, Filehandle]
               Returns an array containing key/value pairs suitable for a hash. The pairs consist of a key,
               the name of the control character/signal, and the value of that character, as a single
               character. This call does nothing under Windows.

               Each key will be an entry from the following list:

                       DISCARD
                       DSUSPEND
                       EOF
                       EOL
                       EOL2
                       ERASE
                       ERASEWORD
                       INTERRUPT
                       KILL
                       MIN
                       QUIT
                       QUOTENEXT
                       REPRINT
                       START
                       STATUS
                       STOP
                       SUSPEND
                       SWITCH
                       TIME

               Thus, the following will always return the current interrupt character, regardless of
               platform.

                       %keys = GetControlChars;
                       $int = $keys{INTERRUPT};

       SetControlChars [, Filehandle]
               Takes an array containing key/value pairs, as a hash will produce. The pairs should consist
               of a key that is the name of a legal control character/signal, and the value should be either
               a single character, or a number in the range 0-255. SetControlChars will die with a runtime
               error if an invalid character name is passed or there is an error changing the settings. The
               list of valid names is easily available via

                       %cchars = GetControlChars();
                       @cnames = keys %cchars;

               This call does nothing under Windows.
