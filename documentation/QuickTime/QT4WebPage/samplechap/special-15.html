Tracks contain references to media samples such as sound or video. When you make a movie self-contained, any references to data in external files are resolved, and copies of the data are stored inside the movie file itself. What's more, the data samples are interleaved for smooth delivery. </P><P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId-7843"></A>If you don't make a movie self-contained, it stores references to the external files (the filenames and the relative path to the files). It also stores the byte offset into the files for each media sample. For such a movie to work, the data files cannot be edited, moved relative to the movie file, or renamed. Any directory names in the relative path must also remain unchanged.</P><P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId-7844"></A>For such a movie to work over the Web, there are additional requirements: the external files and any directories in the relative path must also exist on the Web server, they must have exactly the same names they had on the original computer, and these must be legal file and directory names in the Web server's file system.</P><P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId-7845"></A>There are so many ways to screw this up that it isn't even funny. As a general rule, you should just make the movie self-contained and not worry about it. </P><P CLASS="Body-below"><A NAME="pgfId-12028"></A>Still, there are times when you don't want to make a movie self-contained, as we'll describe in the next section. If you don't make a movie self-contained, you improve your chances of survival by doing the following:</P><UL><LI CLASS="Bullet-1"><A NAME="pgfId-7854"></A><TT CLASS="B1">&nbsp;</TT><TT CLASS="bold">	</TT>Make sure that the data files have only lowercase letters in their filenames; don't mix uppercase and lowercase.</LI><LI CLASS="Bullet-1"><A NAME="pgfId-7857"></A><TT CLASS="B1">&nbsp;</TT><TT CLASS="bold">	</TT>Put all the data files in one directory, and save the movie to that same directory when you create it; that way there are no directory names in the path to the files.</LI></UL></td> </tr> </table><hr>| <a href=special-16.html>Next</a> | <a href=special-14.html>Prev</a> | <a href=special.html>Top</a> |<hr>Copyright 2002 by Academic Press<hr><BR><BR> <font size=+1>				<A HREF="../QT4WebBook.htm">Home</A> | <A HREF="../updates.htm">Updates</A> | <A HREF="../corrections.htm">Corrections</A> | <A HREF="../faq.htm">FAQ</A> | <A HREF="../toc.htm">Table of Contents</A> | <A HREF="special.html">Sample Chapter</a>				</font></BODY></HTML>
