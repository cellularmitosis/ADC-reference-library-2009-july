<b>NAME</b>
       vim - Vi IMproved, a programmers text editor

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>vim</b> [options] [file ..]
       <b>vim</b> [options] -<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">vim&nbsp;[options]vim</font>
       <b>vim</b> [options] -t tag

       <b>rvim</b> <b>rview</b> <b>rgvim</b> <b>rgview</b>

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       <b>Vim</b>  is  a  text  editor that is upwards compatible to Vi.  It can be used to edit all kinds of plain
       text.  It is especially useful for editing programs.

       There are a lot of enhancements above Vi: multi level undo, multi windows and buffers,  syntax  high-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lighting,&nbsp;highlighting,</font>
       lighting,  command  line  editing,  filename  completion,  on-line help, visual selection, etc..  See
       ":help vi_diff.txt" for a summary of the differences between <b>Vim</b> and Vi.

       While running <b>Vim</b> a lot of help can be obtained from the on-line help system, with the  ":help"  com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand.&nbsp;command.</font>
       mand.  See the ON-LINE HELP section below.

       Most often <b>Vim</b> is started to edit a single file with the command

            vim file

       More generally <b>Vim</b> is started with:

            vim [options] [filelist]

       If the filelist is missing, the editor will start with an empty buffer.  Otherwise exactly one out of
       the following four may be used to choose one or more files to be edited.

       file ..     A list of filenames.  The first one will be the current file and read  into  the  buffer.
                   The  cursor will be positioned on the first line of the buffer.  You can get to the other
                   files with the ":next" command.  To edit a file that starts  with  a  dash,  precede  the
                   filelist with "--".

       -           The  file  to  edit is read from stdin.  Commands are read from stderr, which should be a
                   tty.

       -t {tag}    The file to edit and the initial cursor position depends on  a  "tag",  a  sort  of  goto
                   label.  {tag} is looked up in the tags file, the associated file becomes the current file
                   and the associated command is executed.  Mostly this is used for  C  programs,  in  which
                   case  {tag}  could be a function name.  The effect is that the file containing that func-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;function</font>
                   tion becomes the current file and the cursor is positioned on the start of the  function.
                   See ":help tag-commands".

       -q [errorfile]
                   Start  in  quickFix mode.  The file [errorfile] is read and the first error is displayed.
                   If [errorfile] is omitted, the filename is obtained from the 'errorfile' option (defaults
                   to  "AztecC.Err"  for  the  Amiga, "errors.err" on other systems).  Further errors can be
                   jumped to with the ":cn" command.  See ":help quickfix".

       <b>Vim</b> behaves differently, depending on the name of the command (the executable may still be  the  same
       file).

       vim       The "normal" way, everything is default.

       ex        Start  in  Ex  mode.   Go to Normal mode with the ":vi" command.  Can also be done with the
                 "-e" argument.

       view      Start in read-only mode.  You will be protected from writing the files.  Can also  be  done
                 with the "-R" argument.

       gvim gview
                 The GUI version.  Starts a new window.  Can also be done with the "-g" argument.

       evim eview
                 The  GUI  version in easy mode.  Starts a new window.  Can also be done with the "-y" argu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment.&nbsp;argument.</font>
                 ment.

       rvim rview rgvim rgview
                 Like the above, but with restrictions.  It will not be possible to start shell commands, or
                 suspend <b>Vim.</b>  Can also be done with the "-Z" argument.

<b>OPTIONS</b>
       The options may be given in any order, before or after filenames.  Options without an argument can be
       combined after a single dash.

       +[num]      For the first file the cursor will be positioned on line "num".  If "num" is missing, the
                   cursor will be positioned on the last line.

       +/{pat}     For  the  first file the cursor will be positioned on the first occurrence of {pat}.  See
                   ":help search-pattern" for the available search patterns.

       +{command}

       -c {command}
                   {command} will be executed after the first file has been read.  {command} is  interpreted
                   as  an Ex command.  If the {command} contains spaces it must be enclosed in double quotes
                   (this depends on the shell that is used).  Example: Vim "+set si" main.c
                   Note: You can use up to 10 "+" or "-c" commands.

       -S {file}   {file} will be sourced after the first file has been read.   This  is  equivalent  to  -c
                   "source  {file}".   {file}  cannot start with '-'.  If {file} is omitted "Session.vim" is
                   used (only works when -S is the last argument).

       --cmd {command}
                   Like using "-c", but the command is executed just before processing any vimrc file.   You
                   can use up to 10 of these commands, independently from "-c" commands.

       -A          If <b>Vim</b> has been compiled with ARABIC support for editing right-to-left oriented files and
                   Arabic keyboard mapping, this option starts <b>Vim</b> in Arabic mode,  i.e.  'arabic'  is  set.
                   Otherwise an error message is given and <b>Vim</b> aborts.

       -b          Binary  mode.   A few options will be set that makes it possible to edit a binary or exe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cutable&nbsp;executable</font>
                   cutable file.

       -C          Compatible.  Set the 'compatible' option.  This will make <b>Vim</b> behave mostly like Vi, even
                   though a .vimrc file exists.

       -d          Start in diff mode.  There should be two or three file name arguments.  <b>Vim</b> will open all
                   the files and show differences between them.  Works like <a href="vimdiff.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/vimdiff">vimdiff(1)</a>.

       -d {device} Open  {device}  for  use  as  a   terminal.    Only   on   the   Amiga.    Example:   "-d
                   con:20/30/600/150".

       -D          Debugging.  Go to debugging mode when executing the first command from a script.

       -e          Start <b>Vim</b> in Ex mode, just like the executable was called "ex".

       -E          Start <b>Vim</b> in improved Ex mode, just like the executable was called "exim".

       -f          Foreground.   For  the  GUI  version,  <b>Vim</b> will not fork and detach from the shell it was
                   started in.  On the Amiga, <b>Vim</b> is not restarted to open a new window.  This option should
                   be  used  when <b>Vim</b> is executed by a program that will wait for the edit session to finish
                   (e.g. mail).  On the Amiga the ":sh" and ":!" commands will not work.

       --nofork    Foreground.  For the GUI version, <b>Vim</b> will not fork and detach  from  the  shell  it  was
                   started in.

       -F          If  <b>Vim</b> has been compiled with FKMAP support for editing right-to-left oriented files and
                   Farsi keyboard  mapping,  this  option  starts  <b>Vim</b>  in  Farsi  mode,  i.e.  'fkmap'  and
                   'rightleft' are set.  Otherwise an error message is given and <b>Vim</b> aborts.

       -g          If  <b>Vim</b>  has been compiled with GUI support, this option enables the GUI.  If no GUI sup-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">port&nbsp;support</font>
                   port was compiled in, an error message is given and <b>Vim</b> aborts.

       -h          Give a bit of help about the command line arguments and options.  After this <b>Vim</b> exits.

       -H          If <b>Vim</b> has been compiled with RIGHTLEFT support for editing right-to-left oriented  files
                   and  Hebrew  keyboard  mapping,  this  option starts <b>Vim</b> in Hebrew mode, i.e. 'hkmap' and
                   'rightleft' are set.  Otherwise an error message is given and <b>Vim</b> aborts.

       -i {viminfo}
                   When using the viminfo file is enabled, this option sets the filename to use, instead  of
                   the default "~/.viminfo".  This can also be used to skip the use of the .viminfo file, by
                   giving the name "NONE".

       -L          Same as -r.

       -l          Lisp mode.  Sets the 'lisp' and 'showmatch' options on.

       -m          Modifying files is disabled.  Resets the  'write'  option.   You  can  still  modify  the
                   buffer, but writing a file is not possible.

       -M          Modifications  not  allowed.  The 'modifiable' and 'write' options will be unset, so that
                   changes are not allowed and files can not be written.  Note that these options can be set
                   to enable making modifications.

       -N          No-compatible mode.  Reset the 'compatible' option.  This will make <b>Vim</b> behave a bit bet-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ter,&nbsp;better,</font>
                   ter, but less Vi compatible, even though a .vimrc file does not exist.

       -n          No swap file will be used.  Recovery after a crash will be impossible.  Handy if you want
                   to  edit  a file on a very slow medium (e.g. floppy).  Can also be done with ":set uc=0".
                   Can be undone with ":set uc=200".

       -nb         Become an editor server for NetBeans.  See the docs for details.

       -o[N]       Open N windows stacked.  When N is omitted, open one window for each file.

       -O[N]       Open N windows side by side.  When N is omitted, open one window for each file.

       -p[N]       Open N tab pages.  When N is omitted, open one tab page for each file.

       -R          Read-only mode.  The 'readonly' option will be set.  You can still edit the  buffer,  but
                   will  be  prevented  from  accidently  overwriting a file.  If you do want to overwrite a
                   file, add an exclamation mark to the Ex command, as in ":w!".  The -R option also implies
                   the  -n  option  (see  below).  The 'readonly' option can be reset with ":set noro".  See
                   ":help 'readonly'".

       -r          List swap files, with information about using them for recovery.

       -r {file}   Recovery mode.  The swap file is used to recover a crashed  editing  session.   The  swap
                   file  is a file with the same filename as the text file with ".swp" appended.  See ":help
                   recovery".

       -s          Silent mode.  Only when started as "Ex" or when the "-e" option was given before the "-s"
                   option.

       -s {scriptin}
                   The script file {scriptin} is read.  The characters in the file are interpreted as if you
                   had typed them.  The same can be done with the command ":source! {scriptin}".  If the end
                   of the file is reached before the editor exits, further characters are read from the key-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">board.&nbsp;keyboard.</font>
                   board.

       -T {terminal}
                   Tells <b>Vim</b> the name of the terminal you are using.  Only required when the  automatic  way
                   doesn't  work.   Should be a terminal known to <b>Vim</b> (builtin) or defined in the termcap or
                   terminfo file.

       -u {vimrc}  Use the commands in the file {vimrc} for initializations.  All the other  initializations
                   are  skipped.  Use this to edit a special kind of files.  It can also be used to skip all
                   initializations by giving the name "NONE".  See ":help  initialization"  within  vim  for
                   more details.

       -U {gvimrc} Use  the  commands  in the file {gvimrc} for GUI initializations.  All the other GUI ini-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tializations&nbsp;initializations</font>
                   tializations are skipped.  It can also be used to skip all GUI initializations by  giving
                   the name "NONE".  See ":help gui-init" within vim for more details.

       -V[N]       Verbose.   Give messages about which files are sourced and for reading and writing a vim-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">info&nbsp;viminfo</font>
                   info file.  The optional number N is the value for 'verbose'.  Default is 10.

       -v          Start <b>Vim</b> in Vi mode, just like the executable was called "vi".   This  only  has  effect
                   when the executable is called "ex".

       -w {scriptout}
                   All  the  characters  that  you type are recorded in the file {scriptout}, until you exit
                   <b>Vim.</b>  This is useful if you want to create a script file to be  used  with  "vim  -s"  or
                   ":source!".  If the {scriptout} file exists, characters are appended.

       -W {scriptout}
                   Like -w, but an existing file is overwritten.

       -x          Use encryption when writing files.  Will prompt for a crypt key.

       -X          Don't connect to the X server.  Shortens startup time in a terminal, but the window title
                   and clipboard will not be used.

       -y          Start <b>Vim</b> in easy mode, just like the executable was called "evim" or "eview".  Makes <b>Vim</b>
                   behave like a click-and-type editor.

       -Z          Restricted mode.  Works like the executable starts with "r".

       --          Denotes  the  end  of  the options.  Arguments after this will be handled as a file name.
                   This can be used to edit a filename that starts with a '-'.

       --echo-wid  GTK GUI only: Echo the Window ID on stdout.

       --help      Give a help message and exit, just like "-h".

       --literal   Take file name arguments literally, do not expand wildcards.  This has no effect on  Unix
                   where the shell expands wildcards.

       --noplugin  Skip loading plugins.  Implied by -u NONE.

       --remote    Connect  to  a  Vim server and make it edit the files given in the rest of the arguments.
                   If no server is found a warning is given and the files are edited in the current Vim.

       --remote-expr {expr}
                   Connect to a Vim server, evaluate {expr} in it and print the result on stdout.

       --remote-send {keys}
                   Connect to a Vim server and send {keys} to it.

       --remote-silent
                   As --remote, but without the warning when no server is found.

       --remote-wait
                   As --remote, but Vim does not exit until the files have been edited.

       --remote-wait-silent
                   As --remote-wait, but without the warning when no server is found.

       --serverlist
                   List the names of all Vim servers that can be found.

       --servername {name}
                   Use {name} as the server name.  Used for the current Vim, unless  used  with  a  --remote
                   argument, then it's the name of the server to connect to.

       --socketid {id}
                   GTK GUI only: Use the GtkPlug mechanism to run gvim in another window.

       links, see ":help").  All documentation files can be viewed in this  way,  for  example  ":help  syn-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tax.txt".&nbsp;syntax.txt".</font>

<b>AUTHOR</b>
       Most  of <b>Vim</b> was made by Bram Moolenaar, with a lot of help from others.  See ":help credits" in <b>Vim.</b>
       <b>Vim</b> is based on Stevie, worked on by: Tim Thompson, Tony Andrews and G.R.  (Fred)  Walter.   Although
       hardly any of the original code remains.

<b>BUGS</b>
       Probably.  See ":help todo" for a list of known problems.

       Note that a number of things that may be regarded as bugs by some, are in fact caused by a too-faith-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ful&nbsp;too-faithful</font>
       ful reproduction of Vi's behaviour.  And if you think other things are bugs "because Vi does it  dif-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ferently",&nbsp;differently",</font>
       ferently",  you  should take a closer look at the vi_diff.txt file (or type :help vi_diff.txt when in
       Vim).  Also have a look at the 'compatible' and 'cpoptions' options.
