With         the introduction of Power Macintosh systems, OSL was         repackaged as a shared library. When the Code Fragment         Manager 68K Runtime Enabler (CFM-68K) was released, it         became a fat library containing both Power PC and CFM-68K         versions of OSL.</P>                  <P id = introtext>This Technote lists all versions of OSL that are         currently available, along with a brief history and         description of each one, and recommendations as to which         versions to use (and not use).</P>                  <P id = introtext>If you develop Macintosh applications that provide OSA         object model support, or need to use applications that do,         you should read this Technote.</P>         <!-- end_intro_text --><!-- begin_date --><h3>&nbsp;Updated: [Nov 02 1998]</h3><!-- end_date -->                </TD>             </TR>          </TABLE> <!-- end_header_box --><BR><BR><hr width=500 align=center><BR><BR>          <!-- begin_content -->         <P><A NAME=Section1></A></P>                  <H2>In the Beginning of         OSL</H2>                  <P>When the OSL was first released, it was a 68K static         library (<CODE>AEObjectSupportLib.o</CODE>) that was         statically linked into applications that supported the OSA         object model. This is still the case for classic 68K         applications.</P>                  <P>With the release of the Power Macintosh and the         accompanying CFM shared library application model, it was         decided that a shared library version of the OSL         (<CODE>ObjectSupportLib</CODE>), rather than an ".o" file,         should be provided for PowerPC-native applications. This         would allow native applications to take advantage of the         shared library application model.</P>                  <P>The OSL PowerPC shared library was released as version         1.0.2. It was included with the first Power Macintosh system         software (version 7.1.2) and the AppleScript SDK version         1.1. It is currently still available on the Mac OS SDK CDs.         This version of the OSL has a number of known bugs in its         handling of <CODE>whose</CODE> clauses. (These bugs are         listed in the <A HREF = "#Section3">Known Bugs in the OSL</A>         section of this Technote.)</P>                  <P>This first shared library introduced the first OSL-shared         library problem. The OSL was written in Pascal, but there         were no PowerPC Pascal compilers, so it contained a small         PowerPC-native library that loaded a 68K code resource         containing the OSL.</P>                  <P>But this loading was not done properly; the         <CODE>ObjectSupportLib</CODE>'s resource file often ended up         in the middle of an application's resource chain. This         problem was worked around in system 7.5.2 by forcing the         Finder to load the OSL when it started up, thus forcing         OSL's resource file to be located in the system, where it         did no harm. This work-around masked the problem for all         system versions after 7.5.2, but the problem is still there         for earlier system versions.</P>                  <P>After the introduction of the Power Macintosh, work began         to convert the OSL source code from Pascal to C. This         conversion was needed in order to provide a shared library         containing both PowerPC and CFM-68K code. The converted fat         OSL was released as version 1.0.4, which was included on the         E.T.O. CD-ROM releases until recently.</P>                  <P>There were a number of problems, however, with this         version of the OSL, the worst of which was that a Gestalt         selector installed by version 1.0.2 was not being installed         by version 1.0.4. This prevented applications that         tested for this Gestalt selector from detecting the         presence of the OSL shared library.</P>                <BR><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=550><TR><td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><P><B>Note:</B><BR>Note: A Gestalt selector is not the best method for         detecting the presence of the OSL, but this decision was         made early in the development of the code fragment model, and         the liabilities of using Gestalt were not yet well         understood. The preferred method would have been to have         developers compare a symbol in the library to         <CODE>kUnresolvedCFragSymbolAddress</CODE>. (For details of         this process, see <A HREF = "tn1083.html"> Technote 1083:          "Weak-Linking to a Code Fragment Manager-based Shared         Library"</A>.)</P></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><BR>                                    <P>The other major problem with this version of the OSL was         a number of bugs in the code that handled <CODE>whose</CODE>         clause resolution (in addition to those previously         mentioned). These bugs would cause an application to return         incorrect results and/or error messages when they were         presented with valid requests. Because of the missing         Gestalt selector which prevented this version's use, the         <CODE>whose</CODE> clause resolution bugs were not         discovered until much later.</P>               <H3>No Code Changes, Just Version         Changes</H3>                  <P>Somewhere between versions 1.0.2 and 1.0.4, a mistake was         made in the build process for the AppleScript 1.1 SDK, which         led to version 1.0.2 of the OSL being released as version         1.1. There is no difference in the actual code, only a new         version number.</P>                  <P>This meant we now had a 1.1 version which is really older         than version 1.0.4. But installers complain when you try to         install v1.0.4 over 1.1 because they think you are replacing         a newer version with an older one. So when Apple shipped the         Apple Telecom software version of OSL, 1.0.4 was changed to         1.1.1. This allowed the installer to replace the old version         with the new. Again, no code changes, just a version change.         (All the old problems, of course, were still there.)</P>                  <P>This is the point where many people started having         problems; we now had a situation where a (generally)         well-behaved version 1.1 was being replaced with a broken         version 1.1.1.</P>               <H3>A Valiant Attempt To Fix         Things</H3>                  <P>The AppleScript team, at this point, decided that enough         was enough -- it was time to move forward and fix things.         They released a version that fixed the Gestalt selector         problem and called it 1.1.1. But no one had told them about         the Apple Telecom OSL version 1.1.1, so they changed the         version to 1.1.2. But, again, someone else had already made         a limited release of an OSL version 1.1.2.</P>                  <P>This was unfortunate, but not a major problem -- they         just incremented the version to 1.1.3. This version, which         contained the fixed Gestalt selector, got a limited         developer release. Now the applications which         couldn't load it before due to the Gestalt selector bug         could use the OSL. But when these applications loaded the         OSL, they revealed all sorts of interesting behaviors         resulting from the OSL's inability to resolve         <CODE>whose</CODE> clauses. (Remember that no one had         actually executed this code before the Gestalt bug was         fixed.)</P>               <H3>Back to the Drawing         Board</H3>                  <P>The AppleScript team started looking at the 1.0.4/1.1.1         code stream in more detail and, after considering what a fix         might mean to the stability of existing applications, it was         decided that the risk of further trouble was too great. The         decision was made to return to the older 1.0.2/1.1 code         stream for the next release of the OSL.</P>                  <P>As a result, the resource-loading source stream in         version 1.0.2 was revised so it could be compiled as a         native PowerPC and CFM-68K library. The resource-loading bug         was also addressed. This revised library was tested, sent to         a small group of developers for further testing, and then         approved for final build as version 1.1.4.</P>                  <P>Along the way, though, there was a new wrinkle added to         this story. In order to fit in with the Mac OS reference         release strategy, the file's creator type got changed, along         with its version number, which changed to 1.1.6.</P>         <BR><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=550><TR><td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><P><B>Note:</B><BR>Version 1.1.4 appears on the Developer CD Series                  and the Mac OS SDK CD, while version 1.1.6 appears                  on certain E.T.O. CDs.</P></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><BR>                                <P>But we still have more to our story. It seems that the         test suite used to validate the OSL tested for the presence         of the Gestalt selector, but did not determine if it was         properly installed. Basically, native OSL resource-loading         code wasn't doing the right thing when it installed its         Gestalt selector, which could lead to crashes in certain         situations.</P>                  <P>In the meantime, Version 1.1.6 was included as part of         the Harmony (Mac OS 7.6) f3 build that was seeded to         developers. When this latest OSL problem was discovered, the         decision was made to take the version 1.0.2 of OSL and         reversion it (again) as version 1.1.8. This is the version         of OSL that is included in the GM version of Mac OS 7.6.</P>                  <P>The biggest problem with this version is that it isn't         fat, as it doesn't contains CFM-68K code (recall that 1.0.2         didn't, either). This wasn't an immediate problem, since Mac         OS 7.6 shipped without support for CFM-68K. In fact, 7.6         explicitly checks for the presence of the current CFM-68K         extension and disables it to prevent its loading with this         version of the system. If you can't run CFM-68K, you don't         need a fat OSL.</P>                  <H3>A New Hope</H3>                  <P>Thanks to the efforts of a number of engineers, the OSL         got a more thorough rewrite which fixed both the Gestalt         selector and resource file bugs. The testing was completed         and the problems were resolved. This time, the OSL was         released as version 1.2, which now generally works as         expected.
