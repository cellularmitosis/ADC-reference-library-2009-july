<h1> Editing Your Project's Source Files</h1>
</a><a name="7287">
Every component in your project has a code file whose name is the name of the component followed by the appropriate extension (<strong>.java</strong> for Java, <strong>.m</strong> for Objective-C, and <strong>.wos</strong> for WebScript). Your project may use different languages for different components. <p>
</a><a name="7317">
Each component's code specifies the component's behavior. Each component is actually a subclass of WOComponent. This class has standard methods (such as <strong>awake</strong> and <strong>init</strong>) that you may want to override (see <a href = "../DevGuide/DevGuideTOC.html" ><em>WebObjects Developer's Guide</a> </em>for more information on these methods). You can also write your own methods and bind them to dynamic elements in your component (see <a href="DynamicElements1.html#411">"Working With Dynamic Elements"</a>, as well as the <a href = "../Reference/DynamicElements/DynamicElementsTOC.html"><em>Dynamic Elements Reference</a></em>, for information on binding dynamic elements).<p>
</a><a name="7352">
In addition to the component's code, each project has an <em>application code file </em>(<strong>Application.java</strong>, <strong>Application.m</strong>, or <strong>Application.wos</strong>) and a <em>session code file </em>(<strong>Session.java</strong>, <strong>Session.m</strong>, or <strong>Session.wos</strong>). These files implement your applications custom subclasses of WOApplication and WOSession.<p>
</a><a name="7442">
When you first create your project using the Wizard, you specify the language you want to use (see <a href="SettingUp4.html#9594">"Choosing the Programming Language"</a>). This language applies to the application and session code, as well as to the code for your initial component, Main. Other components may be written in different languages.<p>
</a><a name="7446">
Regardless of the language you select, all source code for classes appear in the Classes suitcase. On disk, they are located at the top level of the project directory.<p>

To save changes in your code, choose File <img src="arrow.gif">Save. <p>
</a><a name="8499">
<strong>Note:</strong> WebObjects Builder gets information from Project Builder about variables and methods in your code. If you add or delete a variable or method, WebObjects Builder doesn't get the updated information until you save the file.<p>
