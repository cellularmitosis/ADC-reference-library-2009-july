File: ImageUtils.h

Abstract: This file declares the core functionality of the sample.
	IICreateImage loads and creates the ImageInfo struct that is core to the sample
	IISaveImage saves the transformed image to a JPEG.
	IIApplyTransformation shows how to rotate about center, scale, and translate the image
	IIDrawImage draws the image into the given context
	IIDrawImageTransformed calls IIApplyTransformation and IIDrawImage to do both at once
		while preserving the original context's CTM
	IIRelease releases the ImageInfo struct allocated by IICreateImage

Version: 1.0
