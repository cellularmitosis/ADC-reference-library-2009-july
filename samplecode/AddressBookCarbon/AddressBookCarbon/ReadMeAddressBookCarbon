AddressBookCarbon 1.0

The AddressBookCarbon sample code demonstrates some basic manipulations of the Mac OS X 10.2.x (and beyond) Address Book api. It shows how to add information to the Address Book, and how to extract information from the Address Book. The AddressBook.framework, which provides this functionality, is only available in Mac OS X 10.2.x (and beyond). This sample will not run as is on systems prior to Mac OS X 10.2.x.
