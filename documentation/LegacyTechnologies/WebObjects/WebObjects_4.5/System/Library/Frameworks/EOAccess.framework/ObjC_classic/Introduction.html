The classes and protocols thatmake up the EOAccess framework allow your applications to interactwith database servers at a high level of abstraction. These classesmake up what is known as the access layer. The access layer is dividedinto two main parts:</p><ul><li>The <em>database level</em>, whichallows applications to treat records as full-fledged enterpriseobjects.</li><li>The <em>adaptor level</em>, which provides server-independentdatabase access.</li></ul><p>Working with the access layer allows you to have a finer levelof control over database operations.</p><br><h2>EOAccess Framework Class Hierarchy</h2><p>The EOAccess class hierarchy is rooted in the Foundation Framework'sNSObject class. The remainder of the EOAccess Framework consistsof several related groups of classes, a few miscellaneous classes, anda number of protocols.</p><br><h2>The Adaptor Level</h2><p>The adaptor level deals with database rows packaged as dictionaries.The adaptor level is primarily made up of the following classes:</p><ul><li>EOAdaptor is an abstract class that providesconcrete subclasses with a structure for connecting to a database.</li><li>EOAdaptorChannel is an abstract class that provides its concretesubclasses with a structure for performing database operations.</li><li>EOAdaptorContext is an abstract class that defines transactionhandling in Enterprise Objects Framework applications.</li><li>EOAdaptorOperation is a class that represents a primitiveoperation in a database server and all the necessary informationrequired by the operation.</li><li>EOLoginPanel is an abstract class that defines how users providedatabase login information.</li><li>EOSQLExpression is an abstract superclass that defines howto build SQL statements for adaptor channels.</li></ul><br><h2>The Database Level</h2><p>The database level is where enterprise objects are createdfrom the dictionaries retrieved by the adaptor level. It's alsowhere snapshotting is performed. The database level is primarilymade up of the following classes:</p><ul><li>EODatabase is a class that represents a singledatabase server.</li><li>EODatabaseChannel is a class that represents an independentcommunication channel to the database server.</li><li>EODatabaseContext is subclass of EOObjectStore for accessingrelational databases, creating and saving objects based on EOEntitydefinitions in an EOModel.</li><li>EODatabaseOperation is a class that represents an operation-insert,update, or delete-to perform on an enterprise object and all thenecessary information required to perform the operation.</li></ul><br><h2>The Modeling Classes</h2><p>A model defines, in entity-relationship terms, the mappingbetween enterprise object classes and a database. The followingare the principal modeling classes in the EOAccess framework:</p><ul><li>EOAttribute is a class that represents a column,field or property in a database, and associates an internal namewith an external name or expression by which the property is knownto the database.</li><li>EOEntity is a class that describes a table in a database andassociates a name internal to the Framework with an external nameby which the table is known to the database.</li><li>EOJoin is a class that describes one source-destination attributepair for an EORelationship.</li><li>EOModel is a class that represents a mapping between a databaseschema and a set of classes based on the entity-relationship model.</li><li>EOModelGroup is a class that represents an aggregation ofrelated models.</li><li>EORelationship is a class that describes an association betweentwo entities, based on attributes of those two entities.</li><li>EOStoredProcedure is a class that represents a stored proceduredefined in a database, and associates a name internal to EOF withan external name known to the database.</li></ul><br><h2>Faulting</h2><p>These classes implement or are used to implement object faulting:</p><ul><li>EOAccessArrayFaultHandler is a subclass of EOAccessGenericFaultHandlerthat implements a fault for an array of enterprise objects.</li><li>EOAccessFaultHandler is a subclass of EOAccessGenericFaultHandlerthat implements an object fault for enterprise objects.</li><li>EOAccessGenericFaultHandler is an abstract class that helpsan EOAccessFault to fire by fetching data using an EODatabaseContext.</li></ul><br><h2>Additions to Other Frameworks</h2><p>The EOAccess framework adds methods to a number of classesin different frameworks:</p><ul><li>EOGenericRecord Additions adds one method tothe control layer's class, for returning a generic record'sassociated EOEntity.</li><li>EOObjectStoreCoordinator Additions adds two methods to theEOControl class for accessing the coordinator's EOModelGroup.</li><li>EOQualifier Additions adds one method to the class, for "rerooting"a qualifier to another entity.</li><li>NSString Additions adds two methods to the class, to convertmodeling object names to database schema names, and database schemanames to modeling object names.</li></ul><br><h2>Extensions of EOControl Classes</h2><p>The EOAccess framework also has a number of other useful classes,including:</p><ul><li>EODatabaseDataSource is a concrete subclass ofEODataSource that fetches objects based on an EOModel, using anEODatabaseContext that services the data source's EOEditingContext.</li><li>EOEntityClassDescription is a subclass of the control layer'sEOClassDescription and extends the behavior of enterprise objectsby deriving information about them from an associated EOModel.</li><li>EOSQLQualifier is a subclass of EOQualifier that containsunstructured text that can be transformed into an SQL expression.</li></ul><br><h2>Delegates</h2><p>A number of EOAccess classes delegate behavior. The delegatemethods are defined in these protocols:</p><ul><li>An EOAdaptorChannel delegate receives messagesfor nearly every operation that would affect data in the databaseserver, and it can preempt, modify, or track these operations.</li><li>A EOAdaptorContext delegate receives messages for any transactionbegin, commit, or rollback, and it can preempt, modify, or trackthese operations.</li><li>An EOAdaptor delegate implements a method that can performa database-specific transformations on a value.</li><li>An EODatabaseContext delegate can intervene when objects arecreated and when they're fetched from the database.</li><li>An EOModelGroup class delegate implements a method that returnsthe default model group.</li><li>An EOModelGroup delegate influences how the model group findsand loads models.</li></ul><br><h2>Miscellaneous Classes and Protocols</h2><ul><li>EOCustomClassArchiving is an informal protocolthat defines methods that can write any object that conforms toNSCoding to the database as binary data, as generated by NSArchiver.</li><li>EOEditingContext Additions</li><li>EOPropertyListEncoding declares methods that read and writeobjects to property lists.</li><li>EOQualifierSQLGeneration declares two methods that are adoptedby qualifier classes to qualify fetches from a database.</li></ul><br><a href="EOAccessTOC.html"><img src="../../../../../images/up.gif" border="0" alt="Table of Contents"></a> </BODY></HTML>
