The giraffe is a cud-chewing hoofed mammal that lives in herds in savanna and open bush country. It is native to most of Africa south of the Sahara desert andfeeds primarily on a variety of Acacia and Combretum trees. The giraffe can growto a height of 18 feet or more and run at 30 miles per hour. Males can weigh upto a ton and a half while females typically weight a half ton.Female giraffes give birth standing up, and the young calf is dropped six feet to the ground onto its head. The baby giraffes are 6 feet tall when born and weigh 110-120 pounds. It takes four years to reach maturity. Giraffes live about 20-25 years. Giraffes have the highest known blood pressure in any mammal at 280/180 mm of mercury. This pressure (twice our own) and a heart beat of 170 times per minute helps the giraffe keep a steady flow of blood and oxygen to its brain. The giraffe is a protected species in Eastern Africa.
