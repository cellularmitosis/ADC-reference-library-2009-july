ðAbout JDirect and JDirectTalkerMRJ SDK 2.1 Early Access 2 (EA2)Alpha Release (MRJ SDK 2.1a1c5)September 1, 1998About JDirect and JDirectTalkerJDirectTalker is a simple example of how to use Apple's JDirect technology to access APIs imported from code fragments, the Macintosh implemention of shared libraries.  For more information about JDirect, see the document JDirect Note.pdf in the JDirect folder. This example uses AppleÕs Speech Manager to provide text-to-speech capabilities inside a Java application.The JDirectTalker class provides a simple java wrapper around the Mac OS Speech Manager.  To invoke the Speech Manager, JDirectTalker uses native methods which JDirect binds directly to the SpeechLib shared library. The MRJTalkTest class is a simple java application which uses JDirectTalker to display and speak a short message._______________________________© 1995-1998 Apple Computer.
