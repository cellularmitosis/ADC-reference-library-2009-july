Read Me file for the Preserve68KRegsActiveProc.xcoff and Preserve68KRegsSendProc.xcoff libraries for use with AppleScriptv 1.1The header files included in this package contain complete documentation for the use of these libraries. Purpose:To provide 68K wrapper functions, named Preserve68KRegsActiveProc and Preserve68KRegsSendProc, to be installed as an OSAActiveProc or OSASendProc, respectively.The purpose of these functions are to save and restore a group of emulated 68K registers around calls to a PowerPC active or send function, which in turn calls YieldToAnyThread.This work-around is necessary because, at the current time, the PPC Thread Manager doesn't do anything with the emulated 68K registers, and without this work-around, the OSA AppleScript component get totally confused and blows-up.Andy Bachorski3/97
