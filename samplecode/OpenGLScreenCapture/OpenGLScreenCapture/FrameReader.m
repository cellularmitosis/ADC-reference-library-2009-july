File: FrameReader.m

Abstract: Implements the FrameReader class which allows you to grab frames
from an OpenGL context. The FrameReader is initialized with an OpenGL context 
to read from and the dimensions of the frames to grab. The class contains 
code for asynchronous texture fetching to grab the frames from the OpenGL 
context. Asynchronous texture fetching improves performance significantly. 
Frame grabbing is performed by calling -readScreenAsyncOnSeparateThread
for asynchronous capture.

 /* This FrameReader class in this sample is a generic readback 
 class which shows the following technique for readback: 
    - asynchronous texture fetching. 

 Although it works well for this sample, it could be optimized 
 by the application managing:

  * It's own state thus removing the need for the glGets....
  * Double-buffering the readback. This sample currently only uses 1 
  texture for readback.    

 For real asynchronous behavior, you need to double buffer as follows:

    glCopyTexSubImage -> texture 0
    glCopyTexSubImage -> texture 1
	    glGetTexImage -> texture 0
    glCopyTexSubImage -> texture 0
	    glGetTexImage -> texture 1
    glCopyTexSubImage -> texture 1
