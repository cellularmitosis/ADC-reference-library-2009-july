You can solve this problem by limiting the amount of state stored in memory or by storing state using some other means, as described in the chapter <a href="StateTOC.html#9124">"Managing State"</a>. You can also set up the application so that it shuts down if certain conditions occur, as described in the section <a href="Deployment6.html#4723">"Automatically Terminating an Application"</a>. <p></a><a name="6311">One common mistake is neglecting to set a session time-out value. By default, sessions almost never expire, so the application may be using valuable memory to store sessions that users have long forgotten. When you set the session time-out value, if the session is idle for that amount of &#32;time, it terminates and its state is removed from memory. This is described in more detail in "<a href="StateTOC.html#9124">Managing State</a>."<p></a><P> <a href="Deployment.html"><IMG SRC="ArrowUp.gif">Table of Contents</a> <a href="Deployment12.html"><IMG SRC="ArrowRight.gif">Next Section</a><P></body></html>
