    // If the completion yields a single, non-ambiguous file match and this is turned on, then a space character will be appended to the match.  This is off by default because it is unsuitable if the result is to be used as a simple path.

- (BOOL)appendsSlashOnDirectoryMatch;
- (void)setAppendsSlashOnDirectoryMatch:(BOOL)flag;
    // If the completion yields a single, non-ambiguous directory match and this is turned on, then a slash character will be appended to the match (always a forward slash, run the path through stringByStandardizingPath if you want backslash on windows).  This is on by default since the presence of the slash doesn't confuse anything I'm aware of.
