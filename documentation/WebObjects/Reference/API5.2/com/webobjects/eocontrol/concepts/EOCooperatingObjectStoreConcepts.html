  <h2>Object Storage Abstraction</h2>
  The control layer provides an infrastructure that's independent of your 
  application's storage  mechanism (typically a database) by defining an API 
  for an 'intelligent' repository of objects,  whether it's based on 
  external data or whether it manages objects entirely in memory.  
  EOObjectStore is an abstract class that defines that basic API, setting up 
  the framework for  constructing and registering enterprise objects, 
  servicing object faults, and committing changes  made in an EOEditingContext. 
  Subclasses of EOObjectStore implement the API in terms of their specific 
  storage mechanism. 
  <P>
  EOEditingContext is the principal subclass of EOObjectStore and is used 
  for managing objects in memory. For stores based on external data, there 
  are several subclasses. EOCooperatingObjectStore defines stores that work 
  together to manage data from several distinct sources (such as different 
  databases). The access layer's EODatabaseContext is actually a subclass of 
  this class. A group of cooperating stores is managed by another subclass 
  of EOObjectStore, EOObjectStoreCoordinator. If you're defining a subclass 
  of EOObjectStore, it's probably one based on an external data repository, 
  and it should therefore inherit from EOCooperatingObjectStore so as to 
  work well with an EOObjectStoreCoordinator though this isn't required. <P>
  EODatabaseContext provides objects from relational databases and is 
  therefore provided by Enterprise Objects Framework's access layer. It is 
  the class that defines the interaction between the control and access 
  layers. Database contexts and other object stores based on external 
  data are often shared by several editing contexts to conserve database 
  connections. <P>
  <b>Note</b>: Note that EOCooperatingObjectStore, EOObjectStoreCoordinator, and
  EODatabaseContext are not provided by Java Client<P> <h3>Registering 
  Enterprise Objects</h3> An object store identifies its objects in two ways
  :<ul> <li>By reference for identification within a specific editing 
  context <li>By global ID for universal identification of the same record 
  among multiple stores. </ul>
  </ul> <P>
  A global ID is defined by three classes: EOGlobalID, EOKeyGlobalID, 
  and EOTemporaryGlobalID. EOGlobalID is an abstract class that forms the 
  basis for uniquing in Enterprise Objects Framework. EOKeyGlobalID is a 
  concrete subclass of EOGlobalID whose instances represent persistent IDs 
  based on the access layer's EOModel information: an entity and the primary 
  key values for the object being identified. An EOTemporaryGlobalID object 
  is used to identify a newly created enterprise object before it's saved to 
  an external store. <P> <h3>Servicing Faults</h3>
  For external repositories, an object store might delay fetching an object'
  s data, instead creating an empty enterprise object (called a fault). When 
  a fault is accessed (sent a message), it triggers its object store to 
  fetch its data and fill the fault with its data. This preserves both the 
  object's reference and its EOGlobalID, while saving the cost of fetching 
  data that might not be used. Faults are typically created for the 
  destinations of relationships for objects that are explicitly fetched.
