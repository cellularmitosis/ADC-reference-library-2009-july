// Stage 3 - Draw a 2K by 2K source image to an offscreen 512 x 512 bitmap context,
// effectively caching the original image. The test measures how fast drawing 
// the cached image takes. The cache alleviates the time taken to color match the
// image and also time required to downsample the image. 
// This cache technique is useful when the image has to be repeatedly draw at the
// same scale. 
// The cached image is a 32 bit ARGB image.
// The source image is created programattically as a gradient between colors.
// Returns: the number of operations per second for this stage
//
