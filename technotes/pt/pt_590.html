I have previouslysucceeded in using SADE on stand-alone code resources called from a standard Capplication, and with MPW tools.</p><p>I place the external code resource in the Omnis 5 application resource fork,when the external executes, SADE yields:</p><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=550><TR>	<td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><pre>  Internal fatal error! Please kill the target process! at uEXTERNAL+$0010 in  &quot;Omnis 5&quot;  EXTERNAL</pre>	</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><p>Note that the TRAP is at the breakpoint address, which makes sense. SomehowSADE is getting confused and failing to recognize the TRAP as the breakpoint.What's happening here?</p><P>It seems like that TRAP statement you got was something from outer spacebecause the trap-dispatching with Macintosh traps is handled by A-line trapswhose opcodes start with hex A. The TRAP opcode is never used as with otheroperating systems, such as A/UX.</p><p>The most likely reason for this behavior is that your code resources were movedaround, and SADE picked up whatever it found in that memory location - afterthat the CODE had moved to another place. In order for SADE to get access tothe real CODE resources you need to lock them.</p><h2>SADE "Cannot determine break address..." error</h2><P>Date Written:  4/9/91</p><P>Last reviewed:  6/14/93</p><p>What does the SADE error "Cannot determine break address: Could not determineaddress from available source information" mean and how do I fix it?</p><P>Two common problems are indicated by with SADE's "Cannot determine breakaddress: Could not determine address from available source information" errormessage are:</p><ol type="1" start="1">	<li>not all the source modules have been compiled with -sym on</li>	<li>one of the tools that produces .SYM file information does not conform to the latest format definition</li></ol><P>For the first problem, put breakpoints everywhere except for where the erroroccurs, and make sure all source code is compiled with the "-sym on" option.</p><p>If you can't set breakpoints, check for the second problem. The MPW 3.2 tools(compilers) generate the symbolic information that the Linker puts together forone single file, so eventually when you use an old tool it will not producegood symbolic information for the final .SYM file.</p><p>Check the latest Essentials*Tools*Objects (ETO) CD for the current SADE and MPWtools.</p><h2>SADE "Invalid A6..." error message</h2><P>Date Written:  5/9/91</p><P>Last reviewed:  6/14/93</p><p>What's the cause of the SADE error message, "Invalid A6, A6 must be greaterthan or equal to SP, and within valid stack range"?</p><P>The "Invalid A6, A6 must be greater than or equal to SP, and within valid stackrange" error message that you are receiving stems from a feature that wasplaced into SADE 1.3a5. There is a simple fix. You just need to change the<code>WantStackWindow</code> variable located in the <code>SadeStartup</code> file from 1 to 0. (The<code>WantStackWindow</code> variable is about 30 lines down from the top of the SadeStartupfile.)</P><P>When a user targets an application, SADE launches the application and runsuntil it hits an internally placed break point. At this point in time, theprogram is given a name and A6 is basically junk. The <code>WantStackWindow</code> basicallytells SADE to check to see if A6 is valid or not as the program is running.When SADE hits the break point, A6 is junk, so the user will receive this errormessage. As the user continues to run the application, A6 becomes valid and the"error" no longer exists.</p><p>To sum it up, when <code>WantStackWindow</code> is set to 1, and your program is not runningyou will receive this error. When <code>WantStackWindow</code> is set to 1, and your programis running, you will not receive this error. By setting <code>WantStackWindow</code> to 0,it doesn't check to see if A6 is valid; therefore, you will not receive theerror message.</p><h2>How MPW and SADE 1.0 work together</h2><P>Date Written:  5/3/89</p><P>Last reviewed:  6/14/93</p><p>Why is using SADE 1.0 to step through an MPW Tool so slow?</p><P>When MPW launches a Tool, it acts much like Finder launching an application.TheMPW shell now becomes the operating system for the Tool. But unlike Finder, MPWhas no hooks for a debugger like SADE. Because of this, SADE requires a hugeamount of overhead for each step operation it performs. For each stepoperation, SADE must:</p><ol type="1" start="1">	<li>Save its low memory space so that MPW's and the Tool's may be swapped in;</li>	<li>Restore MPW's as well as the Tool's low memory;</li>	<li>Perform the necessary debugging operation (step);</li>	<li><code>(Block)Move</code> the newly updated low memory to an area accessible by SADE (so that SADE's low memory may be restored). Once SADE is restored, it will want to report on the new low memory state. This is why low memory had to be copied to an area accessible by SADE;</li>	<li>Swap SADE's low memory space back in so that SADE can operate.</li></ol><h2>Why using SADE 1.0 to look at low memory is so slow</h2><P>Date Written:  5/3/89</p><P>Last reviewed:  6/14/93</p><p>Why is using SADE 1.0 to look at low memory so slow?</p><P>Since SADE needs to use low memory just like any other application, there issome overhead involved when using SADE to view low memory. Here is what SADEhas to do to view the target application's low memory:</p><ol type="1" start="1">	<li>Save its low memory space so that target application's may be swapped in;</li>	<li>Restore the target's low memory;</li>	<li><code>(Block)Move</code> the newly updated low memory to an area accessible by SADE (so that SADE's low memory may be restored). Once SADE is restored, it can report on the new low memory state. This is why low memory had to be copied to an area accessible by SADE;</li>	<li>Swap SADE's low-memory space back in so that SADE can now analyze the low memory it copied in step #3 above.</li></ol><h2>SADE and MacApp CString type conflict</h2><P>Date Written:  8/19/92</p><P>Last reviewed: 6/14/93</p><p>I'm having problems printing a <code>CString</code> from memory from SADE. For example:</p><p>does not print the string stored at $B64A12. What do I need to do?</p><P>The problem you encountered with getting SADE to cast a value to <code>CString</code> withina printf involves a type conflict between MacApp's declaration of a type named"CString" and SADE's built-in type named "CString". SADE will first match thetype against declarations from the application, in a case sensitive manner.Only if it fails to match will it then match against its built-in types in acase insensitive manner. So, by casting to <code>CSTRING</code> instead of CString you willget the result you desired.</p><h2>SADE requires 4-byte value for arithmetic operations</h2><P>Date Written:  8/19/92</p><P>Last reviewed:  6/14/93</p><p>The following SADE code gives me an "### Invalid expression operand type" online 05, unless I include line 03. Could you tell me why?</p><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=550><TR>	<td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><pre>01 define aTemp, bTemp, cTemp, dTemp, eTemp, fTemp, gTemp;02 aTemp := ^short(fExpandingView^)^  # Get Class ID03 aTemp := aTemp * 1                 # Multiple by sizeof(short) NOT USED04 bTemp := ^short(pClassTable)       # Get pClassTable address</pre>	</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P>The reason line 03 makes it work is that the constant one is treated as a4-byte value. Multiplying <code>aTemp</code> by 1 and assigning back to <code>aTemp</code> thereforeresults in <code>aTemp</code> being converted to a 4-byte value. <code>bTemp</code> being a pointer type,SADE requires a 4-byte value as the value to be added to it.</p><br>         <a name=Downloads></A>                  <P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></p><h2>Downloadables</H2>                  <TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <td width=50 align=left>                  <P ALIGN=center><img src="images/acrobatsmall.gif" width=22 height=23 align=middle alt="Acrobat gif"></P>               </TD>               <td align="left">                  <P>Acrobat version of this Note (34K).</P>               </TD>               <td width=60 align=left>                  <P><A HREF="pdf/pt_590.pdf">Download</A></P>               </TD>            </TR>                    </TABLE>         <BR></TD></TR></table></center><!-- begin_footer_information -->	<table width="680" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
