// Stage 5 - This measures how fast we can have an updating (i.e. mutable) 
// offscreen bitmap context to the window.
// The offscreen bitmap context is repeatedly modified using CoreGraphics 
// drawing calls. Alternatively we could have also modified the bitmap 
// data's bits directly if we had our own rendering engine.
// The test measures how fast drawing the modified bitmap context takes. 
// This technique demonstrates how to draw images (even if they are changing 
// frame to frame ). Use this technique when you need to modify the bitmap
// bits directly yourself.
// Note that the gradient is just used as a backdrop. 
// Returns: the number of operations per second for this stage
//
