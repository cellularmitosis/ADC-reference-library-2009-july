SCSI Simple Sample - A "simple" SCSI Manager sample.Copyright © 1994, Apple Computer Inc. All Rights Reserved.This is  a simple sample that illustrates how to call the originaland asynchronous SCSI Managers. In particular, it shows howto scan all SCSI buses for the presence of SCSI devices.It compiles on the following environments:Think C 7.0MPW 3.3.1MetroWerks DR3At this time, this program cannot be compiled in native mode forPower Macintosh because the "scsi.h" file has not been completelyconverted to the Universal Header format. However, the programdoes run in compatibility mode on Power Macintosh.Note that, if you are compiling for MetroWerks, you must buildthe resources (in file "SCSISimpleSample.µ.rsrc") by calling Rez- you can either build the MPW version first or make theMetroWerks option in the MakeFile.Because these sources build a half-dozen version of the sample,(three compilers, 68000 native, 68000 on Power Mac, PowerMac native someday), some notes on compatibility are in order:1. The program was originally written and debugged using    Think C on a Quadra 950.2. It was then compiled and tested using MPW 3.3.1.3. It was then compiled and tested using MetroWerks DR3.Each additional compiler found a different set of errors andwarnings. In all cases, optional warnings were turned on.Written by Martin Minow, MACDTS.minow@apple.comAppleLink: MINOW
