/************************************** * *  UDP chat sample *  ©1991 Apple Computer, MacDTS * *	Written by Steve Falkenburg 12/13/91 * *	this sample illustrates how to send and receive MacTCP UDP packets, setting up a simple *	connectionless chat program.  Instead of an outstanding read command, an ASR is *	used to inform the program there is data to be received.  This sample is written for *	Think C 5.0, but can be converted easily to MPW C. * *************************************/
