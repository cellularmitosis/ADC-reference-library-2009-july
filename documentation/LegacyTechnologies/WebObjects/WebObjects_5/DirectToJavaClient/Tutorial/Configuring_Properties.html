The specification settings-the Question, Task, andEntity pull-down lists-should be set to &lt;All&gt;, query, andMovie, respectively. The settings are probably correct, but if anyof the settings are different, change them. A simple way to setthe Task and Entity pull-down lists is to select the Movie tab inthe Query Window. The Assistant automatically updates to set theTask pull-down list to query and the Entity pull-down list to Movie.</p><p>Move <code>plotSummary</code> and <code>voting</code> tothe Other Property Keys list. Move <code>category</code> and <code>studio</code> toProperty Keys. Using the up and down arrows, order the propertiesas follows: <code>title</code>, <code>category</code>, <code>studio</code>.</p><p>Savethe changes, and restart the application (from the Assistant). TheMovie pane of the Query Window is reconfigured.</p><p>Notethat a Studio Name field is now available. This is because you specifiedthe <code>studio</code> relationshipas a property key for the query task. When a to-one relationship(such as <code>studio</code>) is specifiedas a property key, Direct to Java Client uses <i>identify</i> propertykeys of the relationship's destination object to represent therelationship in the user interface.</p></li></p><p><li>Examine the identify property keys for the Studio entity.<p>Inthe Assistant, choose <code>identify</code> fromthe Task pull-down list and choose Studio from the Entity pull-downlist. Observe that the Studio has one identify property key-<code>name</code>. Thisattribute is used to identify a particular Studio when it appearsin the user interface as a destination of a to-one relationship.</p><p>Oneexample of how the identify property keys are used is in the Moviepane of the Query Window. Movie's <code>studio</code> relationshipis specified as a query property key. To represent <code>studio</code> asa property key in the Query Window, Direct to Java Client uses the identifyproperty key (<code>name</code>) ofthe relationship's destination entity (Studio).</p><p>Anotherexample is the Studio part of a Movie window, in which the Movie'sStudio is identified by its <code>name</code>.</p></li></p><p><li>Modify the identify property keys for the Movie entity.<p>ChooseMovie from the Entity pull-down list, keeping the Task as <code>identify</code>.Movie has one identify property key, <code>title</code>.Since it's quite common for movie remakes to use the same nameas the original, a movie's title isn't always enough to identifyit. Add <code>dateReleased</code> toMovie's list of identify properties, and save the change.</p></li></p><p><li>Configure the property keys for listing Movies.<p>The propertykeys for the list task are used in result lists such as the onesin the Query Window. When you search for Movies, for example, theMovies in the result set are listed in the Query Window's table.The result table has a column for the list property keys, <code>title</code>, <code>category</code>, <code>dateReleased</code>, <code>posterName</code>, <code>revenue</code>, <code>trailerName</code>,and <code>plotSummary</code>. Thecolumns for these properties are crowded into the table, and manyaren't particularly helpful to users.</p><br><table border = "0" BGCOLOR="#E6E6E6"><tr><td scope="row"><p><b>Note: </b>Inaddition to the property keys listed above, <code>voting</code> isalso a list property key for the Movie entity. The <code>voting</code> relationshipdoesn't have a column in the results table. This is because Voting'sidentify property key is it's <code>movie</code> relationship, whichDirect to Java Client omits from the table view to avoid recursion.</p></td></tr></table><br><p>To pare down the set of columns, choose list from theAssistant's Task pull-down list, and choose Movie from the Entitypull-down list (if it isn't selected already). Move <code>posterName</code>, <code>revenue</code>, <code>trailerName</code>,and <code>plotSummary</code> to theOther Properties column.</p><p>So users can verify that allthe search criteria they specify is applied correctly, the list propertykeys should be a superset of the query properties. Since users cansearch for Movies by Studio, the list property keys should include <code>studio</code>,as well. Add <code>studio</code> to thelist property keys.</p><p>Save the changes. To see them, opena new Query Window.</p></li></p><p><li>Configure the property keys for Movie form windows.<p>Inthe Query Window, click New to create a Movie form window. The Assistant updatesto set the Task pull-down list to form and the Entity pull-downlist to Movie.</p><p>Examine the form window. As is most commonlythe case, the default property keys for the form task are correctfor this application. In general, the form window should allow usersto edit all of an entity's client class properties. However, youmight want to reorder the properties so they appear in differentlocations in the form window.</p><p>Using the up and downbuttons, order the properties as follows: <code>title</code>, <code>category</code>, <code>dateReleased</code>, <code>rated,revenue</code>, <code>posterName</code>, <code>trailerName</code>, <code>plotSummary</code>, <code>directors</code>, <code>roles</code>, <code>voting</code>, <code>reviews</code>, <code>studio</code>.Save the changes, and open a new Movie form window to see how theyaffect the form window layout.</p></li></p></ol><br>    <br><a href="Configuring_Entities.html" target="_right"><img src="../Images/previous.gif" border="0" alt="Previous"></a><a href="Configuring_Widgets.html" target="_right"><img src="../Images/next.gif" border="0" alt="Next"></a>&nbsp;<p><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="1">&#169; 2001 Apple Computer, Inc.</font></p></body></html>
