When defined to 0, the traditional NewPtr/DisposePtr toolbox calls are	used to request memory from the system.  When defined to 1, the multiprocessing	MPAllocateAligned/MPFree toolbox calls are used to request memory.  Note that the OS must	have MP 2.0 or later in order for MPAllocateAligned to be present.*/#ifndef _MWMT	#define _MWMT 0				/*- JWW 010426 -*/#endif#ifndef _MSL_IMP_EXP    		/*- cc 000315 -*/  	#define _MSL_IMP_EXP #endif #define _POSIX/*	JWW - You can comment out either of the following two defines to limit the MSL library	to using only one style of the file system APIs or the other.		When _MSL_USE_OLD_FILE_APIS is 1 (but _MSL_USE_NEW_FILE_APIS is 0), MSL operates exactly	the same way it always has since MSL first shipped.		When _MSL_USE_NEW_FILE_APIS is 1 (but _MSL_USE_OLD_FILE_APIS is 0), MSL uses the new	calls introduced in OS 9 to access the file system.  This means you get access to filenames	longer than 32 characters and files greater than 2GB.  You must be careful to not use this	configuration on a system which does not support the new APIs since no test is done to	see if the file system routines are actually present before using them.		When both _MSL_USE_NEW_FILE_APIS and _MSL_USE_OLD_FILE_APIS are 1, MSL tests the system	to determine if the enhanced file system APIs are available, and if so it uses them.  If not,	it falls back to the traditional method of accessing files.  This increases the library size	since twice the amount of file system code is necessary, but you get the safety of knowing	your code will operate properly on older systems.		It is an error for both _MSL_USE_NEW_FILE_APIS and _MSL_USE_OLD_FILE_APIS to be 0.*/#ifndef _MSL_USE_OLD_FILE_APIS	#define _MSL_USE_OLD_FILE_APIS 1#endif#ifndef _MSL_USE_NEW_FILE_APIS	#define _MSL_USE_NEW_FILE_APIS 1#endif#if _MSL_USE_NEW_FILE_APIS && (!defined(__POWERPC__))	/* JWW - _MSL_USE_NEW_FILE_APIS cannot be used with 68K targets */	#undef _MSL_USE_NEW_FILE_APIS	#define _MSL_USE_NEW_FILE_APIS 0#endif#if _MSL_USE_OLD_FILE_APIS && _MSL_USE_NEW_FILE_APIS	#define _MSL_USE_OLD_AND_NEW_FILE_APIS 1#elif _MSL_USE_OLD_FILE_APIS || _MSL_USE_NEW_FILE_APIS	#define _MSL_USE_OLD_AND_NEW_FILE_APIS 0#else	#error At least one of _MSL_USE_OLD_FILE_APIS or _MSL_USE_NEW_FILE_APIS must be on!#endif#define __MSL_LONGLONG_SUPPORT__/* #define _MSL_MALLOC_0_RETURNS_NON_NULL *//*	Turn on _MSL_OS_DIRECT_MALLOC for a malloc alternative that simply goes	straight to the OS with	no pooling.

If __ANSI_OVERLOAD__	is defined, and a C++ compiler is used, then these functions are available,	otherwise not.		There is one exception to the above rule:  double abs(double); is available	in <cmath> and <math.h> if the C++ compiler is used.  __ANSI_OVERLOAD__ has	no effect on the availability of this one function.	There is no need to recompile the C or C++ libs when this switch is flipped.	If _MSL_INTEGRAL_MATH is defined then in addition to the prototypes added by	__ANSI_OVERLOAD__, there are also non-standard integral versions of these	prototypes added as well.  This is to allow client code to put integral arguments	into math functions, and avoid ambiguous call errors.*/#define __ANSI_OVERLOAD__  /*- hh 990201 -*/#define _MSL_INTEGRAL_MATH/*For MacHeaders*//*if you are using PP or custom precompiled headers please 	1) set MSL_USE_PRECOMPILED_HEADERS to 0	2) make sure OLDROUTINENAMES, OLDROUTINELOCATIONS are set to false before 	   MacHeaders is precompiled or parts of Universal Headers are included*//*- hh 980727 -*/#ifndef OLDROUTINENAMES	#define OLDROUTINENAMES 0#endif#ifndef OLDROUTINELOCATIONS	#define OLDROUTINELOCATIONS 0#endif/*#define _MWMT 1*/#ifndef	MSL_USE_PRECOMPILED_HEADERS #define MSL_USE_PRECOMPILED_HEADERS	0	/*Set to have ansi_prefix include some form of MacHeaders*/#endif #if (MSL_USE_PRECOMPILED_HEADERS == 1 )	#ifndef USE_PRECOMPILED_MAC_HEADERS		#define	USE_PRECOMPILED_MAC_HEADERS	1  /*Set to 0 if you don't want to use precompiled MacHeaders*/	#endif	#if (USE_PRECOMPILED_MAC_HEADERS != 1 )		#include 	<MacHeaders.c>	#else		#if __POWERPC__			#ifdef __cplusplus				#include <MacHeadersPPC++>			#else				#include <MacHeadersPPC>			#endif		#endif	#endif#endif /*MSL_USE_PRECOMPILED_HEADERS*//*For ZoneRanger	If you want malloc to register its pools with ZoneRanger, add ZoneRanger.c	to your project.
