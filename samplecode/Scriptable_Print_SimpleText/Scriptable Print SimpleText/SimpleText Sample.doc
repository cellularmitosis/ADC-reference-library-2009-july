Hey!  What the Heck is this?!Sample: SimpleTextLanguage: CWPro 2 UH 3.2This example was SimpleText 1.4d16. It's the same sample that's been shipping since 1996. This version has code to "Extend the Print Record" from Technote 1161 and code to allow for scriptable printing added. Note that this code is copyright Apple Computer. The standard disclaimers apply. Here's the copyright information again for your reading enjoyment:You may incorporate this sample code into your applications without restriction, though the sample code has been provided "AS IS" and the responsibility for its operation is 100% yours.  However, what you are not permitted to do is to redistribute the source as "DSC Sample Code" after having made changes. If you're going to re-distribute the source, we require that you make it clear in the source that the code was descended from Apple Sample Code, but that you've made changes.Build notes:When building the 68K version of SimpleText with CodeWarrior, you should note that there is the TextFile.a.o file, which is built from the TextFile.a source. Since CodeWarrior doesn't have an assembler, this file has been assembled with MPW asm and is included with the project.In the folder, I've used labels to break the files into groups. Using the default label colors, Orange signifies files/folders for the build. Red is documentation. Pink are source-files. Light-Blue are header files. Dark Blue are resource files. Brown are files added to the project to add Printing Scriptability.
