No FPU Installed is                  equivalent to a Type 10 Error -- i.e., your program                  has attempted to execute an unknown instruction op                  code starting with the hex value F.</P>                                    <P>On a Power Macintosh, No FPU Installed means                  that some program has jumped to an area of data and                  has tried to execute any data word starting with                  the hex value F. The PowerPC chip has floating                  point support built in, but that floating-point                  support is different from the Motorola 680x0 family                  floating- point support. The Motorola 680x0 family                  uses an external floating-point unit. (There are                  also external memory management units (MMUs) and                  other specialized coprocessors.) Motorola 680x0                  CPUs use instructions starting with hex value F as                  instructions for these coprocessors.</P>                                    <P><A NAME=15298></A></P>                                    <H3>680x0 Microprocessor Instructions</H3>                                    <P>All Motorola 680x0 microprocessors have                  instructions consisting of at least one word (the                  operation word); some instructions can have up to                  eleven words (see the Motorola MC68020 32-bit                  Microprocessor User's Manual, Third edition, page                  3-1.)

This chip, the Floating Point Unit (FPU),                  communicates with the CPU via a special set of                  instructions called F-line instructions.

Such programs would have instructions in                  the program which start with the hex value F.

The 68040                  microprocessor has most of the 68882 FPU included                  on the chip. Not everything in the 68881/68882 FPU                  is in the 68040 chip, however -- just the routines                  that Motorola determined were most frequently used.                  The rest of the FPU routines are automatically                  emulated by software. Because the FPU is                  ``built-in,'' as it were, the 68040 chip handles                  instructions that start with an operation word                  beginning with the hex value F by itself. There is                  no way to add a coprocessor to a 68040 chip; the                  instructions are never brought out of the chip                  itself.</P>                                    <P>The 68040LC is a cost-reduced version of the                  68040 chip. Savings came about by removing the FPU                  portion of the chip. Not only does a 68040LC chip                  have no FPU, there is no way to add one.</P>                                    <P><A NAME=15428></A></P>                                    <H3>The Power Macintosh</H3>                                    <P>Power Macintosh computers emulate a Motorola                  68040LC, i.e., a machine without FPU support.

The                  bug causes the Color Picker to crash when trying to                  resolve a boot volume alias it makes at startup                  time. This problem exists in any system when Color                  Picker 2.0 or 2.0.1 is installed and the boot                  volume is not a removable drive. The fundamental                  cause of the problem is that the SCSI driver                  incorrectly marks the boot drive as a removable                  drive during the boot process and changes it to be                  properly marked as a fixed device after startup. To                  find its code, the Color Picker resolves the boot                  volume alias it made during startup. Since the                  alias passed to the Alias Manager is for a                  removable drive, the Alias Manager can't resolve                  the alias (since the device is now marked as                  fixed.) The Color Picker design did not anticipate                  the boot volume not being found. This results in a                  Type 11 error. The fix is to upgrade your SCSI                  driver to a later version.</P>                                                                        <H4>Calling a Routine That May Move Memory at                  Interrupt Time</H4>                                    <P>The Apple Media Kit, release 1.2, had a problem                  that could cause random errors. During a VBL task,                  AMK was calling SetCCursor. SetCCursor can possibly                  move memory. Moving memory during interrupt time is                  a very bad idea. The Memory Manager may be in an                  unstable state, such as compacting memory, when an                  interrupt routine gets called. This can cause a                  Type 11 error in native code.</P>                                    <P>A replacement cursor.c file has been provided in                  the Apple Media Tool/Programming Environment                  Runtime folder, and we do have a replacement                  Runtime Maker:Codes:Program file for Apple Media                  Tool.

Under these conditions, the control                  panel code wrote past the end of one of its                  buffers. This bug would manifest itself if the user                  opened the select zone dialog and the TCP/IP                  control panel was left open long enough for the NBP                  lookup calls for zones past the 256th zone to                  complete. This is corrected in OpenTransport 1.0.6                  and later, but is given here as an example of a                  Type 11 error.</P>                                                                        <H4>Insufficient Stack Space</H4>                                    <P>Heavy use of local variables or recursion may                  cause your program to run out of stack space. When                  this happens, you may have crashes that are                  difficult to track down. Increasing your program's                  stack is one solution. Whenever you are using a                  large number of local variables or recursive                  routines, you should increase your program's stack                  (using the procedure listed in Inside Macintosh:                  Memory on page 1-40).</P>                                    <P>As an extreme example, a faceless background                  application (documented in Technical Note PS 2) has                  only a 2K stack by default. A 68K application has                  24K of stack on most modern machines (8K if no                  Color QuickDraw is installed, 32K if A/UX is                  installed.) You can use the low memory accessor                  function LMGetDfltStack to find your current stack                  size. Native QuickDraw has several changes in                  algorithms that have increased the size of some                  structures. PowerPC alignment issues may cause the                  size of data structures to increase. Check your                  compiler documentation for further details.</P>                                    <P>To help detect collisions between the stack and                  the heap, a ``stack sniffer'' VBL task is installed                  that compares the current ends of the stack and                  heap and generates a system error 28 in case of a                  collision. Unfortunately, the Thread Manager is                  forced to disable the stack sniffer whenever it is                  installed. (This is because threads can have a                  stack in places where the stack sniffer doesn't                  expect them; if the stack sniffer is enabled, it                  would generate a system error 28.) This means you                  don't have the same level of protection as you did                  under older system software versions without the                  Thread Manager installed.</P>                                                                        <H4>Too Much Recursion in QuickDraw</H4>                                    <P>Native QuickDraw before version 2.4.1 used a                  recursive routine to handle regions. This recursive                  code could cause your stack to run into the heap                  when handling certain region shapes. Version 2.4.1                  of QuickDraw changed to a non-recursive routine                  which eliminates this error. (You can detect the                  version of QuickDraw using the Gestalt selector `qd                  `which returns a version.) In general, recursion on                  PowerMacs is dangerous unless you have substantial                  stack space available; PowerPC stack frames are                  very large, and putting many of them on the stack                  may quickly exhaust available stack.</P>                                                                        <H4>Interrupts Not Handled by Device Drivers</H4>                                    <P>Some Type 11 errors may legitimately be illegal                  interrupt vector errors, rather than simply                  unhandled exceptions in native code.

Unfortunately, most of extended PRAM is                  undocumented. (See Inside Macintosh:Operating                  System Utilities, chapter 7, Parameter RAM                  Utilities, for what details are documented.)

This may alleviate no FPU Installed errors,                  but it doesn't address the fundamental problem,                  namely that some software is executing unexpected                  data or making illegal calls to a non-existent                  FPU.</P>                                    <P>Upgrade any software you find that causes                  repeatable errors.</P>                                    <P><A NAME=Summary></A></P>                                    <H2>Summary</H2>                                    <P>There are no easy solutions for handling Type 11                  Error or No FPU Installed errors.
