This accessis considered private to the enterprise object and is invoked bythe framework to effect persistence on the object's behalf.</p><p>On the other hand, the basic key-value coding methods,  <a frame= "conv" href="../../Protocols/EOKeyValueCoding.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/EOKeyValueCoding/valueForKey:">valueForKey:</a><b> </b>and  <a frame= "conv" href="../../Protocols/EOKeyValueCoding.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/EOKeyValueCoding/takeValue:forKey:">takeValue:forKey:</a>, are the publicAPI to an enterprise object. They are invoked by clients externalto the object, such as for interactions with the user interfaceor with other enterprise objects.</p><p>All of the key-value coding methods access an object's propertiesby invoking property-specific accessor methods or by directly accessinginstance variables. The basic methods resolve the specified propertykey as follows:</p><ol><li>Search for a public accessor method based onthe specified key, invoking it if there is one. For example, witha key of "lastName", <b>takeValue:forKey:</b> looksfor a method named <b>set</b><em>Key</em><b>:</b>,and <b>valueForKey:</b><b> </b>looksfor a method named getLastName or lastName.</li><li>If a public accessor method isn't found and  <a frame= "conv" href="../../Protocols/EOKeyValueCoding.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/EOKeyValueCoding/useStoredAccessor">useStoredAccessor</a> returns YES,the basic methods search for a private accessor method based onthe key. For example, with a key of "lastName", <b>takeValue:forKey:</b> looksfor a method named <b>_set</b><em>Key</em><b>:</b>,and <b>valueForKey:</b><b> </b>looksfor a method named _getLastName or _lastName.</li><li>If an accessor method isn't found, the basic methods searchfor an instance variable based on the key and set the value directly.For the key "lastName", this would be <b>_lastName </b>or <b>lastName</b>.Note that <b>_lastName</b> is used only if  <a frame= "conv" href="../../Protocols/EOKeyValueCoding.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/EOKeyValueCoding/useStoredAccessor">useStoredAccessor</a> returns YES.</li></ol><p>The stored value methods use a different search order forresolving the property key: they search for a private accessor first,then for an instance variable, and finally for a public accessor.Enterprise object classes can take advantage of this distinctionto simply set or get values when properties are accessed throughthe private API (on behalf of a trusted source) and to perform additionalprocessing when properties are accessed through the public API.Put another way, the stored value methods allow you bypass the logicin your public accessor methods, whereas the basic key-value codingmethods execute that logic.</p><p>The stored value methods are especially useful in cases whereproperty values are interdependent. For example, suppose you needto update a total whenever an object's <b>bonus</b> propertyis set:</p><blockquote><pre>- (void)setBonus:(double)newBonus {    [self willChange];    _total += (newBonus - _bonus);    _bonus = newBonus;} </pre></blockquote><br><p>This total-updating code should be activated when the objectis updated with values provided by a user (through the user interface),but not when the <b>bonus</b> property is restoredfrom the database. Since the Framework restores the property using  <a frame= "conv" href="../../Protocols/EOKeyValueCoding.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/EOKeyValueCoding/takeStoredValue:forKey:">takeStoredValue:forKey:</a><b> </b>andsince this method accesses the <b>_bonus</b> instancevariable in preference to calling the public accessor, the unnecessary(and possibly harmful) recomputation of <b>_total </b>isavoided. If the object actually wants to intervene when a property isset from the database, it has two options:</p><ul><li>Implement <b>_setBonus:.</b></li><li>Replace the Framework's default stored value search orderwith the same search order used by the basic methods by overridingthe class method  <a frame= "conv" href="../../Protocols/EOKeyValueCoding.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/EOKeyValueCoding/useStoredAccessor">useStoredAccessor</a> toreturn NO. </li></ul><br><a name = "BADCJJIH"><h2>Type Checking and TypeConversion</h2></a><p>The default implementations of the key-value coding methodsaccept any object as a value, and do no type checking or type conversionamong object classes. It's possible, for example, to pass an NSString to  <a frame= "conv" href="../../Protocols/EOKeyValueCoding.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/EOKeyValueCoding/takeValue:forKey:">takeValue:forKey:</a> as the value fora property the receiver expects to be an NSDate. The sender of a key-valuecoding message is thus responsible for ensuring that a value isof the proper class, typically by using the  <a frame= "conv" href="../../Protocols/EOValidation.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/EOValidation/validateValue:forKey:">validateValue:forKey:</a> method to coerceit to the proper type. The interface layer's EODisplayGroup usesthis on all values received from interface user objects, for example,as well as relying on number and date formatters to interpret stringvalues typed by the user. For more information on the <b>validateValue:forKey:</b> method,see the  <a frame= "conv" href="../../Protocols/EOValidation.html#CJFBEAED">EOValidation</a> informalprotocol specification.</p><p>The key-value coding methods handle one special case withregard to value types. For enterprise objects that access numericvalues as C scalar types, these methods automatically convert betweenthe scalar types and NSNumber objects. For example, suppose yourenterprise object defines these accessor methods:</p><blockquote><pre>- (void)setSalary:(unsigned int)salary- (unsigned int)salary</pre></blockquote><br><p>For the <b>setSalary:</b> method, <b>takeValue:forKey:</b> convertsthe object value it receives as the argument for the "salary"key to an <b>unsigned int</b> and passes it as <em>salary</em> to <b>setSalary:</b>.Similarly,  <a frame= "conv" href="../../Protocols/EOKeyValueCoding.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/EOKeyValueCoding/valueForKey:">valueForKey:</a> converts the returnvalue of the <b>salary</b> method to an NSNumber andreturns that.</p><p>The default implementations of the key-value coding methodssupport the following scalar types:</p><br><table border = "1"><tr><td scope="row"><code>char</code></td><td><code>unsignedchar</code></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><code>short</code></td><td><code>unsignedshort</code></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><code>int</code></td><td><code>unsignedint</code></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><code>long</code></td><td><code>unsignedlong</code></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><code>float</code></td><td><code>double</code></td></tr></table><br><p>Object values are converted to these types with the standardmessages <b>charValue, intValue</b>, <b>floatValue</b>,and so on. Note that the key-value coding methods don't checkthat an object value actually responds to these messages; this canresult in a run-time error if the object doesn't respond to the appropriatemessage.</p><p>One type of conversion these methods can't perform is thatfrom nil to a scalar value. C scalar values define no equivalentof a database system's NULL value, so these must be handled bythe object itself. Upon encountering nil while setting a scalarvalue, <b>takeValue:forKey:</b> invokes  <a frame= "conv" href="../../Protocols/EOKeyValueCoding.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/EOKeyValueCoding/unableToSetNullForKey:">unableToSetNullForKey:</a>, which bydefault simply raises an exception. Enterprise object classes thatuse scalar values which may be NULL in the database should overridethis method to substitute the appropriate scalar value for nil,reinvoking <b>takeValue:forKey:</b> to set thesubstitute value.</p><br><a href="../../EOControlTOC.html"><img src="../../../../../../../images/up.gif" border="0" alt="Table of Contents"></a> </BODY></HTML>
