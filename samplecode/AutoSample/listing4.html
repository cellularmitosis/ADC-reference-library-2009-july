Introduction

This file discusses using the AMWorkflowView and AMWorkflowController classes
to display and execute Automator Workflows, and describes the parts of the
project necessary to support the use of these classes.


The following four items are necessary for any project using the Automator
framework:




1. Add the Automator framework to your project.

Turn down the &quot;Frameworks&quot; group in the Groups &amp; Files area, and then
control-click (or right click) on the &quot;Linked Frameworks&quot; sub-group.  Select
&quot;Add &gt; Existing Frameworks...&quot; from the pop-up menu.  Then, add the
&quot;Automator.framework&quot; (/System/Library/Frameworks/Automator.framework) to the
project.  




2. Add a minimum system version Info.plist key.

Since the Automator.framework is necessary for this application to run and that
framework is not present on previous system versions, you should add the
following key/value pair to the Info.plist file for the application.  If someone
tries to run this application on a system earlier than Mac OS X version 10.5,
then they will receive a notice from launch services letting them know that the
application is meant to be run on a later version of Mac OS X.

  &lt;key&gt;LSMinimumSystemVersion&lt;/key&gt;
  &lt;string&gt;10.5&lt;/string&gt;

You can edit the Info.plist file by either clicking on its icon in the
resources section, or by clicking on the AutoSample target, clicking on the Info
icon, selecting the Properties tab, and then clicking on &quot;Open Info.plist as
File&quot;.




3. Make sure the Target SDK is set to Mac OS X v10.5

You won't have to change this setting for this project, but if you are adding
the Automator framework to another project that you started with an earlier
version of the Mac OS than Mac OS X v10.5, then you will need to update the
Target SDK for the project.  In the Groups &amp; Files view, select the AutoSample
project icon at the top of the list and then open the information window.  Under
the General tab, change the Cross-Develop Using Target SDK: setting to Mac OS X
v10.5.




4. Add in the Automator framework header.

In the files where you will be using the Automator classes, add the import
statement '#import &lt;Automator/Automator.h&gt;' near the top of the file.  This will
include all of the definitions for using the Automator framework.

Here is the import statement for the Automator framework headers:

  #import &lt;Automator/Automator.h&gt;





The remainder of this read me file discusses items specific to this sample.




Overview

This sample displays a single window containing a list of workflows and a read
only AMWorkflowView.  The workflows listed are the ones found in the
Application's resources in the folder:

  /AutoSample.app/Contents/Resources/workflows/

When the application starts up it scans the workflows folder and loads each
Automator workflow found there as an instance of AMWorkflow.  It then stores
these AMWorkflow instances in an array along with the file names.  That array is
used as the backing store for the NSTableView in the window.  

When a click is received on the name of a workflow in the NSTableView, the
workflow is displayed in the AMWorkflowView on the right hand side of the
window.

When a double-click is received on the name of a workflow in the NSTableView
(or, when the &quot;run&quot; button is pressed), the selected workflow is displayed in
the AMWorkflowView on the right hand side of the window and it is run.




Initialization Details

All of the setup for this sample is performed in the -awakeFromNib method.  The
important features to note there are as follows:


(a) The AMWorkflowView is being used for display purposes only.  As such, we
mark the view as read only by turning off it's editing features with the
following method call:

   [workflowView setEditable: NO];


(b) We don't actually manage the AMWorkflowView ourselves.  Rather, we use an
AMWorkflowController to take care of that.  In this sample, we have added an
AMWorkflowController to our .nib file and we have set the AMWorkflowView
displayed in the main window as it's workFlowView.  

With this arrangement, our Controller object does not have to worry about the
details of operating the AMWorkflowView's user interface, as the
AMWorkflowController will take care of that. 

So methods in the Controller object can receive information about the status of
the view we have set our Controller object as the AMWorkflowController's
delegate.  With our controller object set as the AMWorkflowController delegate,
the AMWorkflowController will call back to our Controller object to provide
status information about the AMWorkflow it is displaying in the AMWorkflowView.

To run and display specific AMWorkflows, we will want to call methods on the
AMWorkflowController.  So we can do that from methods implemented in the
Controller object,  we have added an instance variable to the Controller object
where we store a reference to the AMWorkflowController object.

All of these releationships have been set up by control-dragging between
objects in the Interface Builder interface.  You can use the connections
inspector in Interface Builder to examine these connections.


(c) We allocate and initialize all of the AMWorkflow instances for the
workflows found in our Resources folder and we store them in a NSArray.  It's
worth noting that we populate the NSArray with NSDictionary records that include
the AMWorkflow instance, the file name, and the path.


(d) we have set up an array controller to manage the contents of the
NSTableView.  To do that, we have bound the content array of the array
controller to the workflows value stored in our Controller object.  In the
column of the table we have bound the value to the arrangedObjects controller
key on the Array Controller.  Back in our controller object, we have stored a
reference to the Array Controller in the tableContent outlet so we can access
its arrangedObjects value (to allow us to access the values displayed in the
table no matter how the user has sorted the list by clicking on the table
header). 



AMWorkflowController delegate methods

We implement two AMWorkflowController delegate methods in this sample.  Namely,
workflowControllerWillRun: and workflowControllerDidRun:.  The first method is
called just before a workflow being managed by the AMWorkflowController is run
and the second is called just after it finishes running.  

We use these methods to display the progress bar and to set the internal
runningWorkflow flag.  We use bindings based on the runningWorkflow flag to
display the progress bar, enable the stop button while a workflow is running,
and disable the run button while a workflow is running.  Also, we use the
runningWorkflow flag to prevent certain user actions, such as switching the
AMWorkflowController to another workflow, while a workflow is still running.




Running a workflow

We have set the run method on the AMWorkflowController as the target action for
the run button.  Bindings based on the runningWorkflow flag control the
availability of this button (by controlling its enabled state) for starting a
new workflow.

We have set the stop method on the AMWorkflowController as the target action
for the stop button.  Bindings based on the runningWorkflow flag control the
availability of this button (by controlling its enabled state) for stopping a
new workflow.




Where to next?

Documentation for Automator AMWorkflowController and AMWorkflow can be found in
the developer documentation.  To find the AMWorkflowController and AMWorkflow
documentation, select 'Documentation' from the Help Menu in Xcode, and type
AMWorkflow or AMWorkflowController into the search field near the top of the
window.
