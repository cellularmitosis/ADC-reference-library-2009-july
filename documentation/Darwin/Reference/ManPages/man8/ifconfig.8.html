     <b>ifconfig</b> <u>interface</u> <b>bondmode</b> <u>lacp</u> | <u>static</u>

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
     <b>Ifconfig</b> is used to assign an address to a network interface and/or configure network interface parame-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ters.&nbsp;parameters.</font>
     ters.  <b>Ifconfig</b> must be used at boot time to define the network address of each interface present on a
     machine; it may also be used at a later time to redefine an interface's address or other operating
     parameters.

     The following options are available:

     <u>address</u>
             For the DARPA-Internet family, the address is either a host name present in the host name data
             base, <a href="../man5/hosts.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/hosts">hosts(5)</a>, or a DARPA Internet address expressed in the Internet standard ``dot
             notation''.

             It is also possible to use the CIDR notation (also known as the slash notation) to include the
             netmask.  That is, one can specify an address like 192.168.0.1/16.

     <u>address</u><b>_</b><u>family</u>
             Specify the address family which affects interpretation of the remaining parameters.  Since an
             interface can receive transmissions in differing protocols with different naming schemes, spec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ifying&nbsp;specifying</font>
             ifying the address family is recommended.  The address or protocol families currently supported
             are ``inet'', ``inet6'',

     <u>dest</u><b>_</b><u>address</u>
             Specify the address of the correspondent on the other end of a point to point link.

     <u>interface</u>
             This parameter is a string of the form ``name unit'', for example, ``en0''.

     <u>iface</u>   This parameter has the same encoding as the <u>interface</u> parameter.

     The following parameters may be set with <b>ifconfig</b>:

     <b>add</b>     Another name for the <b>alias</b> parameter.  Introduced for compatibility with BSD/OS.

     <b>alias</b>   Establish an additional network address for this interface.  This is sometimes useful when
             changing network numbers, and one wishes to accept packets addressed to the old interface.  If
             the address is on the same subnet as the first network address for this interface, a netmask of
             0xffffffff has to be specified.

     <b>-alias</b>  Remove the network address specified.  This would be used if you incorrectly specified an
             alias, or it was no longer needed.  If you have incorrectly set an NS address having the side
             effect of specifying the host portion, removing all NS addresses will allow you to respecify
             the host portion.

     <b>anycast</b>
             (Inet6 only.)  Specify that the address configured is an anycast address.  Based on the current
             specification, only routers may configure anycast addresses.  Anycast address will not be used
             as source address of any of outgoing IPv6 packets.

     <b>arp</b>     Enable the use of the Address Resolution Protocol <a href="../man4/arp.4.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/4/arp">(arp(4)</a>) in mapping between network level
             addresses and link level addresses (default).  This is currently implemented for mapping
             between DARPA Internet addresses and IEEE 802 48-bit MAC addresses (Ethernet, FDDI, and Token
             Ring addresses).

     <b>-arp</b>    Disable the use of the Address Resolution Protocol <a href="../man4/arp.4.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/4/arp">(arp(4)</a>).

     <b>bonddev</b> <u>iface</u>
             If the interface is a bond pseudo device, associate physical interface <u>iface</u> with it.  By
             default, the bond pseudo device is in LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol) mode (see <b>bond</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mode&nbsp;bondmode</font>
             <b>mode</b> below).  In this mode, the device conforms to the IEEE 802.3ad Link Aggregation specifica-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion.&nbsp;specification.</font>
             tion.

             If this is the first physical interface to be associated with the bond interface, the bond
             interface inherits the ethernet address from the physical interface.  Physical interfaces that
             are added to the bond have their ethernet address re-programmed so that all members of the bond
             have the same ethernet address.  If the physical interface is subsequently removed from the
             bond using <b>-bonddev</b>, a new ethernet address is chosen from the remaining interfaces, and all
             interfaces are re-programmed again with the new ethernet address.  If no remaining interfaces
             exist, the bond interface's ethernet address is cleared.

             If the specified physical interface <u>iface</u> is not capable of having its ethernet address re-pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">grammed,&nbsp;re-programmed,</font>
             grammed, the <b>bonddev</b> command will fail.

             Once the physical interface <u>iface</u> is successfully associated with the bond interface, all
             received packets are diverted to the bond interface.  The physical interface is no longer use-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able&nbsp;useable</font>
             able on its own, and remains that way until it is removed from the bond using <b>-bonddev</b>.

             It is possible that the specified interface <u>iface</u> is not capable of aggregating, and may remain
             unused until the operating conditions change.

             The link status of the bond interface depends on the state of link aggregation.  If no active
             partner is detected, the link status will remain inactive.

             To monitor the 802.3ad Link Aggregation state, use the <b>-b</b> option.

             A physical interface that is associated with a vlan pseudo device cannot at the same time be
             associated with a bond pseudo device.  A physical interface cannot be associated with more than
             one bond pseudo device at the same time.

             It is not possible to associate a bond with pseudo interfaces such as vlan.  Only physical eth-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ernet&nbsp;ethernet</font>
             ernet interfaces may be associated with a bond.

     <b>-bonddev</b> <u>iface</u>
             If the interface is a bond pseudo device, disassociate the physical interface <u>iface</u> from it.
             Before the interface is removed from the bond, the bond device announces to the link partner
             that the interface is now individual and no longer aggregatable.  If the physical <u>iface</u> is the
             last interface in the bond, the bond interface clears its link address.

     bondmode <u>lacp</u> | <u>static</u>
             If the interface is a bond pseudo device, this option will set the <u>mode</u> on the bond interface.
             The two currently supported modes are <u>lacp</u> and <u>static</u>.  The default mode is <u>lacp</u>.

             To enable static mode (and turn off LACP), specify <u>static</u>.  In static mode, a member interface
             is made an active part of the link aggregate as long as the link status is active.

             To re-enable LACP mode, specify <u>lacp</u>.

     <b>broadcast</b>
             (Inet only.)  Specify the address to use to represent broadcasts to the network.  The default
             broadcast address is the address with a host part of all 1's.

     <b>debug</b>   Enable driver dependent debugging code; usually, this turns on extra console error logging.

     <b>-debug</b>  Disable driver dependent debugging code.

     <b>delete</b>  Another name for the <b>-alias</b> parameter.

     <b>down</b>    Mark an interface ``down''.  When an interface is marked ``down'', the system will not attempt
             to transmit messages through that interface.  If possible, the interface will be reset to dis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able&nbsp;disable</font>
             able reception as well.  This action does not automatically disable routes using the interface.

     <b>ether</b>   Another name for the <b>lladdr</b> parameter.

     <b>lladdr</b> <u>addr</u>
             Set the link-level address on an interface.  This can be used to e.g. set a new MAC address on
             an ethernet interface, though the mechanism used is not ethernet-specific.  The address <u>addr</u> is
             specified as a series of colon-separated hex digits.  If the interface is already up when this
             option is used, it will be briefly brought down and then brought back up again in order to
             ensure that the receive filter in the underlying ethernet hardware is properly reprogrammed.

     <b>media</b> <u>type</u>
             If the driver supports the media selection system, set the media type of the interface to <u>type</u>.
             Some interfaces support the mutually exclusive use of one of several different physical media
             connectors.  For example, a 10Mb/s Ethernet interface might support the use of either AUI or
             twisted pair connectors.  Setting the media type to ``10base5/AUI'' would change the currently
             active connector to the AUI port.  Setting it to ``10baseT/UTP'' would activate twisted pair.
             Refer to the interfaces' driver specific documentation or man page for a complete list of the
             available types.

     <b>mediaopt</b> <u>opts</u>
             If the driver supports the media selection system, set the specified media options on the
             interface.  The <u>opts</u> argument is a comma delimited list of options to apply to the interface.
             Refer to the interfaces' driver specific man page for a complete list of available options.

     <b>-mediaopt</b> <u>opts</u>
             If the driver supports the media selection system, disable the specified media options on the
             interface.

     <b>tunnel</b> <u>src</u><b>_</b><u>addr</u> <u>dest</u><b>_</b><u>addr</u>
             (IP tunnel devices only.)  Configure the physical source and destination address for IP tunnel
             interfaces <a href="../man4/gif.4.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/4/gif">(gif(4)</a>).  The arguments <u>src</u><b>_</b><u>addr</u> and <u>dest</u><b>_</b><u>addr</u> are interpreted as the outer
             source/destination for the encapsulating IPv4/IPv6 header.

     <b>deletetunnel</b>
             Unconfigure the physical source and destination address for IP tunnel interfaces previously
             configured with <b>tunnel</b>.

     <b>create</b>  Create the specified network pseudo-device.  If the interface is given without a unit number,
             try to create a new device with an arbitrary unit number.  If creation of an arbitrary device
             is successful, the new device name is printed to standard output.

     <b>destroy</b>
             Destroy the specified network pseudo-device.

     <b>plumb</b>   Another name for the <b>create</b> parameter.  Included for Solaris compatibility.

     <b>unplumb</b>
             Another name for the <b>destroy</b> parameter.  Included for Solaris compatibility.

     <b>metric</b> <u>n</u>
             Set the routing metric of the interface to <u>n</u>, default 0.  The routing metric is used by the
             routing protocol <a href="routed.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/routed">(routed(8)</a>).  Higher metrics have the effect of making a route less favorable;
             metrics are counted as addition hops to the destination network or host.

     <b>mtu</b> <u>n</u>   Set the maximum transmission unit of the interface to <u>n</u>, default is interface specific.  The
             MTU is used to limit the size of packets that are transmitted on an interface.  Not all inter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">faces&nbsp;interfaces</font>
             faces support setting the MTU, and some interfaces have range restrictions.

     <b>netmask</b> <u>mask</u>
             (Inet only.)  Specify how much of the address to reserve for subdividing networks into sub-net-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">works.&nbsp;sub-networks.</font>
             works.  The mask includes the network part of the local address and the subnet part, which is
             taken from the host field of the address.  The mask can be specified as a single hexadecimal
             number with a leading `0x', with a dot-notation Internet address, or with a pseudo-network name
             listed in the network table <a href="../man5/networks.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/networks">networks(5)</a>.  The mask contains 1's for the bit positions in the
             32-bit address which are to be used for the network and subnet parts, and 0's for the host
             part.  The mask should contain at least the standard network portion, and the subnet field
             should be contiguous with the network portion.

             The netmask can also be specified in CIDR notation after the address.  See the <u>address</u> option
             above for more information.

     <b>prefixlen</b> <u>len</u>
             (Inet6 only.)  Specify that <u>len</u> bits are reserved for subdividing networks into sub-networks.
             The <u>len</u> must be integer, and for syntactical reason it must be between 0 to 128.  It is almost
             always 64 under the current IPv6 assignment rule.  If the parameter is omitted, 64 is used.

     <b>remove</b>  Another name for the <b>-alias</b> parameter.  Introduced for compatibility with BSD/OS.

     <b>link</b>[<b>0</b>-<b>2</b>]
             Enable special processing of the link level of the interface.  These three options are inter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">face&nbsp;interface</font>
             face specific in actual effect, however, they are in general used to select special modes of
             operation.  An example of this is to enable SLIP compression, or to select the connector type
             for some Ethernet cards.  Refer to the man page for the specific driver for more information.

     <b>-link</b>[<b>0</b>-<b>2</b>]
             Disable special processing at the link level with the specified interface.

     <b>up</b>      Mark an interface ``up''.  This may be used to enable an interface after an ``<b>ifconfig</b> <b>down</b>''.
             It happens automatically when setting the first address on an interface.  If the interface was
             reset when previously marked down, the hardware will be re-initialized.

     <b>vlan</b> <u>vlan</u><b>_</b><u>tag</u> <b>vlandev</b> <u>iface</u>
             If the interface is a vlan pseudo interface, set its vlan tag value to <u>vlan</u><b>_</b><u>tag</u> and associate
             it with the physical interface <u>iface</u>.

             The <u>vlan</u><b>_</b><u>tag</u> value is a 16-bit number that is used to create an 802.1Q vlan header for packets
             sent from the vlan interface.

             A packet that is transmitted through the vlan interface is sent using the specified physical
             interface <u>iface</u> with 802.1Q vlan encapsulation with the specified <u>vlan</u><b>_</b><u>tag</u>.  A packet with
             802.1Q encapsulation received by the physical interface is directed to the associated vlan
             interface with the matching <u>vlan</u><b>_</b><u>tag</u>.  If there is no matching vlan interface, the packet is
             dropped.

             The vlan interface is assigned a copy of the parent interface's flags and the parent's ethernet
             address.  If the vlan interface already has a physical interface associated with it, this com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
             mand will fail.  To change the association to another physical interface, the existing associa-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;association</font>
             tion must be cleared first using <b>-vlandev</b>.

             If the physical interface supports 802.1Q VLAN tagging in hardware, the vlan pseudo interface
             does not itself insert or remove the 802.1Q encapsulation header.  Instead, the <u>vlan</u><b>_</b><u>tag</u> is
             passed out of band from the packet data.

             A physical interface that is associated with a bond pseudo device cannot at the same time be
             associated with a vlan interface.  However, a physical interface can be associated with multi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ple&nbsp;multiple</font>
             ple vlan interfaces at the same time, as long as each of the <u>vlan</u><b>_</b><u>tag</u> values are unique.

     <b>-vlandev</b> <u>iface</u>
             If the driver is a vlan pseudo device, disassociate the physical interface <u>iface</u> from it.  This
             breaks the link between the vlan interface and its parent, clears its vlan tag, flags and its
             link address.

     <b>Ifconfig</b> displays the current configuration for a network interface when no optional parameters are
     supplied.  If a protocol family is specified, <b>ifconfig</b> will report only the details specific to that
     protocol family.

     If the driver supports the media selection system, the supported media list will be included in the
     output, regardless of whether the <b>-m</b> flag is passed or not.

     The <b>-b</b> option passed before the interface name will print the link aggregation state for bond pseudo
     devices.

     If <b>-L</b> flag is supplied, address lifetime is displayed for IPv6 addresses, as time offset string.

     Optionally, the <b>-a</b> flag may be used instead of an interface name.  This flag instructs <b>ifconfig</b> to dis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">play&nbsp;display</font>
     play information about all interfaces in the system.  The <b>-d</b> flag limits this to interfaces that are
     down, and <b>-u</b> limits this to interfaces that are up.  When no arguments are given, <b>-a</b> is implied.

     The <b>-l</b> flag may be used to list all available interfaces on the system, with no other additional infor-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mation.&nbsp;information.</font>
     mation.  Use of this flag is mutually exclusive with all other flags and commands, except for <b>-d</b> (only
     list interfaces that are down) and <b>-u</b> (only list interfaces that are up).

     Only the super-user may modify the configuration of a network interface.

<b>NOTES</b>
     The media selection system is relatively new and only some drivers support it (or have need for it).

     <b>ifconfig</b> does not change the network settings permanently, it should be used only in a test and debug
     context.  The permanent network settings can be modified using the Network Preferences pane.  In addi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;addition</font>
     tion on Mac OS X Server the permanent network settings can be changed with the <a href="networksetup.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/networksetup">networksetup(8)</a> command.
     Otherwise public APIs in the SystemConfiguration framework are currently the only supported way to
     access and control the state of network settings.

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
     Messages indicating the specified interface does not exist, the requested address is unknown, or the
     user is not privileged and tried to alter an interface's configuration.

<b>BUGS</b>
     IPv6 link-local addresses are required for several basic communication between IPv6 node.  If they are
     deleted by <b>ifconfig</b> manually, the kernel might show very strange behavior.  So, such manual deletions
     are strongly discouraged.
