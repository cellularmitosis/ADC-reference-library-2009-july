As a result, Directto Web user interfaces are highly portable but suffer the limitedinteractivity provided by HTML forms.</font></p><p><font face="Times">Because Direct to Web generates your applications for you,the applications have a number of additional limitations.</font></p><p><font face="Times">First, the programming model is indirect. You provide a modeland Direct to Web assembles the application for you. The Web pagegeneration is performed by a "magic box." You don't have toknow what's going on. This makes it really easy to get started programmingwith Direct to Web. But for certain customizations, the learningcurve gets very steep very fast.</font></p><p><font face="Times">The machinery for generating Web pages is an entirely newlayer on top of the WebObjects HTML-based application technology.This layer adds complexity that regular HTML-based applicationsdon't have, and you might have to learn the details of it to get certainresults. In fact, making fundamental changes to a Direct to Webapplication can be a lot of work. Note, however, that you can typicallyreuse this work in later applications.</font></p><p><font face="Times">Another disadvantage is that modifying the layout of a Directto Web template is more involved and harder to do than laying outa WebObjects component because Direct to Web templates are morecomplex than most WebObjects components.</font></p>    <br><a href="Advantages__eb_Approach.html" target="_right"><img src="../Images/previous.gif" border="0" alt="Previous"></a><a href="Guidelines__rect_to_Web.html" target="_right"><img src="../Images/next.gif" border="0" alt="Next"></a>&nbsp;<p><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="1">&#169; 2001 Apple Computer, Inc.</font></p><!-- start of footer --><!--#include virtual="/includes/framesetfooter" --><!-- end of footer --></body></html>
