<h2>Mac Pro Computers</h2>
<p>This section provides PCI-specific information for Mac Pro computers introduced beginning August 2006. Refer to the specific Mac Pro developer note for additional information.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003937-SW7_1200331175" title="Mac Pro Computers (January 2008)"></a><h3>Mac Pro Computers (January 2008)</h3><p>The Mac Pro computers with Quad-Core Intel Xeon 5400 Series microprocessors were introduced in January 2008. The Mac Pro provides PCI Express (PCIe) 2.0 and 1.0a interfaces as described in the following paragraphs. In this document, PCIe 1.0a is referred to as simply PCIe.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003937-SW79_1200331175" title="Internal PCI Express Buses"></a><h4>Internal PCI Express Buses</h4><p>The Mac Pro implements two PCIe 2.0 dual simplex, 5.0 GHz buses with 16-lane (x16) links and two PCIe 2.5 GHz buses with 4-lane (x4) links. The 5.0 GHz links will auto-detect 2.5 GHz devices and downgrade automatically. </p><p>The FireWire OHCI and optional Airport Express module connect via dedicated PCIe x1 interfaces.</p><p>Each lane is differential, 8B/10B encoded to reduce SSO and crosstalk noise, and signals are AC-coupled to eliminate DC bias issues. The bus operates with an embedded clock in each differential bit lane, eliminating the need for an accompanying clock with the PCI Express data. Each slot is provided with a 100 MHz spread spectrum clock.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003937-SW80_1200331175" title="PCI Express Graphics and Expansion Capabilities"></a><h4>PCI Express Graphics and Expansion Capabilities</h4><p>As shown in <span class="content_text"><a href="pci_implementation.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003937-SW81_1200331175">Figure 1</a></span>, slot one is double-wide and supports the graphics card; slots two, three, and four are available for expansion.

For best performance, insert PCIe 2.0 cards in slots one and two.  When installed in slots three or four, PCIe 2.0 cards will automatically downgrade to PCIe speeds.</p><p>Mac Pro implements robust automatic detection, requiring no manual user configuration. Mac Pro detects whether an inserted card is PCIe 2.0 (5.0 GHz) or PCIe (2.5 GHz) and selects the operation depending on the card's maximum capability.   </p><p>For instructions on installing PCI Express expansion cards, refer to the "Adding PCI Express Cards” section in the <em>Mac Pro User’s Guide</em> that shipped with your computer.</p><p>When installing a new PCI Express card, follow the driver installation documentation provided by the manufacturer of the PCI Express card. </p><div class="notebox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003937-SW10" title="Note"></a><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;PCI and PCI-X cards are not compatible with the Mac Pro.</p></div><p>For information on the supported graphics cards, refer to the <em><a href="../../HWTech_Video/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003504" target="_top">Video Developer Note</a></em>. </p><p>The figure below provides a description of the PCI Express architecture. </p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003937-SW82_1200331175" title="Figure 2PCI Express Architecture"></a><p><strong>Figure 2&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>PCI Express Architecture</p><img src = "../Art/071168001313_02.jpg" alt = "Shows an expanded view of the default PCI Express interface between the graphics IC and the North Bridge and the South Bridge." ></div><br/><p>Based on the type of PCI Express card, the aggregate bandwidths (transmit and receive) of the lanes are listed below:</p><div class="tableholder"><table class="graybox" border = "0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr><th scope="col" align="left" style="font-weight: bold" bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><p>Lanes</p></th><th scope="col" align="left" style="font-weight: bold" bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><p>PCIe bandwidth</p></th><th scope="col" align="left" style="font-weight: bold" bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><p>PCIe 2.0 bandwidth</p></th></tr><tr><td  scope="row"><p>x1</p></td><td ><p>500 MBps</p></td><td ><p>1 GBps</p></td></tr><tr><td  scope="row"><p>x4</p></td><td ><p>2 GBps</p></td><td ><p>4 GBps</p></td></tr><tr><td  scope="row"><p>x8</p></td><td ><p>4 GBps</p></td><td ><p>8 GBps</p></td></tr><tr><td  scope="row"><p>x16</p></td><td ><p>8 GBps</p></td><td ><p>16 GBps</p></td></tr></table></div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003937-SW83_1200331175" title="PCI Express Power Constraints"></a><h5>PCI Express Power Constraints</h5><p>All four PCI Express slots conform to the PCI Express Spec Common Electromechanical Specification 1.1.

<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003937-SW8_1200331175" title="Internal PCI Bus "></a>
<h4>Internal PCI Bus </h4>
<p>An internal 33 MHz PCI bus connects the South Bridge IC to the FireWire OHCI. The North Bridge IC used in the Mac Pro supports the PCI write combining feature. This feature allows sequential write transactions involving the Memory Write or Memory Write and Invalidate commands to be combined into a single PCI transaction. For memory write transactions to be combined, they must be sequential, ascending, and non-overlapping PCI addresses. </p>

<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003937-SW9_1200331175" title="Internal PCI Express Buses"></a>
<h4>Internal PCI Express Buses</h4>
<p>The Mac Pro implements four PCI Express dual simplex, 2.5 GHz buses with up to 16-lane (x16) links. Each lane is differential, 8B/10B encoded to reduce SSO and crosstalk noise, and signals are AC-coupled to eliminate DC bias issues. The bus operates with an embedded clock in each differential bit lane, eliminating the need for an accompanying clock with the PCI Express data. </p>

<h4>PCI Express Graphics and Expansion Capabilities</h4>
<p>The Mac Pro supports four PCI Express slots. Slot one is double-wide and supports the factory-installed graphics card; for information on the supported graphics cards, refer to the <em><a href="../../HWTech_Video/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003504" target="_top">Video Developer Note</a></em>. Slots two, three, and four are available for expansion. As shown below, the Mac Pro has four openings in the back of the case for access to I/O connectors on the video card and any cards in the three expansion slots. Each slot has room for a full length 312.00 mm (12.238 inch) or half length 167.65 mm (6.600 inch) card.</p>

<p>For instructions on installing PCI Express expansion cards, refer to the "Adding PCI Express Cards” section in the <em>Mac Pro User’s Guide</em> that shipped with your computer.</p>
<p>When installing a new PCI Express card, follow the driver installation documentation provided by the manufacturer of the PCI Express card. In order for Mac OS X to detect a new PCI Express card, the driver needs to be recompiled as a Universal Binary. For information on recompiling driver code, refer to the <em><a href="../../../../MacOSX/Conceptual/universal_binary/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002217" target="_top">Universal Binary Programming Guidelines, Second Edition</a></em> and <em><a href="../../../../DeviceDrivers/Conceptual/WritingDeviceDriver/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000694" target="_top">I/O Kit Device Driver Design Guidelines</a></em>. </p>

<p>The Mac Pro has 16 PCI Express lanes from the North Bridge and 12 PCI Express lanes from the South Bridge. The lanes are combined by a set of muxes to allow four expansion slot configurations. Mac OS X sets the mux configurations and saves the settings in non-volatile RAM chip to configure the slots at every boot. </p>
<p>The table below lists the link configuration and the source of the lanes (NB = North Bridge, SB = South Bridge) for the default configuration and the three possible alternate configurations. </p>

<p>The Power Mac G5 supports 4 PCI Express slots. Slot 1 is a 16-lane slot connected to the North Bridge IC and dedicated to the graphics card. (For more information, see <em><a href="../../HWTech_Video/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003504" target="_top">Video Developer Note</a></em>.)</p>
<p>The other 3 slots interface to the Mid Bridge. Slot 3 is configured as 8-lane (x8) and slots 2 and 4 are each configured as 4-lane (x4). All three slots have a 16-lane physical connector on the main logic board.</p>
<p>The computer’s case has four openings in the back for access to I/O connectors on the video card and any cards in the three expansion slots. Each slot has room for a full length 312.00 mm (12.238 inch) or half length 167.65 mm (6.600 inch) card. </p>
<p>The numbering on the left mounting bracket is one through four and corresponds to the label on the main logic board. <span class="content_text"><a href="pci_implementation.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003937-TPXREF116">Figure 7</a></span> shows the slot locations and labeling on the left mounting bracket.</p>

</div><br/>
<p>Each expansion slot provides 3.3 V and 12 V power rails, and may use up to 25 W of power. Total power to the three PCI Express expansion slots is 75 W: 10 W at 3.3 V and 65 W at 12 V. Total power to the three PCI Express expansion slots and the dedicated PCI Express graphics slot is 205 W: 40 W at 3.3 V and 165 W at 12 V. </p>
<p>The PCI Express slots carry the 3.3 V_AUX power and WAKE# signals to allow an expansion card to wake the computer from sleep mode.</p>
<p>To install or remove a PCI Express expansion card, turn off power to the computer, unplug the computer, flip out the enclosure latch, open the side panel, remove the clear plastic air deflector, and remove the fan units. Remove the blank PCI mounting bracket for the appropriate slot, insert the card in the slot, and screw the card’s mounting bracket into place to secure the card. For complete installation and removal instructions, refer to the owner's guide that shipped with the computer.</p>
<div class="importantbox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003937-DontLinkElementID_4" title="Important:"></a><p><strong>Important:</strong>&nbsp;
Before removing or installing a PCI expansion card, shut down the computer and unplug the AC power cord. The Power Mac G5 does not support PCI Express hot-plugging functionality. </p><p>

<p>To use the new PCI Express card, a driver must be installed. The driver installation procedure is documented by the manufacturer of the PCI card. In most cases, existing PCI and PCI-X drivers will run without modification.</p>
<p>For information on PCI Express specifications and design guides, see the PCI-SIG website (<span class="content_text"><a href="http://www.pcisig.com/" target="_blank">(http://www.pcisig.com/)</a></span>).</p>
