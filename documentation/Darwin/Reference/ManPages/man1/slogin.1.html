         [<u>command</u>]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
     <b>ssh</b> (SSH client) is a program for logging into a remote machine and for executing commands on a remote
     machine.  It is intended to replace rlogin and rsh, and provide secure encrypted communications between
     two untrusted hosts over an insecure network.  X11 connections and arbitrary TCP ports can also be for-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">warded&nbsp;forwarded</font>
     warded over the secure channel.

     <b>ssh</b> connects and logs into the specified <u>hostname</u> (with optional <u>user</u> name).  The user must prove
     his/her identity to the remote machine using one of several methods depending on the protocol version
     used (see below).

     If <u>command</u> is specified, it is executed on the remote host instead of a login shell.

     The options are as follows:

     <b>-1</b>      Forces <b>ssh</b> to try protocol version 1 only.

     <b>-2</b>      Forces <b>ssh</b> to try protocol version 2 only.

     <b>-4</b>      Forces <b>ssh</b> to use IPv4 addresses only.

     <b>-6</b>      Forces <b>ssh</b> to use IPv6 addresses only.

     <b>-A</b>      Enables forwarding of the authentication agent connection.  This can also be specified on a
             per-host basis in a configuration file.

             Agent forwarding should be enabled with caution.  Users with the ability to bypass file permis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sions&nbsp;permissions</font>
             sions on the remote host (for the agent's Unix-domain socket) can access the local agent
             through the forwarded connection.  An attacker cannot obtain key material from the agent, how-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ever&nbsp;however</font>
             ever they can perform operations on the keys that enable them to authenticate using the identi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ties&nbsp;identities</font>
             ties loaded into the agent.

     <b>-a</b>      Disables forwarding of the authentication agent connection.

     <b>-b</b> <u>bind</u><b>_</b><u>address</u>
             Use <u>bind</u><b>_</b><u>address</u> on the local machine as the source address of the connection.  Only useful on
             systems with more than one address.

     <b>-C</b>      Requests compression of all data (including stdin, stdout, stderr, and data for forwarded X11
             and TCP connections).  The compression algorithm is the same used by <a href="gzip.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/gzip">gzip(1)</a>, and the ``level''
             can be controlled by the <b>CompressionLevel</b> option for protocol version 1.  Compression is desir-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able&nbsp;desirable</font>
             able on modem lines and other slow connections, but will only slow down things on fast net-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">works.&nbsp;networks.</font>
             works.  The default value can be set on a host-by-host basis in the configuration files; see
             the <b>Compression</b> option.

     <b>-c</b> <u>cipher</u><b>_</b><u>spec</u>
             Selects the cipher specification for encrypting the session.

             Protocol version 1 allows specification of a single cipher.  The supported values are ``3des'',
             ``blowfish'', and ``des''.  <u>3des</u> (triple-des) is an encrypt-decrypt-encrypt triple with three
             different keys.  It is believed to be secure.  <u>blowfish</u> is a fast block cipher; it appears very
             secure and is much faster than <u>3des</u>.  <u>des</u> is only supported in the <b>ssh</b> client for interoper-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ability&nbsp;interoperability</font>
             ability with legacy protocol 1 implementations that do not support the <u>3des</u> cipher.  Its use is
             strongly discouraged due to cryptographic weaknesses.  The default is ``3des''.

             For protocol version 2, <u>cipher</u><b>_</b><u>spec</u> is a comma-separated list of ciphers listed in order of
             preference.  The supported ciphers are: 3des-cbc, aes128-cbc, aes192-cbc, aes256-cbc,
             aes128-ctr, aes192-ctr, aes256-ctr, arcfour128, arcfour256, arcfour, blowfish-cbc, and
             cast128-cbc.  The default is:

                   aes128-cbc,3des-cbc,blowfish-cbc,cast128-cbc,arcfour128,
                   arcfour256,arcfour,aes192-cbc,aes256-cbc,aes128-ctr,
                   aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr

     <b>-D</b> [<u>bind</u><b>_</b><u>address</u>:]<u>port</u>
             Specifies a local ``dynamic'' application-level port forwarding.  This works by allocating a
             socket to listen to <u>port</u> on the local side, optionally bound to the specified <u>bind</u><b>_</b><u>address</u>.
             Whenever a connection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over the secure chan-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nel,&nbsp;channel,</font>
             nel, and the application protocol is then used to determine where to connect to from the remote
             machine.  Currently the SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols are supported, and <b>ssh</b> will act as a SOCKS
             server.  Only root can forward privileged ports.  Dynamic port forwardings can also be speci-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fied&nbsp;specified</font>
             fied in the configuration file.

             IPv6 addresses can be specified with an alternative syntax: [<u>bind</u><b>_</b><u>address</u>/]<u>port</u> or by enclosing
             the address in square brackets.  Only the superuser can forward privileged ports.  By default,
             the local port is bound in accordance with the <b>GatewayPorts</b> setting.  However, an explicit
             <u>bind</u><b>_</b><u>address</u> may be used to bind the connection to a specific address.  The <u>bind</u><b>_</b><u>address</u> of
             ``localhost'' indicates that the listening port be bound for local use only, while an empty
             address or `*' indicates that the port should be available from all interfaces.

     <b>-e</b> <u>escape</u><b>_</b><u>char</u>
             Sets the escape character for sessions with a pty (default: `~').  The escape character is only
             recognized at the beginning of a line.  The escape character followed by a dot (`.') closes the
             connection; followed by control-Z suspends the connection; and followed by itself sends the
             escape character once.  Setting the character to ``none'' disables any escapes and makes the
             session fully transparent.

     <b>-F</b> <u>configfile</u>
             Specifies an alternative per-user configuration file.  If a configuration file is given on the
             command line, the system-wide configuration file (<u>/etc/ssh</u><b>_</b><u>config</u>) will be ignored.  The
             default for the per-user configuration file is <u>~/.ssh/config</u>.

     <b>-f</b>      Requests <b>ssh</b> to go to background just before command execution.  This is useful if <b>ssh</b> is going
             to ask for passwords or passphrases, but the user wants it in the background.  This implies <b>-n</b>.
             The recommended way to start X11 programs at a remote site is with something like <b>ssh</b> <b>-f</b> <b>host</b>
             <b>xterm</b>.

     <b>-g</b>      Allows remote hosts to connect to local forwarded ports.

     <b>-I</b> <u>smartcard</u><b>_</b><u>device</u>
             Specify the device <b>ssh</b> should use to communicate with a smartcard used for storing the user's
             private RSA key.  This option is only available if support for smartcard devices is compiled in
             (default is no support).

     <b>-i</b> <u>identity</u><b>_</b><u>file</u>
             Selects a file from which the identity (private key) for RSA or DSA authentication is read.
             The default is <u>~/.ssh/identity</u> for protocol version 1, and <u>~/.ssh/id</u><b>_</b><u>rsa</u> and <u>~/.ssh/id</u><b>_</b><u>dsa</u> for
             protocol version 2.  Identity files may also be specified on a per-host basis in the configura-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;configuration</font>
             tion file.  It is possible to have multiple <b>-i</b> options (and multiple identities specified in
             configuration files).

     <b>-k</b>      Disables forwarding (delegation) of GSSAPI credentials to the server.

     <b>-L</b> [<u>bind</u><b>_</b><u>address</u>:]<u>port</u>:<u>host</u>:<u>hostport</u>
             Specifies that the given port on the local (client) host is to be forwarded to the given host
             and port on the remote side.  This works by allocating a socket to listen to <u>port</u> on the local
             side, optionally bound to the specified <u>bind</u><b>_</b><u>address</u>.  Whenever a connection is made to this
             port, the connection is forwarded over the secure channel, and a connection is made to <u>host</u>
             port <u>hostport</u> from the remote machine.  Port forwardings can also be specified in the configu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ration&nbsp;configuration</font>
             ration file.  IPv6 addresses can be specified with an alternative syntax:
             [<u>bind</u><b>_</b><u>address</u>/]<u>port</u>/<u>host</u>/<u>hostport</u> or by enclosing the address in square brackets.  Only the
             superuser can forward privileged ports.  By default, the local port is bound in accordance with
             the <b>GatewayPorts</b> setting.  However, an explicit <u>bind</u><b>_</b><u>address</u> may be used to bind the connection
             to a specific address.  The <u>bind</u><b>_</b><u>address</u> of ``localhost'' indicates that the listening port be
             bound for local use only, while an empty address or `*' indicates that the port should be
             available from all interfaces.

     <b>-l</b> <u>login</u><b>_</b><u>name</u>
             Specifies the user to log in as on the remote machine.  This also may be specified on a per-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">host&nbsp;perhost</font>
             host basis in the configuration file.

     <b>-M</b>      Places the <b>ssh</b> client into ``master'' mode for connection sharing.  Multiple <b>-M</b> options places
             <b>ssh</b> into ``master'' mode with confirmation required before slave connections are accepted.
             Refer to the description of <b>ControlMaster</b> in <a href="../man5/ssh_config.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/ssh_config">ssh_config(5)</a> for details.

     <b>-m</b> <u>mac</u><b>_</b><u>spec</u>
             Additionally, for protocol version 2 a comma-separated list of MAC (message authentication
             code) algorithms can be specified in order of preference.  See the <b>MACs</b> keyword for more infor-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mation.&nbsp;information.</font>
             mation.

     <b>-N</b>      Do not execute a remote command.  This is useful for just forwarding ports (protocol version 2
             only).

     <b>-n</b>      Redirects stdin from <u>/dev/null</u> (actually, prevents reading from stdin).  This must be used when
             <b>ssh</b> is run in the background.  A common trick is to use this to run X11 programs on a remote
             machine.  For example, <b>ssh</b> <b>-n</b> <b>shadows.cs.hut.fi</b> <b>emacs</b> <b>&amp;</b> will start an emacs on shad-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ows.cs.hut.fi,&nbsp;shadows.cs.hut.fi,</font>
             ows.cs.hut.fi, and the X11 connection will be automatically forwarded over an encrypted chan-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nel.&nbsp;channel.</font>
             nel.  The <b>ssh</b> program will be put in the background.  (This does not work if <b>ssh</b> needs to ask
             for a password or passphrase; see also the <b>-f</b> option.)

     <b>-O</b> <u>ctl</u><b>_</b><u>cmd</u>
             Control an active connection multiplexing master process.  When the <b>-O</b> option is specified, the
             <u>ctl</u><b>_</b><u>cmd</u> argument is interpreted and passed to the master process.  Valid commands are:
             ``check'' (check that the master process is running) and ``exit'' (request the master to exit).

     <b>-o</b> <u>option</u>
             Can be used to give options in the format used in the configuration file.  This is useful for
             specifying options for which there is no separate command-line flag.  For full details of the
             options listed below, and their possible values, see <a href="../man5/ssh_config.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/ssh_config">ssh_config(5)</a>.

             Port to connect to on the remote host.  This can be specified on a per-host basis in the con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">figuration&nbsp;configuration</font>
             figuration file.

     <b>-q</b>      Quiet mode.  Causes all warning and diagnostic messages to be suppressed.

     <b>-R</b> [<u>bind</u><b>_</b><u>address</u>:]<u>port</u>:<u>host</u>:<u>hostport</u>
             Specifies that the given port on the remote (server) host is to be forwarded to the given host
             and port on the local side.  This works by allocating a socket to listen to <u>port</u> on the remote
             side, and whenever a connection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over the
             secure channel, and a connection is made to <u>host</u> port <u>hostport</u> from the local machine.

             Port forwardings can also be specified in the configuration file.  Privileged ports can be for-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">warded&nbsp;forwarded</font>
             warded only when logging in as root on the remote machine.  IPv6 addresses can be specified by
             enclosing the address in square braces or using an alternative syntax:
             [<u>bind</u><b>_</b><u>address</u>/]<u>host</u>/<u>port</u>/<u>hostport</u>.

             By default, the listening socket on the server will be bound to the loopback interface only.
             This may be overriden by specifying a <u>bind</u><b>_</b><u>address</u>.  An empty <u>bind</u><b>_</b><u>address</u>, or the address `*',
             indicates that the remote socket should listen on all interfaces.  Specifying a remote
             <u>bind</u><b>_</b><u>address</u> will only succeed if the server's <b>GatewayPorts</b> option is enabled (see
             <a href="../man5/sshd_config.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/sshd_config">sshd_config(5)</a>).

     <b>-S</b> <u>ctl</u><b>_</b><u>path</u>
             Specifies the location of a control socket for connection sharing.  Refer to the description of
             <b>ControlPath</b> and <b>ControlMaster</b> in <a href="../man5/ssh_config.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/ssh_config">ssh_config(5)</a> for details.

     <b>-s</b>      May be used to request invocation of a subsystem on the remote system.  Subsystems are a fea-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ture&nbsp;feature</font>
             ture of the SSH2 protocol which facilitate the use of SSH as a secure transport for other
             applications (eg. <a href="sftp.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/sftp">sftp(1)</a>).  The subsystem is specified as the remote command.

     <b>-T</b>      Disable pseudo-tty allocation.

     <b>-t</b>      Force pseudo-tty allocation.  This can be used to execute arbitrary screen-based programs on a
             remote machine, which can be very useful, e.g. when implementing menu services.  Multiple <b>-t</b>
             options force tty allocation, even if <b>ssh</b> has no local tty.

     <b>-V</b>      Display the version number and exit.

     <b>-v</b>      Verbose mode.  Causes <b>ssh</b> to print debugging messages about its progress.  This is helpful in
             debugging connection, authentication, and configuration problems.  Multiple <b>-v</b> options increase
             the verbosity.  The maximum is 3.

     <b>-w</b> <u>local</u><b>_</b><u>tun</u>[:<u>remote</u><b>_</b><u>tun</u>]
             Requests tunnel device forwarding with the specified <!-- a -->tun(4)<!-- /a --> devices between the client
             (<u>local</u><b>_</b><u>tun</u>) and the server (<u>remote</u><b>_</b><u>tun</u>).

             The devices may be specified by numerical ID or the keyword ``any'', which uses the next avail-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able&nbsp;available</font>
             able tunnel device.  If <u>remote</u><b>_</b><u>tun</u> is not specified, it defaults to ``any''.  See also the
             <b>Tunnel</b> and <b>TunnelDevice</b> directives in <a href="../man5/ssh_config.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/ssh_config">ssh_config(5)</a>.  If the <b>Tunnel</b> directive is unset, it is
             set to the default tunnel mode, which is ``point-to-point''.

     <b>-X</b>      Enables X11 forwarding.  This can also be specified on a per-host basis in a configuration
             file.

             X11 forwarding should be enabled with caution.  Users with the ability to bypass file permis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sions&nbsp;permissions</font>
             sions on the remote host (for the user's X authorization database) can access the local X11
             display through the forwarded connection.  An attacker may then be able to perform activities
             such as keystroke monitoring.

             For this reason, X11 forwarding is subjected to X11 SECURITY extension restrictions by default.
             Please refer to the <b>ssh</b> <b>-Y</b> option and the <b>ForwardX11Trusted</b> directive in <a href="../man5/ssh_config.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/ssh_config">ssh_config(5)</a> for more
             information.

     <b>-x</b>      Disables X11 forwarding.

     <b>-Y</b>      Enables trusted X11 forwarding.  Trusted X11 forwardings are not subjected to the X11 SECURITY
             extension controls.

     <b>ssh</b> may additionally obtain configuration data from a per-user configuration file and a system-wide
     configuration file.  The file format and configuration options are described in <a href="../man5/ssh_config.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/ssh_config">ssh_config(5)</a>.

     <b>ssh</b> exits with the exit status of the remote command or with 255 if an error occurred.

<b>AUTHENTICATION</b>
     The OpenSSH SSH client supports SSH protocols 1 and 2.  Protocol 2 is the default, with <b>ssh</b> falling
     back to protocol 1 if it detects protocol 2 is unsupported.  These settings may be altered using the
     <b>Protocol</b> option in <a href="../man5/ssh_config.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/ssh_config">ssh_config(5)</a>, or enforced using the <b>-1</b> and <b>-2</b> options (see above).  Both protocols
     support similar authentication methods, but protocol 2 is preferred since it provides additional mecha-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nisms&nbsp;mechanisms</font>
     nisms for confidentiality (the traffic is encrypted using AES, 3DES, Blowfish, CAST128, or Arcfour) and
     integrity (hmac-md5, hmac-sha1, hmac-ripemd160).  Protocol 1 lacks a strong mechanism for ensuring the
     integrity of the connection.

     The methods available for authentication are: GSSAPI-based authentication, host-based authentication,
     public key authentication, challenge-response authentication, and password authentication.  Authentica-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;Authentication</font>
     tion methods are tried in the order specified above, though protocol 2 has a configuration option to
     change the default order: <b>PreferredAuthentications</b>.

     Host-based authentication works as follows: If the machine the user logs in from is listed in
     <u>/etc/hosts.equiv</u> or <u>/etc/shosts.equiv</u> on the remote machine, and the user names are the same on both
     sides, or if the files <u>~/.rhosts</u> or <u>~/.shosts</u> exist in the user's home directory on the remote machine
     and contain a line containing the name of the client machine and the name of the user on that machine,
     the user is considered for login.  Additionally, the server <u>must</u> be able to verify the client's host
     key (see the description of <u>/etc/ssh</u><b>_</b><u>known</u><b>_</b><u>hosts</u> and <u>~/.ssh/known</u><b>_</b><u>hosts</u>, below) for login to be permit-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ted.&nbsp;permitted.</font>
     ted.  This authentication method closes security holes due to IP spoofing, DNS spoofing, and routing
     spoofing.  [Note to the administrator: <u>/etc/hosts.equiv</u>, <u>~/.rhosts</u>, and the rlogin/rsh protocol in gen-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">eral,&nbsp;general,</font>
     eral, are inherently insecure and should be disabled if security is desired.]

     Public key authentication works as follows: The scheme is based on public-key cryptography, using cryp-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tosystems&nbsp;cryptosystems</font>
     tosystems where encryption and decryption are done using separate keys, and it is unfeasible to derive
     the decryption key from the encryption key.  The idea is that each user creates a public/private key
     pair for authentication purposes.  The server knows the public key, and only the user knows the private
     key.  <b>ssh</b> implements public key authentication protocol automatically, using either the RSA or DSA
     algorithms.  Protocol 1 is restricted to using only RSA keys, but protocol 2 may use either.  The
     <u>HISTORY</u> section of <!-- a -->ssl(8)<!-- /a --> contains a brief discussion of the two algorithms.

     The file <u>~/.ssh/authorized</u><b>_</b><u>keys</u> lists the public keys that are permitted for logging in.  When the user
     logs in, the <b>ssh</b> program tells the server which key pair it would like to use for authentication.  The
     client proves that it has access to the private key and the server checks that the corresponding public
     key is authorized to accept the account.

     The user creates his/her key pair by running <a href="ssh-keygen.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ssh-keygen">ssh-keygen(1)</a>.  This stores the private key in
     <u>~/.ssh/identity</u> (protocol 1), <u>~/.ssh/id</u><b>_</b><u>dsa</u> (protocol 2 DSA), or <u>~/.ssh/id</u><b>_</b><u>rsa</u> (protocol 2 RSA) and
     stores the public key in <u>~/.ssh/identity.pub</u> (protocol 1), <u>~/.ssh/id</u><b>_</b><u>dsa.pub</u> (protocol 2 DSA), or
     <u>~/.ssh/id</u><b>_</b><u>rsa.pub</u> (protocol 2 RSA) in the user's home directory.  The user should then copy the public
     key to <u>~/.ssh/authorized</u><b>_</b><u>keys</u> in his/her home directory on the remote machine.  The <u>authorized</u><b>_</b><u>keys</u>
     file corresponds to the conventional <u>~/.rhosts</u> file, and has one key per line, though the lines can be
     very long.  After this, the user can log in without giving the password.

     The most convenient way to use public key authentication may be with an authentication agent.  See
     <a href="ssh-agent.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ssh-agent">ssh-agent(1)</a> for more information.

     Challenge-response authentication works as follows: The server sends an arbitrary "challenge" text, and
     prompts for a response.  Protocol 2 allows multiple challenges and responses; protocol 1 is restricted
     to just one challenge/response.  Examples of challenge-response authentication include BSD Authentica-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;Authentication</font>
     tion (see <!-- a -->login.conf(5)<!-- /a -->) and PAM (some non-OpenBSD systems).

     Finally, if other authentication methods fail, <b>ssh</b> prompts the user for a password.  The password is
     sent to the remote host for checking; however, since all communications are encrypted, the password
     cannot be seen by someone listening on the network.

     <b>ssh</b> automatically maintains and checks a database containing identification for all hosts it has ever
     been used with.  Host keys are stored in <u>~/.ssh/known</u><b>_</b><u>hosts</u> in the user's home directory.  Addition-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ally,&nbsp;Additionally,</font>
     ally, the file <u>/etc/ssh</u><b>_</b><u>known</u><b>_</b><u>hosts</u> is automatically checked for known hosts.  Any new hosts are auto-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">matically&nbsp;automatically</font>
     matically added to the user's file.  If a host's identification ever changes, <b>ssh</b> warns about this and
     disables password authentication to prevent server spoofing or man-in-the-middle attacks, which could
     otherwise be used to circumvent the encryption.  The <b>StrictHostKeyChecking</b> option can be used to con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">trol&nbsp;control</font>
     trol logins to machines whose host key is not known or has changed.

     When the user's identity has been accepted by the server, the server either executes the given command,
     or logs into the machine and gives the user a normal shell on the remote machine.  All communication
     with the remote command or shell will be automatically encrypted.

     If a pseudo-terminal has been allocated (normal login session), the user may use the escape characters
     noted below.

     If no pseudo-tty has been allocated, the session is transparent and can be used to reliably transfer
     binary data.  On most systems, setting the escape character to ``none'' will also make the session
     transparent even if a tty is used.

     The session terminates when the command or shell on the remote machine exits and all X11 and TCP con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nections&nbsp;connections</font>
     nections have been closed.

<b>ESCAPE</b> <b>CHARACTERS</b>
     When a pseudo-terminal has been requested, <b>ssh</b> supports a number of functions through the use of an
     escape character.

     A single tilde character can be sent as <b>~~</b> or by following the tilde by a character other than those
     described below.  The escape character must always follow a newline to be interpreted as special.  The
     escape character can be changed in configuration files using the <b>EscapeChar</b> configuration directive or
     on the command line by the <b>-e</b> option.

     The supported escapes (assuming the default `~') are:

     <b>~.</b>      Disconnect.

     <b>~^Z</b>     Background <b>ssh</b>.

     <b>~#</b>      List forwarded connections.

     <b>~&amp;</b>      Background <b>ssh</b> at logout when waiting for forwarded connection / X11 sessions to terminate.

     <b>~?</b>      Display a list of escape characters.

     <b>~B</b>      Send a BREAK to the remote system (only useful for SSH protocol version 2 and if the peer sup-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ports&nbsp;supports</font>
             ports it).

     <b>~C</b>      Open command line.  Currently this allows the addition of port forwardings using the <b>-L</b> and <b>-R</b>
             options (see above).  It also allows the cancellation of existing remote port-forwardings using
             <b>-KR</b>[<u>bind</u><b>_</b><u>address</u>:]<u>port</u>.  <b>!</b><u>command</u> allows the user to execute a local command if the
             <b>PermitLocalCommand</b> option is enabled in <a href="../man5/ssh_config.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/ssh_config">ssh_config(5)</a>.  Basic help is available, using the <b>-h</b>
             option.

     <b>~R</b>      Request rekeying of the connection (only useful for SSH protocol version 2 and if the peer sup-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ports&nbsp;supports</font>
             ports it).

<b>TCP</b> <b>FORWARDING</b>
     Forwarding of arbitrary TCP connections over the secure channel can be specified either on the command
     line or in a configuration file.  One possible application of TCP forwarding is a secure connection to
     a mail server; another is going through firewalls.

     In the example below, we look at encrypting communication between an IRC client and server, even though
     the IRC server does not directly support encrypted communications.  This works as follows: the user
     connects to the remote host using <b>ssh</b>, specifying a port to be used to forward connections to the
     remote server.  After that it is possible to start the service which is to be encrypted on the client
     machine, connecting to the same local port, and <b>ssh</b> will encrypt and forward the connection.

     The following example tunnels an IRC session from client machine ``127.0.0.1'' (localhost) to remote
     server ``server.example.com'':

         $ ssh -f -L 1234:localhost:6667 server.example.com sleep 10
         $ irc -c '#users' -p 1234 pinky 127.0.0.1

     This tunnels a connection to IRC server ``server.example.com'', joining channel ``#users'', nickname
     ``pinky'', using port 1234.  It doesn't matter which port is used, as long as it's greater than 1023
     (remember, only root can open sockets on privileged ports) and doesn't conflict with any ports already
     in use.  The connection is forwarded to port 6667 on the remote server, since that's the standard port
     for IRC services.

     The <b>-f</b> option backgrounds <b>ssh</b> and the remote command ``sleep 10'' is specified to allow an amount of
     time (10 seconds, in the example) to start the service which is to be tunnelled.  If no connections are
     made within the time specified, <b>ssh</b> will exit.

<b>X11</b> <b>FORWARDING</b>
     If the <b>ForwardX11</b> variable is set to ``yes'' (or see the description of the <b>-X</b>, <b>-x</b>, and <b>-Y</b> options
     above) and the user is using X11 (the DISPLAY environment variable is set), the connection to the X11
     display is automatically forwarded to the remote side in such a way that any X11 programs started from
     the shell (or command) will go through the encrypted channel, and the connection to the real X server
     will be made from the local machine.  The user should not manually set DISPLAY.  Forwarding of X11 con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nections&nbsp;connections</font>
     nections can be configured on the command line or in configuration files.

     The DISPLAY value set by <b>ssh</b> will point to the server machine, but with a display number greater than
     zero.  This is normal, and happens because <b>ssh</b> creates a ``proxy'' X server on the server machine for
     forwarding the connections over the encrypted channel.

     <b>ssh</b> will also automatically set up Xauthority data on the server machine.  For this purpose, it will
     generate a random authorization cookie, store it in Xauthority on the server, and verify that any for-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">warded&nbsp;forwarded</font>
     warded connections carry this cookie and replace it by the real cookie when the connection is opened.
     The real authentication cookie is never sent to the server machine (and no cookies are sent in the
     plain).

     If the <b>ForwardAgent</b> variable is set to ``yes'' (or see the description of the <b>-A</b> and <b>-a</b> options above)
     and the user is using an authentication agent, the connection to the agent is automatically forwarded
     to the remote side.

<b>VERIFYING</b> <b>HOST</b> <b>KEYS</b>
     When connecting to a server for the first time, a fingerprint of the server's public key is presented
     to the user (unless the option <b>StrictHostKeyChecking</b> has been disabled).  Fingerprints can be deter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mined&nbsp;determined</font>
     mined using <a href="ssh-keygen.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ssh-keygen">ssh-keygen(1)</a>:

           $ ssh-keygen -l -f /etc/ssh_host_rsa_key

     If the fingerprint is already known, it can be matched and verified, and the key can be accepted.  If
     the fingerprint is unknown, an alternative method of verification is available: SSH fingerprints veri-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fied&nbsp;verified</font>
     fied by DNS.  An additional resource record (RR), SSHFP, is added to a zonefile and the connecting
     client is able to match the fingerprint with that of the key presented.

     In this example, we are connecting a client to a server, ``host.example.com''.  The SSHFP resource
     records should first be added to the zonefile for host.example.com:

           $ ssh-keygen -r host.example.com.

     The output lines will have to be added to the zonefile.  To check that the zone is answering finger-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">print&nbsp;fingerprint</font>
     print queries:

           $ dig -t SSHFP host.example.com

     Finally the client connects:

           $ ssh -o "VerifyHostKeyDNS ask" host.example.com
           [...]
           Matching host key fingerprint found in DNS.
           Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

     See the <b>VerifyHostKeyDNS</b> option in <a href="../man5/ssh_config.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/ssh_config">ssh_config(5)</a> for more information.

<b>SSH-BASED</b> <b>VIRTUAL</b> <b>PRIVATE</b> <b>NETWORKS</b>
     <b>ssh</b> contains support for Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnelling using the <!-- a -->tun(4)<!-- /a --> network pseudo-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">device,&nbsp;pseudodevice,</font>
     device, allowing two networks to be joined securely.  The <a href="../man5/sshd_config.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/sshd_config">sshd_config(5)</a> configuration option
     <b>PermitTunnel</b> controls whether the server supports this, and at what level (layer 2 or 3 traffic).

     The following example would connect client network 10.0.50.0/24 with remote network 10.0.99.0/24 using
     a point-to-point connection from 10.1.1.1 to 10.1.1.2, provided that the SSH server running on the
     gateway to the remote network, at 192.168.1.15, allows it.

     On the client:

           # ssh -f -w 0:1 192.168.1.15 true
           # ifconfig tun0 10.1.1.1 10.1.1.2 netmask 255.255.255.252
           # route add 10.0.99.0/24 10.1.1.2

     On the server:

           # ifconfig tun1 10.1.1.2 10.1.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.252
           # route add 10.0.50.0/24 10.1.1.1

     Client access may be more finely tuned via the <u>/root/.ssh/authorized</u><b>_</b><u>keys</u> file (see below) and the
     <b>PermitRootLogin</b> server option.  The following entry would permit connections on <!-- a -->tun(4)<!-- /a --> device 1 from
     user ``jane'' and on tun device 2 from user ``john'', if <b>PermitRootLogin</b> is set to
     ``forced-commands-only'':

       tunnel="1",command="sh /etc/netstart tun1" ssh-rsa ... jane
       tunnel="2",command="sh /etc/netstart tun2" ssh-rsa ... john

     Since an SSH-based setup entails a fair amount of overhead, it may be more suited to temporary setups,
     such as for wireless VPNs.  More permanent VPNs are better provided by tools such as <!-- a -->ipsecctl(8)<!-- /a --> and
     <!-- a -->isakmpd(8)<!-- /a -->.

<b>ENVIRONMENT</b>
     <b>ssh</b> will normally set the following environment variables:

     DISPLAY               The DISPLAY variable indicates the location of the X11 server.  It is automati-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cally&nbsp;automatically</font>
                           cally set by <b>ssh</b> to point to a value of the form ``hostname:n'', where
                           ``hostname'' indicates the host where the shell runs, and `n' is an integer &gt;= 1.
                           <b>ssh</b> uses this special value to forward X11 connections over the secure channel.
                           The user should normally not set DISPLAY explicitly, as that will render the X11
                           connection insecure (and will require the user to manually copy any required
                           authorization cookies).

     HOME                  Set to the path of the user's home directory.

     LOGNAME               Synonym for USER; set for compatibility with systems that use this variable.

     MAIL                  Set to the path of the user's mailbox.

     PATH                  Set to the default PATH, as specified when compiling <b>ssh</b>.

     SSH_ASKPASS           If <b>ssh</b> needs a passphrase, it will read the passphrase from the current terminal
                           if it was run from a terminal.  If <b>ssh</b> does not have a terminal associated with
                           it but DISPLAY and SSH_ASKPASS are set, it will execute the program specified by
                           SSH_ASKPASS and open an X11 window to read the passphrase.  This is particularly
                           useful when calling <b>ssh</b> from a <u>.xsession</u> or related script.  (Note that on some
                           machines it may be necessary to redirect the input from <u>/dev/null</u> to make this
                           work.)

     SSH_AUTH_SOCK         Identifies the path of a UNIX-domain socket used to communicate with the agent.

     SSH_CONNECTION        Identifies the client and server ends of the connection.  The variable contains
                           four space-separated values: client IP address, client port number, server IP
                           address, and server port number.

     SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND  This variable contains the original command line if a forced command is executed.
                           It can be used to extract the original arguments.

     SSH_TTY               This is set to the name of the tty (path to the device) associated with the cur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rent&nbsp;current</font>
                           rent shell or command.  If the current session has no tty, this variable is not
                           set.

     TZ                    This variable is set to indicate the present time zone if it was set when the
                           daemon was started (i.e. the daemon passes the value on to new connections).

     USER                  Set to the name of the user logging in.

     Additionally, <b>ssh</b> reads <u>~/.ssh/environment</u>, and adds lines of the format ``VARNAME=value'' to the envi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ronment&nbsp;environment</font>
     ronment if the file exists and users are allowed to change their environment.  For more information,
     see the <b>PermitUserEnvironment</b> option in <a href="../man5/sshd_config.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/sshd_config">sshd_config(5)</a>.

<b>FILES</b>
     ~/.rhosts
             This file is used for host-based authentication (see above).  On some machines this file may
             need to be world-readable if the user's home directory is on an NFS partition, because <a href="../man8/sshd.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/sshd">sshd(8)</a>
             reads it as root.  Additionally, this file must be owned by the user, and must not have write
             permissions for anyone else.  The recommended permission for most machines is read/write for
             the user, and not accessible by others.

     ~/.shosts
             This file is used in exactly the same way as <u>.rhosts</u>, but allows host-based authentication
             without permitting login with rlogin/rsh.

     ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
             Lists the public keys (RSA/DSA) that can be used for logging in as this user.  The format of
             this file is described in the <a href="../man8/sshd.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/sshd">sshd(8)</a> manual page.  This file is not highly sensitive, but the
             recommended permissions are read/write for the user, and not accessible by others.

     ~/.ssh/config
             This is the per-user configuration file.  The file format and configuration options are
             described in <a href="../man5/ssh_config.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/ssh_config">ssh_config(5)</a>.  Because of the potential for abuse, this file must have strict
             permissions: read/write for the user, and not accessible by others.

     ~/.ssh/environment
             Contains additional definitions for environment variables; see <u>ENVIRONMENT</u>, above.

     ~/.ssh/identity
     ~/.ssh/id_dsa
     ~/.ssh/id_rsa
             Contains the private key for authentication.  These files contain sensitive data and should be
             readable by the user but not accessible by others (read/write/execute).  <b>ssh</b> will simply ignore
             a private key file if it is accessible by others.  It is possible to specify a passphrase when
             generating the key which will be used to encrypt the sensitive part of this file using 3DES.

     ~/.ssh/identity.pub
     ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub
     ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
             Contains the public key for authentication.  These files are not sensitive and can (but need
             not) be readable by anyone.

     ~/.ssh/known_hosts
             Contains a list of host keys for all hosts the user has logged into that are not already in the
             systemwide list of known host keys.  See <a href="../man8/sshd.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/sshd">sshd(8)</a> for further details of the format of this
             file.

     ~/.ssh/rc
             Commands in this file are executed by <b>ssh</b> when the user logs in, just before the user's shell
             (or command) is started.  See the <a href="../man8/sshd.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/sshd">sshd(8)</a> manual page for more information.

     /etc/hosts.equiv
             This file is for host-based authentication (see above).  It should only be writable by root.

     /etc/shosts.equiv
             This file is used in exactly the same way as <u>hosts.equiv</u>, but allows host-based authentication
             without permitting login with rlogin/rsh.

     /etc/ssh_config
             Systemwide configuration file.  The file format and configuration options are described in
             <a href="../man5/ssh_config.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/ssh_config">ssh_config(5)</a>.

     /etc/ssh_host_key
     /etc/ssh_host_dsa_key
     /etc/ssh_host_rsa_key
             These three files contain the private parts of the host keys and are used for host-based
             authentication.  If protocol version 1 is used, <b>ssh</b> must be setuid root, since the host key is
             readable only by root.  For protocol version 2, <b>ssh</b> uses <a href="../man8/ssh-keysign.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/ssh-keysign">ssh-keysign(8)</a> to access the host
             keys, eliminating the requirement that <b>ssh</b> be setuid root when host-based authentication is
             used.  By default <b>ssh</b> is not setuid root.

     /etc/ssh_known_hosts
             Systemwide list of known host keys.  This file should be prepared by the system administrator
             to contain the public host keys of all machines in the organization.  It should be world-read-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able.&nbsp;world-readable.</font>
             able.  See <a href="../man8/sshd.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/sshd">sshd(8)</a> for further details of the format of this file.

     /etc/sshrc
             Commands in this file are executed by <b>ssh</b> when the user logs in, just before the user's shell
             (or command) is started.  See the <a href="../man8/sshd.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/sshd">sshd(8)</a> manual page for more information.
