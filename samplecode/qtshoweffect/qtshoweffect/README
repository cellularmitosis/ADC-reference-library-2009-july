README - QTShowEffectThis sample code illustrates how to use the low-level QuickTime videoeffects API to apply a filter (a one-source effect) to a picture, orto apply a transition (a two-source effect) to two pictures.Launch the application. The user must select an effect and any customparameters for the effect.  To see the effect rendered, select "Run"from the Effects menu.NOTE: QTShowEffect runs only from unlocked volumes; copy the applicationfrom the CD to your local computer before running it.You can choose another effect using the "Select Effect" menu commandin the Effects menu. You can choose some options for the effect inthe Settings menu. Note that you can choose to have a standard effectsparameters dialog box, or you can embed the effects parameters controlsin a custom dialog box of your own.QTShowEffect can also build a QuickTime movie containing a filter or transition. QTShowEffect can be built for both the MacOS and Windows.For Windows builds using Microsoft Visual C++, the Makefile (QTShowEffect.mak)automatically calls Rez to create the resource file QTShowEffect.qtr from theinput file QTShowEffect.r. The .qtr file must reside in the same directory as theapplication QTShowEffect.exe. For final delivery of your product, you shouldinsert the .qtr file into the .exe file by using the tool RezWack.NOTE ON COMPOUND EFFECTS:If you set the compiler flag ALLOW_COMPOUND_EFFECTS to 1, then the Build Effect Movie menu item will add the film noise filter to whatever two-source effect you've already chosen when it builds the movie; this is intended to illustrate how to work with compound (or "stacked") effects. QTShowEffect does not yet provide a mechanism to allow the user to add a compound effect to the effect shown in the Show Video Effect window.Enjoy,QuickTime Team
