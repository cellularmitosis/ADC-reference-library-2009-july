You can form such relationships even if the models map to different databases and different database servers.<p></a><a name="14494">When you add a model to a project, it becomes part of a model group, even if the model group only contains that one model (for more information on model groups, see the EOModelGroup class specification in the <em>Enterprise Objects Framework Reference</em>). Each subsequent model that you add to the project-either directly by adding the model to the project's Resources suitcase or indirectly by adding a framework that includes a model-automatically becomes part of the group. Entity names must be unique within a model group; you can't use the same entity name in two different models in the same group. Put another way, all the entities used in an application must have unique names.<p></a><a name="14495">To form a relationship from one model to another, use the Relationship Inspector as follows:<p></a><ol><a name="14496"><P><li>Add a relationship to the entity you want to use as the source of the relationship.</a><a name="14497"><p>For example, you can form a to-one relationship between the Movie entity in the Movies sample database and the VideoTape entity in the Rentals sample database.<p></a><a name="14498"><P><li>In the Relationship Inspector, use the Model pop-up list to choose the model containing the entity you want to use as the destination of the relationship.</a><a name="14506"><p><img src="Relationships2.gif"><p></a><a name="14507"><p>Figure 27.
