README - QTTimeCodeQTTimeCode is a sample application that illustrates how touse the timecode media handler. You can use QTTimeCode to adda timecode track to a movie, to extract the current timecodevalue from a movie, to extract the source information about atimecode track, and to toggle the display of a movie's timecode track.The main timecode track is contained in the files QTTimeCode.c and QTTimeCode.h. For Windows builds using Microsoft Visual C++, the Makefile (QTTimeCode.mak)automatically calls Rez to create the resource file QTTimeCode.qtr from theinput file QTTimeCode.r. The .qtr file must reside in the same directory as theapplication QTTimeCode.exe. For final delivery of your product, you shouldinsert the .qtr file into the .exe file by using the tool RezWack.Enjoy,QuickTime Team
