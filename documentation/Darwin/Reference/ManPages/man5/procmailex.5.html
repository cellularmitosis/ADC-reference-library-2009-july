<b>NAME</b>
       procmailex - procmail rcfile examples

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>$HOME/.procmailrc</b> <b>examples</b>

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       For a description of the rcfile format see <a href="procmailrc.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/procmailrc"><b>procmailrc</b>(5)</a>.

       The weighted scoring technique is described in detail in the <a href="procmailsc.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/procmailsc"><b>procmailsc</b>(5)</a> man page.

       This  man  page  shows  several  example recipes.  For examples of complete rcfiles you can check the
       NOTES section in <a href="../man1/procmail.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/procmail"><b>procmail</b>(1)</a>, or look at the example rcfiles part of the procmail source distribution
       (procmail*/examples/?procmailrc).

<b>EXAMPLES</b>
       Sort  out  all  mail  coming from the scuba-dive mailing list into the mailfolder scubafile (uses the
       locallockfile scubafile.lock).

              :0:
              * ^TOscuba
              scubafile

       Forward all mail from peter about compilers to william (and keep a copy of it here in petcompil).

              :0
              * ^From.*peter
              * ^Subject:.*compilers
              {
                 :0 c
                 ! william@somewhere.edu

                 :0
                 petcompil
              }

       An equivalent solution that accomplishes the same:

              :0 c
              * ^From.*peter
              * ^Subject:.*compilers
              ! william@somewhere.edu

                 :0 A
                 petcompil

       An equivalent, but slightly slower solution that accomplishes the same:

              :0 c
              * ^From.*peter
              * ^Subject:.*compilers
              ! william@somewhere.edu

              :0
              * ^From.*peter
              * ^Subject:.*compilers
              petcompil

       If you are fairly new to procmail and plan to experiment a little bit it often helps to have a <u>safety</u>
       <u>net</u> of some sort.  Inserting the following two recipes above all other recipes will make sure that of
       all arriving mail always the last 32 messages will  be  preserved.   In  order  for  it  to  work  as
       intended,  you  have  to  create  a directory named `backup' in $MAILDIR prior to inserting these two
       recipes.

              :0 c
              backup

              :0 ic
              | cd backup &amp;&amp; rm -f dummy `ls -t msg.* | sed -e 1,32d`

       If your system doesn't generate or generates incorrect leading `From ' lines on every mail,  you  can
       fix this by calling up procmail with the -f- option.  To fix the same problem by different means, you
       could have inserted the following two recipes above all other recipes in your rcfile.  They will fil-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ter&nbsp;filter</font>
       ter  the  header  of any mail through formail which will strip any leading `From ', and automatically
       regenerates it subsequently.

              :0 fhw
              | formail -I "From " -a "From "

       Add the headers of all messages that didn't come from the postmaster to your private  header  collec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;collection</font>
       tion  (for  statistics  or mail debugging); and use the lockfile `headc.lock'.  In order to make sure
       the lockfile is not removed until the pipe has finished, you have to specify  option  `w';  otherwise
       the lockfile would be removed as soon as the pipe has accepted the mail.

              :0 hwc:
              * !^FROM_MAILER
              | uncompress headc.Z; cat &gt;&gt;headc; compress headc

       Or, if you would use the more efficient gzip instead of compress:

              :0 hwc:
              * !^FROM_MAILER
              | gzip &gt;&gt;headc.gz

       Forward all mails shorter than 1000 bytes to my home address (no lockfile needed on this recipe).

              :0
              * &lt; 1000
              ! myname@home

       Split  up  incoming  digests  from the surfing mailing list into their individual messages, and store
       them into surfing, using surfing.lock as the locallockfile.

              :0:
              * ^Subject:.*surfing.*Digest
              | formail +1 -ds &gt;&gt;surfing

       Store everything coming from the postmaster or mailer-daemon (like bounced mail) into the file postm,
       using postm.lock as the locallockfile.

              :0:
              * ^FROM_MAILER
              postm

       A  simple  autoreply  recipe.  It makes sure that neither mail from any daemon (like bouncing mail or
       mail from mailing-lists), nor autoreplies coming from yourself will be autoreplied to.  If this  pre-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">caution&nbsp;precaution</font>
       caution  would  not  be  taken,  disaster could result (`ringing' mail).  In order for this recipe to
       autoreply to all the incoming mail, you should of course insert it before all other recipes  in  your
       rcfile.   However, it is advisable to put it <u>after</u> any recipes that process the mails from subscribed
       mailinglists; it generally is not a good idea to  generate  autoreplies  to  mailinglists  (yes,  the
       !^FROM_DAEMON  regexp should already catch those, but if the mailinglist doesn't follow accepted con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ventions,&nbsp;conventions,</font>
       ventions, this might <u>not</u> be <u>enough</u>).

              :0 h c
              * !^FROM_DAEMON
              * !^X-Loop: your@own.mail.address
              | (formail -r -I"Precedence: junk" \
                  -A"X-Loop: your@own.mail.address" ; \
                 echo "Mail received.") | $SENDMAIL -t

       A more complicated autoreply recipe that implements the functional equivalent of the well known <!-- a --><b>vaca</b><!-- /a -->-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion(1)&nbsp;vacation(1)</font>
       <!-- a --><b>tion</b>(1)<!-- /a -->  program.   This  recipe  is  based on the same principles as the last one (prevent `ringing'
       mail).  In addition to that however, it maintains a vacation database by extracting the name  of  the
       sender  and  inserting  it in the vacation.cache file if the name was new (the vacation.cache file is
       maintained by formail which will make sure that it always contains the most recent names, the size of
       the  file  is  limited  to a maximum of approximately 8192 bytes).  If the name was new, an autoreply
       will be sent.

       As you can see, the following recipe has comments <b>between</b> the conditions.  This is allowed.   Do  <b>not</b>
       put comments on the same line as a condition though.

              SHELL=/bin/sh    # for other shells, this might need adjustment

              :0 Whc: vacation.lock
               # Perform a quick check to see if the mail was addressed to us
              * $^To:.*\&lt;$\LOGNAME\&gt;
               # Don't reply to daemons and mailinglists
              * !^FROM_DAEMON
               # Mail loops are evil
              * !^X-Loop: your@own.mail.address
              | formail -rD 8192 vacation.cache

                :0 ehc         # if the name was not in the cache
                | (formail -rI"Precedence: junk" \
                     -A"X-Loop: your@own.mail.address" ; \
                   echo "I received your mail,"; \
                   echo "but I won't be back until Monday."; \
                   echo "-- "; cat $HOME/.signature \
                  ) | $SENDMAIL -oi -t

       Store  all  messages concerning TeX in separate, unique filenames, in a directory named texmail (this
       directory has to exist); there is no need to use lockfiles in this case, so we won't.

              :0
              * (^TO|^Subject:.*)TeX[^t]
              texmail

       The same as above, except now we store the mails in numbered files (MH mail folder).

              :0
              * (^TO|^Subject:.*)TeX[^t]
              texmail/.

       Or you could file the mail in several directory folders at the same time.  The following recipe  will
       deliver  the  mail to two MH-folders and one directory folder.  It is actually only one file with two
       extra hardlinks.

              :0
              * (^TO|^Subject:.*)TeX[^t]
              texmail/. wordprocessing dtp/.

       Store all the messages about meetings in a folder that is in a directory that  changes  every  month.
       E.g.  if  it  were January 1994, the folder would have the name `94-01/meeting' and the locallockfile
       would be `94-01/meeting.lock'.

              :0:
              * meeting
              `date +%y-%m`/meeting

       The same as above, but, if the `94-01' directory wouldn't have existed, it is created automatically:

              MONTHFOLDER=`date +%y-%m`

              :0 Wic
              * ? test ! -d $MONTHFOLDER
              | mkdir $MONTHFOLDER

              :0:
              * meeting
              ${MONTHFOLDER}/meeting

       The same as above, but now by slightly different means:

              MONTHFOLDER=`date +%y-%m`
              DUMMY=`test -d $MONTHFOLDER || mkdir $MONTHFOLDER`

              :0:
              * meeting
              ${MONTHFOLDER}/meeting

       If you are subscribed to several mailinglists and people cross-post to  some  of  them,  you  usually
       receive several duplicate mails (one from every list).  The following simple recipe eliminates dupli-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cate&nbsp;duplicate</font>
       cate mails.  It tells formail to keep an 8KB cache file in which it will store the Message-IDs of the
       most  recent  mails  you received.  Since Message-IDs are guaranteed to be unique for every new mail,
       they are ideally suited to weed out duplicate mails.  Simply put the following recipe at the  top  of
       your rcfile, and no duplicate mail will get past it.

              :0 Wh: msgid.lock
              | formail -D 8192 msgid.cache

       <b>Beware</b>  if  you  have  delivery  problems in recipes below this one and procmail tries to requeue the
       mail, then on the next queue run, this mail will be considered a duplicate and will be  thrown  away.
       For  those  not  quite  so  confident  in their own scripting capabilities, you can use the following
       recipe instead.  It puts duplicates in a separate folder instead of throwing them away.  It is up  to
       you to periodically empty the folder of course.

              :0 Whc: msgid.lock
              | formail -D 8192 msgid.cache

              :0 a:
              duplicates

       Procmail can deliver to MH folders directly, but, it does not update the unseen sequences the real MH
       manages.  If you want procmail to update those as well, use a recipe like the  following  which  will
       file  everything  that  contains the word spam in the body of the mail into an MH folder called spam-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fold.&nbsp;spamfold.</font>
       fold.  Note the local lockfile, which is needed because MH programs do not lock the  sequences  file.
       Asynchronous  invocations  of  MH programs that change the sequences file may therefore corrupt it or
       silently lose changes.  Unfortunately, the lockfile doesn't completely solve the problem as  rcvstore
       could  be  invoked  while  `show'  or  `mark'  or  some other MH program is running.  This problem is
       expected to be fixed in some future version of MH, but until then, you'll have to balance the risk of
       lost or corrupt sequences against the benefits of the unseen sequence.

              :0 :spamfold/$LOCKEXT
              * B ?? spam
              | rcvstore +spamfold

       When delivering to emacs folders (i.e., mailfolders managed by any emacs mail package, e.g., RMAIL or
       VM) directly, you should use emacs-compatible lockfiles.  The emacs mailers are a bit braindamaged in
       that respect, they get very upset if someone delivers to mailfolders which they already have in their
       internal buffers.  The following recipe assumes that $HOME equals /home/john.

              MAILDIR=Mail

              :0:/usr/local/lib/emacs/lock/!home!john!Mail!mailbox
              * ^Subject:.*whatever
              mailbox

       Alternatively, you can have procmail deliver into its own set of mailboxes, which you  then  periodi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cally&nbsp;periodically</font>
       cally empty and copy over to your emacs files using <b>movemail</b>.  Movemail uses mailbox.lock local lock-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">files&nbsp;lockfiles</font>
       files per mailbox.  This actually is the preferred mode of operation in conjunction with procmail.

       To extract certain headers from a mail and put them into environment variables you can use any of the
       following constructs:

              SUBJECT=`formail -xSubject:`    # regular field
              FROM=`formail -rt -xTo:`        # special case

              :0 h                            # alternate method
              KEYWORDS=| formail -xKeywords:

       If  you  are  using temporary files in a procmailrc file, and want to make sure that they are removed
       just before procmail exits, you could use something along the lines of:

              TEMPORARY=$HOME/tmp/pmail.$$
              TRAP="/bin/rm -f $TEMPORARY"

       The TRAP keyword can also be used to change the exitcode of procmail.  I.e. if you want  procmail  to
       return an exitcode of `1' instead of its regular exitcodes, you could use:

              EXITCODE=""
              TRAP="exit 1;"   # The trailing semi-colon is important
                               # since exit is not a standalone program

       Or, if the exitcode does not need to depend on the programs run from the TRAP, you can use a mere:

              EXITCODE=1

       The following recipe prints every incoming mail that looks like a postscript file.

              :0 Bb
              * ^^%!
              | lpr

       The  following recipe does the same, but is a bit more selective.  It only prints the postscript file
       if it comes from the print-server.  The first condition matches only if it is found  in  the  header.
       The second condition only matches at the start of the body.

              :0 b
              * ^From[ :].*print-server
              * B ?? ^^%!
              | lpr

       The same as above, but now by slightly different means:

              :0
              * ^From[ :].*print-server
              {
                :0 B b
                * ^^%!
                | lpr
              }

       Likewise:

              :0 HB b
              * ^^(.+$)*From[ :].*print-server
              * ^^(.+$)*^%!
              | lpr

       Suppose  you have two accounts, you use both accounts regularly, but they are in very distinct places
       (i.e., you can only read mail that arrived at either one of the accounts).  You would like to forward
       mail arriving at account one to account two, and the other way around.  The first thing that comes to
       mind is using .forward files at both sites; this won't work of course, since you will be  creating  a
       mail  loop.   This  mail  loop can be avoided by inserting the following recipe in front of all other
       recipes in the $HOME/.procmailrc files on both sites.  If you make sure that you add the same X-Loop:
       field at both sites, mail can now safely be forwarded to the other account from either of them.

              :0 c
              * !^X-Loop: yourname@your.main.mail.address
              | formail -A "X-Loop: yourname@your.main.mail.address" | \
                 $SENDMAIL -oi yourname@the.other.account

       If someone sends you a mail with the word `retrieve' in the subject, the following will automatically
       send back the contents of info_file to the sender.  Like in all recipes where we send mail, we  watch
       out for mail loops.

              :0
              * !^From +YOUR_USERNAME
              * !^Subject:.*Re:
              * !^FROM_DAEMON
              * ^Subject:.*retrieve
              | (formail -r ; cat info_file) | $SENDMAIL -oi -t

       Now  follows an example for a very simple fileserver accessible by mail.  For more demanding applica-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tions,&nbsp;applications,</font>
       tions, I suggest you take a look at <b>SmartList</b> (available from the same place as the procmail  distri-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">bution).&nbsp;distribution).</font>
       bution).   As listed, this fileserver sends back at most one file per request, it ignores the body of
       incoming mails, the Subject: line has to look like "Subject: send file the_file_you_want" (the blanks
       are  significant),  it  does  not return files that have names starting with a dot, nor does it allow
       files to be retrieved that are outside the fileserver directory tree (if you  decide  to  munge  this
       example, make sure you do not inadvertently loosen this last restriction).

              :0
              * ^Subject: send file [0-9a-z]
              * !^X-Loop: yourname@your.main.mail.address
              * !^Subject:.*Re:
              * !^FROM_DAEMON
              * !^Subject: send file .*[/.]\.
              {
                MAILDIR=$HOME/fileserver # chdir to the fileserver directory

                :0 fhw                   # reverse mailheader and extract name
                * ^Subject: send file \/[^ ]*
                | formail -rA "X-Loop: yourname@your.main.mail.address"

                FILE="$MATCH"            # the requested filename

                :0 ah
                | cat - ./$FILE 2&gt;&amp;1 | $SENDMAIL -oi -t
              }

       The following example preconverts all plain-text mail arriving in certain encoded MIME formats into a
       more compact 8-bit format which can be used and displayed more easily by most programs.   The  <!-- a --><b>mimen</b><!-- /a -->-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">code(1)&nbsp;mimencode(1)</font>
       <!-- a --><b>code</b>(1)<!-- /a --> program is part of Nathaniel Borenstein's metamail package.

              :0
              * ^Content-Type: *text/plain
              {
                :0 fbw
                * ^Content-Transfer-Encoding: *quoted-printable
                | mimencode -u -q

                   :0 Afhw
                   | formail -I "Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit"

                :0 fbw
                * ^Content-Transfer-Encoding: *base64
                | mimencode -u -b

                   :0 Afhw
                   | formail -I "Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit"
              }

       The  following one is rather exotic, but it only serves to demonstrate a feature.  Suppose you have a
       file in your HOME directory called ".urgent", and the (one) person named in that file is  the  sender
       of  an  incoming  mail, you'd like that mail to be stored in $MAILDIR/urgent instead of in any of the
       normal mailfolders it would have been sorted in.  Then this is what you could do (beware,  the  file-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">length&nbsp;filelength</font>
       length of $HOME/.urgent should be well below $LINEBUF, increase LINEBUF if necessary):

              URGMATCH=`cat $HOME/.urgent`

              :0:
              * $^From.*${URGMATCH}
              urgent

       An  entirely  different application for procmail would be to conditionally apply filters to a certain
       (outgoing) text or mail.  A typical example would be a filter through which  you  pipe  all  outgoing
       mail,  in  order to make sure that it will be MIME encoded only if it needs to be.  I.e. in this case
       you could start procmail in the middle of a pipe like:

              cat newtext | procmail ./mimeconvert | mail chris@where.ever

       The <b>mimeconvert</b> rcfile could contain something like (the =0x80= and =0xff= should be substituted with
       the real 8-bit characters):

              DEFAULT=|     # pipe to stdout instead of
                            # delivering mail as usual
              :0 Bfbw
              * [=0x80=-=0xff=]
              | mimencode -q

                :0 Afhw
                | formail -I 'MIME-Version: 1.0' \
                   -I 'Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1' \
                   -I 'Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable'
