RAVE Starter Samples Timothy CarrollApple Developer Technical Supportdevsupport@apple.comInitial Release: 5/1/98There are three different samples here, each showing a variation on the same theme --we create a window and do some simple 2D drawing into it.  These samples don't showany clipping code or a full featured 3D engine; these will appear in a future sample.These versions were compiled with CodeWarrior Pro 3 and the RAVE 1.5 SDK.For more information, check out TechNote 1125, which covers many issues related todeveloping RAVE applications.RAVE Common Code -- A few routines are used by multiple samples, so I pulled them out here to have a single code base.  They are also routines that are very useful for many RAVE applications.Gouraud Sample -- This creates context on a specific GDevice and draws a single shaded triangle onto it until you click the mouse.Callback Sample -- This is identical to the Gouraud sample, except that it also demonstrates how to implement a compositing callback.  Erase callbacks look identicalto compositing callbacks, and these are the two most common callbacks games will implement.Texture Sample -- Loads a texture into memory and then draws a textured triangle.
