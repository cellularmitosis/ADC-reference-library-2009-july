Net::LDAP::Security(3)               User Contributed Perl Documentation              Net::LDAP::Security(3)



<b>NAME</b>
       Net::LDAP::Security - Security issues with LDAP connections

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
         none

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       This document discusses various security issues relating to using LDAP and connecting to LDAP
       servers, notably how to manage these potential vulnerabilities:

          do you know that you are connected to the right server

          can someone sniff your passwords/userids from the directory connection

          can someone sniff other confidential information from the directory connection

       <b>Net::LDAP</b> provides ways to address these vulnerabilities: through the use of LDAPS, or LDAPv3 and
       TLS, and/or the use of SASL. Each of these will be explained below.

       <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>an</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>connection</b> <b>work</b>

       A normal LDAPv2 or LDAPv3 connection works by the client connecting directly to port 389 (by
       default), and then issuing various LDAP requests like search, add, etc.

       There is no way to guarantee that an LDAP client is connected to the right LDAP server. Hackers could
       have poisoned your DNS, so 'ldap.example.com' could be made to point to 'ldap.hacker.com'. Or they
       could have installed their own server on the correct machine.

       It is in the nature of the LDAP protocol that all information goes between the client and the server
       in 'plain text'. This is a term used by cryptographers to describe unencrypted and recoverable data,
       so even though LDAP can transfer binary values like JPEG photographs, audio clips and X.509
       certificates, everything is still considered 'plain text'.

       If these vulnerabilities are an issue to, then you should consider the other possibilities described
       below, namely LDAPS, LDAPv3 and TLS, and SASL.

       <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>an</b> <b>LDAPS</b> <b>connection</b> <b>work</b>

       LDAPS is an unofficial protocol. It is to LDAP what HTTPS is to HTTP, namely the exact same protocol
       (but in this case LDAPv2 or LDAPv3) running over a <u>secured</u> SSL ("Secure Socket Layer") connection to
       port 636 (by default).

       Not all servers will be configured to listen for LDAPS connections, but if they do, it will commonly
       be on a different port from the normal plain text LDAP port.

       Using LDAPS can <u>potentially</u> solve the vulnerabilities described above, but you should be aware that
       simply "using" SSL is not a magic bullet that automatically makes your system "secure".

       First of all, LDAPS can solve the problem of verifying that you are connected to the correct server.
       When the client and server connect, they perform a special SSL 'handshake', part of which involves
       the server and client exchanging cryptographic keys, which are described using X.509 certificates. If
       the client wishes to confirm that it is connected to the correct server, all it needs to do is verify
       the server's certificate which is sent in the handshake. This is done in two ways:

       1.  check that the certificate is signed (trusted) by someone that you trust, and that the
           certificate hasn't been revoked. For instance, the server's certificate may have been signed by
           Verisign (www.verisign.com), and you decide that you want to trust Verisign to sign legitimate
           certificates.

       2.  check that the least-significant cn RDN in the server's certificate's DN is the fully-qualified
           hostname of the hostname that you connected to when creating the LDAPS object. For example if the
           server is &lt;cn=ldap.example.com,ou=My department,o=My company&gt;, then the RDN to check is
           cn=ldap.example.com.

       You can do this by using the cafile and capath options when creating a <b>Net::LDAPS</b> object, <u>and</u> by
       setting the verify option to 'require'.

       To prevent hackers 'sniffing' passwords and other information on your connection, you also have to
       make sure the encryption algorithm used by the SSL connection is good enough. This is also something
       that gets decided by the SSL handshake - if the client and server cannot agree on an acceptable
       algorithm the connection is not made.

       <b>Net::LDAPS</b> will by default use all the algorithms built into your copy of OpenSSL, except for ones
       considered to use "low" strength encryption, and those using export strength encryption. You can
       override this when you create the <b>Net::LDAPS</b> object using the 'ciphers' option.

       Once you've made the secure connection, you should also check that the encryption algorithm that is
       actually being used is one that you find acceptable. Broken servers have been observed in the field
       which 'fail over' and give you an unencrypted connection, so you ought to check for that.

       <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>and</b> <b>TLS</b> <b>work</b>

       SSL is a good solution to many network security problems, but it is not a standard. The IETF
       corrected some defects in the SSL mechanism and published a standard called RFC 2246 which describes
       TLS ("Transport Layer Security"), which is simply a cleaned up and standardized version of SSL.

       You can only use TLS with an LDAPv3 server. That is because the standard (RFC 2830) for LDAP and TLS
       requires that the <u>normal</u> LDAP connection (ie., on port 389) can be switched on demand from plain text
       into a TLS connection. The switching mechanism uses a special extended LDAP operation, and since
       these are not legal in LDAPv2, you can only switch to TLS on an LDAPv3 connection.

       So the way you use TLS with LDAPv3 is that you create your normal LDAPv3 connection using
       "Net::LDAP::new()", and then you perform the switch using "Net::LDAP::start_tls()". The "start_tls()"
       method takes pretty much the same arguments as "Net::LDAPS::new()", so check above for details.

       <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>SASL</b> <b>work</b>

       SASL is an authentication framework that can be used by a number of different Internet services,
       including LDAPv3. Because it is only a framework, it doesn't provide any way to authenticate by
       itself; to actually authenticate to a service you need to use a specific SASL <u>mechanism</u>. A number of
       mechanisms are defined, such as CRAM-MD5.

       The use of a mechanism like CRAM-MD5 provides a solution to the password sniffing vulnerability,
       because these mechanisms typically do not require the user to send across a secret (eg., a password)
       in the clear across the network. Instead, authentication is carried out in a clever way which avoids
       this, and so prevents passwords from being sniffed.

       <b>Net::LDAP</b> supports SASL using the <b>Authen::SASL</b> class. Currently the only <b>Authen::SASL</b> subclasses
       (ie., SASL mechanism) available are CRAM-MD5 and EXTERNAL.

       Some SASL mechanisms provide a general solution to the sniffing of all data on the network
       vulnerability, as they can negotiate confidential (ie., encrypted) network connections. Note that
       this is over and above any SSL or TLS encryption! Unfortunately, perl's <b>Authen::SASL</b> code cannot
       negotiate this.
