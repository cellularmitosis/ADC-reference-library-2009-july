README - QTMultiImageThis file contains code that illustrates how to determine whether an image file contains  more than one image and how to display any of those images. This is useful for working with FlashPix files (which contain multiple resolutions of an image) and PhotoShop files (which store layers as separate images), among others.The key new functions to use are GraphicsImportGetImageCount and GraphicsImportSetImageIndex. The rest of the image-handling is done using graphics importer routines that have previously been available.This file defines a single function that prompts the user for an image file, determines how many images are contained in that file, and then displays each such image for a short period of time (2 seconds). Your application, of course, will probably want to do moreinteresting things with the image. Enjoy,QuickTime Team
