LWP::UserAgent(3)                    User Contributed Perl Documentation                   LWP::UserAgent(3)



<b>NAME</b>
       LWP::UserAgent - Web user agent class

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
        require LWP::UserAgent;

        my $ua = LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new;
        $ua-&gt;timeout(10);
        $ua-&gt;env_proxy;

        my $response = $ua-&gt;get('<a href="http://search.cpan.org/">http://search.cpan.org/</a>');

        if ($response-&gt;is_success) {
            print $response-&gt;content;  # or whatever
        }
        else {
            die $response-&gt;status_line;
        }

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The "LWP::UserAgent" is a class implementing a web user agent.  "LWP::UserAgent" objects can be used
       to dispatch web requests.

       In normal use the application creates an "LWP::UserAgent" object, and then configures it with values
       for timeouts, proxies, name, etc. It then creates an instance of "HTTP::Request" for the request that
       needs to be performed. This request is then passed to one of the request method the UserAgent, which
       dispatches it using the relevant protocol, and returns a "HTTP::Response" object.  There are
       convenience methods for sending the most common request types: <u>get()</u>, <u>head()</u> and <u>post()</u>.  When using
       these methods then the creation of the request object is hidden as shown in the synopsis above.

       The basic approach of the library is to use HTTP style communication for all protocol schemes.  This
       means that you will construct "HTTP::Request" objects and receive "HTTP::Response" objects even for
       non-HTTP resources like <u>gopher</u> and <u>ftp</u>.  In order to achieve even more similarity to HTTP style
       communications, gopher menus and file directories are converted to HTML documents.

<b>CONSTRUCTOR</b> <b>METHODS</b>
       The following constructor methods are available:

       $ua = LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new( %options )
           This method constructs a new "LWP::UserAgent" object and returns it.  Key/value pair arguments
           may be provided to set up the initial state.  The following options correspond to attribute
           methods described below:

              KEY                     DEFAULT
              -----------             --------------------
              agent                   "libwww-perl/#.##"
              from                    undef
              conn_cache              undef
              cookie_jar              undef
              default_headers         HTTP::Headers-&gt;new
              max_size                undef
              max_redirect            7
              parse_head              1
              protocols_allowed       undef
              protocols_forbidden     undef
              requests_redirectable   ['GET', 'HEAD']
              timeout                 180

           The following additional options are also accepted: If the "env_proxy" option is passed in with a
           TRUE value, then proxy settings are read from environment variables (see <u>env</u><b>_</b><u>proxy()</u> method
           below).  If the "keep_alive" option is passed in, then a "LWP::ConnCache" is set up (see
           <u>conn</u><b>_</b><u>cache()</u> method below).  The "keep_alive" value is passed on as the "total_capacity" for the
           connection cache.

       $ua-&gt;clone
           Returns a copy of the LWP::UserAgent object.

<b>ATTRIBUTES</b>
       The settings of the configuration attributes modify the behaviour of the "LWP::UserAgent" when it
       dispatches requests.  Most of these can also be initialized by options passed to the constructor
       method.

       The following attributes methods are provided.  The attribute value is left unchanged if no argument
       is given.  The return value from each method is the old attribute value.

       $ua-&gt;agent
       $ua-&gt;agent( $product_id )
           Get/set the product token that is used to identify the user agent on the network.  The agent
           value is sent as the "User-Agent" header in the requests.  The default is the string returned by
           the <b>_</b><u>agent()</u> method (see below).

           If the $product_id ends with space then the <b>_</b><u>agent()</u> string is appended to it.

           The user agent string should be one or more simple product identifiers with an optional version
           number separated by the "/" character.  Examples are:

             $ua-&gt;agent('Checkbot/0.4 ' . $ua-&gt;_agent);
             $ua-&gt;agent('Checkbot/0.4 ');    # same as above
             $ua-&gt;agent('Mozilla/5.0');
             $ua-&gt;agent("");                 # don't identify

       $ua-&gt;_agent
           Returns the default agent identifier.  This is a string of the form "libwww-perl/#.##", where
           "#.##" is substituted with the version number of this library.

       $ua-&gt;from
       $ua-&gt;from( $email_address )
           Get/set the e-mail address for the human user who controls the requesting user agent.  The
           address should be machine-usable, as defined in RFC 822.  The "from" value is send as the "From"
           header in the requests.  Example:

             $ua-&gt;from('gaas@cpan.org');

           The default is to not send a "From" header.  See the <u>default</u><b>_</b><u>headers()</u> method for the more
           general interface that allow any header to be defaulted.

       $ua-&gt;cookie_jar
       $ua-&gt;cookie_jar( $cookie_jar_obj )
           Get/set the cookie jar object to use.  The only requirement is that the cookie jar object must
           implement the extract_cookies($request) and add_cookie_header($response) methods.  These methods
           will then be invoked by the user agent as requests are sent and responses are received.  Normally
           this will be a "HTTP::Cookies" object or some subclass.

           The default is to have no cookie_jar, i.e. never automatically add "Cookie" headers to the
           requests.

           Shortcut: If a reference to a plain hash is passed in as the $cookie_jar_object, then it is
           replaced with an instance of "HTTP::Cookies" that is initialized based on the hash.  This form
           also automatically loads the "HTTP::Cookies" module.  It means that:

             $ua-&gt;cookie_jar({ file =&gt; "$ENV{HOME}/.cookies.txt" });

           is really just a shortcut for:

             require HTTP::Cookies;
             $ua-&gt;cookie_jar(HTTP::Cookies-&gt;new(file =&gt; "$ENV{HOME}/.cookies.txt"));

       $ua-&gt;default_headers
       $ua-&gt;default_headers( $headers_obj )
           Get/set the headers object that will provide default header values for any requests sent.  By
           default this will be an empty "HTTP::Headers" object.  Example:

             $ua-&gt;default_headers-&gt;push_header('Accept-Language' =&gt; "no, en");

       $ua-&gt;default_header( $field )
       $ua-&gt;default_header( $field =&gt; $value )
           This is just a short-cut for $ua-&gt;default_headers-&gt;header( $field =&gt; $value ). Example:

             $ua-&gt;default_header('Accept-Language' =&gt; "no, en");

       $ua-&gt;conn_cache
       $ua-&gt;conn_cache( $cache_obj )
           Get/set the "LWP::ConnCache" object to use.  See LWP::ConnCache for details.

       $ua-&gt;credentials( $netloc, $realm, $uname, $pass )
           Set the user name and password to be used for a realm.  It is often more useful to specialize the
           <u>get</u><b>_</b><u>basic</u><b>_</b><u>credentials()</u> method instead.

       $ua-&gt;max_size
       $ua-&gt;max_size( $bytes )
           Get/set the size limit for response content.  The default is "undef", which means that there is
           no limit.  If the returned response content is only partial, because the size limit was exceeded,
           then a "Client-Aborted" header will be added to the response.  The content might end up longer
           than "max_size" as we abort once appending a chunk of data makes the length exceed the limit.
           The "Content-Length" header, if present, will indicate the length of the full content and will
           normally not be the same as "length($res-&gt;content)".

       $ua-&gt;max_redirect
       $ua-&gt;max_redirect( $n )
           This reads or sets the object's limit of how many times it will obey redirection responses in a
           given request cycle.

           By default, the value is 7. This means that if you call <u>request()</u> method and the response is a
           redirect elsewhere which is in turn a redirect, and so on seven times, then LWP gives up after
           that seventh request.

       $ua-&gt;parse_head
       $ua-&gt;parse_head( $boolean )
           Get/set a value indicating whether we should initialize response headers from the &lt;head&gt; section
           of HTML documents. The default is TRUE.  Do not turn this off, unless you know what you are
           doing.

       $ua-&gt;protocols_allowed
       $ua-&gt;protocols_allowed( \@protocols )
           This reads (or sets) this user agent's list of protocols that the request methods will
           exclusively allow.  The protocol names are case insensitive.

           For example: "$ua-&gt;protocols_allowed( [ 'http', 'https'] );" means that this user agent will
           <u>allow</u> <u>only</u> those protocols, and attempts to use this user agent to access URLs with any other
           schemes (like "<a href="ftp://..">ftp://..</a>") will result in a 500 error.

           To delete the list, call: "$ua-&gt;protocols_allowed(undef)"

           By default, an object has neither a "protocols_allowed" list, nor a "protocols_forbidden" list.

           Note that having a "protocols_allowed" list causes any "protocols_forbidden" list to be ignored.

       $ua-&gt;protocols_forbidden
       $ua-&gt;protocols_forbidden( \@protocols )
           This reads (or sets) this user agent's list of protocols that the request method will <u>not</u> allow.
           The protocol names are case insensitive.

           For example: "$ua-&gt;protocols_forbidden( [ 'file', 'mailto'] );" means that this user agent will
           <u>not</u> allow those protocols, and attempts to use this user agent to access URLs with those schemes
           will result in a 500 error.

           To delete the list, call: "$ua-&gt;protocols_forbidden(undef)"

       $ua-&gt;requests_redirectable
       $ua-&gt;requests_redirectable( \@requests )
           This reads or sets the object's list of request names that "$ua-&gt;redirect_ok(...)" will allow
           redirection for.  By default, this is "['GET', 'HEAD']", as per RFC 2616.  To change to include
           'POST', consider:

              push @{ $ua-&gt;requests_redirectable }, 'POST';

       $ua-&gt;timeout
       $ua-&gt;timeout( $secs )
           Get/set the timeout value in seconds. The default <u>timeout()</u> value is 180 seconds, i.e. 3 minutes.

           The requests is aborted if no activity on the connection to the server is observed for "timeout"
           seconds.  This means that the time it takes for the complete transaction and the <u>request()</u> method
           to actually return might be longer.

       <b>Proxy</b> <b>attributes</b>

       The following methods set up when requests should be passed via a proxy server.

       $ua-&gt;proxy(\@schemes, $proxy_url)
       $ua-&gt;proxy($scheme, $proxy_url)
           Set/retrieve proxy URL for a scheme:

            $ua-&gt;proxy(['http', 'ftp'], '<a href="http://proxy.sn.no:8001/">http://proxy.sn.no:8001/</a>');
            $ua-&gt;proxy('gopher', '<a href="http://proxy.sn.no:8001/">http://proxy.sn.no:8001/</a>');

           The first form specifies that the URL is to be used for proxying of access methods listed in the
           list in the first method argument, i.e. 'http' and 'ftp'.

           The second form shows a shorthand form for specifying proxy URL for a single access scheme.

       $ua-&gt;no_proxy( $domain, ... )
           Do not proxy requests to the given domains.  Calling no_proxy without any domains clears the list
           of domains. Eg:

            $ua-&gt;no_proxy('localhost', 'no', ...);

       $ua-&gt;env_proxy
           Load proxy settings from *_proxy environment variables.  You might specify proxies like this (sh-
           syntax):

             gopher_proxy=<a href="http://proxy.my.place/">http://proxy.my.place/</a>
             wais_proxy=<a href="http://proxy.my.place/">http://proxy.my.place/</a>
             no_proxy="localhost,my.domain"
             export gopher_proxy wais_proxy no_proxy

           csh or tcsh users should use the "setenv" command to define these environment variables.

           On systems with case insensitive environment variables there exists a name clash between the CGI
           environment variables and the "HTTP_PROXY" environment variable normally picked up by
           <u>env</u><b>_</b><u>proxy()</u>.  Because of this "HTTP_PROXY" is not honored for CGI scripts.  The "CGI_HTTP_PROXY"
           environment variable can be used instead.

<b>REQUEST</b> <b>METHODS</b>
       The methods described in this section are used to dispatch requests via the user agent.  The
       following request methods are provided:

       $ua-&gt;get( $url )
       $ua-&gt;get( $url , $field_name =&gt; $value, ... )
           This method will dispatch a "GET" request on the given $url.  Further arguments can be given to
           initialize the headers of the request. These are given as separate name/value pairs.  The return
           value is a response object.  See HTTP::Response for a description of the interface it provides.

           Fields names that start with ":" are special.  These will not initialize headers of the request
           but will determine how the response content is treated.  The following special field names are
           recognized:

               :content_file   =&gt; $filename
               :content_cb     =&gt; \&amp;callback
               :read_size_hint =&gt; $bytes

           If a $filename is provided with the ":content_file" option, then the response content will be
           saved here instead of in the response object.  If a callback is provided with the ":content_cb"
           option then this function will be called for each chunk of the response content as it is received
           from the server.  If neither of these options are given, then the response content will
           accumulate in the response object itself.  This might not be suitable for very large response
           bodies.  Only one of ":content_file" or ":content_cb" can be specified.  The content of
           unsuccessful responses will always accumulate in the response object itself, regardless of the
           ":content_file" or ":content_cb" options passed in.

           The ":read_size_hint" option is passed to the protocol module which will try to read data from
           the server in chunks of this size.  A smaller value for the ":read_size_hint" will result in a
           higher number of callback invocations.

           The callback function is called with 3 arguments: a chunk of data, a reference to the response
           object, and a reference to the protocol object.  The callback can abort the request by invoking
           <u>die()</u>.  The exception message will show up as the "X-Died" header field in the response returned
           by the <u>get()</u> function.

       $ua-&gt;head( $url )
       $ua-&gt;head( $url , $field_name =&gt; $value, ... )
           This method will dispatch a "HEAD" request on the given $url.  Otherwise it works like the <u>get()</u>
           method described above.

       $ua-&gt;post( $url, \%form )
       $ua-&gt;post( $url, \@form )
       $ua-&gt;post( $url, \%form, $field_name =&gt; $value, ... )
           This method will dispatch a "POST" request on the given $url, with %form or @form providing the
           key/value pairs for the fill-in form content. Additional headers and content options are the same
           as for the <u>get()</u> method.

           This method will use the <u>POST()</u> function from "HTTP::Request::Common" to build the request.  See
           HTTP::Request::Common for a details on how to pass form content and other advanced features.

       $ua-&gt;mirror( $url, $filename )
           This method will get the document identified by $url and store it in file called $filename.  If
           the file already exists, then the request will contain an "If-Modified-Since" header matching the
           modification time of the file.  If the document on the server has not changed since this time,
           then nothing happens.  If the document has been updated, it will be downloaded again.  The
           modification time of the file will be forced to match that of the server.

           The return value is the the response object.

       $ua-&gt;request( $request )
       $ua-&gt;request( $request, $content_file )
       $ua-&gt;request( $request, $content_cb )
       $ua-&gt;request( $request, $content_cb, $read_size_hint )
           This method will dispatch the given $request object.  Normally this will be an instance of the
           "HTTP::Request" class, but any object with a similar interface will do.  The return value is a
           response object.  See HTTP::Request and HTTP::Response for a description of the interface
           provided by these classes.

           The <u>request()</u> method will process redirects and authentication responses transparently.  This
           means that it may actually send several simple requests via the <u>simple</u><b>_</b><u>request()</u> method described
           below.

           The request methods described above; <u>get()</u>, <u>head()</u>, <u>post()</u> and <u>mirror()</u>, will all dispatch the
           request they build via this method.  They are convenience methods that simply hides the creation
           of the request object for you.

           The $content_file, $content_cb and $read_size_hint all correspond to options described with the
           <u>get()</u> method above.

           You are allowed to use a CODE reference as "content" in the request object passed in.  The
           "content" function should return the content when called.  The content can be returned in chunks.
           The content function will be invoked repeatedly until it return an empty string to signal that
           there is no more content.

       $ua-&gt;simple_request( $request )
       $ua-&gt;simple_request( $request, $content_file )
       $ua-&gt;simple_request( $request, $content_cb )
       $ua-&gt;simple_request( $request, $content_cb, $read_size_hint )
           This method dispatches a single request and returns the response received.  Arguments are the
           same as for <u>request()</u> described above.

           The difference from <u>request()</u> is that <u>simple</u><b>_</b><u>request()</u> will not try to handle redirects or
           authentication responses.  The <u>request()</u> method will in fact invoke this method for each simple
           request it sends.

       $ua-&gt;is_protocol_supported( $scheme )
           You can use this method to test whether this user agent object supports the specified "scheme".
           (The "scheme" might be a string (like 'http' or 'ftp') or it might be an URI object reference.)

           Whether a scheme is supported, is determined by the user agent's "protocols_allowed" or
           "protocols_forbidden" lists (if any), and by the capabilities of LWP.  I.e., this will return
           TRUE only if LWP supports this protocol <u>and</u> it's permitted for this particular object.

       <b>Callback</b> <b>methods</b>

       The following methods will be invoked as requests are processed. These methods are documented here
       because subclasses of "LWP::UserAgent" might want to override their behaviour.

       $ua-&gt;prepare_request( $request )
           This method is invoked by <u>simple</u><b>_</b><u>request()</u>.  Its task is to modify the given $request object by
           setting up various headers based on the attributes of the user agent. The return value should
           normally be the $request object passed in.  If a different request object is returned it will be
           the one actually processed.

           The headers affected by the base implementation are; "User-Agent", "From", "Range" and "Cookie".

       $ua-&gt;redirect_ok( $prospective_request, $response )
           This method is called by <u>request()</u> before it tries to follow a redirection to the request in
           $response.  This should return a TRUE value if this redirection is permissible.  The
           $prospective_request will be the request to be sent if this method returns TRUE.

           The base implementation will return FALSE unless the method is in the object's
           "requests_redirectable" list, FALSE if the proposed redirection is to a "file://..."  URL, and
           TRUE otherwise.

       $ua-&gt;get_basic_credentials( $realm, $uri, $isproxy )
           This is called by <u>request()</u> to retrieve credentials for documents protected by Basic or Digest
           Authentication.  The arguments passed in is the $realm provided by the server, the $uri requested
           and a boolean flag to indicate if this is authentication against a proxy server.

           The method should return a username and password.  It should return an empty list to abort the
           authentication resolution attempt.  Subclasses can override this method to prompt the user for
           the information. An example of this can be found in "lwp-request" program distributed with this
           library.

           The base implementation simply checks a set of pre-stored member variables, set up with the
           <u>credentials()</u> method.
