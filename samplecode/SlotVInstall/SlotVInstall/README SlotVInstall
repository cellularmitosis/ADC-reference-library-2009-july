SlotVInstallGreg Robbins 9/91This little program installs a slot VBL task for the main screen, even if the main screen uses built-invideo, by getting the gdRefNum and calling GetDctlEntryto find the slot number.The VBL will run 5 times and then be dequeued.Requires the MPW SIOW standard I/O package.
