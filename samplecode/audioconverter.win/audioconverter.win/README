README - AudioConverterAudioConverter is a sample application that illustrates how to use the Sound Manager's SoundConverter routines to convert AIFF and AIFC files (hereafter referred to as "AIFF/AIFC files") into either AIFF/AIFC files or QuickTime movies. It also illustrates how to parse AIFF/AIFC files.You should note in particular that the AudioConverter source code shows how to handle the compression parameters chunk that might be present in an AIFF/AIFC file. The compression parameters chunk contains parameters that are required to decompress the audio data in the file. See the electronic document MacOS_Sound.pdf for more information about the compression parameters chunk and the audio atoms list it contains.Enjoy!QuickTime team07 July 1999
