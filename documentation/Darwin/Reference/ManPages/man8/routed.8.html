ROUTED(8)                 BSD System Manager's Manual                ROUTED(8)

<b>NAME</b>
     <b>routed</b> -- network RIP and router discovery routing daemon

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
     <b>routed</b> [<b>-sqdghmpAt</b>] [<b>-T</b> <u>tracefile</u>] [<b>-F</b> <u>net</u>[/mask[,metric]]]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
     <b>Routed</b> is a daemon invoked at boot time to manage the network routing tables.  It uses Routing Informa-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;Information</font>
     tion Protocol, RIPv1 (RFC 1058), RIPv2 (RFC 1723), and Internet Router Discovery Protocol (RFC 1256) to
     maintain the kernel routing table.  The RIPv1 protocol is based on the reference 4.3BSD daemon.

     It listens on the <a href="../man4/udp.4.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/4/udp">udp(4)</a> socket for the <a href="route.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/route">route(8)</a> service (see <a href="../man5/services.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/services">services(5)</a>) for Routing Information Pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tocol&nbsp;Protocol</font>
     tocol packets.  It also sends and receives multicast Router Discovery ICMP messages.  If the host is a
     router, <b>routed</b> periodically supplies copies of its routing tables to any directly connected hosts and
     networks.  It also advertise or solicits default routes using Router Discovery ICMP messages.

     When started (or when a network interface is later turned on), <b>routed</b> uses an AF_ROUTE address family
     facility to find those directly connected interfaces configured into the system and marked "up".  It
     adds necessary routes for the interfaces to the kernel routing table.  Soon after being first started,
     and provided there is at least one interface on which RIP has not been disabled, <b>routed</b> deletes all
     pre-existing non-static routes in kernel table.  Static routes in the kernel table are preserved and
     included in RIP responses if they have a valid RIP metric (see <a href="route.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/route">route(8)</a> ).

     If more than one interface is present (not counting the loopback interface), it is assumed that the
     host should forward packets among the connected networks.  After transmitting a RIP <u>request</u> and Router
     Discovery Advertisements or Solicitations on a new interface, the daemon enters a loop, listening for
     RIP request and response and Router Discover packets from other hosts.

     When a <u>request</u> packet is received, <b>routed</b> formulates a reply based on the information maintained in its
     internal tables.  The <u>response</u> packet generated contains a list of known routes, each marked with a
     "hop count" metric (a count of 16 or greater is considered "infinite").  Advertised metrics reflect the
     metric associated with interface (see <a href="ifconfig.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/ifconfig">ifconfig(8)</a> ), so setting the metric on an interface is an effec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tive&nbsp;effective</font>
     tive way to steer traffic.

     Responses do not contain routes with a first hop on the requesting network to implement in part
     <u>split-horizon</u>.

     The routing table maintained by the daemon includes space for several gateways for each destination to
     speed recovery from a failing router.  RIP <u>response</u> packets received are used to update the routing
     tables provided they are from one of the several currently recognized gateways or advertise a better
     metric than at least one of the existing gateways.

     When an update is applied, <b>routed</b> records the change in its own tables and updates the kernel routing
     table if the best route to the destination changes.  The change in the kernel routing table is
     reflected in the next batch of <u>response</u> packets sent.  If the next response is not scheduled for a
     while, a <u>flash</u> <u>update</u> response containing only recently changed routes is sent.

     In addition to processing incoming packets, <b>routed</b> also periodically checks the routing table entries.
     If an entry has not been updated for 3 minutes, the entry's metric is set to infinity and marked for
     deletion.  Deletions are delayed until the route has been advertised with an infinite metric to insure
     the invalidation is propagated throughout the local internet.  This is a form of <u>poison</u> <u>reverse</u>.

     Routes in the kernel table that are added or changed as a result of ICMP Redirect messages are deleted
     after a while to minimize <u>black-holes</u>.  When a TCP connection suffers a timeout, the kernel tells
     <b>routed</b>, which deletes all redirected routes through the gateway involved, advances the age of all RIP
     routes through the gateway to allow an alternate to be chosen, and advances of the age of any relevant
     Router Discovery Protocol default routes.

     Hosts acting as internetwork routers gratuitously supply their routing tables every 30 seconds to all
     directly connected hosts and networks.  These RIP responses are sent to the broadcast address on nets
     that support broadcasting, to the destination address on point-to-point links, and to the router's own
     address on other networks.  If RIPv2 is enabled, multicast packets are sent on interfaces that support
     multicasting.

     If no response is received on a remote interface, if there are errors while sending responses, or if
     there are more errors than input or output (see <!-- a -->netstat(8)<!-- /a --> ), then the cable or some other part of the
     interface is assumed to be disconnected or broken, and routes are adjusted appropriately.

     The <u>Internet</u> <u>Router</u> <u>Discovery</u> <u>Protocol</u> is handled similarly.  When the daemon is supplying RIP routes,
     it also listens for Router Discovery Solicitations and sends Advertisements.  When it is quiet and only
     listening to other RIP routers, it sends Solicitations and listens for Advertisements.  If it receives
     a good Advertisement, it stops listening for broadcast or multicast RIP responses.  It tracks several
     advertising routers to speed recovery when the currently chosen router dies.  If all discovered routers
     disappear, the daemon resumes listening to RIP responses.

     While using Router Discovery (which happens by default when the system has a single network interface
     and a Router Discover Advertisement is received), there is a single default route and a variable number
     of redirected host routes in the kernel table.

     The Router Discover standard requires that advertisements have a default "lifetime" of 30 minutes.
     That means should something happen, a client can be without a good route for 30 minutes.  It is a good
     idea to reduce the default to 45 seconds using <b>-P</b> <b>rdisc_interval=45</b> on the command line or
     <b>rdisc_interval=45</b> in the <u>/etc/gateways</u> file.

     See the <b>pm_rdisc</b> facility described below to support "legacy" systems that can handle neither RIPv2 nor
     Router Discovery.

     By default, neither Router Discovery advertisements nor solicitations are sent over point to point
     links (e.g. PPP).

     Options supported by <b>routed</b>:

     <b>-s</b>      this option forces <b>routed</b> to supply routing information.  This is the default if multiple net-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">work&nbsp;network</font>
             work interfaces are present on which RIP or Router Discovery have not been disabled, and if the
             kernel switch ipforwarding=1.

     <b>-q</b>      is the opposite of the <b>-s</b> option.

     <b>-d</b>      Do not run in the background.  This option is meant for interactive use.

     <b>-g</b>      This flag is used on internetwork routers to offer a route to the "default" destination.  It is
             equivalent to <b>-F</b> <b>0/0,1</b> and is present mostly for historical reasons.  A better choice is <b>-P</b>
             <b>pm_rdisc</b> on the command line or <b>pm_rdisc</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <u>/etc/gateways</u> file.  since a larger metric will
             be used, reducing the spread of the potentially dangerous default route.  This is typically
             used on a gateway to the Internet, or on a gateway that uses another routing protocol whose
             routes are not reported to other local routers.  Notice that because a metric of 1 is used,
             this feature is dangerous.  It is more commonly accidently used to create chaos with routing
             loop than to solve problems.

     <b>-h</b>      This causes host or point-to-point routes to not be advertised, provided there is a network
             route going the same direction.  That is a limited kind of aggregation.  This option is useful
             on gateways to ethernets that have other gateway machines connected with point-to-point links
             such as SLIP.

     <b>-m</b>      This causes the machine to advertise a host or point-to-point route to its primary interface.
             It is useful on multi-homed machines such as NFS servers.  This option should not be used
             except when the cost of the host routes it generates is justified by the popularity of the
             server.  It is effective only when the machine is supplying routing information, because there
             is more than one interface.  The <b>-m</b> option overrides the <b>-q</b> option to the limited extent of
             advertising the host route.

     <b>-A</b>      do not ignore RIPv2 authentication if we do not care about RIPv2 authentication.  This option
             is required for conformance with RFC 1723.  However, it makes no sense and breaks using RIP as
             a discovery protocol to ignore all RIPv2 packets that carry authentication when this machine
             does not care about authentication.

     <b>-T</b> <u>tracefile</u>
             increases the debugging level to at least 1 and causes debugging information to be appended to
             the trace file.  Note that because of security concerns, it is wisest to not run <b>routed</b> rou-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tinely&nbsp;routinely</font>
             tinely with tracing directed to a file.

     <b>-t</b>      increases the debugging level, which causes more information to be logged on the tracefile
             specified with <b>-T</b> or standard out.  The debugging level can be increased or decreased with the
             <u>SIGUSR1</u> or <u>SIGUSR2</u> signals.

     <b>-F</b> <u>net[/mask][,metric]</u>
             minimize routes in transmissions via interfaces with addresses that match <u>net/mask</u>, and synthe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sizes&nbsp;synthesizes</font>
             sizes a default route to this machine with the <u>metric</u>.  The intent is to reduce RIP traffic on
             slow, point-to-point links such as PPP links by replacing many large UDP packets of RIP infor-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mation&nbsp;information</font>
             mation with a single, small packet containing a "fake" default route.  If <u>metric</u> is absent, a
             value of 14 is assumed to limit the spread of the "fake" default route.  This is a dangerous
             feature that when used carelessly can cause routing loops.  Notice also that more than one
             interface can match the specified network number and mask.  See also <b>-g</b>.

     <b>-P</b> <u>parms</u>
             is equivalent to adding the parameter line <u>parms</u> to the <u>/etc/gateways</u> file.

     Any other argument supplied is interpreted as the name of a file in which the actions of <b>routed</b> should
     be logged.  It is better to use <b>-T</b> instead of appending the name of the trace file to the command.

     <b>routed</b> also supports the notion of "distant" <u>passive</u> or <u>active</u> gateways.  When <b>routed</b> is started, it
     reads the file <u>/etc/gateways</u> to find such distant gateways which may not be located using only informa-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;information</font>
     tion from a routing socket, to discover if some of the local gateways are <u>passive</u>, and to obtain other
     parameters.  Gateways specified in this manner should be marked passive if they are not expected to
     exchange routing information, while gateways marked active should be willing to exchange RIP packets.
     Routes through <u>passive</u> gateways are installed in the kernel's routing tables once upon startup and are
     not included in transmitted RIP responses.

     Distant active gateways are treated like network interfaces.  RIP responses are sent to the distant
     <u>active</u> gateway.  If no responses are received, the associated route is deleted from the kernel table
     and RIP responses advertised via other interfaces.  If the distant gateway resumes sending RIP
     responses, the associated route is restored.

     Such gateways can be useful on media that do not support broadcasts or multicasts but otherwise act
     like classic shared media like Ethernets such as some ATM networks.  One can list all RIP routers
     reachable on the ATM network in <u>/etc/gateways</u> with a series of "host" lines.

     Gateways marked <u>external</u> are also passive, but are not placed in the kernel routing table nor are they
     included in routing updates.  The function of external entries is to indicate that another routing
     process will install such a route if necessary, and that alternate routes to that destination should
     not be installed by <b>routed</b>.  Such entries are only required when both routers may learn of routes to
     the same destination.

     The <u>/etc/gateways</u> file is comprised of a series of lines, each in one of the following formats or con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sist&nbsp;consist</font>
     sist of parameters described below:

     <b>net</b> <u>Nname[/mask]</u> <b>gateway</b> <u>Gname</u> <b>metric</b> <u>value</u> &lt;<b>passive</b> | <b>active</b> | <b>extern&gt;</b>

     <b>host</b> <u>Hname</u> <b>gateway</b> <u>Gname</u> <b>metric</b> <u>value</u> &lt;<b>passive</b> | <b>active</b> | <b>extern&gt;</b>

     <u>Nname</u> or <u>Hname</u> is the name of the destination network or host.  It may be a symbolic network name or an
     Internet address specified in "dot" notation (see <a href="../man3/inet.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/inet">inet(3)</a> ). (If it is a name, then it must either be
     defined in <u>/etc/networks</u> or <u>/etc/hosts</u>, or <a href="named.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/named">named(8)</a>, must have been started before <b>routed</b>.)

     <u>mask</u> is an optional number between 1 and 32 indicating the netmask associated with <u>Nname</u>.

     <u>Gname</u> is the name or address of the gateway to which RIP responses should be forwarded.

     <u>Value</u> is the hop count to the destination host or network.   <u>host</u> <u>hname</u>  is equivalent to  <u>net</u>
     <u>nname/32</u> .

     One of the keywords <b>passive</b>, <b>active</b> or <b>external</b> must be present to indicate whether the gateway should
     be treated as <b>passive</b> or <b>active</b> (as described above), or whether the gateway is <b>external</b> to the scope
     of the RIP protocol.

     Lines that start with neither "net" nor "host" must consist of one or more of the following parameter
     settings, separated by commas or blanks:

     <b>if</b>=<u>ifname</u>
             indicates that the other parameters on the line apply to the interface name <u>ifname</u>.

     <b>subnet</b>=<u>nname[/mask][,metric]</u>
             advertises a route to network <u>nname</u> with mask <u>mask</u> and the supplied metric (default 1).  This
             is useful for filling "holes" in CIDR allocations.  This parameter must appear by itself on a
             line.

             Do not use this feature unless necessary.  It is dangerous.

     <b>passwd</b>=<u>XXX</u>
             specifies a RIPv2 password that will be included on all RIPv2 responses sent and checked on all
             RIPv2 responses received.  The password must not contain any blanks, tab characters, commas or
             '#' characters.

     <b>no_ag</b>   turns off aggregation of subnets in RIPv1 and RIPv2 responses.

     <b>no_super_ag</b>
             turns off aggregation of networks into supernets in RIPv2 responses.

     <b>passive</b>
             is equivalent <b>no_rip</b> <b>no_rdisc</b>.

     <b>no_rip</b>  disables all RIP processing on the specified interface.  If no interfaces are allowed to
             process RIP packets, <b>routed</b> acts purely as a router discovery daemon.  <b>No_rip</b> is equivalent to
             <b>no_ripv1_in</b> <b>no_ripv2_in</b> <b>no_ripv1_out</b> <b>no_ripv2_out</b>.

             Note that turning off RIP without explicitly turning on router discovery advertisements with
             <b>rdisc_adv</b> or <b>-s</b> causes <b>routed</b> to act as a client router discovery daemon, not advertising.

     <b>no_ripv1_in</b>
             causes RIPv1 received responses to be ignored.

     <b>no_ripv2_in</b>
             causes RIPv2 received responses to be ignored.

     <b>ripv2_out</b>
             turns off RIPv1 output and causes RIPv2 advertisements to be multicast when possible.

     <b>no_rdisc</b>
             disables the Internet Router Discovery Protocol.

     <b>no_solicit</b>
             disables the transmission of Router Discovery Solicitations.

     <b>send_solicit</b>
             specifies that Router Discovery solicitations should be sent, even on point-to-point links,
             which by default only listen to Router Discovery messages.

     <b>no_rdisc_adv</b>
             disables the transmission of Router Discovery Advertisements

     <b>rdisc_adv</b>
             specifies that Router Discovery advertisements should be sent, even on point-to-point links,
             which by default only listen to Router Discovery messages

     <b>bcast_rdisc</b>
             specifies that Router Discovery packets should be broadcast instead of multicast.

     <b>rdisc_pref</b>=<u>N</u>
             sets the preference in Router Discovery Advertisements to the integer <u>N</u>.

     <b>rdisc_interval</b>=<u>N</u>
             sets the nominal interval with which Router Discovery Advertisements are transmitted to N sec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">onds&nbsp;seconds</font>
             onds and their lifetime to 3*N.

     <b>fake_default</b>=<u>metric</u>
             has an identical effect to <b>-F</b> <u>net[/mask][,metric]</u> with the network and mask coming from the
             specified interface.

     <b>pm_rdisc</b>
             is similar to <b>fake_default</b>.  When RIPv2 routes are multicast, so that RIPv1 listeners cannot
             receive them, this feature causes a RIPv1 default route to be broadcast to RIPv1 listeners.
             Unless modified with <b>fake_default</b>, the default route is broadcast with a metric of 14.  That
             serves as a "poor man's router discovery" protocol.

     Note that the netmask associated with point-to-point links (such as SLIP or PPP, with the IFF_POINTO-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">POINT&nbsp;IFF_POINTOPOINT</font>
     POINT flag) is used by <b>routed</b> to infer the netmask used by the remote system when RIPv1 is used.

<b>BUGS</b>
     It does not always detect unidirectional failures in network interfaces (e.g., when the output side
     fails).
