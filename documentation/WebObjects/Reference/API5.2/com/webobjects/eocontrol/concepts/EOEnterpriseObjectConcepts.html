  <h2>Initialization</h2>
  <p>The Framework creates enterprise objects with a constructor of the 
  following form:</p>
  <pre> 
  <blockquote> 
  public MyClass(
      EOEditingContext anEditingContext,
      EOClassDescription classDescription,
      EOGlobalID globalID
  )</blockquote>
  </pre>
  <p><br>
  </p>
  <p>This constructor should create a new instance of your enterprise 
  object class with the provided arguments and it can perform any 
  custom initialization that you require. Enterprise objects created 
  in a Java client and enterprise objects created on the server require
  this constructor.</p>
  <p>After an enterprise object is created, it receives an <b>awake...</b>
  message. The particular message depends on whether the object has been 
  fetched from a database or created anew in the application. In the 
  former case, it receives an awakeFromFetch message. In the latter, it
  receives an awakeFromInsertion message. The receiver can override either
  method to perform extra initialization-such as setting default 
  values-based on how it was created.</p>
  <p><br>
  <h2>Change Notification</h2>
  <p>For the Framework to keep all areas of an application synchronized, 
  enterprise objects must notify their observers when their state changes. 
  Objects do this by invoking willChange before altering any instance 
  variable or other kind of state. This method informs all observers that 
  the invoker is about to change. </p>
  <p>The primary observer of changes in an object is the object's 
  EOEditingContext. EOEditingContext is a subclass of EOObjectStore 
  that manages collections of objects in memory, tracking inserts, deletes,
  and updates, and propagating changes to the persistent store as needed. 
  You can get the EOEditingContext that contains an object by sending the
  object an editingContext message.</p>
  <p><br>
  <h2>Object and Class Metadata Access</h2>
  <p>One of the larger groups of methods in the EOEnterpriseObject interface 
  provides information about an object's properties. Most of these methods 
  consult an EOClassDescription to provide their answers. An object's 
  classDescription method returns it's class description. See the 
  EOClassDescription class specification for the methods it implements. 
  Methods you can send directly to an enterprise object include entityName,
  which provides the name of the entity mapped to the receiver's class; 
  allPropertyKeys, which returns the names of all the receiver's class 
  properties, attributes and relationships alike; and attributeKeys, which 
  returns just the names of the attributes.</p>
  <p>Some methods return information about relationships. 
  toOneRelationshipKeys and toManyRelationshipKeys return the names of the
  receiver's relationships, while isToManyKey: tells which kind a particular
  relationship is. deleteRuleForRelationshipKey indicates what should
  happen to the receiver's relationships when it's deleted. Similarly, 
  ownsDestinationObjectsForRelationshipKey indicates what should happen 
  when another object is added to or removed from the receiver's relationship. 
  Another method, classDescriptionForDestinationKey, returns the 
  EOClassDescription for the objects at the destination of a relationship.</p>
  <p><br>
  <h2>Snapshots</h2>
  <p>The key-value coding methods define a general mechanism for accessing an 
  object's properties, but you first have to know what those properties are. 
  Sometimes, however, the Framework needs to preserve an object's entire state
  for later use, whether to undo changes to the object, compare the values 
  that have changed, or just keep a record of the changes. The snapshotting 
  methods provide this service, extracting or setting all properties at once 
  and performing the necessary conversions for proper behavior. snapshot
  returns a dictionary containing all the receiver's properties, and 
  updateFromSnapshot sets properties of the receiver to the values in a snapshot.</p>
  <p>A special kind of snapshot is also used to merge an object's uncommitted 
  changes with changes that have been committed to the external store since 
  the object was fetched. These methods are changesFromSnapshot and 
  reapplyChangesFromDictionary.</p>
  <p><br>
  <h2>Writing an Enterprise Object Class</h2>
  <p>Some of the EOEnterpriseObject methods are for enterprise objects to 
  implement or override, and some are meant to be used as defined by the 
  Framework. Many methods are used internally by the Framework and rarely 
  invoked by application code. The tables in this section highlight the
  methods that you typically override or implement in a custom enterprise
  object.</p>
