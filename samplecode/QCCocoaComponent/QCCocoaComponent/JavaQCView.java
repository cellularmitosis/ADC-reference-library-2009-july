Abstract:  CocoaComponent extension allowing integration of
	a Quartz Composer QCView into Java containers.  Includes
	a testcase in main().
	
	This sample depends on the Particle System composition found in
	/Developer/Examples/Quartz Composer/Motion Graphics Compositions
	which is installed with the Xcode 2.0 developer examples.

Version: 1.0
