/*	File:		HelloWorld.c	Contains:	Test Jig.				How to use this test jig				I'm lazy, I never put this all together.				So, it's left as an exercise to the student.				If you want to run a test, first compilt his will the TestRandom line as the				only test line uncommented.				This will create a file called sizelist which is a list of the random				sizes to write.				Then, comment that out and make the DoWriteTest line the only one				that is uncommented.				Run it and it will create a file called testfile which contains the test				data. It is a good idea to delete this file between tests to be sure to				be testing all the same parts of the file system each time.				When you want to test reading, make sure you have a both "testfile" and				"sizelist" already generated and make the DoReadTest line the only one uncommented.				See the file CTestJig.c for info on how to compare buffered vs. nonbuffered.	Written by:	Steve Bollinger	Copyright:	Copyright (c) 1999 Apple Computer, Inc., All Rights Reserved.				You may incorporate this Apple sample source code into your program(s) without				restriction.
