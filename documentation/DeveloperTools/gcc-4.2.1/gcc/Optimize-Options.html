<h3 class="section">3.10 Options That Control Optimization</h3>

<p><a name="index-optimize-options-497"></a><a name="index-options_002c-optimization-498"></a>
These options control various sorts of optimizations.

 <p>Without any optimization option, the compiler's goal is to reduce the
cost of compilation and to make debugging produce the expected
results.  Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a
breakpoint between statements, you can then assign a new value to any
variable or change the program counter to any other statement in the
function and get exactly the results you would expect from the source
code.

 <p>Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt to improve
the performance and/or code size at the expense of compilation time
and possibly the ability to debug the program.

 <p>The compiler performs optimization based on the knowledge it has of
the program.  Optimization levels <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> and above, in
particular, enable <em>unit-at-a-time</em> mode, which allows the
compiler to consider information gained from later functions in
the file when compiling a function.  Compiling multiple files at
once to a single output file in <em>unit-at-a-time</em> mode allows
the compiler to use information gained from all of the files when
compiling each of them.

 <p>Not all optimizations are controlled directly by a flag.  Only
optimizations that have a flag are listed.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-O</code><dt><code>-O1</code><dd><a name="index-O-499"></a><a name="index-O1-500"></a>Optimize.  Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time, and a lot
more memory for a large function.

     <p>With <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp>, the compiler tries to reduce code size and execution
time, without performing any optimizations that take a great deal of
compilation time.

     <p><samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> turns on the following optimization flags:
     <pre class="smallexample">          -fdefer-pop 
          -fdelayed-branch 
          -fguess-branch-probability 
          -fcprop-registers 
          -fif-conversion 
          -fif-conversion2 
          -ftree-ccp 
          -ftree-dce 
          -ftree-dominator-opts 
          -ftree-dse 
          -ftree-ter 
          -ftree-lrs 
          -ftree-sra 
          -ftree-copyrename 
          -ftree-fre 
          -ftree-ch 
          -funit-at-a-time 
          -fmerge-constants
     </pre>
     <p><samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> also turns on <samp><span class="option">-fomit-frame-pointer</span></samp> on machines
where doing so does not interfere with debugging.

     <br><dt><code>-O2</code><dd><a name="index-O2-501"></a>Optimize even more.  GCC performs nearly all supported optimizations
that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff.  The compiler does not
perform loop unrolling or function inlining when you specify <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>. 
As compared to <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp>, this option increases both compilation time
and the performance of the generated code.

     <p><samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp> turns on all optimization flags specified by <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp>.  It
also turns on the following optimization flags:
     <pre class="smallexample">          -fthread-jumps 
          -fcrossjumping 
          -foptimize-sibling-calls 
          -fcse-follow-jumps  -fcse-skip-blocks 
          -fgcse  -fgcse-lm  
          -fexpensive-optimizations 
          -frerun-cse-after-loop  
          -fcaller-saves 
          -fpeephole2 
          -fschedule-insns  -fschedule-insns2 
          -fsched-interblock  -fsched-spec 
          -fregmove 
          -fstrict-aliasing -fstrict-overflow 
          -fdelete-null-pointer-checks 
          -freorder-blocks  -freorder-functions 
          -falign-functions  -falign-jumps 
          -falign-loops  -falign-labels 
          -ftree-vrp 
          -ftree-pre
     </pre>
     <p>Please note the warning under <samp><span class="option">-fgcse</span></samp> about
invoking <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp> on programs that use computed gotos.

     <p><samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp> doesn't turn on <samp><span class="option">-ftree-vrp</span></samp> for the Ada compiler. 
This option must be explicitly specified on the command line to be
enabled for the Ada compiler.

     <!-- APPLE LOCAL begin optimization -->
<p>In Apple's version of GCC, <samp><span class="option">-fstrict-aliasing</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-freorder-blocks</span></samp>, and <samp><span class="option">-fsched-interblock</span></samp>
are disabled by default when optimizing. 
<!-- APPLE LOCAL end optimization -->

     <br><dt><code>-O3</code><dd><a name="index-O3-502"></a>Optimize yet more.  <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp> turns on all optimizations specified by
<samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp> and also turns on the <samp><span class="option">-finline-functions</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-funswitch-loops</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-fgcse-after-reload</span></samp> options.

     <br><dt><code>-O0</code><dd><a name="index-O0-503"></a>Do not optimize.  This is the default.

     <!-- APPLE LOCAL begin -fast or -fastf or -fastcp -->
<br><dt><code>-fast</code><dd><a name="index-fast-504"></a>Optimize for maximum performance. <samp><span class="option">-fast</span></samp> changes the overall optimization
strategy of GCC in order to produce the fastest possible running code for PPC7450
and G5 architectures. By default, <samp><span class="option">-fast</span></samp> optimizes for G5. Programs
optimized for G5 will not run on PPC7450. To optimize for PPC7450, add
<samp><span class="option">-mcpu=7450</span></samp> on command line.

     <p><samp><span class="option">-fast</span></samp> currently enables the following optimization flags (for G5 and PPC7450). 
These flags may change in the future.  You cannot override any of these options if you use
<samp><span class="option">-fast</span></samp> except by setting <samp><span class="option">-mcpu=7450</span></samp> (or <samp><span class="option">-fPIC</span></samp>, see below).

     <pre class="smallexample">          -O3
          -falign-loops-max-skip=15
          -falign-jumps-max-skip=15
          -falign-loops=16
          -falign-jumps=16
          -falign-functions=16
          -malign-natural (except when -fastf is specified)
          -ffast-math
          -fstrict-aliasing
          -funroll-loops
          -ftree-loop-linear

          -mcpu=G5
          -mpowerpc-gpopt
          -mtune=G5  (unless -mtune=G4 is specified).
          -fsched-interblock
          -fgcse-sm
          -mpowerpc64
     </pre>
     <p>To build shared libraries with <samp><span class="option">-fast</span></samp>, specify <samp><span class="option">-fPIC</span></samp>
on the command line as <samp><span class="option">-fast</span></samp> turns on <samp><span class="option">-mdynamic-no-pic</span></samp>
otherwise.

     <p>Important notes: <samp><span class="option">-ffast-math</span></samp> results in code that is not necessarily
IEEE-compliant.  <samp><span class="option">-fstrict-aliasing</span></samp> is highly likely to break
non-standard-compliant programs.  <samp><span class="option">-malign-natural</span></samp> only works properly if
the entire program is compiled with it, and none of the standard headers/libraries
contain any code that changes alignment when this option is used.

     <p>On Intel target, <samp><span class="option">-fast</span></samp> currently enables the following optimization flags:

     <pre class="smallexample">          -O3
          -fomit-frame-pointer
          -fstrict-aliasing
          -momit-leaf-frame-pointer
          -fno-tree-pre
          -falign-loops
     </pre>
     <p>All choices of flags enabled by <samp><span class="option">-fast</span></samp> are subject to change without notice.

     <!-- APPLE LOCAL end -fast or -fastf or -fastcp -->
<!-- APPLE LOCAL begin 4231761 -Oz -->
<br><dt><code>-Os</code><dd><a name="index-Os-505"></a>Optimize for size, but not at the expense of speed. 
<samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp> enables all <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp> optimizations that
do not typically increase code size.  However, instructions
are chosen for best performance, regardless of size. 
To optimize solely for size on Darwin, use <samp><span class="option">-Oz</span></samp> (APPLE ONLY).

     <p>The following options are set for <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, but are disabled under <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>:
     <pre class="smallexample">          -falign-functions  -falign-jumps  -falign-loops 
          -falign-labels  -freorder-blocks  -freorder-blocks-and-partition 
          -fprefetch-loop-arrays  -ftree-vect-loop-version
     </pre>
     <!-- APPLE LOCAL begin 4200438 -->
<p>When optimizing with <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-Oz</span></samp> (APPLE ONLY) on
Darwin, any function up to 30 &ldquo;estimated insns&rdquo; in size will be
considered for inlining.  When compiling C and Objective-C sourcefiles with
<samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-Oz</span></samp> on Darwin, functions explictly marked
with the <code>inline</code> keyword up to 450 &ldquo;estimated insns&rdquo; in size
will be considered for inlining. 
<!-- APPLE LOCAL end 4200438 -->
<!-- APPLE LOCAL begin Disable string insns with -Os on Darwin (radar 3509006) -->
When compiling for Apple POWERPC targets, <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="option">-Oz</span></samp> (APPLE ONLY) disable use of the string instructions even though they
would usually be smaller, because the kernel can't emulate them
correctly in some rare cases.  This behavior is not portable to any
other gcc environment, and will not affect most programs at all.  If
you really want the string instructions, use -mstring. 
<!-- APPLE LOCAL end Disable string insns with -Os on Darwin (radar 3509006) -->

     <br><dt><code>-Oz</code><dd><a name="index-Oz-506"></a>(APPLE ONLY) Optimize for size, regardless of performance. 
<samp><span class="option">-Oz</span></samp> enables the same optimization flags that <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>
uses, but <samp><span class="option">-Oz</span></samp> also enables other optimizations intended solely
to reduce code size.  In particular, instructions that encode into
fewer bytes are preferred over longer instructions that execute in
fewer cycles.  <samp><span class="option">-Oz</span></samp> on Darwin is very similar to <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>
in FSF distributions of GCC.  <samp><span class="option">-Oz</span></samp> employs the same inlining
limits and avoids string instructions just like <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>. 
<!-- APPLE LOCAL end 4231761 -Oz -->

     <p>If you use multiple <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> options, with or without level numbers,
the last such option is the one that is effective. 
</dl>

 <p>Options of the form <samp><span class="option">-f</span><var>flag</var></samp> specify machine-independent
flags.  Most flags have both positive and negative forms; the negative
form of <samp><span class="option">-ffoo</span></samp> would be <samp><span class="option">-fno-foo</span></samp>.  In the table
below, only one of the forms is listed&mdash;the one you typically will
use.  You can figure out the other form by either removing `<samp><span class="samp">no-</span></samp>'
or adding it.

 <p>The following options control specific optimizations.  They are either
activated by <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> options or are related to ones that are.  You
can use the following flags in the rare cases when &ldquo;fine-tuning&rdquo; of
optimizations to be performed is desired.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-fno-default-inline</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002ddefault_002dinline-507"></a>Do not make member functions inline by default merely because they are
defined inside the class scope (C++ only).  Otherwise, when you specify
<samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp><!-- /@w -->, member functions defined inside class scope are compiled
inline by default; i.e., you don't need to add `<samp><span class="samp">inline</span></samp>' in front of
the member function name.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-defer-pop</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002ddefer_002dpop-508"></a>Always pop the arguments to each function call as soon as that function
returns.  For machines which must pop arguments after a function call,
the compiler normally lets arguments accumulate on the stack for several
function calls and pops them all at once.

     <!-- APPLE LOCAL begin 4231761 -Oz -->
<p>Disabled at levels <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-Oz</span></samp> (APPLE ONLY). 
<!-- APPLE LOCAL end 4231761 -Oz -->

     <br><dt><code>-fforce-mem</code><dd><a name="index-fforce_002dmem-509"></a>Force memory operands to be copied into registers before doing
arithmetic on them.  This produces better code by making all memory
references potential common subexpressions.  When they are not common
subexpressions, instruction combination should eliminate the separate
register-load. This option is now a nop and will be removed in 4.3.

     <br><dt><code>-fforce-addr</code><dd><a name="index-fforce_002daddr-510"></a>Force memory address constants to be copied into registers before
doing arithmetic on them.

     <br><dt><code>-fomit-frame-pointer</code><dd><a name="index-fomit_002dframe_002dpointer-511"></a>Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for functions that
don't need one.  This avoids the instructions to save, set up and
restore frame pointers; it also makes an extra register available
in many functions.  <strong>It also makes debugging impossible on
some machines.</strong>

     <p>On some machines, such as the VAX, this flag has no effect, because
the standard calling sequence automatically handles the frame pointer
and nothing is saved by pretending it doesn't exist.  The
machine-description macro <code>FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED</code> controls
whether a target machine supports this flag.  See <a href="../gccint/Registers.html#Registers">Register Usage</a>.

     <!-- APPLE LOCAL 4231761 -Oz -->
<p>Enabled at levels <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Oz</span></samp> (APPLE ONLY).

     <br><dt><code>-foptimize-sibling-calls</code><dd><a name="index-foptimize_002dsibling_002dcalls-512"></a>Optimize sibling and tail recursive calls.

     <!-- APPLE LOCAL 4231761 -Oz -->
<p>Enabled at levels <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Oz</span></samp> (APPLE ONLY).

     <br><dt><code>-fno-inline</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dinline-513"></a>Don't pay attention to the <code>inline</code> keyword.  Normally this option
is used to keep the compiler from expanding any functions inline. 
Note that if you are not optimizing, no functions can be expanded inline.

     <br><dt><code>-finline-functions</code><dd><a name="index-finline_002dfunctions-514"></a>Integrate all simple functions into their callers.  The compiler
heuristically decides which functions are simple enough to be worth
integrating in this way.

     <p>If all calls to a given function are integrated, and the function is
declared <code>static</code>, then the function is normally not output as
assembler code in its own right.

     <p>Enabled at level <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-finline-functions-called-once</code><dd><a name="index-finline_002dfunctions_002dcalled_002donce-515"></a>Consider all <code>static</code> functions called once for inlining into their
caller even if they are not marked <code>inline</code>.  If a call to a given
function is integrated, then the function is not output as assembler code
in its own right.

     <p>Enabled if <samp><span class="option">-funit-at-a-time</span></samp> is enabled.

     <br><dt><code>-fearly-inlining</code><dd><a name="index-fearly_002dinlining-516"></a>Inline functions marked by <code>always_inline</code> and functions whose body seems
smaller than the function call overhead early before doing
<samp><span class="option">-fprofile-generate</span></samp> instrumentation and real inlining pass.  Doing so
makes profiling significantly cheaper and usually inlining faster on programs
having large chains of nested wrapper functions.

     <p>Enabled by default.

     <br><dt><code>-finline-limit=</code><var>n</var><dd><a name="index-finline_002dlimit-517"></a>By default, GCC limits the size of functions that can be inlined.  This flag
allows the control of this limit for functions that are explicitly marked as
inline (i.e., marked with the inline keyword or defined within the class
definition in c++).  <var>n</var> is the size of functions that can be inlined in
number of pseudo instructions (not counting parameter handling).  The default
value of <var>n</var> is 600. 
Increasing this value can result in more inlined code at
the cost of compilation time and memory consumption.  Decreasing usually makes
the compilation faster and less code will be inlined (which presumably
means slower programs).  This option is particularly useful for programs that
use inlining heavily such as those based on recursive templates with C++.

     <p>Inlining is actually controlled by a number of parameters, which may be
specified individually by using <samp><span class="option">--param </span><var>name</var><span class="option">=</span><var>value</var></samp>. 
The <samp><span class="option">-finline-limit=</span><var>n</var></samp> option sets some of these parameters
as follows:

          <dl>
<dt><code>max-inline-insns-single</code><dd> is set to <var>n</var>/2. 
<br><dt><code>max-inline-insns-auto</code><dd> is set to <var>n</var>/2. 
<br><dt><code>min-inline-insns</code><dd> is set to 130 or <var>n</var>/4, whichever is smaller. 
<br><dt><code>max-inline-insns-rtl</code><dd> is set to <var>n</var>. 
</dl>

     <p>See below for a documentation of the individual
parameters controlling inlining.

     <p><em>Note:</em> pseudo instruction represents, in this particular context, an
abstract measurement of function's size.  In no way does it represent a count
of assembly instructions and as such its exact meaning might change from one
release to an another.

     <br><dt><code>-fkeep-inline-functions</code><dd><a name="index-fkeep_002dinline_002dfunctions-518"></a>In C, emit <code>static</code> functions that are declared <code>inline</code>
into the object file, even if the function has been inlined into all
of its callers.  This switch does not affect functions using the
<code>extern inline</code> extension in GNU C.  In C++, emit any and all
inline functions into the object file.

     <br><dt><code>-fkeep-static-consts</code><dd><a name="index-fkeep_002dstatic_002dconsts-519"></a>Emit variables declared <code>static const</code> when optimization isn't turned
on, even if the variables aren't referenced.

     <p>GCC enables this option by default.  If you want to force the compiler to
check if the variable was referenced, regardless of whether or not
optimization is turned on, use the <samp><span class="option">-fno-keep-static-consts</span></samp> option.

     <br><dt><code>-fmerge-constants</code><dd>Attempt to merge identical constants (string constants and floating point
constants) across compilation units.

     <p>This option is the default for optimized compilation if the assembler and
linker support it.  Use <samp><span class="option">-fno-merge-constants</span></samp> to inhibit this
behavior.

     <!-- APPLE LOCAL 4231761 -Oz -->
<p>Enabled at levels <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Oz</span></samp> (APPLE ONLY).

     <br><dt><code>-fmerge-all-constants</code><dd>Attempt to merge identical constants and identical variables.

     <p>This option implies <samp><span class="option">-fmerge-constants</span></samp>.  In addition to
<samp><span class="option">-fmerge-constants</span></samp> this considers e.g. even constant initialized
arrays or initialized constant variables with integral or floating point
types.  Languages like C or C++ require each non-automatic variable to
have distinct location, so using this option will result in non-conforming
behavior.

     <br><dt><code>-fmodulo-sched</code><dd><a name="index-fmodulo_002dsched-520"></a>Perform swing modulo scheduling immediately before the first scheduling
pass.  This pass looks at innermost loops and reorders their
instructions by overlapping different iterations.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-branch-count-reg</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dbranch_002dcount_002dreg-521"></a>Do not use &ldquo;decrement and branch&rdquo; instructions on a count register,
but instead generate a sequence of instructions that decrement a
register, compare it against zero, then branch based upon the result. 
This option is only meaningful on architectures that support such
instructions, which include x86, PowerPC, IA-64 and S/390.

     <p>The default is <samp><span class="option">-fbranch-count-reg</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-function-cse</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dfunction_002dcse-522"></a>Do not put function addresses in registers; make each instruction that
calls a constant function contain the function's address explicitly.

     <p>This option results in less efficient code, but some strange hacks

pointer/array dereferencing operations, some standard library
string/heap functions, and some other associated constructs with
range/validity tests.  Modules so instrumented should be immune to
buffer overflows, invalid heap use, and some other classes of C/C++
programming errors.  The instrumentation relies on a separate runtime
library (<samp><span class="file">libmudflap</span></samp>), which will be linked into a program if
<samp><span class="option">-fmudflap</span></samp> is given at link time.  Run-time behavior of the
instrumented program is controlled by the <samp><span class="env">MUDFLAP_OPTIONS</span></samp>
environment variable.  See <code>env MUDFLAP_OPTIONS=-help a.out</code>

     <p>Use <samp><span class="option">-fmudflapth</span></samp> instead of <samp><span class="option">-fmudflap</span></samp> to compile and to

optimizations based on the type of expressions.  In particular, an

example, an <code>unsigned int</code> can alias an <code>int</code>, but not a
<code>void*</code> or a <code>double</code>.  A character type may alias any other
type.

     <p>Every language that wishes to perform language-specific alias analysis

     <p>This option causes the preprocessor macro <code>__SUPPORT_SNAN__</code> to
be defined.

     <p>The default is <samp><span class="option">-fno-signaling-nans</span></samp>.

     <p>This option is experimental and does not currently guarantee to
disable all GCC optimizations that affect signaling NaN behavior.

     <br><dt><code>-fsingle-precision-constant</code><dd><a name="index-fsingle_002dprecision_002dconstant-598"></a>Treat floating point constant as single precision constant instead of
implicitly converting it to double precision constant.

     <br><dt><code>-fcx-limited-range</code><dt><code>-fno-cx-limited-range</code><dd><a name="index-fcx_002dlimited_002drange-599"></a><a name="index-fno_002dcx_002dlimited_002drange-600"></a>When enabled, this option states that a range reduction step is not
needed when performing complex division.  The default is
<samp><span class="option">-fno-cx-limited-range</span></samp>, but is enabled by <samp><span class="option">-ffast-math</span></samp>.

     <p>This option controls the default setting of the ISO C99
<code>CX_LIMITED_RANGE</code> pragma.  Nevertheless, the option applies to
all languages.

 </dl>

 <p>The following options control optimizations that may improve
performance, but are not enabled by any <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> options.  This
section includes experimental options that may produce broken code.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-fbranch-probabilities</code><dd><a name="index-fbranch_002dprobabilities-601"></a>After running a program compiled with <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span></samp>
(see <a href="Debugging-Options.html#Debugging-Options">Options for Debugging Your Program or <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp></a>), you can compile it a second time using
<samp><span class="option">-fbranch-probabilities</span></samp>, to improve optimizations based on
the number of times each branch was taken.  When the program
compiled with <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span></samp> exits it saves arc execution
counts to a file called <samp><var>sourcename</var><span class="file">.gcda</span></samp> for each source
file  The information in this data file is very dependent on the
structure of the generated code, so you must use the same source code
and the same optimization options for both compilations.

     <p>With <samp><span class="option">-fbranch-probabilities</span></samp>, GCC puts a
`<samp><span class="samp">REG_BR_PROB</span></samp>' note on each `<samp><span class="samp">JUMP_INSN</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">CALL_INSN</span></samp>'. 
These can be used to improve optimization.  Currently, they are only
used in one place: in <samp><span class="file">reorg.c</span></samp>, instead of guessing which path a
branch is mostly to take, the `<samp><span class="samp">REG_BR_PROB</span></samp>' values are used to
exactly determine which path is taken more often.

     <br><dt><code>-fprofile-values</code><dd><a name="index-fprofile_002dvalues-602"></a>If combined with <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span></samp>, it adds code so that some
data about values of expressions in the program is gathered.

     <p>With <samp><span class="option">-fbranch-probabilities</span></samp>, it reads back the data gathered
from profiling values of expressions and adds `<samp><span class="samp">REG_VALUE_PROFILE</span></samp>'
notes to instructions for their later usage in optimizations.

     <p>Enabled with <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-generate</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-use</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fvpt</code><dd><a name="index-fvpt-603"></a>If combined with <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span></samp>, it instructs the compiler to add
a code to gather information about values of expressions.

     <p>With <samp><span class="option">-fbranch-probabilities</span></samp>, it reads back the data gathered
and actually performs the optimizations based on them. 
Currently the optimizations include specialization of division operation
using the knowledge about the value of the denominator.

     <br><dt><code>-frename-registers</code><dd><a name="index-frename_002dregisters-604"></a>Attempt to avoid false dependencies in scheduled code by making use
of registers left over after register allocation.  This optimization
will most benefit processors with lots of registers.  Depending on the
debug information format adopted by the target, however, it can
make debugging impossible, since variables will no longer stay in
a &ldquo;home register&rdquo;.

     <p>Enabled by default with <samp><span class="option">-funroll-loops</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-ftracer</code><dd><a name="index-ftracer-605"></a>Perform tail duplication to enlarge superblock size.  This transformation
simplifies the control flow of the function allowing other optimizations to do
better job.

     <p>Enabled with <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-use</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-funroll-loops</code><dd><a name="index-funroll_002dloops-606"></a>Unroll loops whose number of iterations can be determined at compile time or
upon entry to the loop.  <samp><span class="option">-funroll-loops</span></samp> implies
<samp><span class="option">-frerun-cse-after-loop</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-fweb</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-frename-registers</span></samp>. 
It also turns on complete loop peeling (i.e. complete removal of loops with
small constant number of iterations).  This option makes code larger, and may
or may not make it run faster.

     <p>Enabled with <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-use</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-funroll-all-loops</code><dd><a name="index-funroll_002dall_002dloops-607"></a>Unroll all loops, even if their number of iterations is uncertain when
the loop is entered.  This usually makes programs run more slowly. 
<samp><span class="option">-funroll-all-loops</span></samp> implies the same options as
<samp><span class="option">-funroll-loops</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fpeel-loops</code><dd><a name="index-fpeel_002dloops-608"></a>Peels the loops for that there is enough information that they do not
roll much (from profile feedback).  It also turns on complete loop peeling
(i.e. complete removal of loops with small constant number of iterations).

     <p>Enabled with <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-use</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fmove-loop-invariants</code><dd><a name="index-fmove_002dloop_002dinvariants-609"></a>Enables the loop invariant motion pass in the RTL loop optimizer.  Enabled
at level <samp><span class="option">-O1</span></samp>

     <br><dt><code>-funswitch-loops</code><dd><a name="index-funswitch_002dloops-610"></a>Move branches with loop invariant conditions out of the loop, with duplicates
of the loop on both branches (modified according to result of the condition).

     <br><dt><code>-ffunction-sections</code><dt><code>-fdata-sections</code><dd><a name="index-ffunction_002dsections-611"></a><a name="index-fdata_002dsections-612"></a>Place each function or data item into its own section in the output
file if the target supports arbitrary sections.  The name of the
function or the name of the data item determines the section's name
in the output file.

     <p>Use these options on systems where the linker can perform optimizations
to improve locality of reference in the instruction space.  Most systems
using the ELF object format and SPARC processors running Solaris 2 have
linkers with such optimizations.  AIX may have these optimizations in
the future.

     <p>Only use these options when there are significant benefits from doing
so.  When you specify these options, the assembler and linker will
create larger object and executable files and will also be slower. 
You will not be able to use <code>gprof</code> on all systems if you
specify this option and you may have problems with debugging if
you specify both this option and <samp><span class="option">-g</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fbranch-target-load-optimize</code><dd><a name="index-fbranch_002dtarget_002dload_002doptimize-613"></a>Perform branch target register load optimization before prologue / epilogue
threading. 
The use of target registers can typically be exposed only during reload,
thus hoisting loads out of loops and doing inter-block scheduling needs
a separate optimization pass.

     <br><dt><code>-fbranch-target-load-optimize2</code><dd><a name="index-fbranch_002dtarget_002dload_002doptimize2-614"></a>Perform branch target register load optimization after prologue / epilogue
threading.

     <br><dt><code>-fbtr-bb-exclusive</code><dd><a name="index-fbtr_002dbb_002dexclusive-615"></a>When performing branch target register load optimization, don't reuse
branch target registers in within any basic block.

     <br><dt><code>-fstack-protector</code><dd>Emit extra code to check for buffer overflows, such as stack smashing
attacks.  This is done by adding a guard variable to functions with
vulnerable objects.  This includes functions that call alloca, and
functions with buffers larger than 8 bytes.  The guards are initialized
when a function is entered and then checked when the function exits. 
If a guard check fails, an error message is printed and the program exits.

     <br><dt><code>-fstack-protector-all</code><dd>Like <samp><span class="option">-fstack-protector</span></samp> except that all functions are protected.

     <br><dt><code>-fsection-anchors</code><dd><a name="index-fsection_002danchors-616"></a>Try to reduce the number of symbolic address calculations by using
shared &ldquo;anchor&rdquo; symbols to address nearby objects.  This transformation
can help to reduce the number of GOT entries and GOT accesses on some
targets.

     <p>For example, the implementation of the following function <code>foo</code>:

     <pre class="smallexample">          static int a, b, c;
          int foo (void) { return a + b + c; }
     </pre>
     <p>would usually calculate the addresses of all three variables, but if you
compile it with <samp><span class="option">-fsection-anchors</span></samp>, it will access the variables
from a common anchor point instead.  The effect is similar to the
following pseudocode (which isn't valid C):

     <pre class="smallexample">          int foo (void)
          {
            register int *xr = &amp;x;
            return xr[&amp;a - &amp;x] + xr[&amp;b - &amp;x] + xr[&amp;c - &amp;x];
          }
     </pre>
     <p>Not all targets support this option.

     <br><dt><code>--param </code><var>name</var><code>=</code><var>value</var><dd><a name="index-param-617"></a>In some places, GCC uses various constants to control the amount of
optimization that is done.  For example, GCC will not inline functions
that contain more that a certain number of instructions.  You can
control some of these constants on the command-line using the
<samp><span class="option">--param</span></samp> option.

     <p>The names of specific parameters, and the meaning of the values, are
tied to the internals of the compiler, and are subject to change
without notice in future releases.

     <p>In each case, the <var>value</var> is an integer.  The allowable choices for
<var>name</var> are given in the following table:

          <dl>
<dt><code>salias-max-implicit-fields</code><dd>The maximum number of fields in a variable without direct
structure accesses for which structure aliasing will consider trying
to track each field.  The default is 5

          <br><dt><code>salias-max-array-elements</code><dd>The maximum number of elements an array can have and its elements
still be tracked individually by structure aliasing. The default is 4

          <br><dt><code>sra-max-structure-size</code><dd>The maximum structure size, in bytes, at which the scalar replacement
of aggregates (SRA) optimization will perform block copies.  The
default value, 0, implies that GCC will select the most appropriate
size itself.

          <br><dt><code>sra-field-structure-ratio</code><dd>The threshold ratio (as a percentage) between instantiated fields and
the complete structure size.  We say that if the ratio of the number
of bytes in instantiated fields to the number of bytes in the complete
structure exceeds this parameter, then block copies are not used.  The
default is 75.

          <br><dt><code>max-crossjump-edges</code><dd>The maximum number of incoming edges to consider for crossjumping. 
The algorithm used by <samp><span class="option">-fcrossjumping</span></samp> is O(N^2) in
the number of edges incoming to each block.  Increasing values mean
more aggressive optimization, making the compile time increase with
probably small improvement in executable size.

          <br><dt><code>min-crossjump-insns</code><dd>The minimum number of instructions which must be matched at the end
of two blocks before crossjumping will be performed on them.  This
value is ignored in the case where all instructions in the block being
crossjumped from are matched.  The default value is 5.

          <br><dt><code>max-grow-copy-bb-insns</code><dd>The maximum code size expansion factor when copying basic blocks
instead of jumping.  The expansion is relative to a jump instruction. 
The default value is 8.

          <br><dt><code>max-goto-duplication-insns</code><dd>The maximum number of instructions to duplicate to a block that jumps
to a computed goto.  To avoid O(N^2) behavior in a number of
passes, GCC factors computed gotos early in the compilation process,
and unfactors them as late as possible.  Only computed jumps at the
end of a basic blocks with no more than max-goto-duplication-insns are
unfactored.  The default value is 8.

          <br><dt><code>max-delay-slot-insn-search</code><dd>The maximum number of instructions to consider when looking for an
instruction to fill a delay slot.  If more than this arbitrary number of
instructions is searched, the time savings from filling the delay slot
will be minimal so stop searching.  Increasing values mean more
aggressive optimization, making the compile time increase with probably
small improvement in executable run time.

          <br><dt><code>max-delay-slot-live-search</code><dd>When trying to fill delay slots, the maximum number of instructions to
consider when searching for a block with valid live register
information.  Increasing this arbitrarily chosen value means more
aggressive optimization, increasing the compile time.  This parameter
should be removed when the delay slot code is rewritten to maintain the
control-flow graph.

          <br><dt><code>max-gcse-memory</code><dd>The approximate maximum amount of memory that will be allocated in
order to perform the global common subexpression elimination
optimization.  If more memory than specified is required, the
optimization will not be done.

          <br><dt><code>max-gcse-passes</code><dd>The maximum number of passes of GCSE to run.  The default is 1.

          <br><dt><code>max-pending-list-length</code><dd>The maximum number of pending dependencies scheduling will allow
before flushing the current state and starting over.  Large functions
with few branches or calls can create excessively large lists which
needlessly consume memory and resources.

          <br><dt><code>max-inline-insns-single</code><dd>Several parameters control the tree inliner used in gcc. 
This number sets the maximum number of instructions (counted in GCC's
internal representation) in a single function that the tree inliner
will consider for inlining.  This only affects functions declared
inline and methods implemented in a class declaration (C++). 
The default value is 450.

          <br><dt><code>max-inline-insns-auto</code><dd>When you use <samp><span class="option">-finline-functions</span></samp> (included in <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>),
a lot of functions that would otherwise not be considered for inlining
by the compiler will be investigated.  To those functions, a different
(more restrictive) limit compared to functions declared inline can
be applied. 
The default value is 90.

          <br><dt><code>large-function-insns</code><dd>The limit specifying really large functions.  For functions larger than this
limit after inlining inlining is constrained by
<samp><span class="option">--param large-function-growth</span></samp>.  This parameter is useful primarily
to avoid extreme compilation time caused by non-linear algorithms used by the
backend. 
This parameter is ignored when <samp><span class="option">-funit-at-a-time</span></samp> is not used. 
The default value is 2700.

          <br><dt><code>large-function-growth</code><dd>Specifies maximal growth of large function caused by inlining in percents. 
This parameter is ignored when <samp><span class="option">-funit-at-a-time</span></samp> is not used. 
The default value is 100 which limits large function growth to 2.0 times
the original size.

          <br><dt><code>large-unit-insns</code><dd>The limit specifying large translation unit.  Growth caused by inlining of
units larger than this limit is limited by <samp><span class="option">--param inline-unit-growth</span></samp>. 
For small units this might be too tight (consider unit consisting of function A
that is inline and B that just calls A three time.  If B is small relative to
A, the growth of unit is 300\% and yet such inlining is very sane.  For very
large units consisting of small inlininable functions however the overall unit
growth limit is needed to avoid exponential explosion of code size.  Thus for
smaller units, the size is increased to <samp><span class="option">--param large-unit-insns</span></samp>
before applying <samp><span class="option">--param inline-unit-growth</span></samp>.  The default is 10000

          <br><dt><code>inline-unit-growth</code><dd>Specifies maximal overall growth of the compilation unit caused by inlining. 
This parameter is ignored when <samp><span class="option">-funit-at-a-time</span></samp> is not used. 
The default value is 50 which limits unit growth to 1.5 times the original
size.

          <br><dt><code>max-inline-insns-recursive</code><dt><code>max-inline-insns-recursive-auto</code><dd>Specifies maximum number of instructions out-of-line copy of self recursive inline
function can grow into by performing recursive inlining.

          <p>For functions declared inline <samp><span class="option">--param max-inline-insns-recursive</span></samp> is
taken into account.  For function not declared inline, recursive inlining
happens only when <samp><span class="option">-finline-functions</span></samp> (included in <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>) is
enabled and <samp><span class="option">--param max-inline-insns-recursive-auto</span></samp> is used.  The
default value is 450.

          <br><dt><code>max-inline-recursive-depth</code><dt><code>max-inline-recursive-depth-auto</code><dd>Specifies maximum recursion depth used by the recursive inlining.

          <p>For functions declared inline <samp><span class="option">--param max-inline-recursive-depth</span></samp> is
taken into account.  For function not declared inline, recursive inlining
happens only when <samp><span class="option">-finline-functions</span></samp> (included in <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>) is
enabled and <samp><span class="option">--param max-inline-recursive-depth-auto</span></samp> is used.  The
default value is 450.

          <br><dt><code>min-inline-recursive-probability</code><dd>Recursive inlining is profitable only for function having deep recursion
in average and can hurt for function having little recursion depth by
increasing the prologue size or complexity of function body to other
optimizers.

          <p>When profile feedback is available (see <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-generate</span></samp>) the actual
recursion depth can be guessed from probability that function will recurse via
given call expression.  This parameter limits inlining only to call expression
whose probability exceeds given threshold (in percents).  The default value is
10.

          <br><dt><code>inline-call-cost</code><dd>Specify cost of call instruction relative to simple arithmetics operations
(having cost of 1).  Increasing this cost disqualifies inlining of non-leaf
functions and at the same time increases size of leaf function that is believed to
reduce function size by being inlined.  In effect it increases amount of
inlining for code having large abstraction penalty (many functions that just
pass the arguments to other functions) and decrease inlining for code with low
abstraction penalty.  The default value is 16.

          <br><dt><code>max-unrolled-insns</code><dd>The maximum number of instructions that a loop should have if that loop
is unrolled, and if the loop is unrolled, it determines how many times
the loop code is unrolled.

          <br><dt><code>max-average-unrolled-insns</code><dd>The maximum number of instructions biased by probabilities of their execution
that a loop should have if that loop is unrolled, and if the loop is unrolled,
it determines how many times the loop code is unrolled.

          <br><dt><code>max-unroll-times</code><dd>The maximum number of unrollings of a single loop.

          <br><dt><code>max-peeled-insns</code><dd>The maximum number of instructions that a loop should have if that loop
is peeled, and if the loop is peeled, it determines how many times
the loop code is peeled.

          <br><dt><code>max-peel-times</code><dd>The maximum number of peelings of a single loop.

          <br><dt><code>max-completely-peeled-insns</code><dd>The maximum number of insns of a completely peeled loop.

          <br><dt><code>max-completely-peel-times</code><dd>The maximum number of iterations of a loop to be suitable for complete peeling.

          <br><dt><code>max-unswitch-insns</code><dd>The maximum number of insns of an unswitched loop.

          <br><dt><code>max-unswitch-level</code><dd>The maximum number of branches unswitched in a single loop.

          <br><dt><code>lim-expensive</code><dd>The minimum cost of an expensive expression in the loop invariant motion.

          <br><dt><code>iv-consider-all-candidates-bound</code><dd>Bound on number of candidates for induction variables below that
all candidates are considered for each use in induction variable
optimizations.  Only the most relevant candidates are considered
if there are more candidates, to avoid quadratic time complexity.

          <br><dt><code>iv-max-considered-uses</code><dd>The induction variable optimizations give up on loops that contain more
induction variable uses.

          <br><dt><code>iv-always-prune-cand-set-bound</code><dd>If number of candidates in the set is smaller than this value,
we always try to remove unnecessary ivs from the set during its
optimization when a new iv is added to the set.

          <br><dt><code>scev-max-expr-size</code><dd>Bound on size of expressions used in the scalar evolutions analyzer. 
Large expressions slow the analyzer.

          <br><dt><code>vect-max-version-checks</code><dd>The maximum number of runtime checks that can be performed when doing
loop versioning in the vectorizer.  See option ftree-vect-loop-version
for more information.

          <br><dt><code>max-iterations-to-track</code><dd>
The maximum number of iterations of a loop the brute force algorithm
for analysis of # of iterations of the loop tries to evaluate.

          <br><dt><code>hot-bb-count-fraction</code><dd>Select fraction of the maximal count of repetitions of basic block in program
given basic block needs to have to be considered hot.

          <br><dt><code>hot-bb-frequency-fraction</code><dd>Select fraction of the maximal frequency of executions of basic block in
function given basic block needs to have to be considered hot

          <br><dt><code>max-predicted-iterations</code><dd>The maximum number of loop iterations we predict statically.  This is useful
in cases where function contain single loop with known bound and other loop
with unknown.  We predict the known number of iterations correctly, while
the unknown number of iterations average to roughly 10.  This means that the
loop without bounds would appear artificially cold relative to the other one.

          <br><dt><code>tracer-dynamic-coverage</code><dt><code>tracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback</code><dd>
This value is used to limit superblock formation once the given percentage of
executed instructions is covered.  This limits unnecessary code size
expansion.

          <p>The <samp><span class="option">tracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback</span></samp> is used only when profile
feedback is available.  The real profiles (as opposed to statically estimated
ones) are much less balanced allowing the threshold to be larger value.

          <br><dt><code>tracer-max-code-growth</code><dd>Stop tail duplication once code growth has reached given percentage.  This is
rather hokey argument, as most of the duplicates will be eliminated later in
cross jumping, so it may be set to much higher values than is the desired code
growth.

          <br><dt><code>tracer-min-branch-ratio</code><dd>
Stop reverse growth when the reverse probability of best edge is less than this
threshold (in percent).

          <br><dt><code>tracer-min-branch-ratio</code><dt><code>tracer-min-branch-ratio-feedback</code><dd>
Stop forward growth if the best edge do have probability lower than this
threshold.

          <p>Similarly to <samp><span class="option">tracer-dynamic-coverage</span></samp> two values are present, one for
compilation for profile feedback and one for compilation without.  The value
for compilation with profile feedback needs to be more conservative (higher) in
order to make tracer effective.

          <br><dt><code>max-cse-path-length</code><dd>
Maximum number of basic blocks on path that cse considers.  The default is 10.

          <br><dt><code>max-cse-insns</code><dd>The maximum instructions CSE process before flushing. The default is 1000.

          <br><dt><code>global-var-threshold</code><dd>
Counts the number of function calls (<var>n</var>) and the number of
call-clobbered variables (<var>v</var>).  If <var>n</var>x<var>v</var> is larger than this limit, a
single artificial variable will be created to represent all the
call-clobbered variables at function call sites.  This artificial
variable will then be made to alias every call-clobbered variable. 
(done as <code>int * size_t</code> on the host machine; beware overflow).

          <br><dt><code>max-aliased-vops</code><dd>
Maximum number of virtual operands allowed to represent aliases
before triggering the alias grouping heuristic.  Alias grouping
reduces compile times and memory consumption needed for aliasing at
the expense of precision loss in alias information.

          <br><dt><code>ggc-min-expand</code><dd>
GCC uses a garbage collector to manage its own memory allocation.  This
parameter specifies the minimum percentage by which the garbage
collector's heap should be allowed to expand between collections. 
Tuning this may improve compilation speed; it has no effect on code
generation.

          <p>The default is 30% + 70% * (RAM/1GB) with an upper bound of 100% when
RAM &gt;= 1GB.  If <code>getrlimit</code> is available, the notion of "RAM" is
the smallest of actual RAM and <code>RLIMIT_DATA</code> or <code>RLIMIT_AS</code>.  If
GCC is not able to calculate RAM on a particular platform, the lower
bound of 30% is used.  Setting this parameter and
<samp><span class="option">ggc-min-heapsize</span></samp> to zero causes a full collection to occur at
every opportunity.  This is extremely slow, but can be useful for
debugging.

          <br><dt><code>ggc-min-heapsize</code><dd>
Minimum size of the garbage collector's heap before it begins bothering
to collect garbage.  The first collection occurs after the heap expands
by <samp><span class="option">ggc-min-expand</span></samp>% beyond <samp><span class="option">ggc-min-heapsize</span></samp>.  Again,
tuning this may improve compilation speed, and has no effect on code
generation.

          <p>The default is the smaller of RAM/8, RLIMIT_RSS, or a limit which
tries to ensure that RLIMIT_DATA or RLIMIT_AS are not exceeded, but
with a lower bound of 4096 (four megabytes) and an upper bound of
131072 (128 megabytes).  If GCC is not able to calculate RAM on a
particular platform, the lower bound is used.  Setting this parameter
very large effectively disables garbage collection.  Setting this
parameter and <samp><span class="option">ggc-min-expand</span></samp> to zero causes a full collection
to occur at every opportunity.

          <br><dt><code>max-reload-search-insns</code><dd>The maximum number of instruction reload should look backward for equivalent
register.  Increasing values mean more aggressive optimization, making the
compile time increase with probably slightly better performance.  The default
value is 100.

          <br><dt><code>max-cselib-memory-locations</code><dd>The maximum number of memory locations cselib should take into account. 
Increasing values mean more aggressive optimization, making the compile time
increase with probably slightly better performance.  The default value is 500.

          <br><dt><code>max-flow-memory-locations</code><dd>Similar as <samp><span class="option">max-cselib-memory-locations</span></samp> but for dataflow liveness. 
The default value is 100.

          <br><dt><code>reorder-blocks-duplicate</code><dt><code>reorder-blocks-duplicate-feedback</code><dd>
Used by basic block reordering pass to decide whether to use unconditional
branch or duplicate the code on its destination.  Code is duplicated when its
estimated size is smaller than this value multiplied by the estimated size of
unconditional jump in the hot spots of the program.

          <p>The <samp><span class="option">reorder-block-duplicate-feedback</span></samp> is used only when profile
feedback is available and may be set to higher values than
<samp><span class="option">reorder-block-duplicate</span></samp> since information about the hot spots is more
accurate.

          <br><dt><code>max-sched-ready-insns</code><dd>The maximum number of instructions ready to be issued the scheduler should
consider at any given time during the first scheduling pass.  Increasing
values mean more thorough searches, making the compilation time increase
with probably little benefit.  The default value is 100.

          <br><dt><code>max-sched-region-blocks</code><dd>The maximum number of blocks in a region to be considered for
interblock scheduling.  The default value is 10.

          <br><dt><code>max-sched-region-insns</code><dd>The maximum number of insns in a region to be considered for
interblock scheduling.  The default value is 100.

          <br><dt><code>min-spec-prob</code><dd>The minimum probability (in percents) of reaching a source block
for interblock speculative scheduling.  The default value is 40.

          <br><dt><code>max-sched-extend-regions-iters</code><dd>The maximum number of iterations through CFG to extend regions. 
0 - disable region extension,
N - do at most N iterations. 
The default value is 0.

          <br><dt><code>max-sched-insn-conflict-delay</code><dd>The maximum conflict delay for an insn to be considered for speculative motion. 
The default value is 3.

          <br><dt><code>sched-spec-prob-cutoff</code><dd>The minimal probability of speculation success (in percents), so that
speculative insn will be scheduled. 
The default value is 40.

          <br><dt><code>max-last-value-rtl</code><dd>
The maximum size measured as number of RTLs that can be recorded in an expression
in combiner for a pseudo register as last known value of that register.  The default
is 10000.

          <br><dt><code>integer-share-limit</code><dd>Small integer constants can use a shared data structure, reducing the
compiler's memory usage and increasing its speed.  This sets the maximum
value of a shared integer constant's.  The default value is 256.

          <br><dt><code>min-virtual-mappings</code><dd>Specifies the minimum number of virtual mappings in the incremental
SSA updater that should be registered to trigger the virtual mappings
heuristic defined by virtual-mappings-ratio.  The default value is
100.

          <br><dt><code>virtual-mappings-ratio</code><dd>If the number of virtual mappings is virtual-mappings-ratio bigger
than the number of virtual symbols to be updated, then the incremental
SSA updater switches to a full update for those symbols.  The default
ratio is 3.

          <br><dt><code>ssp-buffer-size</code><dd>The minimum size of buffers (i.e. arrays) that will receive stack smashing
protection when <samp><span class="option">-fstack-protection</span></samp> is used.

          <br><dt><code>max-jump-thread-duplication-stmts</code><dd>Maximum number of statements allowed in a block that needs to be
duplicated when threading jumps.

          <br><dt><code>max-fields-for-field-sensitive</code><dd>Maximum number of fields in a structure we will treat in
a field sensitive manner during pointer analysis.
