<h3 class="section">3.6 Options Controlling Objective-C Dialect</h3>

<p><a name="index-compiler-options_002c-Objective_002dC-174"></a><a name="index-Objective_002dC-options_002c-command-line-175"></a><a name="index-options_002c-Objective_002dC-176"></a>This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for Objective-C programs; but you can also use most of the GNU compiler
options regardless of what language your program is in.  For example,
you might compile a file <code>some_class.m</code> like this:

<pre class="example">     gcc -g -fgnu-runtime -O -c some_class.m
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In this example, only <span class="option">-fgnu-runtime</span> is an option meant only for
Objective-C programs; you can use the other options with any language
supported by GCC.

   <p>Here is a list of options that are <em>only</em> for compiling Objective-C
programs:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-fconstant-string-class=</code><var>class-name</var><dd><a name="index-fconstant_002dstring_002dclass-177"></a>Use <var>class-name</var> as the name of the class to instantiate for each
literal string specified with the syntax <code>@"..."</code>.  The default
<!-- APPLE LOCAL begin constant strings -->
class name is <code>NXConstantString</code> if the GNU runtime is being used, and
<code>NSConstantString</code> if the NeXT runtime is being used (see below).  The
<span class="option">-fconstant-cfstrings</span> option, if also present, will override the
<span class="option">-fconstant-string-class</span> setting and cause <code>@"..."</code> literals
to be laid out as constant CoreFoundation strings. 
<!-- APPLE LOCAL end constant strings -->

     <br><dt><code>-fgnu-runtime</code><dd><a name="index-fgnu_002druntime-178"></a>Generate object code compatible with the standard GNU Objective-C
runtime.  This is the default for most types of systems.

     <br><dt><code>-fnext-runtime</code><dd><a name="index-fnext_002druntime-179"></a>Generate output compatible with the NeXT runtime.  This is the default
for NeXT-based systems, including Darwin and Mac OS X.  The macro
<code>__NEXT_RUNTIME__</code> is predefined if (and only if) this option is
used.

     <!-- APPLE LOCAL begin ObjC options -->
<br><dt><code>-fno-nil-receivers </code><span class="roman">(APPLE ONLY)</span><dd><a name="index-_002dfno_002dnil_002dreceivers-180"></a>Assume that all Objective-C message dispatches (e.g.,
<code>[receiver message:arg]</code>) in this translation unit ensure that the receiver
is not <code>nil</code>.  This allows for more efficient entry points in the runtime to be
used.  Currently, this option is only available in conjunction with
the NeXT runtime.

     <br><dt><code>-fobjc-direct-dispatch </code><span class="roman">(APPLE ONLY)</span><dd><a name="index-_002dfobjc_002ddirect_002ddispatch-181"></a>For some functions (such as <code>objc_msgSend</code>) called very frequently by
Objective-C programs, special entry points exist in high memory that may be jumped
to directly (e.g., via the <code>"bla"</code> instruction on the PowerPC) for improved
performance.  The <span class="option">-fobjc-direct-dispatch</span> option will cause such jumps
to be generated.  This option is only available in conjunction with the NeXT
runtime; furthermore, programs built with the <span class="option">-fobjc-direct-dispatch</span>
option will only run on Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) or later systems.

     <br><dt><code>-fobjc-exceptions </code><span class="roman">(APPLE ONLY)</span><dd><a name="index-_002dfobjc_002dexceptions-182"></a>Enable syntactic support for structured exception handling in Objective-C,
similar to what is offered by C++ and Java.  This option will also be enabled
if the environment variable <code>MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET</code> exists and is set
to <code>"10.3"</code> or greater.

     <pre class="smallexample">            @try {
              ...
                 @throw expr;
              ...
            }
            @catch (AnObjCClass *exc) {
              ...
                @throw expr;
              ...
                @throw;
              ...
            }
            @catch (AnotherClass *exc) {
              ...
            }
            @catch (id allOthers) {
              ...
            }
            @finally {
              ...
                @throw expr;
              ...
            }
     </pre>
     <p>The <code>@throw</code> statement may appear anywhere in an Objective-C or
Objective-C++ program; when used inside of a <code>@catch</code> block, the
<code>@throw</code> may appear without an argument (as shown above), in which case
the object caught by the <code>@catch</code> will be rethrown.

     <p>Note that only (pointers to) Objective-C objects may be thrown and
caught using this scheme.  When an object is thrown, it will be caught
by the nearest <code>@catch</code> clause capable of handling objects of that type,
analogously to how <code>catch</code> blocks work in C++ and Java.  A
<code>@catch(id ...)</code> clause (as shown above) may also be provided to catch
any and all Objective-C exceptions not caught by previous <code>@catch</code>
clauses (if any).

     <p>The <code>@finally</code> clause, if present, will be executed upon exit from the
immediately preceding <code>@try ... @catch</code> section.  This will happen
regardless of whether any exceptions are thrown, caught or rethrown
inside the <code>@try ... @catch</code> section, analogously to the behavior
of the <code>finally</code> clause in Java.

     <p>There are several caveats to using the new exception mechanism:

          <ul>
<li>Although currently designed to be binary compatible with <code>NS_HANDLER</code>-style
idioms provided by the <code>NSException</code> class, the new
exceptions can only be used on Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther) and later
systems, due to additional functionality needed in the (NeXT) Objective-C
runtime.

          <li>As mentioned above, the new exceptions do not support handling
types other than Objective-C objects.   Furthermore, when used from
Objective-C++, the Objective-C exception model does not interoperate with C++
exceptions at this time.  This means you cannot <code>@throw</code> an exception
from Objective-C and <code>catch</code> it in C++, or vice versa
(i.e., <code>throw ... @catch</code>). 
</ul>

     <p>The <span class="option">-fobjc-exceptions</span> switch also enables the use of synchronization
blocks for thread-safe execution:

     <pre class="smallexample">            ObjCClass *lockObject = ...;
            ...
            @synchronized (lockObject) {
              ...
                @throw expr;
              ...
            }
     </pre>
     <p>Unlike Java, Objective-C does not allow for entire methods to be marked
<code>@synchronized</code>.  Note that throwing exceptions out of
<code>@synchronized</code> blocks is allowed, and will cause the guarding object
to be unlocked properly.

     <br><dt><code>-freplace-objc-classes </code><span class="roman">(APPLE ONLY)</span><dd><a name="index-_002dfreplace_002dobjc_002dclasses-183"></a>When compiling for the NeXT runtime, the compiler ordinarily replaces calls
to <code>objc_getClass("...")</code> (when the name of the class is known at
compile time) with static class references that get initialized at load time,
which improves run-time performance.  Specifying the
<span class="option">-freplace-objc-classes</span> flag suppresses this behavior and causes calls
to <code>objc_getClass("...")</code> to be retained.  This is useful in
Fix-and-Continue debugging mode, since it allows for individual class
implementations to be modified during program execution.

     <br><dt><code>-fzero-link </code><span class="roman">(APPLE ONLY)</span><dd><a name="index-_002dfzero_002dlink-184"></a>Emit a special marker instructing <span class="command">ld(1)</span> not to statically link in
the resulting object file, and allow <span class="command">dyld(1)</span> to load it in at
run time instead.  This is used in conjunction with the Zero Link debugging
mode. 
<!-- APPLE LOCAL end ObjC options -->

     <br><dt><code>-gen-decls</code><dd><a name="index-gen_002ddecls-185"></a>Dump interface declarations for all classes seen in the source file to a
file named <var>sourcename</var><span class="file">.decl</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-Wno-protocol</code><dd><a name="index-Wno_002dprotocol-186"></a>If a class is declared to implement a protocol, a warning is issued for
every method in the protocol that is not implemented by the class.  The
default behavior is to issue a warning for every method not explicitly
implemented in the class, even if a method implementation is inherited
from the superclass.  If you use the <code>-Wno-protocol</code> option, then
methods inherited from the superclass are considered to be implemented,
and no warning is issued for them.

     <br><dt><code>-Wselector</code><dd><a name="index-Wselector-187"></a>Warn if multiple methods of different types for the same selector are
found during compilation.  The check is performed on the list of methods
in the final stage of compilation.  Additionally, a check is performed
that for each selector appearing in a <code>@selector(...)</code>
expression, a corresponding method with that selector has been found
during compilation.  Because these checks scan the method table only at
the end of compilation, these warnings are not produced if the final
stage of compilation is not reached, for example because an error is
found during compilation, or because the <code>-fsyntax-only</code> option is
being used.

     <br><dt><code>-Wundeclared-selector</code><dd><a name="index-Wundeclared_002dselector-188"></a>Warn if a <code>@selector(...)</code> expression referring to an
undeclared selector is found.  A selector is considered undeclared if no
method with that name has been declared (explicitly, in an
<code>@interface</code> or <code>@protocol</code> declaration, or implicitly, in
an <code>@implementation</code> section) before the
<code>@selector(...)</code> expression.  This option always performs its
checks as soon as a <code>@selector(...)</code> expression is found
(while <code>-Wselector</code> only performs its checks in the final stage of
compilation), and so additionally enforces the coding style convention
that methods and selectors must be declared before being used.
