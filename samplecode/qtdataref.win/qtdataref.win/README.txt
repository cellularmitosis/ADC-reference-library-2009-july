QTDataRefQTDataRef is a sample application that shows how to work with data referencesand data handlers. It shows how to create data references and open moviesspecified by those data references. It also shows how to work directly withdata handlers; for this, it replicates some of the code in the QTFileTransfersnippet to show how to use the URL and file data handlers to transfer a filefrom a remote machine to the local machine. Finally, QTDataRef shows how tocreate data reference extensions.Enjoy, QuickTime Team
