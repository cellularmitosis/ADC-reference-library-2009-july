Module 8- Using QuickTime Transitions and EffectsAbout this Code Sample----------------------This sample code accompanies the Intro to QuickTime for Java Tutorial located on the Apple Develeloper Connection pages at:http://developer.apple.com/java/qtjtutorial/index.htmlIn this module, we will learn how to use QuickTime's built-in effects engine to generate a transition between two compositors. This adds visual appeal to the application and is very easy to do.What's Included---------------This package includes all media files required for completing this tutorial section. There is a pre-built application that you can run to see what the completed module will look like, and a data folder that contains media used by the project. Additionally, there is a completed source folder that you can use to compare your java files to in case you run into a compilation error. Finally, there are two directories, a source directory where you should save all of your source files and an output directory where you should put your built class files. For convenience, we have provided a properties file you can use with the MRJ App Builder.Requirements------------To build this sample, you will need Sun's JDK tools (Part of the MRJ SDK on the Macintosh), QuickTime 4.0 or later (4.1 highly recommended), and a Java VM installed.
