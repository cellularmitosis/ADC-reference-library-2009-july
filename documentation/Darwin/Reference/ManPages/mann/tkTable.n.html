       <b>-relief</b>         <b>-takefocus</b>     <b>-xscrollcommand</b>
       <b>-yscrollcommand</b>

       See the <b>options</b> manual entry for details on the standard options.


<b>WIDGET-SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       Command-Line Name:<b>-autoclear</b>
       Database Name:  <b>autoClear</b>
       Database Class: <b>AutoClear</b>

              A boolean value which specifies whether the first keypress in a cell will delete whatever text
              was previously there.  Defaults to 0.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-bordercursor</b>
       Database Name:  <b>borderCursor</b>
       Database Class: <b>Cursor</b>

              Specifies the name of the cursor to show when over borders, a visual indication that  interac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tive&nbsp;interactive</font>
              tive  resizing  is  allowed  (it  is thus affect by the value of -resizeborders).  Defaults to
              <u>crosshair</u>.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-borderwidth</b> <b>or</b> <b>-bd</b>
       Database Name:  <b>borderWidth</b>
       Database Class: <b>BorderWidth</b>

              Specifies a non-negative pixel value or list of values indicating the width of the 3-D  border
              to  draw on interior table cells (if such a border is being drawn; the <b>relief</b> option typically
              determines this).  If one value is specified, a rectangle of this width will be drawn.  If two
              values  are  specified,  then only the left and right edges of the cell will have borders.  If
              four values are specified, then the values correspond to the {left right  top  bottom}  edges.
              This  can  be  overridden  by  the a tag's borderwidth option.  It can also be affected by the
              defined <b>-drawmode</b> for the table.  Each value in the list must have one of the forms acceptable
              to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-browsecommand</b> <b>or</b> <b>-browsecmd</b>
       Database Name:  <b>browseCommand</b>
       Database Class: <b>BrowseCommand</b>

              Specifies  a  command  which  will  be evaluated anytime the active cell changes.  It uses the
              %-substition model described in COMMAND SUBSTITUTION below.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-cache</b>
       Database Name:  <b>cache</b>
       Database Class: <b>Cache</b>

              A boolean value that specifies whether an internal cache of the table contents should be kept.
              This  greatly  enhances  speed performance when used with <b>-command</b> but uses extra memory.  Can
              maintain state when both <b>-command</b> and <b>-variable</b> are empty.  The cache is automatically flushed
              whenever the value of <b>-cache</b> or <b>-variable</b> changes, otherwise you have to explicitly call <b>clear</b>
              on it.  Defaults to off.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-colorigin</b>
       Database Name:  <b>colOrigin</b>
       Database Class: <b>Origin</b>

              Specifies what column index to interpret as the leftmost column in the table.  This  value  is
              used for user indices in the table.  Defaults to 0.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-cols</b>
       Database Name:  <b>cols</b>
       Database Class: <b>Cols</b>

              Number of cols in the table.  Defaults to 10.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-colseparator</b>
       Database Name:  <b>colSeparator</b>
       Database Class: <b>Separator</b>

              Specifies  a separator character that will be interpreted as the column separator when cutting
              or pasting data in a table.  By default, columns are separated as elements of a tcl list.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-colstretchmode</b>
       Database Name:  <b>colStretchMode</b>
       Database Class: <b>StretchMode</b>

              Specifies one of the following stretch modes for columns to fill extra allocated window space:

              <b>none</b>   Columns  will  not  stretch  to fill the assigned window space.  If the columns are too
                     narrow, there will be a blank space at the right of the table.  This is the default.

              <b>unset</b>  Only columns that do not have a specific width set will be stretched.

              <b>all</b>    All columns will be stretched by the same number of pixels to  fill  the  window  space
                     allocated to the table.  This mode can interfere with interactive border resizing which
                     tries to force column width.

              <b>last</b>   The last column will be stretched to fill the window space allocated to the table.

              <b>fill</b> (only valid for <b>-rowstretch</b> currently)
                     The table will get more or less columns according to the window space allocated to  the
                     table.  This mode has numerous quirks and may disappear in the future.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-coltagcommand</b>
       Database Name:  <b>colTagCommand</b>
       Database Class: <b>TagCommand</b>

              Provides  the name of a procedure that will be evaluated by the widget to determine the tag to
              be used for a given column.  When displaying a cell, the table widget will first check to  see
              if a tag has been defined using the <b>tag</b> <b>col</b> widget method.  If no tag is found, it will evalu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ate&nbsp;evaluate</font>
              ate the named procedure passing the column number in question as the sole argument.  The  pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cedure&nbsp;procedure</font>
              cedure is expected to return the name of a tag to use, or a null string.  Errors occuring dur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;during</font>
              ing the evaluation of the procedure, or the  return  of  an  invalid  tag  name  are  silently
              ignored.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-colwidth</b>
       Database Name:  <b>colWidth</b>
       Database Class: <b>ColWidth</b>

              Default  column  width, interpreted as characters in the default font when the number is posi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tive,&nbsp;positive,</font>
              tive, or pixels if it is negative.  Defaults to 10.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-command</b>
       Database Name:  <b>command</b>
       Database Class: <b>Command</b>

              Specified a command to use as a procedural interface to cell values.  If <b>-usecommand</b> is  true,
              this  command  will  be used instead of any reference to the <b>-variable</b> array.  When retrieving
              cell values, the return value of the command is used as the value for the cell.  It  uses  the
              %-substition model described in COMMAND SUBSTITUTION below.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-drawmode</b>
       Database Name:  <b>drawMode</b>
       Database Class: <b>DrawMode</b>

              Sets the table drawing mode to one of the following options:

              <b>slow</b>   The  table  is  drawn  to an offscreen pixmap using the Tk bordering functions (double-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">buffering).&nbsp;(doublebuffering).</font>
                     buffering).  This means there will be no flashing, but this mode  is  slow  for  larger
                     tables.

              <b>compatible</b>
                     The table is drawn directly to the screen using the Tk border functions.  It is faster,
                     but the screen may flash on update.  This is the default.

              <b>fast</b>   The table is drawn directly to the screen and the borders are done with fast  X  calls,
                     so they are always one pixel wide only.  As a side effect, it restricts <b>-borderwidth</b> to
                     a range of 0 or 1.  This mode provides best performance for large tables, but can flash
                     on redraw and is not 100% Tk compatible on the border mode.

              <b>single</b> The table is drawn to the screen as in fast mode, but only single pixel lines are drawn
                     (not square borders).

       Command-Line Name:<b>-ellipsis</b>
       Database Name:  <b>ellipsis</b>
       Database Class: <b>Ellipsis</b>

              This specifies a string to display at the end of a line that would be  clipped  by  its  cell,
              like  ``...''.   An  ellipsis will be displayed only on non-wrapping, non-multiline cells that
              would be clipped.  The ellipsis will display on the left for east anchored cells, otherwise it
              displays on the right.  Defaults to "" (no ellipsis).

       Command-Line Name:<b>-flashmode</b>
       Database Name:  <b>flashMode</b>
       Database Class: <b>FlashMode</b>

              A  boolean value which specifies whether cells should flash when their value changes.  The ta-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ble&nbsp;table</font>
              ble tag <b>flash</b> will be applied to  these  cells  for  the  duration  specified  by  <b>-flashtime</b>.
              Defaults to 0.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-flashtime</b>
       Database Name:  <b>flashTime</b>
       Database Class: <b>FlashTime</b>

              The amount of time, in 1/4 second increments, for which a cell should flash when its value has
              changed.  <b>-flashmode</b> must be on.  Defaults to 2.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-height</b>
       Database Name:  <b>height</b>
       Database Class: <b>Height</b>

              Specifies the desired height for the window, in rows.  If  zero  or  less,  then  the  desired
              height for the window is made just large enough to hold all the rows in the table.  The height
              can be further limited by <b>-maxheight</b>.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-invertselected</b>
       Database Name:  <b>invertSelected</b>
       Database Class: <b>InvertSelected</b>

              Specifies whether the foreground and background of an item should  simply  have  their  values
              swapped  instead  of  merging  the  <u>sel</u>  tag options when the cell is selected.  Defaults to 0
              (merge <u>sel</u> tag).

       Command-Line Name:<b>-ipadx</b>
       Database Name:  <b>ipadX</b>
       Database Class: <b>Pad</b>

              A pixel value specifying the internal offset X padding for text in a cell.   This  value  does
              not  grow the size of the cell, it just causes the text to be drawn further from the cell bor-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">der.&nbsp;border.</font>
              der.  It only affects one side (depending on anchor).  Defaults to 0.  See <b>-padx</b> for an alter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nate&nbsp;alternate</font>
              nate padding style.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-ipady</b>
       Database Name:  <b>ipadY</b>
       Database Class: <b>Pad</b>

              A  pixel  value  specifying the internal offset Y padding for text in a cell.  This value does
              not grow the size of the cell, it just causes the text to be drawn further from the cell  bor-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">der.&nbsp;border.</font>
              der.  It only affects one side (depending on anchor).  Defaults to 0.  See <b>-pady</b> for an alter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nate&nbsp;alternate</font>
              nate padding style.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-justify</b>
       Database Name:  <b>justify</b>
       Database Class: <b>Justify</b>

              How to justify multi-line text in a cell.  It must be one of <b>left</b>, <b>right</b>, or <b>center</b>.  Defaults
              to left.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-maxheight</b>
       Database Name:  <b>maxHeight</b>
       Database Class: <b>MaxHeight</b>

              The max height in pixels that the window will request.  Defaults to 600.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-maxwidth</b>
       Database Name:  <b>maxWidth</b>
       Database Class: <b>MaxWidth</b>

              The max width in pixels that the window will request.  Defaults to 800.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-multiline</b>
       Database Name:  <b>multiline</b>
       Database Class: <b>Multiline</b>

              Specifies the default setting for the multiline tag option.  Defaults to 1.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-padx</b>
       Database Name:  <b>padX</b>
       Database Class: <b>Pad</b>

              A  pixel value specifying the offset X padding for a cell.  This value causes the default size
              of the cell to increase by two times the value (one for each side), unless  a  specific  pixel
              size is chosen for the cell with the <b>width</b> command.  This will force an empty area on the left
              and right of each cell edge.  This padding affects all types of data in the cell.  Defaults to
              0.  See <b>-ipadx</b> for an alternate padding style.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-pady</b>
       Database Name:  <b>padY</b>
       Database Class: <b>Pad</b>

              A  pixel value specifying the offset Y padding for a cell.  This value causes the default size
              of the cell to increase by two times the value (one for each side), unless  a  specific  pixel
              size is chosen for the cell with the <b>height</b> command.  This will force an empty area on the top
              and bottom of each cell edge.  This padding affects all types of data in the  cell.   Defaults
              to 0.  See <b>-ipadx</b> for an alternate padding style.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-resizeborders</b>
       Database Name:  <b>resizeBorders</b>
       Database Class: <b>ResizeBorders</b>

              Specifies  what  kind  of  interactive border resizing to allow, must be one of row, col, both
              (default) or none.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-rowheight</b>
       Database Name:  <b>rowHeight</b>
       Database Class: <b>RowHeight</b>

              Default row height, interpreted as lines in the default font when the number is  positive,  or
              pixels if it is negative.  Defaults to 1.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-roworigin</b>
       Database Name:  <b>rowOrigin</b>
       Database Class: <b>Origin</b>

              Specifies what row index to interpret as the topmost row in the table.  This value is used for
              user indices in the table.  Defaults to 0.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-rows</b>
       Database Name:  <b>rows</b>
       Database Class: <b>Rows</b>

              Number of rows in the table.  Defaults to 10.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-rowseparator</b>
       Database Name:  <b>rowSeparator</b>
       Database Class: <b>Separator</b>

              Specifies a separator character that will be interpreted as the row separator when cutting  or
              pasting data in a table.  By default, rows are separated as tcl lists.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-rowstretchmode</b>
       Database Name:  <b>rowStretchMode</b>
       Database Class: <b>StretchMode</b>

              Specifies  the  stretch modes for rows to fill extra allocated window space.  See <b>-colstretch</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mode&nbsp;-colstretchmode</font>
              <b>mode</b> for valid options.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-rowtagcommand</b>
       Database Name:  <b>rowTagCommand</b>
       Database Class: <b>TagCommand</b>

              Provides the name of a procedure that can evaluated by the widget to determine the tag  to  be
              used  for  a given row.  The procedure must be defined by the user to accept a single argument
              (the row number), and return a tag name or null string.  This operates in a similar manner  as
              <b>-coltagcommand</b>, except that it applies to row tags.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-selectioncommand</b> <b>or</b> <b>-selcmd</b>
       Database Name:  <b>selectionCommand</b>
       Database Class: <b>SelectionCommand</b>

              Specifies a command to evaluate when the selection is retrieved from a table via the selection
              mechanism (ie: evaluating "<b>selection</b> <b>get</b>").  The return value from this  command  will  become
              the  string passed on by the selection mechanism.  It uses the %-substition model described in
              COMMAND SUBSTITUTION below.  If an error occurs, a Tcl background error is generated and noth-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;nothing</font>
              ing is returned.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-selectmode</b>
       Database Name:  <b>selectMode</b>
       Database Class: <b>SelectMode</b>

              Specifies  one  of several styles for manipulating the selection.  The value of the option may
              be arbitrary, but the default bindings expect it to be either  <b>single</b>,  <b>browse</b>,  <b>multiple</b>,  or
              <b>extended</b>; the default value is <b>browse</b>.  These styles are like those for the Tk listbox, except
              expanded for 2 dimensions.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-selecttitle</b>
       Database Name:  <b>selectTitles</b>
       Database Class: <b>SelectTitles</b>

              Specifies whether title cells should be allowed in the selection.  Defaults to 0 (disallowed).

       Command-Line Name:<b>-selecttype</b>
       Database Name:  <b>selectType</b>
       Database Class: <b>SelectType</b>

              Specifies one of several types of selection for the table.  The value of the option may be one
              of <b>row</b>, <b>col</b>, <b>cell</b>, or <b>both</b> (meaning <b>row</b> <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <b>col</b>); the  default  value  is  <b>cell</b>.   These  types
              define  whether  an  entire  row/col  is  affected  when a cell's selection is changed (set or
              clear).

       Command-Line Name:<b>-sparsearray</b>
       Database Name:  <b>sparseArray</b>
       Database Class: <b>SparseArray</b>

              A boolean value that specifies whether an associated Tcl array should  be  kept  as  a  sparse
              array  (1, the default) or as a full array (0).  If true, then cell values that are empty will
              be deleted from the array (taking less memory).  If false, then all values in the  array  will
              be maintained.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-state</b>
       Database Name:  <b>state</b>
       Database Class: <b>State</b>

              Specifies one of two states for the entry:  <b>normal</b> or <b>disabled</b>.  If the table is disabled then
              the value may not be changed using widget commands and no insertion cursor will be  displayed,
              even if the input focus is in the widget.  Also, all insert or delete methods will be ignored.
              Defaults to <b>normal</b>.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-titlecols</b>
       Database Name:  <b>titleCols</b>
       Database Class: <b>TitleCols</b>

              Number of columns to use as a title area.  Defaults to 0.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-titlerows</b>
       Database Name:  <b>titleRows</b>
       Database Class: <b>TitleRows</b>

              Number of rows to use as a title area.  Defaults to 0.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-usecommand</b>
       Database Name:  <b>useCommand</b>
       Database Class: <b>UseCommand</b>

              A boolean value which specifies whether to use the <b>command</b> option.  This value sets itself  to
              zero  if <b>command</b> is used and returns an error.  Defaults to 1 (will use <b>command</b> if specified).

       Command-Line Name:<b>-validate</b>
       Database Name:  <b>validate</b>
       Database Class: <b>Validate</b>

              A boolean specifying whether validation should occur for the active buffer.  Defaults to 0.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-validatecommand</b> <b>or</b> <b>-vcmd</b>
       Database Name:  <b>validateCommand</b>
       Database Class: <b>ValidateCommand</b>

              Specifies a command to execute when the active cell is edited.  This command  is  expected  to
              return  a  Tcl boolean.  If it returns true, then it is assumed the new value is OK, otherwise
              the new value is rejected (the edition will not take place).  Errors in this command are  han-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dled&nbsp;handled</font>
              dled  in  the  background.   It  uses the %-substition model described in COMMAND SUBSTITUTION
              below.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-variable</b>
       Database Name:  <b>variable</b>
       Database Class: <b>Variable</b>

              Global Tcl array variable to attach to the table's C array.  It will be created if it  doesn't
              already  exist  or  is a simple variable.  Keys used by the table in the array are of the form
              <u>row</u>,<u>col</u> for cells and the special key <u>active</u> which contains  the  value  of  the  active  cell
              buffer.   The  Tcl  array  is  managed  as a sparse array (the table doesn't require all valid
              indices have values).  No stored value for an index is equivalent to  the  empty  string,  and
              clearing  a cell will remove that index from the Tcl array, unless the <b>-sparsearray</b> options is
              set to 0.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-width</b>
       Database Name:  <b>width</b>
       Database Class: <b>Width</b>

              Specifies the desired width for the window, in columns.  If zero or  less,  then  the  desired
              width  for  the  window  is  made just large enough to hold all the columns in the table.  The
              width can be further limited by <b>-maxwidth</b>.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-wrap</b>
       Database Name:  <b>wrap</b>
       Database Class: <b>Wrap</b>

              Specifies the default wrap value for tags.  Defaults to 0.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The <b>table</b> command creates a 2-dimensional grid of cells.  The table can use a Tcl array  variable  or
       Tcl  command  for  data  storage and retrieval, as well as optionally cache data in memory for speed.
       One of these data sources <u>must</u> be configured before any data is retained by the  table.   The  widget
       has  an active cell, the contents of which can be edited (when the state is normal).  The widget sup-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ports&nbsp;supports</font>
       ports a default style for the cells and also multiple <u>tags</u>, which can be used to change the style  of
       a  row, column or cell (see TAGS for details).  A cell <u>flash</u> can be set up so that changed cells will
       change color for a specified amount of time ("blink").  Cells can have embedded images or windows, as
       described in TAGS and "EMBEDDED WINDOWS" respectively.

       One  or  more  cells  may be selected as described below.  If a table is exporting its selection (see
       <b>-exportselection</b> option), then it will observe the standard X11 protocols for handling the selection.
       See THE SELECTION for details.

       It is not necessary for all the cells to be displayed in the table window at once; commands described
       below may be used to change the view in the window.  Tables allow scrolling in both directions  using
       the  standard  <b>-xscrollcommand</b> and <b>-yscrollcommand</b> options.  They also support scanning, as described
       below.

       In order to obtain good performance, the table widget supports multiple drawing modes, two  of  which
       are fully Tk compatible.


<b>INITIALIZATION</b>
       When  the <b>table</b> command is loaded into an interpreter, a built-in Tcl command, <b>tkTableInit</b>, is evalu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ated.&nbsp;evaluated.</font>
       ated.  This will search for the appropriate  table  binding  init  file  to  load.   The  directories
       searched  are those in <u>$tcl</u><b>_</b><u>pkgPath</u>, both with Tktable(version) appended and without, <u>$tk</u><b>_</b><u>library</u> and
       <u>[pwd]</u> (the current directory).  You can also define an <u>$env(TK</u><b>_</b><u>TABLE</u><b>_</b><u>LIBRARY)</u>  to  head  this  search
       list.  By default, the file searched for is called <b>tkTable.tcl</b>, but this can be overridden by setting
       <u>$env(TK</u><b>_</b><u>TABLE</u><b>_</b><u>LIBRARY</u><b>_</b><u>FILE)</u>.

       This entire init script can be overridden by providing your  own  <b>tkTableInit</b>  procedure  before  the
       library is loaded.  Otherwise, the aforementioned <u>env(TK</u><b>_</b><u>TABLE</u><b>_</b><u>LIBRARY)</u> variable will be set with the
       directory in which <u>$env(TK</u><b>_</b><u>TABLE</u><b>_</b><u>LIBRARY</u><b>_</b><u>FILE)</u> was found.


<b>INDICES</b>
       Many of the widget commands for tables take one or more indices as arguments.  An index  specifies  a
       particular cell of the table, in any of the following ways:

       <u>number,number</u>
                   Specifies  the cell as a numerical index of row,col which corresponds to the index of the
                   associated Tcl array, where <b>-roworigin,-colorigin</b> corresponds to the first  cell  in  the
                   table (0,0 by default).  The values for row and column will be constrained to actual val-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ues&nbsp;values</font>
                   ues in the table, which means a valid cell is always found.

       <b>active</b>      Indicates the cell that has the location cursor.  It is specified with the <b>activate</b>  wid-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">get&nbsp;widget</font>
                   get command.

       <b>anchor</b>      Indicates the anchor point for the selection, which is set with the <b>selection</b> <b>anchor</b> wid-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">get&nbsp;widget</font>
                   get command.

       <b>bottomright</b> Indicates the bottom-rightmost cell visible in the table.

       <b>end</b>         Indicates the bottom right cell of the table.

       <b>origin</b>      Indicates the top-leftmost editable cell of the table, not necessarily  in  the  display.
                   This takes into account the user specified origin and title area.

       <b>topleft</b>     Indicates  the  top-leftmost  editable  cell  visible  in  the table (this excludes title
                   cells).

       <b>@</b><u>x</u><b>,</b><u>y</u>        Indicates the cell that covers the point in the table window specified by  <u>x</u>  and  <u>y</u>  (in
                   pixel coordinates).  If no cell covers that point, then the closest cell to that point is
                   used.

       In the widget command descriptions below, arguments named <u>index</u>, <u>first</u>, and <u>last</u> always contain  text
       indices in one of the above forms.


<b>TAGS</b>
       A  tag  is  a  textual string that is associated with zero or more rows, columns or cells in a table.
       Tags may contain arbitrary characters, but it is probably best to avoid using names which  look  like
       indices  to  reduce  coding  confusion.  A tag can apply to an entire row or column, or just a single
       cell.  There are several permanent tags in each table that can be configured by  the  user  and  will
       determine the attributes for special cells:

              <b>active</b>    This tag is given to the <u>active</u> cell

              <b>flash</b>     If flash mode is on, this tag is given to any recently edited cells.

              <b>sel</b>       This tag is given to any selected cells.

              <b>title</b>     This  tag  is given to any cells in the title rows and columns.  This tag has <b>-state</b>
                        <u>disabled</u> by default.

       Tags control the way cells are displayed on the screen.  Where appropriate, the default for  display-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;displaying</font>
       ing cells is determined by the options for the table widget.  However, display options may be associ-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ated&nbsp;associated</font>
       ated with individual tags using the ``<u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b> <b>configure</b>'' widget command.  If  a  cell,  row  or
       column has been tagged, then the display options associated with the tag override the default display
       style.  The following options are currently supported for tags:

              <b>-anchor</b> <u>anchor</u>
                     Anchor for item in the cell space.

              <b>-background</b> or <b>-bg</b> <u>color</u>
                     Background color of the cell.

              <b>-borderwidth</b> or <b>-bd</b> <u>pixelList</u>
                     Borderwidth of the cell, of the same format for the table, but may  also  be  empty  to
                     inherit the default table borderwidth value (the default).

              <b>-ellipsis</b> <u>string</u>
                     String to display at the end of a line that would be clipped by its cell, like ``...''.
                     An ellipsis will be displayed only on non-wrapping, non-multiline cells that  would  be
                     clipped.   The  ellipsis will display on the left for east anchored cells, otherwise it
                     displays on the right.

              <b>-font</b> <u>fontName</u>
                     Font for text in the cell.

              <b>-foreground</b> or <b>-fg</b> <u>color</u>
                     Foreground color of the cell.

              <b>-justify</b> <u>justify</u>
                     How to justify multi-line text in a cell.  It must be one of <b>left</b>, <b>right</b>, or <b>center</b>.

              <b>-image</b> <u>imageName</u>
                     An image to display in the cell instead of text.

              <b>-multiline</b> <u>boolean</u>
                     Whether to display text with newlines on multiple lines.

              <b>-relief</b> <u>relief</u>
                     The relief for the cell.  May be the empty string to cause this tag to not disturb  the
                     value.

              <b>-showtext</b> <u>boolean</u>
                     Whether to show the text over an image.

              <b>-state</b> <u>state</u>
                     The  state  of  the cell, to allow for certain cells to be disabled.  This prevents the
                     cell from being edited by the <u>insert</u> or <u>delete</u> methods, but a direct <u>set</u>  will  not  be
                     prevented.

              <b>-wrap</b> <u>boolean</u>
                     Whether characters should wrap in a cell that is not wide enough.

       A priority order is defined among tags based on creation order (first created tag has highest default
       priority), and this order is used in implementing some of the tag-related functions described  below.
       When  a  cell  is displayed, its properties are determined by the tags which are assigned to it.  The
       priority of a tag can be modified by the ``<u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b> <b>lower</b>'' and  ``<u>pathName</u>  <b>tag</b>  <b>raise</b>''  widget
       commands.

       If a cell has several tags associated with it that define the same display options (eg - a <b>title</b> cell
       with specific <b>row</b> and <b>cell</b> tags), then the options of the highest priority tag are used.  If  a  par-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ticular&nbsp;particular</font>
       ticular  display option hasn't been specified for a particular tag, or if it is specified as an empty
       string, then that option will not be used;  the  next-highest-priority  tag's  option  will  be  used
       instead.  If no tag specifies a particular display option, then the default style for the widget will
       be used.

       Images are used for display purposes only.  Editing in that cell will still be enabled and any query-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;querying</font>
       ing of the cell will show the text value of the cell, regardless of the value of <b>-showtext</b>.


<b>EMBEDDED</b> <b>WINDOWS</b>
       There  may  be any number of embedded windows in a table widget (one per cell), and any widget may be
       used as an embedded window (subject to the usual rules for geometry management, which require the ta-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ble&nbsp;table</font>
       ble window to be the parent of the embedded window or a descendant of its parent).  The embedded win-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dow's&nbsp;window's</font>
       dow's position on the screen will be updated as the table is modified or scrolled,  and  it  will  be
       mapped  and unmapped as it moves into and out of the visible area of the table widget.  Each embedded
       window occupies one cell's worth of space in the table widget, and it is referred to by the index  of
       the  cell in the table.  Windows associated with the table widget are destroyed when the table widget
       is destroyed.

       Windows are used for display purposes only.  A value still exists for that  cell,  but  will  not  be
       shown unless the window is deleted in some way.  If the window is destroyed or lost by the table wid-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">get&nbsp;widget</font>
       get to another geometry manager, then any data associated with it is lost (the cell it occupied  will
       no longer appear in <b>window</b> <b>names</b>).

       When  an embedded window is added to a table widget with the window configure widget command, several
       configuration options may be associated with it.  These options may be modified with later  calls  to
       the window configure widget command.  The following options are currently supported:

              <b>-create</b> <u>script</u>
                     NOT  CURRENTLY  SUPPORTED.   Specifies a Tcl script that may be evaluated to create the
                     window for the annotation.  If no -window option has been specified for this cell  then
                     this  script  will  be  evaluated when the cell is about to be displayed on the screen.
                     Script must create a window for the cell and return the name  of  that  window  as  its
                     result.   If  the  cell's  window  should ever be deleted, the script will be evaluated
                     again the next time the cell is displayed.

              <b>-background</b> or <b>-bg</b> <u>color</u>
                     Background color of the cell.  If not specified, it  uses  the  table's  default  back-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ground.&nbsp;background.</font>
                     ground.

              <b>-borderwidth</b> or <b>-bd</b> <u>pixelList</u>
                     Borderwidth  of  the  cell,  of the same format for the table, but may also be empty to
                     inherit the default table borderwidth value (the default).

              <b>-padx</b> <u>pixels</u>
                     As defined in the Tk options man page.

              <b>-pady</b> <u>pixels</u>
                     As defined in the Tk options man page.

              <b>-relief</b> <u>relief</u>
                     The relief to use for the cell in which the window lies.  If not specified, it uses the
                     table's default relief.

              <b>-sticky</b> <u>sticky</u>
                     Stickiness of the window inside the cell, as defined by the <b>grid</b> command.

              <b>-window</b> <u>pathName</u>
                     Specifies  the  name  of a window (widget) to display in the annotation.  It must exist
                     before being specified here.  When an empty string is specified, if a window  was  dis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">played&nbsp;displayed</font>
                     played it will cease to be managed by the table widget.


<b>THE</b> <b>SELECTION</b>
       Table  selections  are  available as type STRING.  By default, the value of the selection will be the
       values of the selected cells in nested Tcl list form where each row is a list and each column  is  an
       element of a row list.  You can change the way this value is interpreted by setting the <b>-rowseparator</b>
       and <b>-colseparator</b> options.  For example, default Excel format would be to set <b>-rowseparator</b>  to  "\n"
       and  <b>-colseparator</b> to "\t".  Changing these values affects both how the table sends out the selection
       and reads in pasted data, ensuring that the table should always be able to cut and paste  to  itself.
       It is possible to change how pastes are handled by editing the table library procedure <b>tk_tablePaste</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">Handler.&nbsp;tk_tablePasteHandler.</font>
       <b>Handler</b>.  This might be necessary if <b>-selectioncommand</b> is set.


<b>ROW/COL</b> <b>SPANNING</b>
       Individual cells can span multiple rows and/or columns.  This is done  via  the  <b>spans</b>  command  (see
       below  for  exact arguments).  Cells in the title area that span are not permitted to span beyond the
       title area, and will be constrained accordingly.  If the title area shrinks during a configure,  san-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ity&nbsp;sanity</font>
       ity  checking  will occur to ensure the above.  You may set spans on regular cells that extend beyond
       the defined row/col area.  These spans will not be constrained, so that when the defined row/col area
       expands, the span will expand with it.

       When setting a span, checks are made as to whether the span would overlap an already spanning or hid-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">den&nbsp;hidden</font>
       den cell.  This is an error and it not allowed.  Spans can affect the overall speed of table drawing,
       although not significantly.  If spans are not used, then there is no performance loss.

       Cells  <u>hidden</u> by spanning cells still have valid data.  This will be seen during cut and paste opera-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tions&nbsp;operations</font>
       tions that involve hidden cells, or through direct access by a command like <b>get</b> or <b>set</b>.

       The drawing properties of spanning cells apply to only the visual area of the cell.  For example,  if
       a  cell  is  center justified over 5 columns, then when viewing any portion of those columns, it will
       appear centered in the visible area. The non-visible column area will not be considered in  the  cen-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tering&nbsp;centering</font>
       tering calculations.


<b>COMMAND</b> <b>SUBSTITUTION</b>
       The  various option based commands that the table supports all support the familiar Tk %-substitution
       model (see <b>bind</b> for more details).  The following %-sequences are recognized and substituted  by  the
       table widget:

       <b>%c</b>   For  <b>SelectionCommand</b>,  it is the maximum number of columns in any row in the selection.  Other-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">wise&nbsp;Otherwise</font>
            wise it is the column of the triggered cell.

       <b>%C</b>   A convenience substitution for <u>%r</u>,<u>%c</u>.

       <b>%i</b>   For <b>SelectionCommand</b>, it is the total number of cells in the selection.  For <b>Command</b>,  it  is  0
            for  a  read  (get) and 1 for a write (set).  Otherwise it is the current cursor position in the
            cell.

       <b>%r</b>   For <b>SelectionCommand</b>, it is the number of rows in the selection.  Otherwise it is the row of the
            triggered cell.

       <b>%s</b>   For <b>ValidateCommand</b>, it is the current value of the cell being validated.  For <b>SelectionCommand</b>,
            it is the default value of the selection.  For <b>BrowseCommand</b>, it is the index of the last active
            cell.   For  <b>Command</b>,  it  is empty for reads (get) and the current value of the cell for writes
            (set).

       <b>%S</b>   For <b>ValidateCommand</b>, it is the potential new value of the cell being validated.  For  <b>BrowseCom</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand,&nbsp;BrowseCommand,</font>
            <b>mand</b>, it is the index of the new active cell.

       <b>%W</b>   The pathname to the window for which the command was generated.



<b>WIDGET</b> <b>COMMAND</b>
       The  <b>table</b>  command  creates  a  new Tcl command whose name is <u>pathName</u>.  This command may be used to
       invoke various operations on the widget.  It has the following general form:
              <u>pathName</u> <u>option</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
       <u>Option</u> and the <u>arg</u>s determine the exact behavior of the command.

       The following commands are possible for <b>table</b> widgets:

       <u>pathName</u> <b>activate</b> <u>index</u>
              Sets the active cell to the one indicated by <u>index</u>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>bbox</b> <u>first</u> ?<u>last</u>?
              It returns the bounding box for the specified cell (range) as a 4-tuple of  x,  y,  width  and
              height  in pixels.  It clips the box to the visible portion, if any, otherwise an empty string
              is returned.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>border</b> <u>option</u> <u>args</u>
              This command is a voodoo hack to implement border sizing for tables.  This is normally  called
              through bindings, with the following as valid options:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>border</b> <b>mark</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u> ?<u>row|col</u>?
                     Records  <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> and the row and/or column border under that point in the table window,
                     if any; used in conjunction with later <b>border</b> <b>dragto</b> commands.  Typically this  command
                     is associated with a mouse button press in the widget.  If <u>row</u> or <u>col</u> is not specified,
                     it returns a tuple of both border indices (an empty item means no border).   Otherwise,
                     just the specified item is returned.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>border</b> <b>dragto</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u>
                     This  command  computes  the  difference  between its <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> arguments and the <u>x</u> and <u>y</u>
                     arguments to the last <b>border</b> <b>mark</b> command for the widget.  It then adjusts  the  previ-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ously&nbsp;previously</font>
                     ously marked border by the difference.  This command is typically associated with mouse
                     motion events in the widget, to produce the effect of interactive border resizing.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>cget</b> <u>option</u>
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <u>option</u>.  <u>Option</u> may have any of
              the values accepted by the <b>table</b> command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>clear</b> <u>option</u> ?<u>first</u>? ?<u>last</u>?
              This command is a convenience routine to clear certain state information managed by the table.
              <u>first</u> and <u>last</u> represent valid table indices.  If neither  are  specified,  then  the  command
              operates on the whole table.  The following options are recognized:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>clear</b> <b>cache</b> ?<u>first</u>? ?<u>last</u>?
                     Clears the specified section of the cache, if the table has been keeping one.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>clear</b> <b>sizes</b> ?<u>first</u>? ?<u>last</u>?
                     Clears  the  specified  row and column areas of specific height/width dimensions.  When
                     just one index is specified, for example <b>2,0</b>, that is interpreted as row 2  <b>and</b>  column
                     0.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>clear</b> <b>tags</b> ?<u>first</u>? ?<u>last</u>?
                     Clears the specified area of tags (all row, column and cell tags).

              <u>pathName</u> <b>clear</b> <b>all</b> ?<u>first</u>? ?<u>last</u>?
                     Performs all of the above clear functions on the specified area.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>configure</b> ?<u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no <u>option</u> is specified, returns a
              list describing all of the available options for <u>pathName</u> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b>  for  informa-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;information</font>
              tion  on  the  format  of  this list).  If <u>option</u> is specified with no <u>value</u>, then the command
              returns a list describing the one named option (this list will be identical to the correspond-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;corresponding</font>
              ing  sublist  of  the  value returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).  If one or more <u>option-value</u>
              pairs are specified, then the command modifies the given widget <!-- a -->option(s)<!-- /a --> to  have  the  given
              <!-- a -->value(s)<!-- /a -->;   in this case the command returns an empty string.  <u>Option</u> may have any of the val-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ues&nbsp;values</font>
              ues accepted by the <b>table</b> command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>curselection</b> ?<u>value</u>?
              With no arguments, it returns the sorted indices of the currently selected  cells.   Otherwise
              it sets all the selected cells to the given value.  The set has no effect if there is no asso-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ciated&nbsp;associated</font>
              ciated Tcl array or the state is disabled.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>curvalue</b> ?<u>value</u>?
              If no value is given, the value of the cell being edited (indexed by <b>active</b>) is returned, else
              it is set to the given value.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>delete</b> <u>option</u> <u>arg</u> ?<u>arg</u>?
              This  command is used to delete various things in a table.  It has several forms, depending on
              the <u>option</u>:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>delete</b> <b>active</b> <u>index</u> ?<u>index</u>?
                     Deletes text from the active cell.  If only one index is given, it deletes the  charac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ter&nbsp;character</font>
                     ter  after  that index, otherwise it deletes from the first index to the second.  <u>index</u>
                     can be a number, <b>insert</b> or <b>end</b>.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>delete</b> <b>cols</b> ?<u>switches</u>? <u>index</u> ?<u>count</u>?
                     Deletes <u>count</u> cols starting at (and including) col  <u>index</u>.   The  <u>index</u>  will  be  con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">strained&nbsp;constrained</font>
                     strained  to  the  limits  of the tables.  If <u>count</u> is negative, it deletes cols to the
                     left.  Otherwise it deletes cols to the right.  <u>count</u> defaults to 1 (meaning  just  the
                     column  specified).   At the moment, spans are not adjusted with this action.  Optional
                     switches are:

                     <b>-holddimensions</b>
                            Causes the table cols to be unaffected by the deletion (empty cols may  appear).
                            By default the dimensions are adjusted by <b>count</b>.

                     <b>-holdselection</b>
                            Causes  the selection to be maintained on the absolute cells values.  Otherwise,
                            the selection will be cleared..

                     <b>-holdtags</b>
                            Causes the tags specified by the <u>tag</u> method to not move  along  with  the  data.
                            Also  prevents  specific widths set by the <u>width</u> method from being adjusted.  By
                            default, these tags are properly adjusted.

                     <b>-holdwindows</b>
                            Causes the embedded windows created with the <u>window</u> method  to  not  move  along
                            with the data.  By default, these windows are properly adjusted.

                     <b>-keeptitles</b>
                            Prevents  title  area cells from being changed.  Otherwise they are treated just
                            like regular cells and will move as specified.

                     <b>--</b>     Signifies the end of the switches.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>delete</b> <b>rows</b> ?<u>switches</u>? <u>index</u> ?<u>count</u>?
                     Deletes <b>count</b> rows starting at (and including) row <b>index</b>.  If  <b>count</b>  is  negative,  it
                     deletes  rows  going  up.  Otherwise it deletes rows going down.  The selection will be
                     cleared.  The switches are the same as those for column deletion.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>get</b> <u>first</u> ?<u>last</u>?
              Returns the value of the cells specified by the table indices <u>first</u> and (optionally) <u>last</u> in a
              list.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>height</b> ?<u>row</u>? ?<u>value</u> <u>row</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              If  no  <u>row</u>  is specified, returns a list describing all rows for which a height has been set.
              If <b>row</b> is specified with no value, it prints out the height of that row in  characters  (posi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tive&nbsp;(positive</font>
              tive  number) or pixels (negative number).  If one or more <u>row-value</u> pairs are specified, then
              it sets each row to be that height in lines (positive number) or pixels (negative number).  If
              <u>value</u> is <u>default</u>, then the row uses the default height, specified by <b>-rowheight</b>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>hidden</b> ?<u>index</u>? ?<u>index</u> <u>...</u>?
              When  called  without args, it returns all the <u>hidden</u> cells (those cells covered by a spanning
              cell).  If one index is specified, it returns the spanning cell covering that index,  if  any.
              If  multiple indices are specified, it returns 1 if all indices are hidden cells, 0 otherwise.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>icursor</b> ?<u>arg</u>?
              With no arguments, prints out the location of the insertion cursor in the active  cell.   With
              one  argument,  sets the cursor to that point in the string.  0 is before the first character,
              you can also use <b>insert</b> or <b>end</b> for the current insertion point or the end  of  the  text.   If
              there is no active cell, or the cell or table is disabled, this will return -1.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>index</b> <u>index</u> ?<u>row|col</u>?
              Returns  the integer cell coordinate that corresponds to <u>index</u> in the form row,col.  If <b>row</b> or
              <b>col</b> is specified, then only the row or column index is returned.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>insert</b> <u>option</u> <u>arg</u> <u>arg</u>
              This command is used to into various things into a table.  It has several forms, depending  on
              the <u>option</u>:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>insert</b> <b>active</b> <u>index</u> <u>value</u>
                     The  <u>value</u>  is a text string which is inserted at the <u>index</u> postion of the active cell.
                     The cursor is then positioned after the new text. <u>index</u> can be a number, <b>insert</b> or <b>end</b>.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>insert</b> <b>cols</b> ?<u>switches</u>? <u>index</u> ?<u>count</u>?
                     Inserts  <b>count</b> cols starting at col <b>index</b>.  If <b>count</b> is negative, it inserts before the
                     specified col.  Otherwise it inserts after the specified col.  The  selection  will  be
                     cleared.  The switches are the same as those for column deletion.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>insert</b> <b>rows</b> ?<u>switches</u>? <u>index</u> ?<u>count</u>?
                     Inserts  <b>count</b> rows starting at row <b>index</b>.  If <b>count</b> is negative, it inserts before the
                     specified row.  Otherwise it inserts after the specified row.  The  selection  will  be
                     cleared.  The switches are the same as those for column deletion.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>reread</b>
              Rereads  the  old contents of the cell back into the editing buffer.  Useful for a key binding
              when &lt;Escape&gt; is pressed to abort the edit (a default binding).

       <u>pathName</u> <b>scan</b> <u>option</u> <u>args</u>
              This command is used to implement scanning on tables.  It has two forms, depending on <u>option</u>:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>scan</b> <b>mark</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u>
                     Records <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> and the current view in the table window;   used  in  conjunction  with
                     later  <b>scan</b>  <b>dragto</b> commands.  Typically this command is associated with a mouse button
                     press in the widget.  It returns an empty string.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>scan</b> <b>dragto</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u>.
                     This command computes the difference between its <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> arguments  and  the  <u>x</u>  and  <u>y</u>
                     arguments  to the last <b>scan</b> <b>mark</b> command for the widget.  It then adjusts the view by 5
                     times the difference in coordinates.  This command is typically associated  with  mouse
                     motion  events  in the widget, to produce the effect of dragging the list at high speed
                     through the window.  The return value is an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>see</b> <u>index</u>
              Adjust the view in the table so that the cell given by <u>index</u> is positioned as the cell one off
              from  top  left (excluding title rows and columns) if the cell is not currently visible on the
              screen.  The actual cell may be different to keep the screen full.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <u>option</u> <u>arg</u>
              This command is used to adjust the selection within a table.  It has several forms,  depending
              on <u>option</u>:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>anchor</b> <u>index</u>
                     Sets  the selection anchor to the cell given by <u>index</u>.  The selection anchor is the end
                     of the selection that is fixed while dragging out a  selection  with  the  mouse.   The
                     index <b>anchor</b> may be used to refer to the anchor cell.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>clear</b> <u>first</u> ?<u>last</u>?
                     If  any  of  the  cells between <u>first</u> and <u>last</u> (inclusive) are selected, they are dese-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lected.&nbsp;deselected.</font>
                     lected.  The selection state is not changed for cells outside this range.  <u>first</u> may be
                     specified as <b>all</b> to remove the selection from all cells.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>includes</b> <u>index</u>
                     Returns 1 if the cell indicated by <u>index</u> is currently selected, 0 if it isn't.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>set</b> <u>first</u> ?<u>last</u>?
                     Selects  all  of  the  cells  in  the  range between <u>first</u> and <u>last</u>, inclusive, without
                     affecting the selection state of cells outside that range.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>set</b> ?<u>row|col</u>? <u>index</u> ?<u>value</u>? ?<u>index</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Sets the specified index to the associated value.  Table validation will not be triggered  via
              this  method.  If <b>row</b> or <b>col</b> precedes the list of index/value pairs, then the value is assumed
              to be a Tcl list whose values will be split and set into the subsequent  columns  (if  <b>row</b>  is
              specified)  or  rows (for <b>col</b>).  For example, <b>set</b> <b>row</b> <b>2,3</b> <b>{2,3</b> <b>2,4</b> <b>2,5}</b> will set 3 cells, from
              2,3 to 2,5.  The setting of cells is silently bounded by the known table dimensions.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>spans</b> ?<u>index</u>? ?<u>rows,cols</u> <u>index</u> <u>rows,cols</u> <u>...</u>?
              This command is used to manipulate row/col spans.  When called with no  arguments,  all  known
              spans  are  returned  as a list of tuples of the form {index span}.  When called with only the
              <u>index</u>, the span for that <u>index</u> only is returned, if any.  Otherwise an even  number  of  <u>index</u>
              <u>rows,cols</u> pairs are used to set spans.  A span starts at the <u>index</u> and continues for the spec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ified&nbsp;specified</font>
              ified number of rows and cols.  Negative spans are not supported.  A span of  0,0  unsets  any
              span on that cell.  See EXAMPLES for more info.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b> option ?<u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
              This  command  is  used  to manipulate tags.  The exact behavior of the command depends on the
              <u>option</u> argument that follows the <b>tag</b> argument.  <u>cget</u>, <u>cell</u>, and <u>row|col</u> complain about unknown
              tag names.  The following forms of the command are currently supported:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b> <b>cell</b> <u>tagName</u> <u>?index</u> <u>...?</u>
                     With  no  arguments,  prints out the list of cells that use the <u>tag</u>.  Otherwise it sets
                     the specified cells to use the named tag, replacing any tag  that  may  have  been  set
                     using  this  method  before.  If <u>tagName</u> is {}, the cells are reset to the default <u>tag</u>.
                     Tags added during -*tagcommand evaluation do not register here.  If  <u>tagName</u>  does  not
                     exist, it will be created with the default options.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b> <b>cget</b> <u>tagName</u> <u>option</u>
                     This  command  returns the current value of the option named <u>option</u> associated with the
                     tag given by <u>tagName</u>.  <u>Option</u> may have any of the values accepted by the <b>tag</b>  <b>configure</b>
                     widget command.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b> <b>col</b> <u>tagName</u> <u>?col</u> <u>...?</u>
                     With no arguments, prints out the list of cols that use the <u>tag</u>.  Otherwise it sets the
                     specified columns to use the named tag, replacing any tag that may have been set  using
                     this  method  before.   If  <u>tagName</u> is {}, the cols are reset to the default <u>tag</u>.  Tags
                     added during -coltagcommand evaluation do not  register  here.   If  <u>tagName</u>  does  not
                     exist, it will be created with the default options.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b> <b>configure</b> <u>tagName</u> ?<u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u>? ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
                     This command is similar to the <b>configure</b> widget command except that it modifies options
                     associated with the tag given by <u>tagName</u> instead of modifying options for  the  overall
                     table  widget.  If no <u>option</u> is specified, the command returns a list describing all of
                     the available options for <u>tagName</u> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for information on  the  format
                     of  this  list).  If <u>option</u> is specified with no <u>value</u>, then the command returns a list
                     describing the one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding  sub-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">list&nbsp;sublist</font>
                     list  of  the  value  returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).  If one or more <u>option-value</u>
                     pairs are specified, then the command modifies the given <!-- a -->option(s)<!-- /a --> to  have  the  given
                     <!-- a -->value(s)<!-- /a -->  in <u>tagName</u>; in this case the command returns an empty string.  See TAGS above
                     for details on the options available for tags.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b> <b>delete</b> <u>tagName</u>
                     Deletes a tag.  No error if the tag does not exist.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b> <b>exists</b> <u>tagName</u>
                     Returns 1 if the named tag exists, 0 otherwise.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b> <b>includes</b> <u>tagName</u> <u>index</u>
                     Returns 1 if the specified index has the named tag, 0 otherwise.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b> <b>lower</b> <u>tagName</u> ?<u>belowThis</u>?
                     Lower the priority of the named tag.  If <u>belowThis</u> is not  specified,  then  the  tag's
                     priority is lowered to the bottom, otherwise it is lowered to one below <u>belowThis</u>.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b> <b>names</b> ?<u>pattern</u>?
                     If no pattern is specified, shows the names of all defined tags.  Otherwise the <u>pattern</u>
                     is used as a glob pattern to show only tags  matching  that  pattern.   Tag  names  are
                     returned in priority order (highest priority tag first).

              <u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b> <b>raise</b> <u>tagName</u> ?<u>aboveThis</u>?
                     Raise  the  priority  of  the named tag.  If <u>aboveThis</u> is not specified, then the tag's
                     priority is raised to the top, otherwise it is raised to one above <u>aboveThis</u>.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b> <b>row</b> <u>tagName</u> ?<u>row</u> <u>...</u>?
                     With no arguments, prints out the list of rows that use the <u>tag</u>.  Otherwise it sets the
                     specified  columns to use the named tag, replacing any tag that may have been set using
                     this method before.  If <u>tagName</u> is {}, the rows are reset to use the default tag.  Tags
                     added  during  -rowtagcommand  evaluation  do  not  register here.  If <u>tagName</u> does not
                     exist, it will be created with the default options.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>validate</b> <u>index</u>
              Explicitly validates the specified index based on the current <b>-validatecommand</b> and  returns  0
              or 1 based on whether the cell was validated.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>width</b> ?<u>col</u>? ?<u>value</u> <u>col</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              If no <u>col</u> is specified, returns a list describing all cols for which a width has been set.  If
              <b>col</b> is specified with no value, it prints out the width of that col  in  characters  (positive
              number)  or  pixels  (negative number).  If one or more <u>col-value</u> pairs are specified, then it
              sets each col to be that width in characters (positive number) or  pixels  (negative  number).
              If <u>value</u> is <u>default</u>, then the col uses the default width, specified by <b>-colwidth</b>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>window</b> option ?<u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
              This  command  is  used  to  manipulate  embedded  windows.  The exact behavior of the command
              depends on the <u>option</u> argument that follows the <b>window</b> argument.  The following forms  of  the
              command are currently supported:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>window</b> <b>cget</b> <u>index</u> <u>option</u>
                     This  command  returns the current value of the option named <u>option</u> associated with the
                     window given by <u>index</u>.  <u>Option</u> may have any of the values accepted by the  <b>window</b>  <b>con</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">figure&nbsp;configure</font>
                     <b>figure</b> widget command.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>window</b> <b>configure</b> <u>index</u> ?<u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u>? ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
                     This command is similar to the <b>configure</b> widget command except that it modifies options
                     associated with the embedded window given by <u>index</u> instead of modifying options for the
                     overall table widget.  If no <u>option</u> is specified, the command returns a list describing
                     all of the available options for <u>index</u> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b>  for  information  on  the
                     format of this list).  If <u>option</u> is specified with no <u>value</u>, then the command returns a
                     list describing the one named option (this list will be identical to the  corresponding
                     sublist  of the value returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).  If one or more <u>option-value</u>
                     pairs are specified, then the command modifies the given <!-- a -->option(s)<!-- /a --> to  have  the  given
                     <!-- a -->value(s)<!-- /a --> in <u>index</u>; in this case the command returns an empty string.  See EMBEDDED WIN-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">DOWS&nbsp;WINDOWS</font>
                     DOWS above for details on the options available for windows.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>window</b> <b>delete</b> <u>index</u> ?<u>index</u> <u>...</u>?
                     Deletes an embedded window from the table.  The associated window will also be deleted.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>window</b> <b>move</b> <u>indexFrom</u> <u>indexTo</u>
                     Moves  an  embedded window from one cell to another.  If a window already exists in the
                     target cell, it will be deleted.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>window</b> <b>names</b> ?<u>pattern</u>?
                     If no pattern is specified, shows the cells of all  embedded  windows.   Otherwise  the
                     <u>pattern</u> is used as a glob pattern to show only cells matching that pattern.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b> <u>args</u>
              This  command  is  used  to query and change the horizontal position of the information in the
              widget's window.  It can take any of the following forms:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b>
                     Returns a list containing two elements.  Each element is a real fraction between 0  and
                     1;   together  they  describe  the  horizontal span that is visible in the window.  For
                     example, if the first element is .2 and the second element is .6, 20%  of  the  table's
                     text is off-screen to the left, the middle 40% is visible in the window, and 40% of the
                     text is off-screen to the right.  These are the same values passed  to  scrollbars  via
                     the <b>-xscrollcommand</b> option.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b> <u>index</u>
                     Adjusts  the  view  in the window so that the column given by <u>index</u> is displayed at the
                     left edge of the window.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b> <b>moveto</b> <u>fraction</u>
                     Adjusts the view in the window so that <u>fraction</u> of the total width of the table text is
                     off-screen to the left.  <u>fraction</u> must be a fraction between 0 and 1.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b> <b>scroll</b> <u>number</u> <u>what</u>
                     This  command shifts the view in the window left or right according to <u>number</u> and <u>what</u>.
                     <u>Number</u> must be an integer.  <u>What</u> must be either <b>units</b> or <b>pages</b> or  an  abbreviation  of
                     one  of these.  If <u>what</u> is <b>units</b>, the view adjusts left or right by <u>number</u> cells on the
                     display; if it is <b>pages</b> then the view adjusts by <u>number</u> screenfuls.  If <u>number</u> is nega-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tive&nbsp;negative</font>
                     tive  then cells farther to the left become visible;  if it is positive then cells far-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ther&nbsp;farther</font>
                     ther to the right become visible.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b> <u>?args</u>?
              This command is used to query and change the vertical position of the  text  in  the  widget's
              window.  It can take any of the following forms:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b>
                     Returns  a list containing two elements, both of which are real fractions between 0 and
                     1.  The first element gives the position of the table element at the top of the window,
                     relative  to the table as a whole (0.5 means it is halfway through the table, for exam-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ple).&nbsp;example).</font>
                     ple).  The second element gives the position of the table element just after  the  last
                     one  in the window, relative to the table as a whole.  These are the same values passed
                     to scrollbars via the <b>-yscrollcommand</b> option.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b> <u>index</u>
                     Adjusts the view in the window so that the row given by <u>index</u> is displayed at  the  top
                     of the window.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b> <b>moveto</b> <u>fraction</u>
                     Adjusts the view in the window so that the element given by <u>fraction</u> appears at the top
                     of the window.  <u>Fraction</u> is a fraction between 0 and 1;  0 indicates the first  element
                     in  the  table,  0.33 indicates the element one-third the way through the table, and so
                     on.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b> <b>scroll</b> <u>number</u> <u>what</u>
                     This command adjusts the view in the window up or down according to  <u>number</u>  and  <u>what</u>.
                     <u>Number</u>  must be an integer.  <u>What</u> must be either <b>units</b> or <b>pages</b>.  If <u>what</u> is <b>units</b>, the
                     view adjusts up or down by <u>number</u> cells; if it is <b>pages</b> then the view adjusts by <u>number</u>
                     screenfuls.  If <u>number</u> is negative then earlier elements become visible; if it is posi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tive&nbsp;positive</font>
                     tive then later elements become visible.


<b>DEFAULT</b> <b>BINDINGS</b>
       The initialization creates class bindings that give the following default behaviour:

       [1]    Clicking Button-1 in a cell activates that cell.  Clicking into an already active  cell  moves
              the insertion cursor to the character nearest the mouse.

       [2]    Moving  the  mouse  while Button-1 is pressed will stroke out a selection area.  Exiting while
              Button-1 is pressed causing scanning to occur on the table along with selection.

       [3]    Moving the mouse while Button-2 is pressed causes scanning to occur without any selection.

       [4]    Home moves the table to have the origin in view.

       [5]    End moves the table to have the <b>end</b> cell in view.

       [6]    Control-Home moves the table to the origin and activates that cell.

       [7]    Control-End moves the table to the end and activates that cell.

       [8]    Shift-Control-Home extends the selection to the origin.

       [9]    Shift-Control-End extends the selection to the end.

       [10]   The left, right, up and down arrows move the active cell.

       [11]   Shift-&lt;arrow&gt; extends the selection in that direction.

       [12]   Control-leftarrow and Control-rightarrow move the insertion cursor within the cell.

       [13]   Control-slash selects all the cells.

       [14]   Control-backslash clears selection from all the cells.

       [15]   Backspace deletes the character before the insertion cursor in the active cell.

       [16]   Delete deletes the character after the insertion cursor in the active cell.

       [17]   Escape rereads the value of the active cell from the specified  data  source,  discarding  any
              edits that have may been performed on the cell.

       [18]   Control-a moves the insertion cursor to the beginning of the active cell.

       [19]   Control-e moves the insertion cursor to the end of the active cell.

       [20]   Control-minus and Control-equals decrease and increase the width of the column with the active
              cell in it.

       [21]   Moving the mouse while Button-3 (the right button on Windows) is pressed while you are over  a
              border  will cause interactive resizing of that row and/or column to occur, based on the value
              of <b>-resizeborders</b>.

       Some bindings may have slightly different behavior dependent on the <b>-selectionmode</b> of the widget.

       If the widget is disabled using the <b>-state</b> option, then its view can still be adjusted and cells  can
       still  be  selected,  but  no  insertion cursor will be displayed and no cell modifications will take
       place.

       The behavior of tables can be changed by defining new bindings for individual widgets or by  redefin-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;redefining</font>
       ing  the class bindings.  The default bindings are either compiled in or read from a file expected to
       correspond to: "[lindex $tcl_pkgPath 0]/Tktable&lt;version&gt;/tkTable.tcl".


<b>PERFORMANCE</b> <b>ISSUES</b>
       The number of rows and columns or a table widget should not significantly affect the speed of redraw.
       Recalculation and redraw of table parameters and cells is restricted as much as possible.

       The display cell with the insert cursor is redrawn each time the cursor blinks, which causes a steady
       stream of graphics traffic.  Set the <b>-insertofftime</b> option to 0 avoid this.  The use  of  a  <b>-command</b>
       with  the  table  without  a cache can cause significant slow-down, as the command is called once for
       each request of a cell value.



<b>EXAMPLES</b>
       Set the topleft title area to be one spanning cell.  This overestimates both row and column  span  by
       one, but the command does all the constraining for us.
              $table span [$table cget -roworigin],[$table cget -colorigin] [$table cget -titlerows],[$table cget -titlecols]
       Force  a  table  window  refresh (useful for the slight chance that a bug in the table is not causing
       proper refresh):
              $table configure -padx [$table cget -padx]
