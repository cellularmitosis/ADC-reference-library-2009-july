To handle the asynch case, you must	declare the global gOptionCompleted.  When an option management call is made	gOptionCompleted is set to zero.  When the T_OPTMGMTCOMPLETE call is handled	by the endpoint handler, then gOptionCompleted is set to 1.  Note that the	sample spin loops until gOptionCompleted is non-zero.  As such, the 	DoSetServerStatusOption call cannot be made at interrupt time or from a deferred	task.  The DoSetServerStatusOption can only be made at system task time.		Ensure that gOptionCompleted is used to flag only one outstanding Option 	Management call at a time.	*/extern UInt32	gOptionCompleted;/*	input parameters	ep - endpoint on which to set the status string option	statusstr - C style string of the status string to set		function result - kOTNoError indicates that the option was successfully negotiated		if the result is negative, then this is the result returned by the call to		OTOptionManagement.
