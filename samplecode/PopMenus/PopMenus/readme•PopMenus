    PopMenus is a very simple demonstration of how to use pop-up menus     in your application.  It implements a pop-up menu as a userItem in     a modal dialog box (this is a helpful example in its own right).    We recommend that you review Sample or TESample for the general     structure and MultiFinder techniques you should use when writing a     new application.
