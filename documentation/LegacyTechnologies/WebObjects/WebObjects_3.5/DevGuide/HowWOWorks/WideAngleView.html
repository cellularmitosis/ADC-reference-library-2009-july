<h1> The Classes in the Request-Response Loop</h1>
</a><a name="5815">
The request-response loop begins when an incoming message (URL) from a client web browser is handled by the HTTP server. This section starts at that point and then dives into the request-response loop layer by layer, telling you which classes get involved, and at which point. Later sections walk you through the sequence of events that happen during one cycle of the request-response loop and the sequence of events for generating an HTML page. <p>
