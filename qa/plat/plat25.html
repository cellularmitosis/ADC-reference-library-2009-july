Under the new Release approach, each framework release will bemade up of features at various levels of certification. Most features will beof final quality, while others may be of beta or alpha quality. You can choosethe features with which to build your MacApp-based application, and by doing soyou will choose the quality level of the resulting application. Our build toolswill indicate the quality level you have chosen from those build flags you havepassed to them. The release notes which accompany each MacApp release will listthe features included in the framework and their quality status.</p><p id=p4>Important: For each MacApp release, ALWAYS refer to the release notes for thequality status. For some releases, we recommend that you do not buildapplications which you intend to rely on as "final" quality applications.Releases that have final quality status are suitable for building final-qualityMacApp-based applications.</p><p id=p4>Over the course of multiple releases, every feature will proceed through alpha,beta, and final quality phases. Some features will move rapidly fromdevelopment into final quality, perhaps in as little time as one release, whileother features may require several releases. This approach ensures that thesoftware features Apple provides to you are of the highest possible quality,while still allowing you to experiment with new, unproven features.</p><p id=p4>In addition to giving you an early indication of the direction Apple is takingwith MacApp, the release approach will also improve the timeliness of Apple'ssupport for new technologies, because feedback regarding your needs andrequirements can direct which module we enhance first.</p><p id=p4>Apple will create a new Release version of MacApp approximately once every sixto nine months, and the MacApp product will ship once each ETO delivery cycle.Releases of MacApp that occur between ETO shipment dates will be posted to theWeb. </p></td></tr></table></CENTER><!-- end_content --><!-- begin_date --><H4 ALIGN=center>[Aug 21 1996]</H4><!-- end_date --><!-- begin_footer_information -->	<table width="680" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
