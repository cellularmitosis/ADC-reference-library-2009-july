#	Apple Macintosh Developer Technical Support##	CLUTSample##   Loosely based in the sample SAMPLE this program shows#   how to create a window and display on it the colors of the CLUT#	associated with the device the window sits on top of.##	Left to the curious reader are some improvements such as, remembering the#	positions of each open window, so if you use this program to monitor your#	color tables it will position the windows in the last place you opened them.#	The treatment of direct devices is kind of 'casual' a better color display may #	be appropriate. Last, it may be desireable to change the size of the color#	rectangles depending on the depth of the color table.#	Check Sample sources for more detailed documentation regarding segmentation, #   memory allocation and such.#	The procedures containing the code I want to show are:##	CLUTSample.a --> OpenClutWindow: Opens windows used to display the device#									 CLUT.##	CLUTSampleMisc.a --> DrawClut: Gets and sets the device with the max depth#								   the window spans and uses its color table to#							       display colors.##	Dennis Hexcox, Macintosh Developer Technical Support 1990
