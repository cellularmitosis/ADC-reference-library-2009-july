/*	File:		DeepImages.c		Description: This example demonstrates QuickTimes support for 16bit deep components by rendering	             an image containing 48bit and 24bit RGB data. It then allows you to keep doubling the	             brightness of every pixel pinning the value at white.				 Sample Test Image : Sample 9-48RGB vs 24RGB.tiff	Author:		QuickTime Engineering, DTS	Copyright: 	© Copyright 1999 - 2002 Apple Computer, Inc.
