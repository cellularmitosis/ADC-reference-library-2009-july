<H3>Synopsis</H3>

<H3>Description</H3>
<P></B>WOGenericContainer provides a way for WebObjects to accommodate custom HTML container elements, that is, elements that affect a range of text. Since the HTML language is evolving rapidly, it's convenient to have a way to dynamically generate elements which are not explicitly supported by WebObjects.
<P>In HTML, a container element (for example, &lt;A ... &gt; ... &lt;/A&gt;) has opening and closing tags that delimit the text or graphic affected by the element. In contrast, an empty element (for example &lt;HR&gt; or &lt;BR&gt;) is represented by a single tag and so can't enclose any text or graphics. (See the related element WOGenericElement for information about the support of empty elements.)
<DL><DT><B>elementName</DT>
<DD></B>Name of the HTML element to generate. This name (for example "TEXTAREA") will be used to generate the container's opening and closing tags (&lt;TEXTAREA&gt;...&lt;/TEXTAREA&gt;).</DD></DL><BR>
<P><B>elementName</B> must be statically defined, that is, it must be a constant. It can't be something returned by a script method, for example. Please note that for elements with URL attributes, the URLs specified will appear as is in the HTML document.

<P>This approach works for many elements, but has one limitation. Some HTML elements have an <B>href</B> attribute that associates the element with a URL. In WebObjects, the corresponding dynamic element generally has two mutually exclusive attributes, <B>href</B> and <B>action</B>, which make use of the HTML element's <B>href</B> attribute. (See WOHyperlink for an element that can have either an <B>href</B> or an <B>action</B> attribute.) The dynamic element's <B>href</B> attribute simply returns a URL, but <B>action</B> invokes a WebObjects method, which returns a URL. This overloading of the HTML <B>href</B> attribute is not supported by WOGenericContainer. If your custom element requires this functionality, you will have to create your own subclass of WODynamicElement.
