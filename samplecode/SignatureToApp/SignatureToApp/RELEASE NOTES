11 June 2002:¥	I ripped out old code for walking through the DTDB and used MoreFiles instead.¥	I now call Launch Services if we're built for Carbon and it's available.	Launch Services is your friend!¥	Note that I continue to use FSSpec's, not FSRef's, for the call results 	because I attempted to maintain compatibility with existing clients.19 June 1991:¥	I'm now NILing the ioNamePtr field of the param block before calling PBGetVolParms, which	should prevent some unsightly crashes.17 June 1991:¥	Got it to work properly with file servers. NOTE: You may still have trouble with particular	applications on particular file servers, because a lot of servers seem to have screwed-up	desktop databases that don't have entries for various apps on the server. This is the	server's fault, not mine or PBDTGetAPPL's!7 June 1991:¥	Added the ability to find an application on disk without launching it.¥	Changed the boolean allowLaunch flag to a more general mode setting to allow this.¥	Renamed the whole thing to SignatureToApp.¥	Made the process parameter optional.¥	fnfErr, not afpItemNotFound, is returned if no application is found on disk.¥	Extended the 'Launch' tool to try out all three modes.¥	Rewrote a lot of this documentation.
