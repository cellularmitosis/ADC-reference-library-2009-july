 <P>When you create an application in WebObjects Builder, you're creating a new directory under <B>&lt;DocumentRoot&gt;/WebObjects</B>. All WebObjects applications must be              
 located beneath this directory so that the HTTP server can find them. The application directory is given the extension <B>.woa</B>.                                            
 <P>The application directory contains the application's resources. These resources        
 consist mainly of components, which are dynamic HTML pages.                            
 <P>Components are themselves directories, consisting of files that store the HTML, the    
 script, bindings, and any component-specific resources. The component for the first    
 page of the application is usually named <B>Main.wo</B>.
