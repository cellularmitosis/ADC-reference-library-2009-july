Client-server communication is handledby WebObjects. WebObjects applications that are partitioned in thisway are known as <b>Java Client</b> applications.</p><p>Java Client distributes the objects of your WebObjects applicationbetween the application server and one or more clients&#151;typicallyJava applications. It is based on a distributed multi-tier client-serverarchitecture where processing duties are divided between a client, anapplication server, a database server, and an HTTP  server. Witha Java Client application, you can partition business objects containingbusiness logic and data into a client side and a server side. Thispartitioning can improve performance and at the same time help tosecure legacy data and business rules.</p><p> <a href="#BABFHFGG">Figure 2-3</a> illustrates a Java Client application in which theclient portion is running as an application installed on the user'scomputer. As with an HTML-based WebObjects application, the applicationcan communicate with the server side using HTTP. In addition, JavaClient passes objects between a portion of your application residingon the user's computer and the portion of your application thatremains on the application server.</p><br><a name = "BABFHFGG"></a><p><b><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">Figure2-3 A website running Java Client applications</font></b></p> <img src = "../Art/javaclientapps.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/javaclientapps.gif]"><p>Java Client allows your application to look and feel likea traditional desktop application and still take full advantageof the power of WebObjects.</p><br>    <br><a href="HTML_Based__pplications.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/previous.gif" border="0"></a><a href="Rapid_Development.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/next.gif" border="0"></a>&nbsp;<br><br><p><hr><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">&#169; 2002 Apple Computer, Inc.
