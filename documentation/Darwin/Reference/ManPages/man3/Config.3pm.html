Config(3pm)                           Perl Programmers Reference Guide                           Config(3pm)



<b>NAME</b>
       Config - access Perl configuration information

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
           use Config;
           if ($Config{usethreads}) {
               print "has thread support\n"
           }

           use Config qw(myconfig config_sh config_vars config_re);

           print myconfig();

           print config_sh();

           print config_re();

           config_vars(qw(osname archname));

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The Config module contains all the information that was available to the "Configure" program at Perl
       build time (over 900 values).

       Shell variables from the <u>config.sh</u> file (written by Configure) are stored in the readonly-variable
       %Config, indexed by their names.

       Values stored in config.sh as 'undef' are returned as undefined values.  The perl "exists" function
       can be used to check if a named variable exists.

       <u>myconfig()</u>
           Returns a textual summary of the major perl configuration values.  See also "-V" in "Switches" in
           perlrun.

       <u>config</u><b>_</b><u>sh()</u>
           Returns the entire perl configuration information in the form of the original config.sh shell
           variable assignment script.

       config_re($regex)
           Like <u>config</u><b>_</b><u>sh()</u> but returns, as a list, only the config entries who's names match the $regex.

       config_vars(@names)
           Prints to STDOUT the values of the named configuration variable. Each is printed on a separate
           line in the form:

             name='value';

           Names which are unknown are output as "name='UNKNOWN';".  See also "-V:name" in "Switches" in
           perlrun.

<b>EXAMPLE</b>
       Here's a more sophisticated example of using %Config:

           use Config;
           use strict;

           my %sig_num;
           my @sig_name;
           unless($Config{sig_name} &amp;&amp; $Config{sig_num}) {
               die "No sigs?";
           } else {
               my @names = split ' ', $Config{sig_name};
               @sig_num{@names} = split ' ', $Config{sig_num};
               foreach (@names) {
                   $sig_name[$sig_num{$_}] ||= $_;
               }
           }

           print "signal #17 = $sig_name[17]\n";
           if ($sig_num{ALRM}) {
               print "SIGALRM is $sig_num{ALRM}\n";
           }

<b>WARNING</b>
       Because this information is not stored within the perl executable itself it is possible (but
       unlikely) that the information does not relate to the actual perl binary which is being used to
       access it.

       The Config module is installed into the architecture and version specific library directory ($Con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fig{installarchlib})&nbsp;($Config{installarchlib})</font>
       fig{installarchlib}) and it checks the perl version number when loaded.

       The values stored in config.sh may be either single-quoted or double-quoted. Double-quoted strings
       are handy for those cases where you need to include escape sequences in the strings. To avoid runtime
       variable interpolation, any "$" and "@" characters are replaced by "\$" and "\@", respectively. This
       isn't foolproof, of course, so don't embed "\$" or "\@" in double-quoted strings unless you're will-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;willing</font>
       ing to deal with the consequences. (The slashes will end up escaped and the "$" or "@" will trigger
       variable interpolation)

<b>GLOSSARY</b>
       Most "Config" variables are determined by the "Configure" script on platforms supported by it (which
       is most UNIX platforms).  Some platforms have custom-made "Config" variables, and may thus not have
       some of the variables described below, or may have extraneous variables specific to that particular
       port.  See the port specific documentation in such cases.

       <b>_</b>


       "_a"
           From <u>Unix.U</u>:

           This variable defines the extension used for ordinary library files.  For unix, it is <u>.a</u>.  The <u>.</u>
           is included.  Other possible values include <u>.lib</u>.

       "_exe"
           From <u>Unix.U</u>:

           This variable defines the extension used for executable files.  "DJGPP", Cygwin and <u>OS/2</u> use
           <u>.exe</u>.  Stratus "VOS" uses <u>.pm</u>.  On operating systems which do not require a specific extension
           for executable files, this variable is empty.

       "_o"
           From <u>Unix.U</u>:

           This variable defines the extension used for object files.  For unix, it is <u>.o</u>.  The <u>.</u> is
           included.  Other possible values include <u>.obj</u>.

       <b>a</b>


       "afs"
           From <u>afs.U</u>:

           This variable is set to "true" if "AFS" (Andrew File System) is used on the system, "false" oth-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">erwise.&nbsp;otherwise.</font>
           erwise.  It is possible to override this with a hint value or command line option, but you'd bet-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ter&nbsp;better</font>
           ter know what you are doing.

       "afsroot"
           From <u>afs.U</u>:

           This variable is by default set to <u>/afs</u>. In the unlikely case this is not the correct root, it is
           possible to override this with a hint value or command line option.  This will be used in subse-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">quent&nbsp;subsequent</font>
           quent tests for AFSness in the Perl configure and test process.

       "alignbytes"
           From <u>alignbytes.U</u>:

           This variable holds the number of bytes required to align a double-- or a long double when appli-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cable.&nbsp;applicable.</font>
           cable. Usual values are 2, 4 and 8.  The default is eight, for safety.

       "ansi2knr"
           From <u>ansi2knr.U</u>:

           This variable is set if the user needs to run ansi2knr.  Currently, this is not supported, so we
           just abort.

       "aphostname"
           From <u>d</u><b>_</b><u>gethname.U</u>:

           This variable contains the command which can be used to compute the host name. The command is
           fully qualified by its absolute path, to make it safe when used by a process with super-user
           privileges.

       "api_revision"
           From <u>patchlevel.U</u>:

           The three variables, api_revision, api_version, and api_subversion, specify the version of the
           oldest perl binary compatible with the present perl.  In a full version string such as <u>5.6.1</u>,
           api_revision is the 5.  Prior to 5.5.640, the format was a floating point number, like 5.00563.

           <u>perl.c</u>:<u>incpush()</u> and <u>lib/lib.pm</u> will automatically search in <u>$sitelib/.</u>. for older directories
           back to the limit specified by these api_ variables.  This is only useful if you have a perl
           library directory tree structured like the default one.  See "INSTALL" for how this works.  The
           versioned site_perl directory was introduced in 5.005, so that is the lowest possible value.  The
           version list appropriate for the current system is determined in <u>inc</u><b>_</b><u>version</u><b>_</b><u>list.U</u>.

           "XXX" To do:  Since compatibility can depend on compile time options (such as bincompat, long-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">long,&nbsp;longlong,</font>
           long, etc.) it should (perhaps) be set by Configure, but currently it isn't.  Currently, we read
           a hard-wired value from <u>patchlevel.h</u>.  Perhaps what we ought to do is take the hard-wired value
           from <u>patchlevel.h</u> but then modify it if the current Configure options warrant.  <u>patchlevel.h</u> then
           would use an #ifdef guard.

       "api_subversion"
           From <u>patchlevel.U</u>:

           The three variables, api_revision, api_version, and api_subversion, specify the version of the
           oldest perl binary compatible with the present perl.  In a full version string such as <u>5.6.1</u>,
           api_subversion is the 1.  See api_revision for full details.

       "api_version"
           From <u>patchlevel.U</u>:

           The three variables, api_revision, api_version, and api_subversion, specify the version of the
           oldest perl binary compatible with the present perl.  In a full version string such as <u>5.6.1</u>,
           api_version is the 6.  See api_revision for full details.  As a special case, 5.5.0 is rendered
           in the old-style as 5.005.  (In the 5.005_0x maintenance series, this was the only versioned
           directory in $sitelib.)

       "api_versionstring"
           From <u>patchlevel.U</u>:

           This variable combines api_revision, api_version, and api_subversion in a format such as 5.6.1
           (or 5_6_1) suitable for use as a directory name.  This is filesystem dependent.

       "ar"
           From <u>Loc.U</u>:

           This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the full pathname (if any) of the ar
           program.  After Configure runs, the value is reset to a plain "ar" and is not useful.

       "archlib"
           From <u>archlib.U</u>:

           This variable holds the name of the directory in which the user wants to put architecture-depen-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dent&nbsp;architecture-dependent</font>
           dent public library files for $package.  It is most often a local directory such as
           <u>/usr/local/lib</u>.  Programs using this variable must be prepared to deal with filename expansion.

       "archlibexp"
           From <u>archlib.U</u>:

           This variable is the same as the archlib variable, but is filename expanded at configuration
           time, for convenient use.

       "archname64"
           From <u>use64bits.U</u>:

           This variable is used for the 64-bitness part of $archname.

       "archname"
           From <u>archname.U</u>:

           This variable is a short name to characterize the current architecture.  It is used mainly to
           construct the default archlib.

       "archobjs"
           From <u>Unix.U</u>:

           This variable defines any additional objects that must be linked in with the program on this
           architecture.  On unix, it is usually empty.  It is typically used to include emulations of unix
           calls or other facilities.  For perl on <u>OS/2</u>, for example, this would include <u>os2/os2.obj</u>.

       "asctime_r_proto"
           From <u>d</u><b>_</b><u>asctime</u><b>_</b><u>r.U</u>:

           This variable encodes the prototype of asctime_r.  It is zero if d_asctime_r is undef, and one of
           the "REENTRANT_PROTO_T_ABC" macros of <u>reentr.h</u> if d_asctime_r is defined.

       "awk"
           From <u>Loc.U</u>:

           This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the full pathname (if any) of the awk
           program.  After Configure runs, the value is reset to a plain "awk" and is not useful.

       <b>b</b>


       "baserev"
           From <u>baserev.U</u>:

           The base revision level of this package, from the <u>.package</u> file.

       "bash"
           From <u>Loc.U</u>:

           This variable is defined but not used by Configure.  The value is a plain '' and is not useful.

       "bin"
           From <u>bin.U</u>:

           This variable holds the name of the directory in which the user wants to put publicly executable
           images for the package in question.  It is most often a local directory such as <u>/usr/local/bin</u>.
           Programs using this variable must be prepared to deal with <u>~name</u> substitution.

       "binexp"
           From <u>bin.U</u>:

           This is the same as the bin variable, but is filename expanded at configuration time, for use in
           your makefiles.

       "bison"
           From <u>Loc.U</u>:

           This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the full pathname (if any) of the
           bison program.  After Configure runs, the value is reset to a plain "bison" and is not useful.

       "byacc"
           From <u>Loc.U</u>:

           This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the full pathname (if any) of the
           byacc program.  After Configure runs, the value is reset to a plain "byacc" and is not useful.

       "byteorder"
           From <u>byteorder.U</u>:

           This variable holds the byte order in a "UV". In the following, larger digits indicate more sig-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nificance.&nbsp;significance.</font>
           nificance.  The variable byteorder is either 4321 on a big-endian machine, or 1234 on a lit-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tle-endian,&nbsp;little-endian,</font>
           tle-endian, or 87654321 on a Cray ... or 3412 with weird order !

       <b>c</b>


       "c" From <u>n.U</u>:

           This variable contains the \c string if that is what causes the echo command to suppress newline.
           Otherwise it is null.  Correct usage is $echo $n "prompt for a question: $c".

       "castflags"
           From <u>d</u><b>_</b><u>castneg.U</u>:

           This variable contains a flag that precise difficulties the compiler has casting odd floating
           values to unsigned long: 0 = ok 1 = couldn't cast &lt; 0 2 = couldn't cast &gt;= 0x80000000 4 =
           couldn't cast in argument expression list

       "cat"
           From <u>Loc.U</u>:

           This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the full pathname (if any) of the cat
           program.  After Configure runs, the value is reset to a plain "cat" and is not useful.

       "cc"
           From <u>cc.U</u>:

           This variable holds the name of a command to execute a C compiler which can resolve multiple
           global references that happen to have the same name.  Usual values are "cc" and "gcc".  Fervent
           "ANSI" compilers may be called "c89".  "AIX" has xlc.

       "cccdlflags"
           From <u>dlsrc.U</u>:

           This variable contains any special flags that might need to be passed with "cc -c" to compile
           modules to be used to create a shared library that will be used for dynamic loading.  For hpux,
           this should be +z.  It is up to the makefile to use it.

       "ccdlflags"
           From <u>dlsrc.U</u>:

           This variable contains any special flags that might need to be passed to cc to link with a shared
           library for dynamic loading.  It is up to the makefile to use it.  For sunos 4.1, it should be
           empty.

       "ccflags"
           From <u>ccflags.U</u>:

           This variable contains any additional C compiler flags desired by the user.  It is up to the
           Makefile to use this.

       "ccflags_uselargefiles"
           From <u>uselfs.U</u>:

           This variable contains the compiler flags needed by large file builds and added to ccflags by
           hints files.

       "ccname"
           From <u>Checkcc.U</u>:

           This can set either by hints files or by Configure.  If using gcc, this is gcc, and if not, usu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ally&nbsp;usually</font>
           ally equal to cc, unimpressive, no?  Some platforms, however, make good use of this by storing
           the flavor of the C compiler being used here.  For example if using the Sun WorkShop suite,
           ccname will be "workshop".

       "ccsymbols"
           From <u>Cppsym.U</u>:

           The variable contains the symbols defined by the C compiler alone.  The symbols defined by cpp or
           by cc when it calls cpp are not in this list, see cppsymbols and cppccsymbols.  The list is a
           space-separated list of symbol=value tokens.

       "ccversion"
           From <u>Checkcc.U</u>:

           This can set either by hints files or by Configure.  If using a (non-gcc) vendor cc, this vari-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able&nbsp;variable</font>
           able may contain a version for the compiler.

       "cf_by"
           From <u>cf</u><b>_</b><u>who.U</u>:

           Login name of the person who ran the Configure script and answered the questions. This is used to
           tag both <u>config.sh</u> and <u>config</u><b>_</b><u>h.SH</u>.

       "cf_email"
           From <u>cf</u><b>_</b><u>email.U</u>:

           Electronic mail address of the person who ran Configure. This can be used by units that require

           rated by spaces.  This is only useful if you have a perl library directory tree structured like
           the default one.  See "INSTALL" for how this works.  The versioned site_perl directory was intro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">duced&nbsp;introduced</font>
           duced in 5.005, so that is the lowest possible value.

           age.  For most users, this is the same as prefix.  However, it is useful for installing the soft-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ware&nbsp;software</font>
           ware into a different (usually temporary) location after which it can be bundled up and moved
           somehow to the final location specified by prefix.

           for portability.

       "installstyle"
           From <u>installstyle.U</u>:

           This variable describes the "style" of the perl installation.  This is intended to be useful for
           tools that need to manipulate entire perl distributions.  Perl itself doesn't use this to find
           its libraries -- the library directories are stored directly in <u>Config.pm</u>.  Currently, there are
           only two styles:  "lib" and <u>lib/perl5</u>.  The default library locations (e.g. privlib, sitelib) are
           either <u>$prefix/lib</u> or <u>$prefix/lib/perl5</u>.  The former is useful if $prefix is a directory dedi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cated&nbsp;dedicated</font>
           cated to perl (e.g. <u>/opt/perl</u>), while the latter is useful if $prefix is shared by many packages,
           e.g. if $prefix=<u>/usr/local</u>.

           Unfortunately, while this "style" variable is used to set defaults for all three directory hier-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">archies&nbsp;hierarchies</font>
           archies (core, vendor, and site), there is no guarantee that the same style is actually appropri-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ate&nbsp;appropriate</font>
           ate for all those directories.  For example, $prefix might be <u>/opt/perl</u>, but $siteprefix might be
           <u>/usr/local</u>.  (Perhaps, in retrospect, the "lib" style should never have been supported, but it
           did seem like a nice idea at the time.)

           The situation is even less clear for tools such as MakeMaker that can be used to install addi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tional&nbsp;additional</font>
           tional modules into non-standard places.  For example, if a user intends to install a module into
           a private directory (perhaps by setting "PREFIX" on the <u>Makefile.PL</u> command line), then there is
           no reason to assume that the Configure-time $installstyle setting will be relevant for that "PRE-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">FIX".&nbsp;"PREFIX".</font>
           FIX".

           This may later be extended to include other information, so be careful with pattern-matching on
           the results.

           For compatibility with <u>perl5.005</u> and earlier, the default setting is based on whether or not
           $prefix contains the string "perl".

       "installusrbinperl"
           From <u>instubperl.U</u>:

           This variable tells whether Perl should be installed also as <u>/usr/bin/perl</u> in addition to

           From <u>lseektype.U</u>:

           This variable defines lseektype to be something like off_t, long, or whatever type is used to
           declare lseek offset's type in the kernel (which also appears to be lseek's return type).

       "lseektype"
           From <u>lseektype.U</u>:

           This variable defines lseektype to be something like off_t, long, or whatever type is used to

           Some versions of "make" set the variable "MAKE".  Others do not.  This variable contains the
           string to be included in <u>Makefile.SH</u> so that "MAKE" is set if needed, and not if not needed.
           Possible values are:

           make_set_make="MAKE=$make"    # if it doesn't.

           This uses a comment character to distinguish a "set" value (from a previous <u>config.sh</u> or Config-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ure&nbsp;Configure</font>
           ure "-D" option) from an uncomputed value.

       "man1dir"
           From <u>man1dir.U</u>:

           This variable contains the name of the directory in which manual source pages are to be put.  It
           is the responsibility of the <u>Makefile.SH</u> to get the value of this into the proper command.  You
           must be prepared to do the <u>~name</u> expansion yourself.

       "man1direxp"
           From <u>man1dir.U</u>:

           This variable is the same as the man1dir variable, but is filename expanded at configuration

           This variable can be used to establish a fallthrough for the cases where nm fails to find a sym-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">bol.&nbsp;symbol.</font>
           bol.  If usenm is false or usenm is true and mistrustnm is false, this variable has no effect.
           If usenm is true and mistrustnm is "compile", a test program will be compiled to try to find any
           symbol that can't be located via nm lookup.  If mistrustnm is "run", the test program will be run
           as well as being compiled.

           From <u>Loc.U</u>:

           This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the full pathname (if any) of the more
           program.  After Configure runs, the value is reset to a plain "more" and is not useful.

       "multiarch"
           From <u>multiarch.U</u>:

           This variable conditionally defines the "MULTIARCH" symbol which signifies the presence of multi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">platform&nbsp;multiplatform</font>
           platform files.  This is normally set by hints files.

       "mv"
           From <u>Loc.U</u>:

           This variable is defined but not used by Configure.  The value is a plain '' and is not useful.

       "myarchname"
           From <u>archname.U</u>:

           This variable holds the architecture name computed by Configure in a previous run. It is not
           intended to be perused by any user and should never be set in a hint file.

       "mydomain"
           From <u>myhostname.U</u>:

           This variable contains the eventual value of the "MYDOMAIN" symbol, which is the domain of the
           host the program is going to run on.  The domain must be appended to myhostname to form a com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">plete&nbsp;complete</font>
           plete host name.  The dot comes with mydomain, and need not be supplied by the program.

       "myhostname"
           From <u>myhostname.U</u>:

           This variable contains the eventual value of the "MYHOSTNAME" symbol, which is the name of the
           host the program is going to run on.  The domain is not kept with hostname, but must be gotten
           from mydomain.  The dot comes with mydomain, and need not be supplied by the program.

       "myuname"
           From <u>Oldconfig.U</u>:

           The output of "uname -a" if available, otherwise the hostname. On Xenix, pseudo variables assign-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ments&nbsp;assignments</font>
           ments in the output are stripped, thank you. The whole thing is then lower-cased.

       <b>n</b>


       "n" From <u>n.U</u>:

           This variable contains the "-n" flag if that is what causes the echo command to suppress newline.
           Otherwise it is null.  Correct usage is $echo $n "prompt for a question: $c".

       "need_va_copy"
           From <u>need</u><b>_</b><u>va</u><b>_</b><u>copy.U</u>:

           This symbol, if defined, indicates that the system stores the variable argument list datatype,
           va_list, in a format that cannot be copied by simple assignment, so that some other means must be
           used when copying is required.  As such systems vary in their provision (or non-provision) of
           copying mechanisms, <u>handy.h</u> defines a platform- "independent" macro, Perl_va_copy(src, dst), to
           do the job.

       "netdb_hlen_type"
           From <u>netdbtype.U</u>:

           This variable holds the type used for the 2nd argument to <u>gethostbyaddr()</u>.  Usually, this is int

       "netdb_name_type"
           From <u>netdbtype.U</u>:

           This variable holds the type used for the argument to <u>gethostbyname()</u>.  Usually, this is char *
           or const char *.  This is only useful if you have <u>gethostbyname()</u>, naturally.

       "netdb_net_type"
           From <u>netdbtype.U</u>:

           This variable holds the type used for the 1st argument to <u>getnetbyaddr()</u>.  Usually, this is int

       "nm"
           From <u>Loc.U</u>:

           This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the full pathname (if any) of the nm
           program.  After Configure runs, the value is reset to a plain "nm" and is not useful.

           From <u>usenm.U</u>:

           This variable holds the options that may be necessary for nm.

       "nm_so_opt"
           From <u>usenm.U</u>:

           This variable holds the options that may be necessary for nm to work on a shared library but that
           can not be used on an archive library.  Currently, this is only used by Linux, where nm --dynamic
           is *required* to get symbols from an "ELF" library which has been stripped, but nm --dynamic is
           *fatal* on an archive library.  Maybe Linux should just always set usenm=false.

       "nonxs_ext"
           From <u>Extensions.U</u>:

           This variable holds a list of all non-xs extensions included in the package.  All of them will be

       <b>o</b>


       "o_nonblock"
           From <u>nblock</u><b>_</b><u>io.U</u>:

           This variable bears the symbol value to be used during <u>open()</u> or <u>fcntl()</u> to turn on non-blocking
           I/O for a file descriptor. If you wish to switch between blocking and non-blocking, you may try
           ioctl("FIOSNBIO") instead, but that is only supported by some devices.

       "obj_ext"
           From <u>Unix.U</u>:

           This is an old synonym for _o.

       "old_pthread_create_joinable"

           This variable is "true" if the components of libraries must be ordered (with `lorder $* | tsort`)
           before placing them in an archive.  Set to "false" if ranlib or ar can generate random libraries.

       "osname"
           From <u>Oldconfig.U</u>:

           This variable contains the operating system name (e.g. sunos, solaris, hpux, etc.).  It can be
           useful later on for setting defaults.  Any spaces are replaced with underscores.  It is set to a
           null string if we can't figure it out.

       "osvers"
           From <u>Oldconfig.U</u>:

           This variable contains the operating system version (e.g.  4.1.3, 5.2, etc.).  It is primarily
           used for helping select an appropriate hints file, but might be useful elsewhere for setting
           defaults.  It is set to '' if we can't figure it out.  We try to be flexible about how much of
           the version number to keep, e.g. if 4.1.1, 4.1.2, and 4.1.3 are essentially the same for this
           package, hints files might just be <u>os</u><b>_</b><u>4.0</u> or <u>os</u><b>_</b><u>4.1</u>, etc., not keeping separate files for each
           little release.

       "otherlibdirs"

           This variable contains a colon-separated set of paths for the perl binary to search for addi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tional&nbsp;additional</font>
           tional library files or modules.  These directories will be tacked to the end of @"INC".  Perl
           will automatically search below each path for version- and architecture-specific directories.
           See inc_version_list for more details.  A value of " " means "none" and is used to preserve this
           value for the next run through Configure.

       "package"
           From <u>package.U</u>:

           This is the Perl patch level, a numeric change identifier, as defined by whichever source code
           maintenance system is used to maintain the patches; currently Perforce.  It does not correlate
           with the Perl version numbers or the maintenance versus development dichotomy except by also
           being increasing.

       "PERL_REVISION"
           From <u>Oldsyms.U</u>:

           In a Perl version number such as 5.6.2, this is the 5.  This value is manually set in <u>patch</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">level.h&nbsp;patchlevel.h</font>

           From <u>perlpath.U</u>:

           This variable contains the eventual value of the "PERLPATH" symbol, which contains the name of
           the perl interpreter to be used in shell scripts and in the "eval "exec"" idiom.  This variable
           is not necessarily the pathname of the file containing the perl interpreter; you must append the
           executable extension (_exe) if it is not already present.  Note that Perl code that runs during
           the Perl build process cannot reference this variable, as Perl may not have been installed, or

       "uidtype"
           From <u>uidtype.U</u>:

           This variable defines Uid_t to be something like uid_t, int, ushort, or whatever type is used to
           declare user ids in the kernel.

       "uname"
           From <u>Loc.U</u>:

           This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the full pathname (if any) of the

       "uniq"
           From <u>Loc.U</u>:

           This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the full pathname (if any) of the uniq
           program.  After Configure runs, the value is reset to a plain "uniq" and is not useful.

       "uquadtype"
           From <u>quadtype.U</u>:

           This variable defines Uquad_t to be something like unsigned long, unsigned int, unsigned long

       "use64bitall"
           From <u>use64bits.U</u>:

           This variable conditionally defines the USE_64_BIT_ALL symbol, and indicates that 64-bit integer
           types should be used when available.  The maximal possible 64-bitness is employed: LP64 or ILP64,
           meaning that you will be able to use more than 2 gigabytes of memory.  This mode is even more
           binary incompatible than USE_64_BIT_INT. You may not be able to run the resulting executable in a
           32-bit "CPU" at all or you may need at least to reboot your "OS" to 64-bit mode.

       "use64bitint"
           From <u>use64bits.U</u>:

           This variable conditionally defines the USE_64_BIT_INT symbol, and indicates that 64-bit integer
           types should be used when available.  The minimal possible 64-bitness is employed, just enough to
           get 64-bit integers into Perl.  This may mean using for example "long longs", while your memory
           may still be limited to 2 gigabytes.

           lations.

       "usemorebits"
           From <u>usemorebits.U</u>:

           This variable conditionally defines the "USE_MORE_BITS" symbol, and indicates that explicit
           64-bit interfaces and long doubles should be used when available.

       "usemultiplicity"

           This variable conditionally defines the "MULTIPLICITY" symbol, and indicates that Perl should be
           built to use multiplicity.

       "usemymalloc"
           From <u>mallocsrc.U</u>:

           This variable contains y if the malloc that comes with this package is desired over the system's
           version of malloc.  People often include special versions of malloc for effiency, but such ver-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sions&nbsp;versions</font>
           sions are often less portable.  See also mallocsrc and mallocobj.  If this is "y", then -lmalloc
           is removed from $libs.

       "usenm"
           From <u>usenm.U</u>:

           This variable contains "true" or "false" depending whether the nm extraction is wanted or not.

       "useopcode"
           From <u>Extensions.U</u>:

           This variable holds either "true" or "false" to indicate whether the Opcode extension should be

           extension from the Configure command line.

       "useperlio"
           From <u>useperlio.U</u>:

           This variable conditionally defines the "USE_PERLIO" symbol, and indicates that the PerlIO
           abstraction should be used throughout.

       "useposix"
           From <u>Extensions.U</u>:

           This variable holds either "true" or "false" to indicate whether the "POSIX" extension should be
           used.  The sole use for this currently is to allow an easy mechanism for hints files to indicate
           that "POSIX" will not compile on a particular system.

       "usereentrant"
           From <u>usethreads.U</u>:

           This variable conditionally defines the "USE_REENTRANT_API" symbol, which indicates that the
           thread code may try to use the various _r versions of library functions.  This is only poten-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tially&nbsp;potentially</font>
           tially meaningful if usethreads is set and is very experimental, it is not even prompted for.

           This variable is set to true when the user agrees to use sfio.  It is set to false when sfio is
           not available or when the user explicitely requests not to use sfio.  It is here primarily so
           that command-line settings can override the auto-detection of d_sfio without running into a "WHOA
           THERE".

       "useshrplib"
           From <u>libperl.U</u>:

           This variable is set to "true" if the user wishes to build a shared libperl, and "false" other-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">wise.&nbsp;otherwise.</font>
           wise.
