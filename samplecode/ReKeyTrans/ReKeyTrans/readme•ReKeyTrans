    OK, intrepid developer-like objects, we admit it! We don't    know where this sample came from and we don't know anything about    its original intent. However, since we're super-geniuses, we were    able to make up a plausible story.    Say you're a terminal emulator. And you have to run on a Mac Plus.    With us so far? Now, the Plus doesn't have a control key, but you'd    really like to pretend it does. So you use the option key. Here's where    the problem comes in.    The default behavior of KeyTrans is to support umlauts and other    fun letter modifiers by making option-U, for example, into a    "dead" key which results in no keystrokes but modifies subsequent    keystrokes. So when you type option-U followed by a u, you get: 'Ÿ'.    And there was much rejoicing, except in Terminal Emulator Land.    There, the people were downtrodden, as they had no way to tell    their UNIX command line to clear.    So, you ask, why don't I just install my own keymap? Well, that'd    be swell for all us qwerty people, but the people who type on those    keyboards with all the keys rearranged would really hate it (Hi Quinn!)    and they'd have to relearn the icky qwerty (try typing that 5 times    fast) layout again after they'd gone to all the effort of rearranging    their keycaps on the keyboard so they'd feel funny (they're not all    the same shape, you know). So...        This sample shows how to patch KeyTrans in order to completely    ignore the dead-key processing that goes on and lets you type those    fancy accented characters. You're back in 7-bit ASCII days now,    bucko. Enjoy.
