<b>NAME</b>
       smbd - server to provide SMB/CIFS services to clients

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       smbd [-D] [-F] [-S] [-i] [-h] [-V] [-b] [-d &lt;debug level&gt;] [-l &lt;log directory&gt;] [-p &lt;port <!-- a -->number(s)<!-- /a -->&gt;]
        [-P &lt;profiling level&gt;] [-O &lt;socket option&gt;] [-s &lt;configuration file&gt;]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       This program is part of the <a href="../man7/samba.7.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/7/samba"><b>samba</b>(7)</a> suite.

       smbd is the server daemon that provides filesharing and printing services  to  Windows  clients.  The
       server  provides  filespace and printer services to clients using the SMB (or CIFS) protocol. This is
       compatible with the LanManager protocol, and can service LanManager clients. These  include  MSCLIENT
       3.0  for DOS, Windows for Workgroups, Windows 95/98/ME, Windows NT, Windows 2000, OS/2, DAVE for Mac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">intosh,&nbsp;Macintosh,</font>
       intosh, and smbfs for Linux.

       An extensive description of the services that the server can provide is given in the man page for the
       configuration  file controlling the attributes of those services (see <a href="../man5/smb.conf.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/smb.conf"><b>smb.conf</b>(5)</a>. This man page will
       not describe the services, but will concentrate on the administrative aspects of running the  server.

       Please  note  that  there  are  significant  security  implications  to  running this server, and the
       <a href="../man5/smb.conf.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/smb.conf"><b>smb.conf</b>(5)</a> manual page should be regarded as mandatory reading before proceeding with  installation.

       A  session  is created whenever a client requests one. Each client gets a copy of the server for each
       session. This copy then services all connections made by the client during  that  session.  When  all
       connections from its client are closed, the copy of the server for that client terminates.

       The  configuration  file, and any files that it includes, are automatically reloaded every minute, if
       they change. You can force a reload by sending a SIGHUP to the server.  Reloading  the  configuration
       file  will  not  affect  connections to any service that is already established. Either the user will
       have to disconnect from the service, or smbd killed and restarted.

<b>OPTIONS</b>
       -D
          If specified, this parameter causes the server to operate as a daemon. That is, it detaches itself
          and  runs  in the background, fielding requests on the appropriate port. Operating the server as a
          daemon is the recommended way of running smbd for servers that provide more than casual  use  file
          and print services. This switch is assumed if smbd is executed on the command line of a shell.

       -F
          If  specified,  this parameter causes the main smbd process to not daemonize, i.e. double-fork and
          disassociate with the terminal. Child processes are still created as normal to service  each  con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nection&nbsp;connection</font>
          nection  request,  but the main process does not exit. This operation mode is suitable for running
          smbd under process supervisors such as supervise and svscan from Daniel J. Bernstein's daemontools
          package, or the AIX process monitor.

       -S
          If specified, this parameter causes smbd to log to standard output rather than a file.

       -i
          If  this parameter is specified it causes the server to run "interactively", not as a daemon, even
          if the server is executed on the command line of a  shell.  Setting  this  parameter  negates  the
          implicit deamon mode when run from the command line.  smbd also logs to standard output, as if the
          -S parameter had been given.

       -V
          Prints the program version number.

       -s &lt;configuration file&gt;
          The file specified contains the configuration details required by the server. The  information  in
          this  file  includes  server-specific  information  such  as what printcap file to use, as well as
          descriptions of all the services that the server is to provide. See <u>smb.conf</u> for more information.
          The default configuration file name is determined at compile time.

       -d|--debuglevel=level
          <u>level</u> is an integer from 0 to 10. The default value if this parameter is not specified is zero.

          The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log files about the activities of the
          server. At level 0, only critical errors and serious warnings will be logged. Level 1 is a reason-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able&nbsp;reasonable</font>
          able  level  for  day-to-day running - it generates a small amount of information about operations
          carried out.

          Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and should only be used when inves-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tigating&nbsp;investigating</font>
          tigating  a  problem.  Levels  above  3  are designed for use only by developers and generate HUGE
          amounts of log data, most of which is extremely cryptic.

          Note that specifying this parameter here will override the

          parameter in the <u>smb.conf</u> file.

       -l|--logfile=logdirectory
          Base directory name for log/debug files. The extension <b>".progname"</b> will be appended (e.g. log.smb-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">client,&nbsp;log.smbclient,</font>
          client, log.smbd, etc...). The log file is never removed by the client.

       -h|--help
          Print a summary of command line options.

       -b
          Prints information about how Samba was built.

       -p|--port&lt;port <!-- a -->number(s)<!-- /a -->&gt;
          <u>port</u>  <!-- a --><u>number(s)</u><!-- /a --><u></u> is a space or comma-separated list of TCP ports smbd should listen on. The default
          value is taken from the ports parameter in <u>smb.conf</u>

          The default ports are 139 (used for SMB over NetBIOS over TCP) and port 445 (used  for  plain  SMB
          over TCP).

       -P|--profiling-level&lt;profiling level&gt;
          <u>profiling</u>  <u>level</u>  is  a number specifying the level of profiling data to be collected. 0 turns off
          profiling, 1 turns on counter profiling only, 2 turns on complete profiling, and 3 resets all pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">filing&nbsp;profiling</font>
          filing data.

<b>FILES</b>
       <u>/etc/inetd.conf</u>
          If  the  server  is  to  be  run by the inetd meta-daemon, this file must contain suitable startup
          information for the meta-daemon.

       <u>/etc/rc</u>
          or whatever initialization script your system uses).

          If running the server as a daemon at startup, this  file  will  need  to  contain  an  appropriate
          startup sequence for the server.

       <u>/etc/services</u>
          If  running the server via the meta-daemon inetd, this file must contain a mapping of service name
          (e.g., netbios-ssn) to service port (e.g., 139) and protocol type (e.g., tcp).

       <u>/usr/local/samba/lib/smb.conf</u>
          This is the default location of the <a href="../man5/smb.conf.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/smb.conf"><b>smb.conf</b>(5)</a> server configuration  file.  Other  common  places
          that systems install this file are <u>/usr/samba/lib/smb.conf</u> and <u>/etc/samba/smb.conf</u>.

          This  file  describes all the services the server is to make available to clients. See <a href="../man5/smb.conf.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/smb.conf"><b>smb.conf</b>(5)</a>
          for more information.

<b>LIMITATIONS</b>
       On some systems smbd cannot change uid back to root after a setuid() call. Such  systems  are  called
       trapdoor uid systems. If you have such a system, you will be unable to connect from a client (such as
       a PC) as two different users at once. Attempts to connect the  second  user  will  result  in  access
       denied or similar.

<b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b>
       <b>PRINTER</b>
          If  no  printer  name  is specified to printable services, most systems will use the value of this
          variable (or <b>lp</b> if this variable is not defined) as the name of the printer to use.  This  is  not
          specific to the server, however.

<b>PAM</b> <b>INTERACTION</b>
       Samba  uses  PAM  for authentication (when presented with a plaintext password), for account checking
       (is this account disabled?) and for session management. The degree too which samba  supports  PAM  is
       restricted  by  the  limitations  of the SMB protocol and the obey pam restrictions <a href="../man5/smb.conf.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/smb.conf"><b>smb.conf</b>(5)</a> para-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mater.&nbsp;paramater.</font>
       mater. When this is set, the following restrictions apply:

         <b>Account</b> <b>Validation</b>: All accesses to a samba server are checked against PAM to see if  the  account
          is  vaild,  not  disabled  and  is permitted to login at this time. This also applies to encrypted
          logins.

         <b>Session</b> <b>Management</b>: When not using share level secuirty, users  must  pass  PAM's  session  checks
          before  access  is granted. Note however, that this is bypassed in share level secuirty. Note also
          that some older pam configuration files may need a line added for session support.

<b>VERSION</b>
       This man page is correct for version 3.0 of the Samba suite.

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       Most diagnostics issued by the server are logged in a specified log file. The log file name is speci-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fied&nbsp;specified</font>
       fied at compile time, but may be overridden on the command line.

       The  number and nature of diagnostics available depends on the debug level used by the server. If you
       have problems, set the debug level to 3 and peruse the log files.

       Most messages are reasonably self-explanatory. Unfortunately, at the time this man page was  created,
       there  are  too  many  diagnostics  available in the source code to warrant describing each and every
       diagnostic. At this stage your best bet is still to grep the source code and inspect  the  conditions
       that gave rise to the diagnostics you are seeing.

<b>TDB</b> <b>FILES</b>
       Samba stores it's data in several TDB (Trivial Database) files, usually located in <u>/var/lib/samba</u>.

       (*) information persistent across restarts (but not necessarily important to backup).

       wins.dat*
          wins database when 'wins support = yes'

<b>SIGNALS</b>
       Sending  the  smbd  a  SIGHUP  will cause it to reload its <u>smb.conf</u> configuration file within a short
       period of time.

       To shut down a user's smbd process it is recommended that SIGKILL (-9) <b>NOT</b> be used, except as a  last
       resort,  as this may leave the shared memory area in an inconsistent state. The safe way to terminate
       an smbd is to send it a SIGTERM (-15) signal and wait for it to die on its own.

       The debug log level of smbd may be raised or lowered using <a href="../man1/smbcontrol.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/smbcontrol"><b>smbcontrol</b>(1)</a> program (SIGUSR[1|2] signals
       are  no  longer  used  since  Samba 2.2). This is to allow transient problems to be diagnosed, whilst
       still running at a normally low log level.

       Note that as the signal handlers send a debug write, they are not re-entrant in smbd. This you should
       wait  until  smbd is in a state of waiting for an incoming SMB before issuing them. It is possible to
       make the signal handlers safe by un-blocking the signals before the select call and re-blocking  them
       after, however this would affect performance.

<b>AUTHOR</b>
       The  original  Samba  software  and  related  utilities were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now
       developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel  is  devel-
       oped.

       The  original  Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer. The man page sources were converted to YODL
       format    (another    excellent    piece    of     Open     Source     software,     available     at
       <a href="ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/)">ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/)</a> and updated for the Samba 2.0 release by Jeremy Allison. The conver-
       sion to DocBook for Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter. The conversion to DocBook XML 4.2 for  Samba
       3.0 was done by Alexander Bokovoy.
