Devel::Peek(3pm)                      Perl Programmers Reference Guide                      Devel::Peek(3pm)



<b>NAME</b>
       Devel::Peek - A data debugging tool for the XS programmer

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
               use Devel::Peek;
               Dump( $a );
               Dump( $a, 5 );
               DumpArray( 5, $a, $b, ... );
               mstat "Point 5";

               use Devel::Peek ':opd=st';

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       Devel::Peek contains functions which allows raw Perl datatypes to be manipulated from a Perl script.
       This is used by those who do XS programming to check that the data they are sending from C to Perl
       looks as they think it should look.  The trick, then, is to know what the raw datatype is supposed to
       look like when it gets to Perl.  This document offers some tips and hints to describe good and bad
       raw data.

       It is very possible that this document will fall far short of being useful to the casual reader.  The
       reader is expected to understand the material in the first few sections of perlguts.

       Devel::Peek supplies a "Dump()" function which can dump a raw Perl datatype, and "mstat("marker")"
       function to report on memory usage (if perl is compiled with corresponding option).  The function
       <u>DeadCode()</u> provides statistics on the data "frozen" into inactive "CV".  Devel::Peek also supplies
       "SvREFCNT()", "SvREFCNT_inc()", and "SvREFCNT_dec()" which can query, increment, and decrement refer-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ence&nbsp;reference</font>
       ence counts on SVs.  This document will take a passive, and safe, approach to data debugging and for
       that it will describe only the "Dump()" function.

       Function "DumpArray()" allows dumping of multiple values (useful when you need to analyze returns of
       functions).

       The global variable $Devel::Peek::pv_limit can be set to limit the number of character printed in
       various string values.  Setting it to 0 means no limit.

       If "use Devel::Peek" directive has a ":opd=FLAGS" argument, this switches on debugging of opcode dis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">patch.&nbsp;dispatch.</font>
       patch.  "FLAGS" should be a combination of "s", "t", and "P" (see <b>-D</b> flags in perlrun).  ":opd" is a
       shortcut for ":opd=st".

       <b>Runtime</b> <b>debugging</b>

       "CvGV($cv)" return one of the globs associated to a subroutine reference $cv.

       <u>debug</u><b>_</b><u>flags()</u> returns a string representation of $^D (similar to what is allowed for <b>-D</b> flag).  When
       called with a numeric argument, sets $^D to the corresponding value.  When called with an argument of
       the form "flags-flags", set on/off bits of $^D corresponding to letters before/after "-".  (The
       returned value is for $^D before the modification.)

       <u>runops</u><b>_</b><u>debug()</u> returns true if the current <u>opcode</u> <u>dispatcher</u> is the debugging one.  When called with
       an argument, switches to debugging or non-debugging dispatcher depending on the argument (active for
       newly-entered subs/etc only).  (The returned value is for the dispatcher before the modification.)

       <b>Memory</b> <b>footprint</b> <b>debugging</b>

       When perl is compiled with support for memory footprint debugging (default with Perl's <u>malloc()</u>),
       Devel::Peek provides an access to this API.

       Use <u>mstat()</u> function to emit a memory state statistic to the terminal.  For more information on the
       format of output of <u>mstat()</u> see "Using $ENV{PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS}" in perldebguts.

       Three additional functions allow access to this statistic from Perl.  First, use "mstats_fill-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">hash(%hash)"&nbsp;"mstats_fillhash(%hash)"</font>
       hash(%hash)" to get the information contained in the output of <u>mstat()</u> into %hash. The field of this
       hash are

         minbucket nbuckets sbrk_good sbrk_slack sbrked_remains sbrks start_slack
         topbucket topbucket_ev topbucket_odd total total_chain total_sbrk totfree

       Two additional fields "free", "used" contain array references which provide per-bucket count of free
       and used chunks.  Two other fields "mem_size", "available_size" contain array references which pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">vide&nbsp;provide</font>
       vide the information about the allocated size and usable size of chunks in each bucket.  Again, see
       "Using $ENV{PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS}" in perldebguts for details.

       Keep in mind that only the first several "odd-numbered" buckets are used, so the information on size
       of the "odd-numbered" buckets which are not used is probably meaningless.

       The information in

        mem_size available_size minbucket nbuckets

       is the property of a particular build of perl, and does not depend on the current process.  If you do
       not provide the optional argument to the functions <u>mstats</u><b>_</b><u>fillhash()</u>, <u>fill</u><b>_</b><u>mstats()</u>, <u>mstats2hash()</u>,
       then the information in fields "mem_size", "available_size" is not updated.

       "fill_mstats($buf)" is a much cheaper call (both speedwise and memory-wise) which collects the
       statistic into $buf in machine-readable form.  At a later moment you may need to call
       "mstats2hash($buf, %hash)" to use this information to fill %hash.

       All three APIs "fill_mstats($buf)", "mstats_fillhash(%hash)", and "mstats2hash($buf, %hash)" are
       designed to allocate no memory if used <u>the</u> <u>second</u> <u>time</u> on the same $buf and/or %hash.

       So, if you want to collect memory info in a cycle, you may call

         $#buf = 999;
         fill_mstats($_) for @buf;
         mstats_fillhash(%report, 1);          # Static info too

         foreach (@buf) {
           # Do something...
           fill_mstats $_;                     # Collect statistic
         }
         foreach (@buf) {
           mstats2hash($_, %report);           # Preserve static info
           # Do something with %report
         }

<b>EXAMPLES</b>
       The following examples don't attempt to show everything as that would be a monumental task, and,
       frankly, we don't want this manpage to be an internals document for Perl.  The examples do demon-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">strate&nbsp;demonstrate</font>
       strate some basics of the raw Perl datatypes, and should suffice to get most determined people on
       their way.  There are no guidewires or safety nets, nor blazed trails, so be prepared to travel alone
       from this point and on and, if at all possible, don't fall into the quicksand (it's bad for busi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ness).&nbsp;business).</font>
       ness).

       Oh, one final bit of advice: take perlguts with you.  When you return we expect to see it
       well-thumbed.

       <b>A</b> <b>simple</b> <b>scalar</b> <b>string</b>

       Let's begin by looking a simple scalar which is holding a string.

               use Devel::Peek;
               $a = "hello";
               Dump $a;

       The output:

               SV = PVIV(0xbc288)
                 REFCNT = 1
                 FLAGS = (POK,pPOK)
                 IV = 0
                 PV = 0xb2048 "hello"\0
                 CUR = 5
                 LEN = 6

       This says $a is an SV, a scalar.  The scalar is a PVIV, a string.  Its reference count is 1.  It has
       the "POK" flag set, meaning its current PV field is valid.  Because POK is set we look at the PV item
       to see what is in the scalar.  The \0 at the end indicate that this PV is properly NUL-terminated.
       If the FLAGS had been IOK we would look at the IV item.  CUR indicates the number of characters in
       the PV.  LEN indicates the number of bytes requested for the PV (one more than CUR, in this case,
       because LEN includes an extra byte for the end-of-string marker).

       <b>A</b> <b>simple</b> <b>scalar</b> <b>number</b>

       If the scalar contains a number the raw SV will be leaner.

               use Devel::Peek;
               $a = 42;
               Dump $a;

       The output:

               SV = IV(0xbc818)
                 REFCNT = 1
                 FLAGS = (IOK,pIOK)
                 IV = 42

       This says $a is an SV, a scalar.  The scalar is an IV, a number.  Its reference count is 1.  It has
       the "IOK" flag set, meaning it is currently being evaluated as a number.  Because IOK is set we look
       at the IV item to see what is in the scalar.

       <b>A</b> <b>simple</b> <b>scalar</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>extra</b> <b>reference</b>

       If the scalar from the previous example had an extra reference:

               use Devel::Peek;
               $a = 42;
               $b = \$a;
               Dump $a;

       The output:

               SV = IV(0xbe860)
                 REFCNT = 2
                 FLAGS = (IOK,pIOK)
                 IV = 42

       Notice that this example differs from the previous example only in its reference count.  Compare this
       to the next example, where we dump $b instead of $a.

       <b>A</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>scalar</b>

       This shows what a reference looks like when it references a simple scalar.

               use Devel::Peek;
               $a = 42;
               $b = \$a;
               Dump $b;

       The output:

               SV = RV(0xf041c)
                 REFCNT = 1
                 FLAGS = (ROK)
                 RV = 0xbab08
               SV = IV(0xbe860)
                 REFCNT = 2
                 FLAGS = (IOK,pIOK)
                 IV = 42

       Starting from the top, this says $b is an SV.  The scalar is an RV, a reference.  It has the "ROK"
       flag set, meaning it is a reference.  Because ROK is set we have an RV item rather than an IV or PV.
       Notice that Dump follows the reference and shows us what $b was referencing.  We see the same $a that
       we found in the previous example.

       Note that the value of "RV" coincides with the numbers we see when we stringify $b. The addresses
       inside <u>RV()</u> and <u>IV()</u> are addresses of "X***" structure which holds the current state of an "SV". This
       address may change during lifetime of an SV.

       <b>A</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>array</b>

       This shows what a reference to an array looks like.

               use Devel::Peek;
               $a = [42];
               Dump $a;

       The output:

               SV = RV(0xf041c)
                 REFCNT = 1
                 FLAGS = (ROK)
                 RV = 0xb2850
               SV = PVAV(0xbd448)
                 REFCNT = 1
                 FLAGS = ()
                 IV = 0
                 NV = 0
                 ARRAY = 0xb2048
                 ALLOC = 0xb2048
                 FILL = 0
                 MAX = 0
                 ARYLEN = 0x0
                 FLAGS = (REAL)
               Elt No. 0 0xb5658
               SV = IV(0xbe860)
                 REFCNT = 1
                 FLAGS = (IOK,pIOK)
                 IV = 42

       This says $a is an SV and that it is an RV.  That RV points to another SV which is a PVAV, an array.
       The array has one element, element zero, which is another SV. The field "FILL" above indicates the
       last element in the array, similar to "$#$a".

       If $a pointed to an array of two elements then we would see the following.

               use Devel::Peek 'Dump';
               $a = [42,24];
               Dump $a;

       The output:

               SV = RV(0xf041c)
                 REFCNT = 1
                 FLAGS = (ROK)
                 RV = 0xb2850
               SV = PVAV(0xbd448)
                 REFCNT = 1
                 FLAGS = ()
                 IV = 0
                 NV = 0
                 ARRAY = 0xb2048
                 ALLOC = 0xb2048
                 FILL = 0
                 MAX = 0
                 ARYLEN = 0x0
                 FLAGS = (REAL)
               Elt No. 0  0xb5658
               SV = IV(0xbe860)
                 REFCNT = 1
                 FLAGS = (IOK,pIOK)
                 IV = 42
               Elt No. 1  0xb5680
               SV = IV(0xbe818)
                 REFCNT = 1
                 FLAGS = (IOK,pIOK)
                 IV = 24

       Note that "Dump" will not report <u>all</u> the elements in the array, only several first (depending on how
       deep it already went into the report tree).

       <b>A</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>hash</b>

       The following shows the raw form of a reference to a hash.

               use Devel::Peek;
               $a = {hello=&gt;42};
               Dump $a;

       The output:

               SV = RV(0x8177858) at 0x816a618
                 REFCNT = 1
                 FLAGS = (ROK)
                 RV = 0x814fc10
                 SV = PVHV(0x8167768) at 0x814fc10
                   REFCNT = 1
                   FLAGS = (SHAREKEYS)
                   IV = 1
                   NV = 0
                   ARRAY = 0x816c5b8  (0:7, 1:1)
                   hash quality = 100.0%
                   KEYS = 1
                   FILL = 1
                   MAX = 7
                   RITER = -1
                   EITER = 0x0
                   Elt "hello" HASH = 0xc8fd181b
                   SV = IV(0x816c030) at 0x814fcf4
                     REFCNT = 1
                     FLAGS = (IOK,pIOK)
                     IV = 42

       This shows $a is a reference pointing to an SV.  That SV is a PVHV, a hash. Fields RITER and EITER
       are used by "each".

       The "quality" of a hash is defined as the total number of comparisons needed to access every element
       once, relative to the expected number needed for a random hash. The value can go over 100%.

       The total number of comparisons is equal to the sum of the squares of the number of entries in each
       bucket.  For a random hash of "&lt;n"&gt; keys into "&lt;k"&gt; buckets, the expected value is:

                       n + n(n-1)/2k

       <b>Dumping</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>array</b> <b>or</b> <b>hash</b>

       The "Dump()" function, by default, dumps up to 4 elements from a toplevel array or hash.  This number
       can be increased by supplying a second argument to the function.

               use Devel::Peek;
               $a = [10,11,12,13,14];
               Dump $a;

       Notice that "Dump()" prints only elements 10 through 13 in the above code.  The following code will
       print all of the elements.

               use Devel::Peek 'Dump';
               $a = [10,11,12,13,14];
               Dump $a, 5;

       <b>A</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>SV</b> <b>which</b> <b>holds</b> <b>a</b> <b>C</b> <b>pointer</b>

       This is what you really need to know as an XS programmer, of course.  When an XSUB returns a pointer
       to a C structure that pointer is stored in an SV and a reference to that SV is placed on the XSUB
       stack.  So the output from an XSUB which uses something like the T_PTROBJ map might look something
       like this:

               SV = RV(0xf381c)
                 REFCNT = 1
                 FLAGS = (ROK)
                 RV = 0xb8ad8
               SV = PVMG(0xbb3c8)
                 REFCNT = 1
                 FLAGS = (OBJECT,IOK,pIOK)
                 IV = 729160
                 NV = 0
                 PV = 0
                 STASH = 0xc1d10       "CookBookB::Opaque"

       This shows that we have an SV which is an RV.  That RV points at another SV.  In this case that sec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ond&nbsp;second</font>
       ond SV is a PVMG, a blessed scalar.  Because it is blessed it has the "OBJECT" flag set.  Note that
       an SV which holds a C pointer also has the "IOK" flag set.  The "STASH" is set to the package name
       which this SV was blessed into.

       The output from an XSUB which uses something like the T_PTRREF map, which doesn't bless the object,
       might look something like this:

               SV = RV(0xf381c)
                 REFCNT = 1
                 FLAGS = (ROK)
                 RV = 0xb8ad8
               SV = PVMG(0xbb3c8)
                 REFCNT = 1
                 FLAGS = (IOK,pIOK)
                 IV = 729160
                 NV = 0
                 PV = 0

       <b>A</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>subroutine</b>

       Looks like this:

               SV = RV(0x798ec)
                 REFCNT = 1
                 FLAGS = (TEMP,ROK)
                 RV = 0x1d453c
               SV = PVCV(0x1c768c)
                 REFCNT = 2
                 FLAGS = ()
                 IV = 0
                 NV = 0
                 COMP_STASH = 0x31068  "main"
                 START = 0xb20e0
                 ROOT = 0xbece0
                 XSUB = 0x0
                 XSUBANY = 0
                 GVGV::GV = 0x1d44e8   "MY" :: "top_targets"
                 FILE = "(eval 5)"
                 DEPTH = 0
                 PADLIST = 0x1c9338

       This shows that

          the subroutine is not an XSUB (since "START" and "ROOT" are non-zero, and "XSUB" is zero);

          that it was compiled in the package "main";

          under the name "MY::top_targets";

          inside a 5th eval in the program;

          it is not currently executed (see "DEPTH");

          it has no prototype ("PROTOTYPE" field is missing).
