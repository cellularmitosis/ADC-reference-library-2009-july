<b>NAME</b>
       distcc - distributed C/C++/ObjC compiler

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>distcc</b> <u>&lt;compiler&gt;</u> <u>[COMPILER</u> <u>OPTIONS]</u>

       <b>distcc</b> <u>[COMPILER</u> <u>OPTIONS]</u>

       <b>&lt;compiler&gt;</b> <u>[COMPILER</u> <u>OPTIONS]</u>

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       distcc  distributes compilation of C code across several machines on a network.  distcc should always
       generate the same results as a local compile, is simple to install and use, and is often much  faster
       than a local compile.

       distcc sends the complete preprocessed source code and compiler arguments across the network for each
       job, so the machines do not need to share a filesystem, have the same headers or libraries installed,
       or have synchronized clocks.

       Compilation  is  driven by a "client" machine, which is typically the developer's workstation or lap-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">top.&nbsp;laptop.</font>
       top.  The distcc client runs on this machine, as does make, the preprocessor, the linker,  and  other
       stages  of  the  build process.  Any number of "volunteer" machines help the client to build the pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">gram,&nbsp;program,</font>
       gram, by running the <a href="distccd.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/distccd"><b>distccd(1)</b></a><b></b> daemon, C compiler and assembler as required.

       distcc can run across either TCP sockets (on port 3632 by default), or through a tunnel command  such
       as <a href="ssh.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ssh">ssh(1)</a>.  For TCP connections the volunteers must run the <a href="distccd.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/distccd">distccd(1)</a> daemon either directly or from
       inetd.  For SSH connections distccd must be installed but should <b>not</b> be listening for connections.

       TCP connections should only be used on secure networks because there is  no  user  authentication  or
       protection  of  source or object code.  SSH connections are typically 25% slower because of processor
       overhead for encryption, although this can vary greatly depending on CPUs, network  and  the  program
       being built.

       distcc  is  intended to be used with GNU Make's <b>-j</b> option, which runs several compiler processes con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">currently.&nbsp;concurrently.</font>
       currently.  distcc spreads the jobs across both local and remote CPUs.  Because  distcc  is  able  to
       distribute  most of the work across the network a higher concurrency level can be used than for local
       builds.  The <b>-j</b> value should normally be set to about twice the total number of  available  CPUs,  to
       allow  for  some tasks being blocked waiting for disk or network IO.  distcc can also work with other
       build control tools such as SCons.

       It is strongly recommended that you install the same compiler version on all  machines  participating
       in a build.  Incompatible compilers may cause mysterious compile or link failures.

<b>QUICKSTART</b>
       1      For each machine, download distcc, unpack, and install.

       2      On  each  of  the  servers,  run  <b>distccd</b> <b>--daemon</b> optionally with <b>--allow</b> options to restrict
              access.

       3      Put the names of the servers in your environment:
              $ export DISTCC_HOSTS='localhost red green blue'

       4      Build!
              $ make -j8 CC=distcc

<b>HOW</b> <b>IT</b> <b>WORKS</b>
       distcc only ever runs the compiler and assembler remotely.  The preprocessor must always run  locally
       because it needs to access various header files on the local machine which may not be present, or may
       not be the same, on the volunteer.  The linker similarly needs to examine libraries and object files,
       and so must run locally.

       The compiler and assembler take only a single input file (the preprocessed source) and produce a sin-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">gle&nbsp;single</font>
       gle output (the object file).  distcc ships these two files across the network and can therefore  run
       the compiler/assembler remotely.

       Fortunately, for most programs running the preprocessor is relatively cheap, and the linker is called
       relatively infrequent, so most of the work can be distributed.

       distcc examines its command line to determine which of these phases are being  invoked,  and  whether
       the job can be distributed.

<b>OPTION</b> <b>SUMMARY</b>
       Most  options  passed  to  distcc are interpreted as compiler options.  Two options are understood by
       distcc itself:

       <b>--help</b> Displays summary instructions.

       <b>--version</b>
              Displays the distcc client version.

<b>INSTALLING</b> <b>DISTCC</b>
       There are three different ways to call distcc, to suit different circumstances:

              distcc can be installed under the name of the real compiler, to intercept calls to it and  run
              them  remotely.  This "masqueraded" compiler has the widest compatibility with existing source
              trees, and is convenient when you want to use distcc  for  all  compilation.   The  fact  that
              distcc is being used is transparent to the makefiles.

              distcc  can  be  prepended  to  compiler  command  lines,  such  as  "distcc cc -c hello.c" or
              CC="distcc gcc".  This is convenient when you want to use distcc for only some compilations or
              to  try  it  out, but can cause trouble with some makefiles or versions of libtool that assume
              $CC does not contain a space.

              Finally, distcc can be used directly as a compiler.  "cc" is always used as the  name  of  the
              real  compiler  in  this  "implicit"  mode.   This  can be convenient for interactive use when
              "explicit" mode does not work but is not really recommended for new use.

       Remember that you should not use two methods for calling distcc at the same time.  If you are using a
       masquerade  directory,  don't  change  CC  and/or CXX, just put the directory early on your PATH.  If
       you're not using a masquerade directory, you'll need to either change CC and/or CXX,  or  modify  the
       <!-- a -->makefile(s)<!-- /a --> to call distcc explicitly.

<b>MASQUERADING</b>
       The  basic  idea is to create a "masquerade directory" which contains links from the name of the real
       compiler to the distcc binary.  This directory is inserted early on the PATH, so that  calls  to  the
       compiler are intercepted and distcc is run instead.  distcc then removes itself from the PATH to find
       the real compiler.

       For example:

              # mkdir /usr/lib/distcc/bin
              # cd /usr/lib/distcc/bin
              # ln -s ../../../bin/distcc gcc
              # ln -s ../../../bin/distcc cc
              # ln -s ../../../bin/distcc g++
              # ln -s ../../../bin/distcc c++

       Then, to use distcc, a user just needs to put the directory /usr/lib/distcc/bin early  in  the  PATH,
       and have set a host list in DISTCC_HOSTS or a file.  distcc will handle the rest.

       Note  that  this masquerade directory must occur on the PATH earlier than the directory that contains
       the actual compilers of the same names, and that any auxiliary programs  that  these  compilers  call
       (such as as or ld) must also be found on the PATH in a directory after the masquerade directory since
       distcc calls out to the real compiler with a PATH value that has all directory up  to  and  including
       the masquerade directory trimmed off.

       It  is  possible  to  get  a "recursion error" in masquerade mode, which means that distcc is somehow
       finding itself again, not the real compiler.  This can indicate that you have two masquerade directo-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ries&nbsp;directories</font>
       ries on the PATH, possibly because of having two distcc installations in different locations.  It can
       also indicate that you're trying to mix "masqueraded" and "explicit" operation.

<b>USING</b> <b>DISTCC</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>CCACHE</b>
       ccache is a program that speeds software builds by caching the results of  compilations.   ccache  is
       normally  called before distcc, so that results are retrieved from a normal cache.  Some experimenta-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;experimentation</font>
       tion may be required for idiosyncratic makefiles to make everything work together.

       The most reliable method is to set

              <b>CCACHE_PREFIX="distcc"</b>

       This tells ccache to run distcc as a wrapper around the real compiler.  ccache still  uses  the  real
       compiler to detect compiler upgrades.

       ccache  can then be run using either a masquerade directory <u>or</u> by setting

              <b>CC="ccache</b> <b>gcc"</b>

       As of version 2.2, ccache does not cache compilation from preprocessed source and so will never get a
       cache hit if it is run from distccd or distcc.  It must be run only on the  client  side  and  before
       distcc to be any use.

<b>HOST</b> <b>SPECIFICATIONS</b>
       A  "host  list"  tells  distcc  which machines to use for compilation.  In order, distcc looks in the
       <b>$DISTCC_HOSTS</b> environment variable, the user's <b>$DISTCC_DIR/hosts</b> file, and the system-wide host file.
       If no host list can be found, distcc emits a warning and compiles locally.

       The  host  list  is a simple whitespace separated list of host specifications.  The simplest and most
       common form is a host names, such as

              <b>localhost</b> <b>red</b> <b>green</b> <b>blue</b>

       distcc prefers hosts towards the start of the list, so machines should be listed in descending  order
       of  speed.   In  particular,  when  only  a  single  compilation can be run (such as from a configure
       script), the first machine listed is used.

       Placing <u>localhost</u> at the right point in the list is important to getting good  performance.   Because
       overhead  for running jobs locally is low, localhost should normally be first.  However, it is impor-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tant&nbsp;important</font>
       tant that the client have enough cycles free to run the local jobs and the  distcc  client.   If  the
       client  is slower than the volunteers, or if there are many volunteers, then the client should be put
       later in the list or not at all.  As a general rule, if the aggregate CPU speed of the client is less
       than one fifth of the total, then the client should be left out of the list.

       Performance  depends on the details of the source and makefiles used for the project, and the machine
       and network speeds.  Experimenting with different settings for  the  host  list  and  -j  factor  may
       improve performance.

       The syntax is

         DISTCC_HOSTS = HOSTSPEC ...
         HOSTSPEC = LOCAL_HOST | SSH_HOST | TCP_HOST | OLDSTYLE_TCP_HOST
         LOCAL_HOST = localhost[/LIMIT]
         SSH_HOST = [USER]@HOSTID[/LIMIT][:COMMAND][OPTIONS]
         TCP_HOST = HOSTID[:PORT][/LIMIT][OPTIONS]
         OLDSTYLE_TCP_HOST = HOSTID[/LIMIT][:PORT][OPTIONS]
         HOSTID = HOSTNAME | IPV4
         OPTIONS = ,OPTION[OPTIONS]
         OPTION = lzo

       Here are some individual examples of the syntax:

       <b>localhost</b>
              The  literal  word  "localhost"  is interpreted specially to cause compilations to be directly
              executed, rather than passed to a daemon on the local machine.  If you do want to connect to a
              daemon  on the local machine for testing, then give the machine's IP address or real hostname.
              (This will be slower.)

       <b>IPV4</b>   A literal IPv4 address, such as <b>10.0.0.1</b>

       <b>HOSTNAME</b>
              A hostname to be looked up using the resolver.

       <b>:PORT</b>  Connect to a specified decimal port number, rather than the default of 3632.

       <b>@HOSTID</b>
              Connect to the host over SSH, rather than TCP.  Options for the SSH connection can be  set  in
              <b>~/.ssh/config</b>

       <b>USER@</b>  Connect to the host over SSH as a specified username.

       <b>:COMMAND</b>
              Connect  over SSH, and use a specified path to find the distccd server.  This is normally only
              needed if for some reason you can't install distccd into a directory on the default  PATH  for
              SSH connections.  Use this if you get errors like "distccd: command not found" in SSH mode.

       <b>/LIMIT</b> A  decimal  limit  can  be added to any host specification to restrict the number of jobs that
              this client will send to the machine.  The limit defaults to four per  host  (two  for  local-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">host),&nbsp;localhost),</font>
              host), but may be further restricted by the server.  You should only need to increase this for
              servers with more than two processors.

       <b>,lzo</b>   Enables LZO compression for this TCP or SSH host.

       Here is an example demonstrating some possibilities:

              <b>localhost/2</b> <b>@bigman/16:/opt/bin/distccd</b> <b>oldmachine:4200/1</b>
              <b>#</b> <b>cartman</b> <b>is</b> <b>down</b>
              <b>distant/3,lzo</b>

       Comments are allowed in host specifications.  Comments start with a hash/pound sign (<b>#</b>)  and  run  to
       the end of the line.

       If  a host in the list is not reachable distcc will emit a warning and ignore that host for about one
       minute.

<b>COMPRESSION</b>
       The <b>lzo</b> host option specifies that LZO compression should be used for data transfer,  including  pre-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">processed&nbsp;preprocessed</font>
       processed  source,  object  code  and  error messages.  Compression is usually economical on networks
       slower than 100Mbps, but results may vary depending on the network, processors and source tree.

       Enabling compression makes the distcc client and server use more CPU time, but less network  traffic.
       The compression ratio is typically 4:1 for source and 2:1 for object code.

       Using  compression  requires both client and server to use at least release 2.9 of distcc.  No server
       configuration is required: the server always responds with compressed replies to compressed requests.

<b>SEARCH</b> <b>PATHS</b>
       If the compiler name is an absolute path, it is passed verbatim to the server and the compiler is run
       from that directory.  For example:

              <b>distcc</b> <b>/usr/local/bin/gcc-3.1415</b> <b>-c</b> <b>hello.c</b>

       If the compiler name is not absolute, or not fully  qualified,  distccd's  PATH  is  searched.   When
       distcc  is run from a masquerade directory, only the base name of the compiler is used.  The client's
       PATH is used only to run the preprocessor and has no effect on the server's path.

<b>TIMEOUTS</b>
       Both the distcc client and server impose timeouts on transfer of data across the  network.   This  is
       intended  to detect hosts which are down or unreachable, and to prevent compiles hanging indefinitely
       if a server is disconnected while in use.  If a client-side timeout expires, the job will  be  re-run
       locally.

       The timeouts are not configurable at present.

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       Error  messages or warnings from local or remote compilers are passed through to diagnostic output on
       the client.

       distcc can supply extensive debugging information when the verbose option  is  used.   This  is  con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">trolled&nbsp;controlled</font>
       trolled  by  the  <b>DISTCC_VERBOSE</b>  environment variable on the client, and the <b>--verbose</b> option on the
       server.  For troubleshooting, examine both the client and server error messages.

<b>EXIT</b> <b>CODES</b>
       The exit code of distcc is normally that of the compiler: zero for successful  compilation  and  non-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">zero&nbsp;nonzero</font>
       zero otherwise.

       distcc  distinguishes between "genuine" errors such as a syntax error in the source, and "accidental"
       errors such as a networking problem connecting to a volunteer.  In the  case  of  accidental  errors,
       distcc will retry the compilation locally unless the DISTCC_FALLBACK option has been disabled.

       If the compiler exits with a signal, distcc returns an exit code of 128 plus the signal number.

       distcc internal errors cause an exit code between 100 and 127.  In particular

       100    General distcc failure.

       105    Out of memory.

       110    Compiler not found.

       111    Recursive call to distcc.

       116    No hosts defined and fallbacks disabled.

       (Others are listed in exitcode.h.)

<b>FILES</b>
       If  $DISTCC_HOSTS is not set, distcc reads a host list from either <b>$DISTCC_DIR/hosts</b> or a system-wide
       configuration file set at compile time.  The file locations are  shown  in  the  output  from  <b>distcc</b>
       <b>--help</b>

       distcc creates a number of temporary and lock files underneath the temporary directory.

<b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b>
       distcc's  behaviour  is controlled by a number of environment variables.  For most cases nothing need
       be set if the host list is stored in a file.

       <b>DISTCC_HOSTS</b>
              Space-separated list of volunteer host specifications.

       <b>DISTCC_VERBOSE</b>
              If set to 1, distcc produces explanatory messages on the standard error stream or in  the  log
              file.   This can be helpful in debugging problems.  Bug reports should include verbose output.

       <b>DISTCC_LOG</b>
              Log file to receive messages from distcc itself, rather than stderr.

       <b>DISTCC_FALLBACK</b>
              By default distcc will compile locally if it  fails  to  distribute  a  job  to  the  intended
              machine,  or  if  no  host list can be found.  If this variable is set to 0 then fallbacks are
              disabled and those compilations will simply fail.  Note that this does not affect  jobs  which
              must always be local such as linking.

       <b>DISTCC_SAVE_TEMPS</b>
              If  set to 1, temporary files are not deleted after use.  Good for debugging, or if your disks
              are too empty.

       <b>DISTCC_TCP_CORK</b>
              If set to 0, disable use of "TCP corks", even if they're present on this system.  Using  corks
              normally helps pack requests into fewer packets and aids performance.  This should normally be
              left enabled.

       <b>DISTCC_SSH</b>
              Specifies the command used for opening SSH connections.  Defaults to "ssh" but may be set to a
              different  connection  command  such  as  "lsh" or "tsocks-ssh" that accepts a similar command
              line.  The command is not split into words and is not executed through the shell.

       <b>DISTCC_DIR</b>
              Per-user  configuration  directory  to  store  lock  files  and  state  files.    By   default
              <b>/var/tmp/distcc.{UID}/</b> is used.

       <b>TMPDIR</b> Directory for temporary files such as preprocessor output.  By default /tmp/distcc is used.

       <b>UNCACHED_ERR_FD</b>
              If  set and if DISTCC_LOG is not set, distcc errors are written to the file descriptor identi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fied&nbsp;identified</font>
              fied by this variable.  This variable is intended mainly for automatic use  by  ccache,  which
              sets it to avoid caching transient errors such as network problems.

<b>CROSS</b> <b>COMPILING</b>
       Cross  compilation  means building programs to run on a machine with a different processor, architec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ture,&nbsp;architecture,</font>
       ture, or operating system to where they were compiled.  distcc supports cross compilation,  including
       teams  of  mixed-architecture  machines,  although  some  changes  to the compilation commands may be
       required.

       The compilation command passed to distcc must be one that will execute properly  on  every  volunteer
       machine  to  produce  an object file of the appropriate type.  If the machines have different proces-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sors,&nbsp;processors,</font>
       sors, then simply using <b>distcc</b> <b>cc</b> will probably not work, because that will normally invoke the  vol-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">unteer's&nbsp;volunteer's</font>
       unteer's native compiler.

       Machines with the same CPU but different operating systems may not necessarily generate compatible .o
       files.

       Several different gcc configurations can be installed side-by-side on any machine.  If you build  gcc
       from  source,  you  should use the <b>--program-suffix</b> <b>configuration</b> options to cause it to be installed
       with a name that encodes the gcc version and the target platform.

       The recommended convention for the gcc name is <u>TARGET-gcc-VERSION</u> such as <b>i686-linux-gcc-3.2</b>  .   GCC
       3.3  will  install itself under this name, in addition to <u>TARGET-gcc</u> and, if it's native, <u>gcc-VERSION</u>
       and <u>gcc</u> .

       The compiler must be installed under the same name on the client and on every volunteer machine.

<b>BUGS</b>
       If you think you have found a  distcc bug, please see the file <u>reporting-bugs.txt</u> in  the  documenta-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;documentation</font>
       tion directory for information on how to report it.

       Some  makefiles  have  missing  or  extra  dependencies that cause incorrect or slow parallel builds.
       Recursive make is inefficient and can leave processors unnecessarily idle  for  long  periods.   (See
       <u>Recursive</u> <u>Make</u> <u>Considered</u> <u>Harmful</u> by Peter Miller.)  Makefile bugs are the most common cause of trees
       failing to build under distcc.  Alternatives to Make such as <u>SCons</u> can give much  faster  builds  for
       some projects.

       Using  different  versions  of  gcc  can  cause confusing build problems because the header files and
       binary interfaces have changed over time, and some distributors have  included  incompatible  patches
       without  changing  the  version number.  distcc does not protect against using incompatible versions.
       Compiler errors about link problems or declarations in system header files are usually  due  to  mis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">matched&nbsp;mismatched</font>
       matched or incorrectly installed compilers.

       Due  to  limitations  in gcc, gdb may not be able to automatically find the source files for programs
       built using distcc in some circumstances.  The gdb <b>directory</b> command can be  used.   This  should  be
       fixed in gcc 3.4.

       gcc's <b>-MD</b> option can produce output in the wrong directory if the source and object files are in dif-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ferent&nbsp;different</font>
       ferent directories and the <b>-MF</b> option is not used.  There is no perfect solution because of incompat-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ible&nbsp;incompatible</font>
       ible  changes  between  gcc versions.  Explicitly specifying the dependency output file with <b>-MF</b> will
       fix the problem.

       TCP mode connections should only be used on trusted networks.

       Including slow machines in the list of volunteer hosts can slow the build down.

       When distcc or ccache is used on NFS, the filesystem  must  be  exported  with  the  <b>no_subtree_check</b>
       option to allow reliable renames between directories.

       The compiler can be invoked with a command line <b>gcc</b> <b>hello.c</b> to both compile and link.  distcc doesn't
       split this into separate parts, but rather runs the whole thing locally.
