<b>NAME</b>
       bind - Arrange for X events to invoke Tcl scripts

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>bind</b> <u>tag</u>

       <b>bind</b> <u>tag</u> <u>sequence</u>

       <b>bind</b> <u>tag</u> <u>sequence</u> <u>script</u>

       <b>bind</b> <u>tag</u> <u>sequence</u> <b>+</b><u>script</u>
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________


<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
       The  <b>bind</b>  command  associates Tcl scripts with X events.  If all three arguments are specified, <b>bind</b>
       will arrange for <u>script</u> (a Tcl script) to be evaluated whenever the <!-- a -->event(s)<!-- /a --> given by <u>sequence</u>  occur
       in  the  <!-- a -->window(s)<!-- /a --> identified by <u>tag</u>.  If <u>script</u> is prefixed with a ``+'', then it is appended to any
       existing binding for <u>sequence</u>;  otherwise <u>script</u> replaces any existing  binding.   If  <u>script</u>  is  an
       empty string then the current binding for <u>sequence</u> is destroyed, leaving <u>sequence</u> unbound.  In all of
       the cases where a <u>script</u> argument is provided, <b>bind</b> returns an empty string.

       If <u>sequence</u> is specified without a <u>script</u>, then the script currently bound to <u>sequence</u>  is  returned,
       or  an  empty string is returned if there is no binding for <u>sequence</u>.  If neither <u>sequence</u> nor <u>script</u>
       is specified, then the return value is a list whose elements are all the sequences  for  which  there
       exist bindings for <u>tag</u>.

       The  <u>tag</u> argument determines which <!-- a -->window(s)<!-- /a --> the binding applies to.  If <u>tag</u> begins with a dot, as in
       <b>.a.b.c</b>, then it must be the path name for a window; otherwise it may be an  arbitrary  string.   Each
       window  has  an  associated  list of tags, and a binding applies to a particular window if its tag is
       among those specified for the window.  Although the <b>bindtags</b> command may be used to assign  an  arbi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">trary&nbsp;arbitrary</font>
       trary set of binding tags to a window, the default binding tags provide the following behavior:

              If a tag is the name of an internal window the binding applies to that window.

              If the tag is the name of a toplevel window the binding applies to the toplevel window and all
              its internal windows.

              If the tag is the name of a class of widgets, such as <b>Button</b>, the binding applies to all  wid-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">gets&nbsp;widgets</font>
              gets in that class;

              If <u>tag</u> has the value <b>all</b>, the binding applies to all windows in the application.


<b>EVENT</b> <b>PATTERNS</b>
       The  <u>sequence</u>  argument specifies a sequence of one or more event patterns, with optional white space
       between the patterns.  Each event pattern may take one of three forms.  In the simplest case it is  a |
       single  printing  ASCII character, such as <b>a</b> or <b>[</b>.  The character may not be a space character or the
       character <b>&lt;</b>.  This form of pattern matches a <b>KeyPress</b> event for the particular character.  The second
       form of pattern is longer but more general.  It has the following syntax:
              <b>&lt;</b><u>modifier-modifier-type-detail</u><b>&gt;</b>
       The entire event pattern is surrounded by angle brackets.  Inside the angle brackets are zero or more
       modifiers, an event type, and an extra piece of information (<u>detail</u>) identifying a particular  button
       or  keysym.  Any of the fields may be omitted, as long as at least one of <u>type</u> and <u>detail</u> is present.
       The fields must be separated by white space or dashes.                                                |

       The third form of pattern is used to specify a user-defined, named virtual event.  It has the follow- |
       ing syntax:                                                                                           |
              <b>&lt;&lt;</b><u>name</u><b>&gt;&gt;</b>                                                                                       |
       The  entire  virtual event pattern is surrounded by double angle brackets.  Inside the angle brackets |
       is the user-defined name of the virtual event.  Modifiers, such as <b>Shift</b> or <b>Control</b>, may not be  com- |
       bined  with a virtual event to modify it.  Bindings on a virtual event may be created before the vir- |
       tual event is defined, and if the definition of a virtual  event  changes  dynamically,  all  windows |
       bound to that virtual event will respond immediately to the new definition.

<b>MODIFIERS</b>
       Modifiers consist of any of the following values:

              <b>Control</b>                 <b>Mod2,</b> <b>M2</b>
              <b>Shift</b>                   <b>Mod3,</b> <b>M3</b>
              <b>Lock</b>                    <b>Mod4,</b> <b>M4</b>
              <b>Button1,</b> <b>B1</b>             <b>Mod5,</b> <b>M5</b>
              <b>Button2,</b> <b>B2</b>             <b>Meta,</b> <b>M</b>
              <b>Button3,</b> <b>B3</b>             <b>Alt</b>
              <b>Button4,</b> <b>B4</b>             <b>Double</b>
              <b>Button5,</b> <b>B5</b>             <b>Triple</b>
              <b>Mod1,</b> <b>M1</b>                <b>Quadruple</b>

       Where  more  than  one  value is listed, separated by commas, the values are equivalent.  Most of the
       modifiers have the obvious X meanings.  For example, <b>Button1</b> requires that button 1 be depressed when
       the  event occurs.  For a binding to match a given event, the modifiers in the event must include all
       of those specified in the event pattern.  An event may also contain additional modifiers  not  speci-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fied&nbsp;specified</font>
       fied  in the binding.  For example, if button 1 is pressed while the shift and control keys are down,
       the pattern <b>&lt;Control-Button-1&gt;</b> will match the event, but <b>&lt;Mod1-Button-1&gt;</b> will not.  If  no  modifiers
       are specified, then any combination of modifiers may be present in the event.

       <b>Meta</b>  and  <b>M</b>  refer to whichever of the <b>M1</b> through <b>M5</b> modifiers is associated with the meta <!-- a -->key(s)<!-- /a --> on
       the keyboard (keysyms <b>Meta_R</b> and <b>Meta_L</b>).  If there are no meta keys, or if they are  not  associated
       with any modifiers, then <b>Meta</b> and <b>M</b> will not match any events.  Similarly, the <b>Alt</b> modifier refers to
       whichever modifier is associated with the alt <!-- a -->key(s)<!-- /a --> on the keyboard (keysyms <b>Alt_L</b> and <b>Alt_R</b>).

       The <b>Double</b>, <b>Triple</b> and <b>Quadruple</b> modifiers are a convenience for specifying double mouse  clicks  and
       other repeated events. They cause a particular event pattern to be repeated 2, 3 or 4 times, and also
       place a time and space requirement on the sequence: for a sequence  of  events  to  match  a  <b>Double</b>,
       <b>Triple</b> or <b>Quadruple</b> pattern, all of the events must occur close together in time and without substan-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tial&nbsp;substantial</font>
       tial mouse motion in between.  For example, <b>&lt;Double-Button-1&gt;</b> is equivalent  to  <b>&lt;Button-1&gt;&lt;Button-1&gt;</b>
       with the extra time and space requirement.


<b>EVENT</b> <b>TYPES</b>
       The  <u>type</u>  field  may be any of the standard X event types, with a few extra abbreviations.  The <u>type</u>
       field will also accept a couple non-standard X event types that were added to better support the Mac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">intosh&nbsp;Macintosh</font>
       intosh  and  Windows  platforms.   Below  is  a  list  of all the valid types; where two names appear
       together, they are synonyms.

              <b>Activate</b>            <b>Destroy</b>            <b>Map</b>
              <b>ButtonPress,</b> <b>Button</b> <b>Enter</b>              <b>MapRequest</b>
              <b>ButtonRelease</b>       <b>Expose</b>             <b>Motion</b>
              <b>Circulate</b>           <b>FocusIn</b>            <b>MouseWheel</b>
              <b>CirculateRequest</b>    <b>FocusOut</b>           <b>Property</b>
              <b>Colormap</b>            <b>Gravity</b>            <b>Reparent</b>
              <b>Configure</b>           <b>KeyPress,</b> <b>Key</b>      <b>ResizeRequest</b>
              <b>ConfigureRequest</b>    <b>KeyRelease</b>         <b>Unmap</b>
              <b>Create</b>              <b>Leave</b>              <b>Visibility</b>
              <b>Deactivate</b>


       Most of the above events have the same fields and behaviors as events in the X Windowing system.  You |
       can  find  more  detailed descriptions of these events in any X window programming book.  A couple of |
       the events are extensions to the X event system to support features unique to the Macintosh and  Win- |
       dows platforms.  We provide a little more detail on these events here.  These include:                |

       <b>Acti-</b>                                                                                                 |
       <b>vate</b>                                                                                              |   |

       <b>Deacti-</b>                                                                                               |
       <b>vate</b>                                                                                            |     |
            These two events are sent to every sub-window of a toplevel when they change state.  In addition |
            to the focus Window, the Macintosh platform and Windows platforms have a  notion  of  an  active |
            window  (which  often  has but is not required to have the focus).  On the Macintosh, widgets in |
            the active window have a different appearance than widgets in deactive  windows.   The  <b>Activate</b> |
            event  is  sent  to  all  the  sub-windows  in a toplevel when it changes from being deactive to |
            active.  Likewise, the <b>Deactive</b> event is sent when the window's state  changes  from  active  to |
            deactive.   There  are  no  useful  percent  substitutions  you would make when binding to these |
            events.                                                                                          |

       <b>Mouse-</b>                                                                                                |
       <b>Wheel</b>                                                                                            |    |
            Some  mice  on  the Windows platform support a mouse wheel which is used for scrolling documents |
            without using the scrollbars.  By rolling the wheel, the system will generate <b>MouseWheel</b>  events |
            that  the  application  can use to scroll.  On Windows, the event is always routed to the window |
            that currently has focus. On Mac OS X, the event is routed to  the  window  under  the  pointer. |
            When  the event is received you can use the <b>%D</b> substitution to get the <u>delta</u> field for the event |
            which is a integer value of motion that the mouse wheel has moved.  The smallest value for which |
            the system will report is defined by the OS.  On Windows 95 &amp; 98 machines this value is at least |
            120 before it is reported.  However, higher resolution devices may be available in  the  future. |
            On  Mac  OS  X, the value is not scaled by 120, but a value of 1 corresponds to roughly one text |
            line.  The sign of the value determines which direction your  widget  should  scroll.   Positive |
            values should scroll up and negative values should scroll down.

       The last part of a long event specification is <u>detail</u>.  In the case of a <b>ButtonPress</b> or <b>ButtonRelease</b>
       event, it is the number of a button (1-5).  If a button number is given, then only an event  on  that
       particular  button will match;  if no button number is given, then an event on any button will match.
       Note:  giving a specific button number is different than specifying a button modifier; in  the  first
       case,  it  refers  to a button being pressed or released, while in the second it refers to some other
       button that is already depressed when the matching event occurs.  If a button number  is  given  then
       <u>type</u>  may  be omitted:  if will default to <b>ButtonPress</b>.  For example, the specifier <b>&lt;1&gt;</b> is equivalent
       to <b>&lt;ButtonPress-1&gt;</b>.

       If the event type is <b>KeyPress</b> or <b>KeyRelease</b>, then <u>detail</u> may be specified in the form of an X keysym.
       Keysyms are textual specifications for particular keys on the keyboard; they include all the alphanu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">meric&nbsp;alphanumeric</font>
       meric ASCII characters (e.g. ``a'' is the keysym for the ASCII character  ``a''),  plus  descriptions
       for  non-alphanumeric characters (``comma'' is the keysym for the comma character), plus descriptions
       for all the non-ASCII keys on the keyboard (``Shift_L'' is the keysm for  the  left  shift  key,  and
       ``F1''  is  the  keysym  for the F1 function key, if it exists).  The complete list of keysyms is not
       presented here;  it is available in other X documentation and may vary from  system  to  system.   If
       necessary,  you can use the <b>%K</b> notation described below to print out the keysym name for a particular
       key.  If a keysym <u>detail</u> is given, then the <u>type</u> field may be omitted;  it will default to  <b>KeyPress</b>.
       For example, <b>&lt;Control-comma&gt;</b> is equivalent to <b>&lt;Control-KeyPress-comma&gt;</b>.


<b>BINDING</b> <b>SCRIPTS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>SUBSTITUTIONS</b>
       The <u>script</u> argument to <b>bind</b> is a Tcl script, which will be executed whenever the given event sequence
       occurs.  <u>Command</u> will be executed in the same interpreter that the <b>bind</b> command was executed in,  and
       it  will  run  at  global level (only global variables will be accessible).  If <u>script</u> contains any <b>%</b>
       characters, then the script will not be executed directly.  Instead, a new script will  be  generated
       by  replacing  each  <b>%</b>, and the character following it, with information from the current event.  The
       replacement depends on the character following the <b>%</b>, as defined in the list below.  Unless otherwise
       indicated,  the  replacement  string  is the decimal value of the given field from the current event.
       Some of the substitutions are only valid for certain types of events;  if they  are  used  for  other
       types of events the value substituted is undefined.

       <b>%%</b>   Replaced with a single percent.

       <b>%#</b>   The number of the last client request processed by the server (the <u>serial</u> field from the event).
            Valid for all event types.

       <b>%a</b>   The <u>above</u> field from the event, formatted as a hexadecimal number.   Valid  only  for  <b>Configure</b>
            events.

       <b>%b</b>   The number of the button that was pressed or released.  Valid only for <b>ButtonPress</b> and <b>ButtonRe</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lease&nbsp;ButtonRelease</font>
            <b>lease</b> events.

       <b>%c</b>   The <u>count</u> field from the event.  Valid only for <b>Expose</b> events.

       <b>%d</b>   The <u>detail</u> field from the event.  The <b>%d</b> is replaced by a string identifying  the  detail.   For
            <b>Enter</b>, <b>Leave</b>, <b>FocusIn</b>, and <b>FocusOut</b> events, the string will be one of the following:

                   <b>NotifyAncestor</b>          <b>NotifyNonlinearVirtual</b>
                   <b>NotifyDetailNone</b>        <b>NotifyPointer</b>
                   <b>NotifyInferior</b>          <b>NotifyPointerRoot</b>
                   <b>NotifyNonlinear</b>         <b>NotifyVirtual</b>

            For <b>ConfigureRequest</b> events, the string will be one of:

       The replacement string for a %-replacement is formatted as a proper Tcl  list  element.   This  means
       that  it  will be surrounded with braces if it contains spaces, or special characters such as <b>$</b> and <b>{</b>
       may be preceded by backslashes.  This guarantees that the string  will  be  passed  through  the  Tcl
       parser  when  the binding script is evaluated.  Most replacements are numbers or well-defined strings
       such as <b>Above</b>;  for these replacements no special formatting is ever necessary.  The most common case
       where reformatting occurs is for the <b>%A</b> substitution.  For example, if <u>script</u> is
              <b>insert</b> <b>%A</b>
       and the character typed is an open square bracket, then the script actually executed will be
              <b>insert</b> <b>\[</b>
       This  will  cause  the <b>insert</b> to receive the original replacement string (open square bracket) as its
       first argument.  If the extra backslash hadn't been added, Tcl would not have been able to parse  the
       script correctly.


<b>MULTIPLE</b> <b>MATCHES</b>
       It  is  possible  for several bindings to match a given X event.  If the bindings are associated with
       different <u>tag</u>'s, then each of the bindings will be executed, in order.  By default, a binding for the
       widget  will  be  executed first, followed by a class binding, a binding for its toplevel, and an <b>all</b>
       binding.  The <b>bindtags</b> command may be used to change this order for a particular window or  to  asso-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ciate&nbsp;associate</font>
       ciate additional binding tags with the window.

       The  <b>continue</b>  and  <b>break</b>  commands  may be used inside a binding script to control the processing of
       matching scripts.  If <b>continue</b> is invoked, then the current binding script is terminated but Tk  will
       continue  processing  binding  scripts  associated with other <u>tag</u>'s.  If the <b>break</b> command is invoked
       within a binding script, then that script terminates and no other scripts will  be  invoked  for  the
       event.

       If  more  than  one binding matches a particular event and they have the same <u>tag</u>, then the most spe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cific&nbsp;specific</font>
       cific binding is chosen and its script is evaluated.  The following tests are applied, in  order,  to
       determine which of several matching sequences is more specific: (a) an event pattern that specifies a
       specific button or key is more specific than one that doesn't; (b) a longer  sequence  (in  terms  of
       number of events matched) is more specific than a shorter sequence; (c) if the modifiers specified in
       one pattern are a subset of the modifiers in another pattern, then the pattern with more modifiers is
       more specific.  (d) a virtual event whose physical pattern matches the sequence is less specific than
       the same physical pattern that is not associated with a virtual event.  (e)  given  a  sequence  that
       matches  two or more virtual events, one of the virtual events will be chosen, but the order is unde-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fined.&nbsp;undefined.</font>
       fined.

       If the matching sequences contain more than one event, then tests (c)-(e) are applied in  order  from
       the most recent event to the least recent event in the sequences.  If these tests fail to determine a
       winner, then the most recently registered sequence is the winner.

       If there are two (or more) virtual events that are both triggered by the same sequence, and  both  of
       those  virtual  events  are bound to the same window tag, then only one of the virtual events will be
       triggered, and it will be picked at random:
              event add &lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt; &lt;Control-y&gt;
              event add &lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt; &lt;Button-2&gt;
              event add &lt;&lt;Scroll&gt;&gt; &lt;Button-2&gt;
              bind Entry &lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt; {puts Paste}
              bind Entry &lt;&lt;Scroll&gt;&gt; {puts Scroll}
       If the user types Control-y, the <b>&lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt;</b> binding will be invoked, but if the user presses button  2
       then  one  of  either the <b>&lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt;</b> or the <b>&lt;&lt;Scroll&gt;&gt;</b> bindings will be invoked, but exactly which one
       gets invoked is undefined.

       If an X event does not match any of the existing bindings, then the event  is  ignored.   An  unbound
       event is not considered to be an error.


<b>MULTI-EVENT</b> <b>SEQUENCES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>IGNORED</b> <b>EVENTS</b>
       When  a <u>sequence</u> specified in a <b>bind</b> command contains more than one event pattern, then its script is
       executed whenever the recent events (leading up to and including the current event) match  the  given
       sequence.   This means, for example, that if button 1 is clicked repeatedly the sequence <b>&lt;Double-But-</b>
       <b>tonPress-1&gt;</b> will match each button press but the first.  If extraneous events that  would  prevent  a
       match occur in the middle of an event sequence then the extraneous events are ignored unless they are
       <b>KeyPress</b> or <b>ButtonPress</b> events.  For example, <b>&lt;Double-ButtonPress-1&gt;</b> will match a sequence of presses
       of  button 1, even though there will be <b>ButtonRelease</b> events (and possibly <b>Motion</b> events) between the
       <b>ButtonPress</b> events.  Furthermore, a <b>KeyPress</b> event may be preceded by any number  of  other  <b>KeyPress</b>
       events  for  modifier  keys  without  the  modifier  keys preventing a match.  For example, the event
       sequence <b>aB</b> will match a press of the <b>a</b> key, a release of the <b>a</b> key, a press of the <b>Shift</b> key, and  a
       press of the <b>b</b> key:  the press of <b>Shift</b> is ignored because it is a modifier key.  Finally, if several
       <b>Motion</b> events occur in a row, only the last one is used for purposes of matching binding sequences.


<b>ERRORS</b>
       If an error occurs in executing the script for a binding then the <b>bgerror</b> mechanism is used to report
       the error.  The <b>bgerror</b> command will be executed at global level (outside the context of any Tcl pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cedure).&nbsp;procedure).</font>
