It allowsCGI-like tasks to run as part of the main server process, avoidingthe creation and termination of a process for each request. See <b>API-basedadaptor</b>; <b>CGI adaptor</b>; <b>HTTP adaptor</b>.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>application host</b></dt><dd>A computer capable of running application instances.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>bundle</b></dt><dd>In Mac OS X systems, a bundle is a directoryin the file system that stores executable code and the softwareresources related to that code. The bundle directory, in essence,groups a set of resources in a discrete package.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>CGI (Common Gateway Interface)</b></dt><dd>A standard for communication between external applicationsand information servers, such as HTTP servers.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>CGI adaptor</b></dt><dd>HTTP adaptor that uses the Common Gateway Interface(CGI) to translate requests from an HTTP server into requests toan application instance, and responses from an application instanceto responses to the HTTP server. The HTTP server creates a new CGI processto handle each request. See <b>API-based adaptor</b>; <b>HTTPadaptor</b>.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>component</b></dt><dd>An object (of the WOComponent class) that representsa Web page or a reusable portion of one.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>datasource adaptor</b></dt><dd>A mechanism that connects your applicationto a particular database server. For each type of server you use, youneed a separate adaptor. WebObjects provides an adaptor for databasesconforming to JDBC. See also <b>JDBC adaptor</b>.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>framework</b></dt><dd>A type of bundle that packages a dynamic sharedlibrary with the resources that the library requires, includingheader files and reference documentation.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>HTTP</b></dt><dd>The client-server TCP/IP protocol used on theWeb for the exchange of HTML documents.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>HTTP adaptor</b></dt><dd>A process (or a part of one) that connectsWebObjects applications to an HTTP server. See also <b>HTTPserver</b>.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>Java Client</b></dt><dd>A WebObjects development approach that allowsyou to create graphical user interface applications that run onthe user's computer and communicate with a WebObjects server application.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)</b></dt><dd>An interface between Java platforms and databases.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>JDBC adaptor</b></dt><dd>A datasource adaptor that allows WebObjectsapplications to connect to  JDBC-compliant database management systems. See <b>datasourceadaptor</b>.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>lifebeat</b></dt><dd>Status message sent by WebObjects applicationsto wotaskd to report their activity. The four types of lifebeatmessages are has started, is alive, will stop, and will crash.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>load balancing</b></dt><dd>Technique used to distribute user-load amongthe instances of an application. When multiple instances of an applicationare running and a new user accesses the application, the WebObjectsadaptor uses one of several algorithms to determine which instanceto forward the request to.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>loopback</b></dt><dd>Mechanism that allows you to open a connectionto a computer that does not go over the network.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>Monitor</b></dt><dd>A tool used to configure and maintain deployedWebObjects applications capable of handling multiple applications,application instances, and applications hosts at the same time.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>Project Builder	</b></dt><dd>A tool used to manage the development of aWebObjects application or framework.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>session</b></dt><dd>A period during which access to a WebObjectsapplication and its resources is granted to a particular client(typically a browser). Also an object (of the WOSession class) representinga session.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>SMTP (Simple Mail TransferProtocol)</b></dt><dd>A protocol used totransfer email between computers, usually over Ethernet.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>socket</b></dt><dd>Mechanism for creating a virtual connectionbetween processes. It interfaces standard I/O with network communication facilities.A socket address consists of a port number and an IP address.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>UDP (User Datagram Protocol)</b></dt><dd>Lightweight and efficient connectionless datagramtransport protocol. Used to send self-routing data throughout anetwork.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>HTTP server</b></dt><dd>An application that serves Web pages to Webbrowsers using the HTTP protocol. In WebObjects, the HTTP serverlies between the browser and a WebObjects application. When theHTTP server receives a request from a browser, it passes the requestto the WebObjects adaptor, which generates a response and returns itto the HTTP server. The HTTP server then sends the response to thebrowser. See also <b>HTTP adaptor</b>.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>WebObjects Deployment</b></dt><dd>Software package that allows you to deployWebObjects applications on an intranet or the Web. You need to installa WebObjects deployment license on computers on which you want toinstall this package. See also <b>WebObjects Development</b>.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>WebObjects Development</b></dt><dd>Software package that allows you to developWebObjects applications. It includes tools to design applicationsusing an object-oriented approach. You need to install a WebObjectsdevelopment license on computers on which you want to develop applications.See also <b>WebObjects Deployment</b>.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>WOServices</b></dt><dd>WebObjects service that monitors wotaskd processes.Its main duty is to monitor wotaskd and restart it if it dies orwhen the host is restarted. The implementation of this service is platform-dependent.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>wotaskd (WebObjects task daemon)</b></dt><dd>WebObjects Deployment tool that manages theinstances on an application host. It's used by Monitor to propagatesite configuration changes throughout the site's application hosts.See also <b>Monitor</b>.</dd></dl><br><a href="../RevisionHistory/iDocument_Revision_History.html" target="_top"><img src="../images/previous.gif" border="0"></a><!-- apple_doc:nextPageTop --><br><br><p><hr><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">&#169; 2002 Apple Computer, Inc.
