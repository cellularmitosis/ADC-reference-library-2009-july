  /*! @function terminate
    @abstract Make an IOService inactive and begin its destruction.
    @discussion Registering an IOService informs possible clients of its existance and instantiates drivers that may be used with it; terminate involves the opposite process of informing clients that an IOService is no longer able to be used and will be destroyed. By default, if any client has the service open, terminate fails. If the kIOServiceRequired flag is passed however, terminate will be sucessful though further progress in the destruction of the IOService will not proceed until the last client has closed it. The service will be made inactive immediately upon successful termination, and all its clients will be notified via their message method with a message of type kIOMessageServiceIsTerminated. Both these actions take place on the callers thread. After the IOService is made inactive, further matching or attach calls will fail on it. Each client has its stop method called upon their close of an inactive IOService, or on its termination if they do not have it open. After stop, detach is called in each client. When all clients have been detached, the finalize method is called in the inactive service. The terminate process is inherently asynchronous since it will be deferred until all clients have chosen to close.
    @param options In most cases no options are needed. kIOServiceSynchronous may be passed to cause terminate to not return until the service is finalized.
