/*	File:		ShadingWinds.h	Contains:	This little application includes code to allow you to detect whether or not the Shell				Window is "rolled up" by WindowShade.  How do you do this?  You check the window's 				contRgn.  If the contRgn is empty, then the window is shaded.  You'll note that the				grafPort is unchanged by WindowShade, so if you need to save window dimensions, you				can grab that information from the portRect.	Written by: Virginia (Ginny) McCulloh	 	Copyright:	Copyright © 1995-1999 by Apple Computer, Inc., All Rights Reserved.				You may incorporate this Apple sample source code into your program(s) without				restriction.
