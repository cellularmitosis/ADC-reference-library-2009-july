Read Me About NoCopyReceives for CodeWarrior (ProjectBuilder is below)2.0This sample demonstrates the use of no-copy receives under Open Transport.  The code from this sample is featured in the book “Inside Macintosh: Open Transport”.Packing ListThe package contains the following items items: • NoCopyReceives.mcp — A project to build the PPC version. • NoCopyReceives(Carbon) — A compiled version of the above.• NoCopyReceives.c — Source code common to both projects.• NoCopyReceives_Output.txt — Source code common tobothh projects.Sample RequirementsI tested this code with Carbon 1.2.5 running under Mac OS 9 and on Mac OSX.  The code should run just fine with Carbon 1.2.5 (or newer) and Universal Interfaces 3.3.2 (or newer).  Running the SampleTo run the sample, simply double click the application and read the output on the console window.  The sample will connect via HTTP to www.apple.com and download the root page twice, illustrating two different ways of using OT’s no-copy receive functionality.  The sample places both copies of the page (with HTTP headers) into the file “NoCopyReceives_Output.txt” in the same folder as the application.  You can open this file with a text editor to check that the page was downloaded successfully.Building the SampleThe sample was built using the Metrowerks CodeWarrior IDE 4.1 environment Carbon SDK 1.2.5 and Universal Interfaces 3.3.2.  Both the Carbon SDK and Universal intefaces can be downloaded from Apple website at : http://developer.apple.com/sdk/index.htmlTo rebuild the sample, first open the project and change the “Access Paths” to point to the interfaces and libraries from the Carbon 1.2.5 SDK (or newer) and the Universal Interfaces 3.3.2 (or newer).  Then choose Make from the Project menu.Credits and Version HistoryIf you find any problems with this sample, mail <DevSupport@apple.com> with “Attn: Quinn” as the first line of your mail and I’ll try to fix them up.Version 1.0d1 (Sep 1997) is the first release.Version 1.0d2 (Jul 1998) fixes a serious bug in the use of OTReadBuffer.  OTReadBuffer modifies info->fBuffer, so you can’t use that as your only copy of the OTBuffer pointer.  You must have an extra copy of the original value that you pass to OTReleaseBuffer.Version 2.0 (March 2001) Carbonized the sample.Share and EnjoyQuinn “The Eskimo!”Apple Developer Technical SupportNetworking, Communications, Hardware2 March 2001.==========Read Me About NoCopyReceives For ProjectBuilder2.0This sample demonstrates the use of no-copy receives under Open Transport.
