The page becomes a WebObjectscomponent in your project with an HTML template, a Java source file,and a bindings file. You can edit it with WebObjects Builder justas you would any other component. The downside is that you can'tcustomize frozen pages with the Direct to Web Assistant.</font></li><li><b>Generate a Direct to Web template.</b> Sometimesyou need to change the way every page for a particular task appearsin your application. For example, you might want to put an extrahyperlink at the bottom of every list page. To do so, you instructthe Direct to Web Assistant to generate a Direct to Web template,modify the template, and tell the assistant to use your customizedtemplate instead of the standard one. As mentioned earlier, a Directto Web template is an ordinary WebObjects component and can be editedusing WebObjects Builder. Unlike frozen pages, Direct to Web pagesbased your custom template can be customized with the assistant.</font></li><li><b>Modify the page wrapper and menu header.</b> Thepage wrapper component is included in your project and determinesthe text and elements that are common to every page in your applicationexcept the login page. It contains the menu header appropriate forthe look.  <a href="Direct_to_W_pplications.html#BABIECIC" target = "_right">Figure 5-8</a> shows the menu header for the Basic look. The menuheader is another component in your project.</font></li><li><b>Mix WebObjects and Direct to Web pages</b>.You can navigate to a Direct to Web page from a WebObjects pageand vice versa. You can also embed certain Direct to Web functionswithin a WebObjects page. These capabilities extend the flexibilityof Direct to Web considerably.</font></li><li><b>Perform other customizations</b>. You canchange almost anything in a Direct to Web application because itis just a WebObjects application with some extra functionality. However,you need to know the details of the Direct to Web architecture.</font></li></ul><br>    <br><a href="The_Direct__b_Assistant.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/previous.gif" border="0"></a><a href="Advantages__eb_Approach.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/next.gif" border="0"></a>&nbsp;<br><br><p><hr><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">&#169; 2002 Apple Computer, Inc.
