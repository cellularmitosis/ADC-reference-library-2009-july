The SectionReport project is sample code for creating a PostScript Output Filterplug-in for LaserWriter 8.7.The file "SectionReport.mcp" is a CodeWarrior Pro 5 project which containsseveral targets. The project can be opened and built inCodeWarrior Pro 5 (IDE 4.x) with no changes. The target "SectionReport.debug" builds a debugging versionof the filter, producing the file "SectionReport.debug". The target"SectionReport.nodebug" builds a non-debugging version of the projectand produces the file "SectionReport". The target "Full Build" buildsboth versions of the filter.This sample code builds with Universal Headers 3.2.
