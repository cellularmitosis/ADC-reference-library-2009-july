The twoother methods in the informal protocol,  <a frame= "conv" href="#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/EORelationshipManipulation/addObject:toBothSidesOfRelationshipWithKey:">addObject:toBothSidesOfRelationshipWithKey:</a> and  <a frame= "conv" href="#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/EORelationshipManipulation/removeObject:fromBothSidesOfRelationshipWithKey:">removeObject:fromBothSidesOfRelationshipWithKey:</a>,are implemented in terms of the two primitives to handle reciprocalrelationships. These methods find the inverse relationship to theone identified by the specified key (if there is such an inverserelationship) and use <b>addObject:toPropertyWithKey:</b> and <b>removeObject:fromPropertyWithKey:</b> toalter both relationships, whether they're to-one or to-many.</p><p>The primitive methods check first for a method you might implement, <b>addTo</b><em>Key</em> or <b>removeFrom</b><em>Key</em>, invokingthat method if it's implemented, otherwise using the basic key-valuecoding methods to do the work. Consequently, you rarely need toprovide your own implementations of EORelationshipManipulation.Rather, you can provide relationship accessors (<b>addTo</b><em>Key</em> or <b>removeFrom</b><em>Key</em>)whenever you need to implement custom business logic.</p><BR><BR><h2>Instance Methods</h2><hr><a name = "CJFCEGIB"><BR><h3><a name="//apple_ref/occ/intfm/EORelationshipManipulation/addObject:toBothSidesOfRelationshipWithKey:">addObject:toBothSidesOfRelationshipWithKey:</a></h3></a><p><code>- (void)<b>addObject:</b>(id)<em>anObject</em><b>toBothSidesOfRelationshipWithKey:</b>(NSString*)<em>key</em></code></p>Sets or adds <em>anObject</em> asthe destination for the receiver's relationship identified by <em>key</em>,and also sets or adds the receiver for <em>anObject</em>'sreciprocal relationship if there is one. For a to-one relationship, <em>anObject</em> isset using  <a frame= "conv" href="../Protocols/EOKeyValueCoding.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/EOKeyValueCoding/takeValue:forKey:">takeValue:forKey:</a>. For a to-manyrelationship, <em>anObject</em> is added using  <a frame= "conv" href="#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/EORelationshipManipulation/addObject:toBothSidesOfRelationshipWithKey:">addObject:toBothSidesOfRelationshipWithKey:</a>.<p>This method also properly handles removing <code>self </code>and <em>anObject</em> fromtheir previous relationship as needed. For example, if an Employeeobject belongs to the Research department, invoking this method withthe Maintenance department removes the Employee from the Researchdepartment as well as setting the Employee's department to Maintenance.</p><hr WIDTH=25% ALIGN=LEFT><a name = "CJFCIDAG"><BR><h3><a name="//apple_ref/occ/intfm/EORelationshipManipulation/addObject:toPropertyWithKey:">addObject:toPropertyWithKey:</a></h3></a><p><code>- (void)<b>addObject:</b>(id)<em>anObject</em><b>toPropertyWithKey:</b>(NSString *)<em>key</em></code></p>Adds <em>anObject</em> tothe receiver's to-many relationship identified by <em>key</em>,without setting a reciprocal relationship.
