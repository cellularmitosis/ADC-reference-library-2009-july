/* the following categories are added to NSURLRequest and NSMutableURLRequest
for the purposes of sharing information between the various webView delegate
routines and the custom protocol implementation defined in this file.  Our
WebResourceLoadDelegate (WRLD) will intercept resource load requests before they are
handled and if a NSURLRequest is destined for our special protocol, then the
WRLD will copy the NSURLRequest to a NSMutableURLRequest and call setSpecialVars
to attach some data we want to share between the WRLD and our NSURLProtocol
object. Inside of our NSURLProtocol we can access this data.

In this example, we store a reference to our WRLD object in the dictionary inside
of our WRLD method and then we call a method on our WRLD object from inside of our
startLoading method on our NSURLProtocol object.
