<b>NAME</b>
       perlbug - how to submit bug reports on Perl

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>perlbug</b> [ <b>-v</b> ] [ <b>-a</b> <u>address</u> ] [ <b>-s</b> <u>subject</u> ] [ <b>-b</b> <u>body</u> | <b>-f</b> <u>inputfile</u> ] [ <b>-F</b> <u>outputfile</u> ] [ <b>-r</b> <u>retur</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">naddress&nbsp;returnaddress</font>
       <u>naddress</u> ] [ <b>-e</b> <u>editor</u> ] [ <b>-c</b> <u>adminaddress</u> | <b>-C</b> ] [ <b>-S</b> ] [ <b>-t</b> ]  [ <b>-d</b> ]  [ <b>-A</b> ]  [ <b>-h</b> ]

       <b>perlbug</b> [ <b>-v</b> ] [ <b>-r</b> <u>returnaddress</u> ]
        [ <b>-A</b> ] [ <b>-ok</b> | <b>-okay</b> | <b>-nok</b> | <b>-nokay</b> ]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       A program to help generate bug reports about perl or the modules that come with it, and mail them.

       If you have found a bug with a non-standard port (one that was not part of the <u>standard</u> <u>distribu</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion),&nbsp;distribution),</font>
       <u>tion</u>), a binary distribution, or a non-standard module (such as Tk, CGI, etc), then please see the
       documentation that came with that distribution to determine the correct place to report bugs.

       "perlbug" is designed to be used interactively. Normally no arguments will be needed.  Simply run it,
       and follow the prompts.

       If you are unable to run <b>perlbug</b> (most likely because you don't have a working setup to send mail
       that perlbug recognizes), you may have to compose your own report, and email it to <b>perlbug@perl.org</b>.
       You might find the <b>-d</b> option useful to get summary information in that case.

       In any case, when reporting a bug, please make sure you have run through this checklist:

       What version of Perl you are running?
           Type "perl -v" at the command line to find out.

       Are you running the latest released version of perl?
           Look at <a href="http://www.perl.com/">http://www.perl.com/</a> to find out.  If it is not the latest released version, get that one
           and see whether your bug has been fixed.  Note that bug reports about old versions of Perl, espe-
           cially those prior to the 5.0 release, are likely to fall upon deaf ears.  You are on your own if
           you continue to use perl1 .. perl4.

       Are you sure what you have is a bug?
           A significant number of the bug reports we get turn out to be documented features in Perl.  Make
           sure the behavior you are witnessing doesn't fall under that category, by glancing through the
           documentation that comes with Perl (we'll admit this is no mean task, given the sheer volume of
           it all, but at least have a look at the sections that <u>seem</u> relevant).

           Be aware of the familiar traps that perl programmers of various hues fall into.  See perltrap.

           Check in perldiag to see what any Perl error <!-- a -->message(s)<!-- /a --> mean.  If message isn't in perldiag, it
           probably isn't generated by Perl.  Consult your operating system documentation instead.

           If you are on a non-UNIX platform check also perlport, as some features may be unimplemented or
           work differently.

           Try to study the problem under the Perl debugger, if necessary.  See perldebug.

       Do you have a proper test case?
           The easier it is to reproduce your bug, the more likely it will be fixed, because if no one can
           duplicate the problem, no one can fix it.  A good test case has most of these attributes: fewest
           possible number of lines; few dependencies on external commands, modules, or libraries; runs on
           most platforms unimpeded; and is self-documenting.

           A good test case is almost always a good candidate to be on the perl test suite.  If you have the
           time, consider making your test case so that it will readily fit into the standard test suite.

           Remember also to include the <b>exact</b> error messages, if any.  "Perl complained something" is not an
           exact error message.

           If you get a core dump (or equivalent), you may use a debugger (<b>dbx</b>, <b>gdb</b>, etc) to produce a stack
           trace to include in the bug report.  NOTE: unless your Perl has been compiled with debug info
           (often <b>-g</b>), the stack trace is likely to be somewhat hard to use because it will most probably
           contain only the function names and not their arguments.  If possible, recompile your Perl with
           debug info and reproduce the dump and the stack trace.

       Can you describe the bug in plain English?
           The easier it is to understand a reproducible bug, the more likely it will be fixed.  Anything
           you can provide by way of insight into the problem helps a great deal.  In other words, try to
           analyze the problem (to the extent you can) and report your discoveries.

       Can you fix the bug yourself?
           A bug report which <u>includes</u> <u>a</u> <u>patch</u> <u>to</u> <u>fix</u> <u>it</u> will almost definitely be fixed.  Use the "diff"
           program to generate your patches ("diff" is being maintained by the GNU folks as part of the <b>dif</b>-
           <b>futils</b> package, so you should be able to get it from any of the GNU software repositories).  If
           you do submit a patch, the cool-dude counter at perlbug@perl.org will register you as a savior of
           the world.  Your patch may be returned with requests for changes, or requests for more detailed
           explanations about your fix.

           Here are some clues for creating quality patches: Use the <b>-c</b> or <b>-u</b> switches to the diff program
           (to create a so-called context or unified diff).  Make sure the patch is not reversed (the first
           argument to diff is typically the original file, the second argument your changed file).  Make
           sure you test your patch by applying it with the "patch" program before you send it on its way.
           Try to follow the same style as the code you are trying to patch.  Make sure your patch really
           does work ("make test", if the thing you're patching supports it).

       Can you use "perlbug" to submit the report?
           <b>perlbug</b> will, amongst other things, ensure your report includes crucial information about your
           version of perl.  If "perlbug" is unable to mail your report after you have typed it in, you may
           have to compose the message yourself, add the output produced by "perlbug -d" and email it to
           <b>perlbug@perl.org</b>.  If, for some reason, you cannot run "perlbug" at all on your system, be sure
           to include the entire output produced by running "perl -V" (note the uppercase V).

           Whether you use "perlbug" or send the email manually, please make your Subject line informative.
           "a bug" not informative.  Neither is "perl crashes" nor "HELP!!!".  These don't help.  A compact
           description of what's wrong is fine.

       Having done your bit, please be prepared to wait, to be told the bug is in your code, or even to get
       no reply at all.  The Perl maintainers are busy folks, so if your problem is a small one or if it is
       difficult to understand or already known, they may not respond with a personal reply.  If it is
       important to you that your bug be fixed, do monitor the "Changes" file in any development releases
       since the time you submitted the bug, and encourage the maintainers with kind words (but never any
       flames!).  Feel free to resend your bug report if the next released version of perl comes out and
       your bug is still present.

<b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-a</b>      Address to send the report to.  Defaults to <b>perlbug@perl.org</b>.

       <b>-A</b>      Don't send a bug received acknowledgement to the reply address.  Generally it is only a sen-
               sible to use this option if you are a perl maintainer actively watching perl porters for your
               message to arrive.

       <b>-b</b>      Body of the report.  If not included on the command line, or in a file with <b>-f</b>, you will get
               a chance to edit the message.

       <b>-C</b>      Don't send copy to administrator.

       <b>-c</b>      Address to send copy of report to.  Defaults to the address of the local perl administrator
               (recorded when perl was built).

       <b>-d</b>      Data mode (the default if you redirect or pipe output).  This prints out your configuration
               data, without mailing anything.  You can use this with <b>-v</b> to get more complete data.

       <b>-e</b>      Editor to use.

       <b>-f</b>      File containing the body of the report.  Use this to quickly send a prepared message.

       <b>-F</b>      File to output the results to instead of sending as an email. Useful particularly when run-
               ning perlbug on a machine with no direct internet connection.

       <b>-h</b>      Prints a brief summary of the options.

       <b>-ok</b>     Report successful build on this system to perl porters. Forces <b>-S</b> and <b>-C</b>. Forces and supplies
               values for <b>-s</b> and <b>-b</b>. Only prompts for a return address if it cannot guess it (for use with
               <b>make</b>). Honors return address specified with <b>-r</b>.  You can use this with <b>-v</b> to get more com-
               plete data.   Only makes a report if this system is less than 60 days old.

       <b>-okay</b>   As <b>-ok</b> except it will report on older systems.

       <b>-nok</b>    Report unsuccessful build on this system.  Forces <b>-C</b>.  Forces and supplies a value for <b>-s</b>,
               then requires you to edit the report and say what went wrong.  Alternatively, a prepared
               report may be supplied using <b>-f</b>.  Only prompts for a return address if it cannot guess it
               (for use with <b>make</b>). Honors return address specified with <b>-r</b>.  You can use this with <b>-v</b> to
               get more complete data.  Only makes a report if this system is less than 60 days old.

       <b>-nokay</b>  As <b>-nok</b> except it will report on older systems.

       <b>-r</b>      Your return address.  The program will ask you to confirm its default if you don't use this
               option.

       <b>-S</b>      Send without asking for confirmation.

       <b>-s</b>      Subject to include with the message.  You will be prompted if you don't supply one on the
               command line.

       <b>-t</b>      Test mode.  The target address defaults to <b>perlbug-test@perl.org</b>.

       <b>-v</b>      Include verbose configuration data in the report.
