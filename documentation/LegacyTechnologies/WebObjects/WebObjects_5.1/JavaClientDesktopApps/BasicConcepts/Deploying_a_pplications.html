and Using Java Client Applications</font></h2><!-- apple_doc: pageHeadingEnd -->

<p>HTML-based WebObjects applications require only a Web browser
on the client. The client requirements for Java Client desktop applications,
however, are considerably more demanding. </p>
<p>Java Client applications can be deployed as either applets
running within a browser or as real desktop applications. Either
deployment option is feasible, but you should carefully evaluate
both options after understanding their respective strengths and
weaknesses.</p>
<dl><dt>Installation</dt>
<dd>Applets require no installation of the Java Client application
on the user's part, since the Web browser handles the downloading
of classes. Applications, however, need to be installed on the client.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Upgrades</dt>
<dd>Using applets, the upgrade process is invisible to the
user. Using applications, the user must perform upgrades manually,
and a versioning scheme must be devised to ensure compatibility
between client and server.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Platform support</dt>
<dd>Both applications and applets require the presence of
JRE 1.3 or later on the client. Mac OS X provides out-of-the-box
support for JRE 1.3. On other platforms, the JRE must be downloaded
and installed. Internet Explorer for Mac OS X 10.1 supports embedded
applets as well, and Sun's Java plugin for Web browsers provides
support for running applets on other platforms. So, in terms of
portability, systems with the correct JRE can run Java Client applications
as either applets or as full desktop applications.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>User experience</dt>
<dd>Running Java Client applications as desktop applications
always provides a better user experience than running as applets.
Applets can take down the Java virtual machine and other applets,
and applets generally don't have the fit and finish of Java desktop
applications. Java Client applications running as desktop applications
in Mac OS X take advantage of platform-specific features such as the
global menu bar and the dirty window marker.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Performance</dt>
<dd>Generally, applications perform better than applets,
since Web browsers provide more security checks than applications
and perform other operations that degrade performance. But even
so, the performance difference between applets and applications
should be an insignificant factor in choosing a deployment method.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Security</dt>
<dd>From the user's perspective, running as applets is
inherently more secure, since applets prevent the JVM from accessing
the file system or other parts of the user's system. Developers
usually prefer applications over applets because they don't have
to worry about the security restrictions inherent to Web browsers.</dd></dl>

<td scope="row"><b>Note: </b>A
new technology in the JDK, Web Start, alleviates the issues with
application installation and upgrades. It allows users to access
applications from hyperlinks in Web browsers. The hyperlink invokes
Web Start on the client, which takes care of downloading all the
classes needed for the client-side application.</td>
