PERLSTYLE(1)                          Perl Programmers Reference Guide                          PERLSTYLE(1)



<b>NAME</b>
       perlstyle - Perl style guide

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       Each programmer will, of course, have his or her own preferences in regards to formatting, but there
       are some general guidelines that will make your programs easier to read, understand, and maintain.

       The most important thing is to run your programs under the <b>-w</b> flag at all times.  You may turn it off
       explicitly for particular portions of code via the "no warnings" pragma or the $^W variable if you
       must.  You should also always run under "use strict" or know the reason why not.  The "use sigtrap"
       and even "use diagnostics" pragmas may also prove useful.

       Regarding aesthetics of code lay out, about the only thing Larry cares strongly about is that the
       closing curly bracket of a multi-line BLOCK should line up with the keyword that started the con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">struct.&nbsp;construct.</font>
       struct.  Beyond that, he has other preferences that aren't so strong:

          4-column indent.

          Opening curly on same line as keyword, if possible, otherwise line up.

          Space before the opening curly of a multi-line BLOCK.

          One-line BLOCK may be put on one line, including curlies.

          No space before the semicolon.

          Semicolon omitted in "short" one-line BLOCK.

          Space around most operators.

          Space around a "complex" subscript (inside brackets).

          Blank lines between chunks that do different things.

          Uncuddled elses.

          No space between function name and its opening parenthesis.

          Space after each comma.

          Long lines broken after an operator (except "and" and "or").

          Space after last parenthesis matching on current line.

          Line up corresponding items vertically.

          Omit redundant punctuation as long as clarity doesn't suffer.

       Larry has his reasons for each of these things, but he doesn't claim that everyone else's mind works
       the same as his does.

       Here are some other more substantive style issues to think about:

          Just because you <u>CAN</u> do something a particular way doesn't mean that you <u>SHOULD</u> do it that way.
           Perl is designed to give you several ways to do anything, so consider picking the most readable
           one.  For instance

               open(FOO,$foo) || die "Can't open $foo: $!";

           is better than

               die "Can't open $foo: $!" unless open(FOO,$foo);

           because the second way hides the main point of the statement in a modifier.  On the other hand

               print "Starting analysis\n" if $verbose;

           is better than

               $verbose &amp;&amp; print "Starting analysis\n";

           because the main point isn't whether the user typed <b>-v</b> or not.

           Similarly, just because an operator lets you assume default arguments doesn't mean that you have
           to make use of the defaults.  The defaults are there for lazy systems programmers writing one-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">shot&nbsp;oneshot</font>
           shot programs.  If you want your program to be readable, consider supplying the argument.

           Along the same lines, just because you <u>CAN</u> omit parentheses in many places doesn't mean that you
           ought to:

               return print reverse sort num values %array;
               return print(reverse(sort num (values(%array))));

           When in doubt, parenthesize.  At the very least it will let some poor schmuck bounce on the % key
           in <b>vi</b>.

           Even if you aren't in doubt, consider the mental welfare of the person who has to maintain the
           code after you, and who will probably put parentheses in the wrong place.

          Don't go through silly contortions to exit a loop at the top or the bottom, when Perl provides
           the "last" operator so you can exit in the middle.  Just "outdent" it a little to make it more
           visible:

               LINE:
                   for (;;) {
                       statements;
                     last LINE if $foo;
                       next LINE if /^#/;
                       statements;
                   }

          Don't be afraid to use loop labels--they're there to enhance readability as well as to allow mul-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tilevel&nbsp;multilevel</font>
           tilevel loop breaks.  See the previous example.

          Avoid using "grep()" (or "map()") or `backticks` in a void context, that is, when you just throw
           away their return values.  Those functions all have return values, so use them.  Otherwise use a
           "foreach()" loop or the "system()" function instead.

          For portability, when using features that may not be implemented on every machine, test the con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">struct&nbsp;construct</font>
           struct in an eval to see if it fails.  If you know what version or patchlevel a particular fea-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ture&nbsp;feature</font>
           ture was implemented, you can test $] ($PERL_VERSION in "English") to see if it will be there.
           The "Config" module will also let you interrogate values determined by the <b>Configure</b> program when
           Perl was installed.

          Choose mnemonic identifiers.  If you can't remember what mnemonic means, you've got a problem.

          While short identifiers like $gotit are probably ok, use underscores to separate words in longer
           identifiers.  It is generally easier to read $var_names_like_this than $VarNamesLikeThis, espe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cially&nbsp;especially</font>
           cially for non-native speakers of English. It's also a simple rule that works consistently with
           "VAR_NAMES_LIKE_THIS".

           Package names are sometimes an exception to this rule.  Perl informally reserves lowercase module
           names for "pragma" modules like "integer" and "strict".  Other modules should begin with a capi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tal&nbsp;capital</font>
           tal letter and use mixed case, but probably without underscores due to limitations in primitive
           file systems' representations of module names as files that must fit into a few sparse bytes.

          You may find it helpful to use letter case to indicate the scope or nature of a variable. For
           example:

               $ALL_CAPS_HERE   constants only (beware clashes with perl vars!)
               $Some_Caps_Here  package-wide global/static
               $no_caps_here    function scope my() or local() variables

           Function and method names seem to work best as all lowercase.  E.g., "$obj-&gt;as_string()".

           You can use a leading underscore to indicate that a variable or function should not be used out-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">side&nbsp;outside</font>
           side the package that defined it.

          If you have a really hairy regular expression, use the "/x" modifier and put in some whitespace
           to make it look a little less like line noise.  Don't use slash as a delimiter when your regexp
           has slashes or backslashes.

          Use the new "and" and "or" operators to avoid having to parenthesize list operators so much, and
           to reduce the incidence of punctuation operators like "&amp;&amp;" and "||".  Call your subroutines as if
           they were functions or list operators to avoid excessive ampersands and parentheses.

          Use here documents instead of repeated "print()" statements.

          Line up corresponding things vertically, especially if it'd be too long to fit on one line any-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">way.&nbsp;anyway.</font>
           way.

               $IDX = $ST_MTIME;
               $IDX = $ST_ATIME       if $opt_u;
               $IDX = $ST_CTIME       if $opt_c;
               $IDX = $ST_SIZE        if $opt_s;

               mkdir $tmpdir, 0700 or die "can't mkdir $tmpdir: $!";
               chdir($tmpdir)      or die "can't chdir $tmpdir: $!";
               mkdir 'tmp',   0777 or die "can't mkdir $tmpdir/tmp: $!";

          Always check the return codes of system calls.  Good error messages should go to "STDERR",
           include which program caused the problem, what the failed system call and arguments were, and
           (VERY IMPORTANT) should contain the standard system error message for what went wrong.  Here's a
           simple but sufficient example:

               opendir(D, $dir)     or die "can't opendir $dir: $!";

          Line up your transliterations when it makes sense:

               tr [abc]
                  [xyz];

          Think about reusability.  Why waste brainpower on a one-shot when you might want to do something
           like it again?  Consider generalizing your code.  Consider writing a module or object class.
           Consider making your code run cleanly with "use strict" and "use warnings" (or <b>-w</b>) in effect.
           Consider giving away your code.  Consider changing your whole world view.  Consider... oh, never
           mind.

          Try to document your code and use Pod formatting in a consistent way. Here are commonly expected
           conventions:

              use "C&lt;&gt;" for function, variable and module names (and more generally anything that can be
               considered part of code, like filehandles or specific values). Note that function names are
               considered more readable with parentheses after their name, that is "function()".

              use "B&lt;&gt;" for commands names like <b>cat</b> or <b>grep</b>.

              use "F&lt;&gt;" or "C&lt;&gt;" for file names. "F&lt;&gt;" should be the only Pod code for file names, but as
               most Pod formatters render it as italic, Unix and Windows paths with their slashes and back-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">slashes&nbsp;backslashes</font>
               slashes may be less readable, and better rendered with "C&lt;&gt;".

          Be consistent.

          Be nice.
