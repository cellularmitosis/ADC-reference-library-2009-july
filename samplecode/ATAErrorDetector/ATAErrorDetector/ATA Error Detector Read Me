This is sample code demonstrating how to detect the two errors mentioned in the technote titled, "PowerBook HD Upgrades and SCSI disk mode Compatibility".  The two errors only apply if all the following conditions are true:1) You are using SCSI disk mode.  If you never use SCSI disk mode, then none of this applies.  Ignore this application, sample code, and documentation.2) You have upgraded your PowerBook by substituting a larger capacity hard drive, and you are using a PowerBook that takes an ATA hard drive.  Such PowerBooks are the Duo 2300c, the PowerBook 190, 5300, 1400, 2400 and 3400.  PowerBooks such as the PowerBook G3 introduced in November 1997 and any PowerBooks introduced after November 1997 do not have these problems.  PowerBooks with SCSI disks do not have this problem.Remember, even if you get a warning from this program that your hard disk should not be used in SCSI disk mode, it is still okay in normal operation.  Just don't plug in the special cable that turns your PowerBook into a hard disk.You shouldn't encounter any problems running this program.  You may get an error when it tries to check your CD-ROM drive (.AppleCD); ignore any such error.Comments, feedback, etc. should go to devsupport@apple.com.  Thanks!--Brian Bechtel, November 1997
