/**  WARNING: THIS CODE REQUIRES GARBAGE COLLECTION!
 **  This sample application uses Objective-C 2.0 garbage collection.
 **  Therefore, the source code in this file does NOT perform manual object memory management.
 **  If you reuse any of this code in a process that isn't garbage collected, you will need to
 **  add all necessary retain/release/autorelease calls, and implement -dealloc methods,
 **  otherwise unpleasant leakage will occur!
