PING6(8)                  BSD System Manager's Manual                 PING6(8)

<b>NAME</b>
     <b>ping6</b> -- send ICMPv6 ECHO_REQUEST packets to network hosts

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
     <b>ping6</b> [<b>-dfHnNqRtvwW</b>] [<b>-a</b> <u>addrtype</u>] [<b>-b</b> <u>bufsiz</u>] [<b>-c</b> <u>count</u>] [<b>-h</b> <u>hoplimit</u>] [<b>-I</b> <u>interface</u>] [<b>-i</b> <u>wait</u>]
           [<b>-l</b> <u>preload</u>] [<b>-p</b> <u>pattern</u>] [<b>-P</b> <u>policy</u>] [<b>-S</b> <u>sourceaddr</u>] [<b>-s</b> <u>packetsize</u>] [<u>hops...</u>] <u>host</u>

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
     <b>ping6</b> uses the ICMPv6 protocol's mandatory ICMP6_ECHO_REQUEST datagram to elicit an ICMP6_ECHO_REPLY
     from a host or gateway.  ICMP6_ECHO_REQUEST datagrams (``pings'') have an IPv6 header, and ICMPv6
     header formatted as documented in RFC2463.  The options are as follows:

     <b>-a</b> <u>addrtype</u>
             Generate ICMPv6 Node Information Node Addresses query, rather than echo-request.  <u>addrtype</u> must
             be a string constructed of the following characters.
             <b>a</b>       requests all the responder's unicast addresses.  If the character is omitted, only
                     those addresses which belong to the interface which has the responder's address are
                     requests.
             <b>c</b>       requests responder's IPv4-compatible and IPv4-mapped addresses.
             <b>g</b>       requests responder's global-scope addresses.
             <b>s</b>       requests responder's site-local addresses.
             <b>l</b>       requests responder's link-local addresses.
             <b>A</b>       requests responder's anycast addresses.  Without this character, the responder will
                     return unicast addresses only.  With this character, the responder will return anycast
                     addresses only.  Note that the specification does not specify how to get responder's
                     anycast addresses.  This is an experimental option.

     <b>-b</b> <u>bufsiz</u>
             Set socket buffer size.

     <b>-c</b> <u>count</u>
             Stop after sending (and receiving) <u>count</u> ECHO_RESPONSE packets.

     <b>-d</b>      Set the SO_DEBUG option on the socket being used.

     <b>-f</b>      Flood ping.  Outputs packets as fast as they come back or one hundred times per second, which-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ever&nbsp;whichever</font>
             ever is more.  For every ECHO_REQUEST sent a period ``.'' is printed, while for every
             ECHO_REPLY received a backspace is printed.  This provides a rapid display of how many packets
             are being dropped.  Only the super-user may use this option.  <u>This</u> <u>can</u> <u>be</u> <u>very</u> <u>hard</u> <u>on</u> <u>a</u> <u>net</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">work&nbsp;network</font>
             <u>work</u> <u>and</u> <u>should</u> <u>be</u> <u>used</u> <u>with</u> <u>caution.</u>

     <b>-H</b>      Specifies to try reverse-lookup of IPv6 addresses.  The <b>ping6</b> command does not try reverse-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lookup&nbsp;reverselookup</font>
             lookup unless the option is specified.

     <b>-h</b> <u>hoplimit</u>
             Set the IPv6 hoplimit.

     <b>-I</b> <u>interface</u>
             Source packets with the given interface address.  This flag applies if the ping destination is
             a multicast address, or link-local/site-local unicast address.

     <b>-i</b> <u>wait</u>
             Wait <u>wait</u> seconds <u>between</u> <u>sending</u> <u>each</u> <u>packet</u>.  The default is to wait for one second between
             each packet.  This option is incompatible with the <b>-f</b> option.

     <b>-l</b> <u>preload</u>
             If <u>preload</u> is specified, <b>ping6</b> sends that many packets as fast as possible before falling into
             its normal mode of behavior.  Only the super-user may use this option.

     <b>-n</b>      Numeric output only.  No attempt will be made to lookup symbolic names from addresses in the
             reply.

     <b>-N</b>      Probe node information multicast group (ff02::2:xxxx:xxxx).  <u>host</u> must be string hostname of
             the target (must not be a numeric IPv6 address).  Node information multicast group will be com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">puted&nbsp;computed</font>
             puted based on given <u>host</u>, and will be used as the final destination.  Since node information
             multicast group is a link-local multicast group, destination link needs to be specified by <b>-I</b>
             option.

     <b>-p</b> <u>pattern</u>
             You may specify up to 16 ``pad'' bytes to fill out the packet you send.  This is useful for
             diagnosing data-dependent problems in a network.  For example, ``-p ff'' will cause the sent
             packet to be filled with all ones.

     <b>-P</b> <u>policy</u>
             <u>policy</u> specifies IPsec policy to be used for the probe.

     <b>-q</b>      Quiet output.  Nothing is displayed except the summary lines at startup time and when finished.

     <b>-R</b>      Make the kernel believe that the target <u>host</u> (or the first <u>hop</u> if you specify <u>hops</u>) is reach-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able,&nbsp;reachable,</font>
             able, by injecting upper-layer reachability confirmation hint.  The option is meaningful only
             if the target <u>host</u> (or the first hop) is a neighbor.

     <b>-S</b> <u>sourceaddr</u>
             Specifies the source address of request packets.  The source address must be one of the unicast
             addresses of the sending node.  If the outgoing interface is specified by the <b>-I</b> option as
             well, <u>sourceaddr</u> needs to be an address assigned to the specified interface.

     <b>-s</b> <u>packetsize</u>
             Specifies the number of data bytes to be sent.  The default is 56, which translates into 64
             ICMP data bytes when combined with the 8 bytes of ICMP header data.  You may need to specify <b>-b</b>
             as well to extend socket buffer size.

     <b>-t</b>      Generate ICMPv6 Node Information supported query types query, rather than echo-request.  <b>-s</b> has
             no effect if <b>-t</b> is specified.

     <b>-v</b>      Verbose output.  ICMP packets other than ECHO_RESPONSE that are received are listed.

     <b>-w</b>      Generate ICMPv6 Node Information DNS Name query, rather than echo-request.  <b>-s</b> has no effect if
             <b>-w</b> is specified.

     <b>-W</b>      Same as <b>-w</b>, but with old packet format based on 03 draft.  This option is present for backward
             compatibility.  <b>-s</b> has no effect if <b>-w</b> is specified.

     <u>hops</u>    IPv6 addresses for intermediate nodes, which will be put into type 0 routing header.

     <u>host</u>    IPv6 adddress of the final destination node.

     When using <b>ping6</b> for fault isolation, it should first be run on the local host, to verify that the
     local network interface is up and running.  Then, hosts and gateways further and further away should be
     ``pinged''.  Round-trip times and packet loss statistics are computed.  If duplicate packets are
     received, they are not included in the packet loss calculation, although the round trip time of these
     packets is used in calculating the round-trip time statistics.  When the specified number of packets
     have been sent (and received) or if the program is terminated with a SIGINT, a brief summary is dis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">played,&nbsp;displayed,</font>
     played, showing the number of packets sent and received, and the minimum, maximum, mean, and standard
     deviation of the round-trip times.

     This program is intended for use in network testing, measurement and management.  Because of the load
     it can impose on the network, it is unwise to use <b>ping6</b> during normal operations or from automated
     scripts.

<b>DUPLICATE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>DAMAGED</b> <b>PACKETS</b>
     <b>ping6</b> will report duplicate and damaged packets.  Duplicate packets should never occur when pinging a
     unicast address, and seem to be caused by inappropriate link-level retransmissions.  Duplicates may
     occur in many situations and are rarely (if ever) a good sign, although the presence of low levels of
     duplicates may not always be cause for alarm.  Duplicates are expected when pinging a broadcast or mul-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ticast&nbsp;multicast</font>
     ticast address, since they are not really duplicates but replies from different hosts to the same
     request.

     Damaged packets are obviously serious cause for alarm and often indicate broken hardware somewhere in
     the <b>ping6</b> packet's path (in the network or in the hosts).

<b>TRYING</b> <b>DIFFERENT</b> <b>DATA</b> <b>PATTERNS</b>
     The (inter)network layer should never treat packets differently depending on the data contained in the
     data portion.  Unfortunately, data-dependent problems have been known to sneak into networks and remain
     undetected for long periods of time.  In many cases the particular pattern that will have problems is
     something that does not have sufficient ``transitions'', such as all ones or all zeros, or a pattern
     right at the edge, such as almost all zeros.  It is not necessarily enough to specify a data pattern of
     all zeros (for example) on the command line because the pattern that is of interest is at the data link
     level, and the relationship between what you type and what the controllers transmit can be complicated.

     This means that if you have a data-dependent problem you will probably have to do a lot of testing to
     find it.  If you are lucky, you may manage to find a file that either cannot be sent across your net-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">work&nbsp;network</font>
     work or that takes much longer to transfer than other similar length files.  You can then examine this
     file for repeated patterns that you can test using the <b>-p</b> option of <b>ping6</b>.

<b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b>
     <b>ping6</b> returns 0 on success (the host is alive), and non-zero if the arguments are incorrect or the host
     is not responding.

<b>EXAMPLES</b>
     Normally, ping6(8) works just like <a href="ping.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/ping">ping(8)</a> would work; the following will send ICMPv6 echo request to
     dst.foo.com.

           ping6 -n dst.foo.com

     The following will probe hostnames for all nodes on the network link attached to wi0 interface.  The
     address ff02::1 is named the link-local all-node multicast address, and the packet would reach every
     node on the network link.

           ping6 -w ff02::1%wi0

     The following will probe addresses assigned to the destination node, dst.foo.com.

           ping6 -a agl dst.foo.com

<b>BUGS</b>
     There have been many discussions on why we separate ping6(8) and <a href="ping.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/ping">ping(8)</a>.  Some people argued that it
     would be more convenient to uniform the ping command for both IPv4 and IPv6.  The followings are an
     answer to the request.

     From a developer's point of view: since the underling raw sockets API is totally different between IPv4
     and IPv6, we would end up having two types of code base.  There would actually be less benefit to uni-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">form&nbsp;uniform</font>
     form the two commands into a single command from the developer's standpoint.

     From an operator's point of view: unlike ordinary network applications like remote login tools, we are
     usually aware of address family when using network management tools.  We do not just want to know the
     reachability to the host, but want to know the reachability to the host via a particular network proto-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">col&nbsp;protocol</font>
     col such as IPv6.  Thus, even if we had a unified <a href="ping.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/ping">ping(8)</a> command for both IPv4 and IPv6, we would usu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ally&nbsp;usually</font>
     ally type a <b>-6</b> or <b>-4</b> option (or something like those) to specify the particular address family.  This
     essentially means that we have two different commands.

<b>HISTORY</b>
     The <a href="ping.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/ping">ping(8)</a> command appeared in 4.3BSD.  The <b>ping6</b> command with IPv6 support first appeared in WIDE
     Hydrangea IPv6 protocol stack kit.

     IPv6 and IPsec support based on the KAME Project (<a href="http://www.kame.net/)">http://www.kame.net/)</a> stack was initially integrated
     into FreeBSD 4.0
