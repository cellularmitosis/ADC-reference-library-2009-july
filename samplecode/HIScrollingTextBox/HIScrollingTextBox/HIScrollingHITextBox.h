If this parameter is NULL, the *      view defaults to have empty bounds ( 0, 0, 0, 0 ). *     *    inURLRef: *      The CFURLRef to the text to be displayed in the box. *     *    inAutoScroll: *      If true then the text scrolls automatically using the following parameters, *      If false then the text has to be scrolled manually using the visible scroll bar. *     *    inDelayBeforeAutoScroll: *      If inAutoScroll is true, then this is the delay before the automatic scrolling starts, *      If inAutoScroll is false, this parameter is ignored. *     *    inDelayBetweenAutoScroll: *      If inAutoScroll is true, then this parameter and the next one set the automatic scrolling speed, *      If inAutoScroll is false, this parameter is ignored. *     *    inAutoScrollAmount: *      If inAutoScroll is true, then this parameter and the previous one set the automatic scrolling speed, *      If inAutoScroll is false, this parameter is ignored. *     *    outHIView: *      On exit, contains the new HIView. *   *  Availability: *    Mac OS X:         in version 10.2 and later since it needs the HIView APIs *    CarbonLib:        not available *    Non-Carbon CFM:   not available */extern OSStatus HICreateScrollingHITextBox(	const HIRect * inBounds,                   /* can be NULL */	CFURLRef       inURLRef,	Boolean        inAutoScroll,	UInt32         inDelayBeforeAutoScroll,	UInt32         inDelayBetweenAutoScroll,	UInt16         inAutoScrollAmount,	HIViewRef *    outHIView);#ifdef __cplusplus}#endif#endif
