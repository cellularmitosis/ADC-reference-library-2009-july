// However, these accessors are merely convenience accessors for the same information
// but conveniently provides you, for example, the actual icon image, plus extended localized string
// information (display name and description)
//
// note:
// these are provided due to the fact that this information may be different
// than what's on disk, they are localized strings used for display purposes in the UI

-(void)close;	// closes its window
