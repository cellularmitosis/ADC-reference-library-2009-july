                                                     ð                                 QuickTime Updates to Universal Interfaces 3.4 The QuickTimeLib and QTStreamLib CFM stub libraries in Universal Interfaces 3.4 are missing the symbols for APIs first made available in QuickTime 5.0.1. The replacement stub libraries provided here include these symbols and should be used to replace the existing file in the :Libraries:StubLibraries: folder of Universal Interfaces 3.4.The additional symbols provided by these stub libaries are:* from QuickTimeComponents.iDataHGetInfo* from QuickTimeStreaming.iQTSPresGetSettingsAsTextQTSPresSettingsDialogWithFiltersQTSPrefsAddProxyUserInfoQTSPrefsFindProxyUserInfoByTypeQTSInitializeMediaParams* from QTStreamingComponents.iQTSSourcerInitializeIf you do not use these APIs, the use of these replacement stub libraries is not necessary.These libraries should only be used with Universal Interfaces 3.4.0, as releases of Universal Interfaces after 3.4.0 will include the above symbols.
