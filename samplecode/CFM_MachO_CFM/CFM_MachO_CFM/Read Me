CFM_MachO_CFM Notes:---------------------This sample was built with CodeWarrior Pro 6.This sample requires the enclosed Mach-O bundle "Test.bundle" be located at "/"This sample demonstrates how to call a Mach-O function which takes a callbackfunction pointer as a parameter.  The main CFM application readies the callbackfunction by calling a routine MachOFunctionPointerForCFMFunctionPointer() whichgenerates power pc assembly glue to call the passed in function pointer.   Thisgenerated glue is then passed to the Mach-O routine as the callback parameter.
