GCC 4.0 will be the default compiler on Mac OS X for C, C++, Objective-C, and Objective-C++ source code after this package is installed. GCC 3.3, which was the default compiler in the Mac OS X 10.3 Development Tools, continues to be provided for backward compatibility.</p><p>These release notes are not comprehensive.

GCC 2.95 and GCC 3.1 are no longer provided.</p><p>Here are some important things to keep in mind before you switch from an earlier compiler version to GCC 4.0.</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Recompile all your C++ and Objective-C++ code, including all libraries and frameworks that export a C++ interface. The application binary interface (ABI) for C++ programs changed between GCC 3.1 and GCC 3.3, and again between GCC 3.3 and GCC 4.0. The changes are small bug fixes, but are still large enough to prevent a mixed C++ program from operating correctly. <em>Do not link C++ modules compiled with one of these compilers against modules compiled with the other.</em> Even if the modules appear to link correctly, C++ ABI differences may still cause problems that will not manifest themselves until run time.</p></li><li class="li"><p>You do not need to recompile C or Objective-C code (unless you're using long double as described below). The C and Objective-C ABI has not changed.</p></li><li class="li"><p>You do not need to recompile C or Objective-C code (unless you're using long double as described below). The C and Objective-C ABI has not changed.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Test your code. Even if the compiler doesn't raise any errors or warnings, your code may rely on idiosyncrasies in previous compilers that GCC 4.0 handles differently. As one example, where order of execution is undefined there are cases where gcc 3.3 and gcc 4.0 make different choices.</p></li></ul><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001825-DontLinkElementID_18" title="Switching between compilers"></a><h4>Switching between compilers</h4><p>Both compilers may coexist on the same system. GCC 3.3 is always available as <code>/usr/bin/gcc-3.3</code>, and GCC 4.0 is always available as <code>/usr/bin/gcc-4.0</code>. In addition, there are symbolic links at <code>/usr/bin/cc</code> and <code>/usr/bin/gcc</code> that point to the selected compiler. By default, the selected compiler is GCC 4.0.</p><p>If you have a lot of make files and shell scripts that refer to <code>/usr/bin/cc</code> or <code>/usr/bin/gcc</code>, changing all those references to your compiler of choice may be impractical. In that case, use the gcc_select command to change the selected compiler.</p><p>To use GCC 3.3 as the selected compiler:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Open the Terminal, and enter <code>sudo /usr/sbin/gcc_select 3.3</code>. If you're asked, enter your password.</p></li><li class="li"><p>This command line logs in as root, makes the neccesary changes, and leaves you logged in under your original account. When it's done, <code>/usr/bin/cc</code> and <code>/usr/bin/gcc</code> use GCC 3.3.</p></li></ul><p>To use GCC 4.0 as the selected compiler:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Open the Terminal, and enter <code>sudo /usr/sbin/gcc_select 4.0</code>.

Choose Settings -> Simple View -> GCC Compiler Settings. Select the compiler with which you wish to build the target using the <strong>Compiler version</strong> popup.</p><p>To set the compiler for a native target, bring up the inspector for the target. Select the <strong>Build Rules</strong> tab. If the compiler shown in the System C Rule is not the desired compiler, then add a new build rule by clicking on the + button. Configure your new build rule to process "C source files" using the desired version of GCC. If you wish to revert to using the system compiler, you can delete the build rule.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001825-DontLinkElementID_20" title="Documentation"></a><h3>Documentation</h3><p>Documentation for the 4.0 compiler is available in /Developer/ADC Reference Library/documentation/DeveloperTools/gcc-4.0.0.</p><p>Documentation for the 3.3 compiler is available in /Developer/ADC Reference Library/documentation/DeveloperTools/gcc-3.3.</p><p>Look for additional and updated documentation on the <span class="content_text"><a href="http://developer.apple.com/referencelibrary/DeveloperTools" target="_top">ADC web site</a></span>.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001825-DontLinkElementID_21" title="Source code compatibility issues"></a><h3>Source code compatibility issues</h3><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001825-DontLinkElementID_22" title="Changes related to C++ templates"></a><h4>Changes related to C++ templates</h4><p>GCC 4.0 has moved much closer to full conformance with the C++ standard; the only remaining C++ language feature that is not yet supported is export. As a result of this better conformance, some incorrect programs that were accepted by GCC 3.3 will have to be modified for compilation with GCC 4.0. This section describes some of the main issues; see the FSF 3.4 release notes and the FSF 4.0 release notes for a more complete list.</p><p>Complete template specialization requires the <code>template&lt;></code> syntax, as described in the C++ standard. (This is because of uniformity between complete specialization and partial specialization.) For example:</p><div class="codesample"><table><tr><td scope="row"><pre>template&lt;> class X&lt;int> { ... };<span></span></pre></td></tr></table></div><p>is a syntactially valid template specialization, but</p><div class="codesample"><table><tr><td scope="row"><pre>class X&lt;int> { ... };<span></span></pre></td></tr></table></div><p>is not. Earlier versions of GCC incorrectly accepted the latter form.</p><p>GCC 4.0 now implements "two-phase name lookup" correctly. This has the following consequences:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Within a template, you have to use the the <code>typename</code> keyword when a nested type depends on a template parameter. For example, if <code>T</code> is a template parameter, you have to write <code>typename list&lt;T>::iterator</code>, not just <code>list&lt;T>::iterator</code>. Without the typename, the compiler will parse this under the assumption that the name iterator doesn't refer to a type. (See section 14.6 of the C++ standard for more details.)</p></li><li class="li"><p>Names that do not depend on a template parameter are looked up at the point of template definition, not the point of instantiation. Within a template, for example, <code>f(3)</code> means whatever overload of <code>f</code> best matches an <code>int</code> argument <em>at the point where the template is defined</em>. If there is no appropriate version of <code>f</code> in scope then this is an error, even if such a function is declared later on.</p></li><li class="li"><p>If a class template inherits from another class template, then base class members won't be found unless they are qualified. (See section 14.6.2, paragraph 3, of the C++ standard.) For example:</p><div class="codesample"><table><tr><td scope="row"><pre>template &lt;typename T> struct Base {<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>    void f();<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>};<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre> <span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>template &lt;typename T> struct Derived : public Base&lt;T> {<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>    void g() {<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>        f();          // Error, name not found.<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>        this->f();    // OK<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>        Derived::f(); // OK<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>        Base&lt;T>::f(); // OK<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>    }<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>};<span></span></pre></td></tr></table></div><p>See the GCC 4.0 manual for more information about two-phase name lookup.</p></li></ul><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001825-DontLinkElementID_23" title="Generalized lvalues"></a><h4>Generalized lvalues</h4><p>The C and C++ languages distinguish between <em>lvalues</em> and <em>rvalues</em>. Informally, the names "l" and "r" come from the left- and right-hand side of assignment statements. An lvalue refers to some location in memory, and an rvalue may be a temporary result that doesn't correspond to a memory location.</p><p>Previous versions of GCC supported a partially documented "generalized lvalue" extension: they treated certain expressions as lvalues even though the relevant language standards said they were not. GCC supported <em>cast as lvalue</em>, <em>conditional as lvalue</em>, and <em>compound expression as lvalue</em>. That is, previous versions of GCC allowed the following constructs, which the C and C++ standards say are illegal:</p><div class="codesample"><table><tr><td scope="row"><pre>(int) x = 17; (is_ok ? x : y) = 3; (x, y) = 0;<span></span></pre></td></tr></table></div><p>All of these generalized lvalue extensions have been removed from the FSF version of GCC; see the FSF 3.4 release notes.</p><p>In Apple's version of GCC 4.0, generalized lvalues are <em>deprecated</em>. GCC 4.0 will accept code that uses cast-as-lvalue and conditional-as-lvalue for this release only, but the compiler will issue a warning. Generalized lvalues will be removed in a future release of Apple's version of GCC, to match the FSF version. To match the FSF behavior with GCC 4.0 (i.e. to get errors instead of merely warnings), use the <code>-fno-non-lvalue-assign</code> flag.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001825-DontLinkElementID_24" title="Changes in command-line options"></a><h4>Changes in command-line options</h4><p>The following command-line flags have been removed from GCC 4.0:</p><ul class="simple"><li><p><code>-fcoalesce</code></p></li><li><p><code>-fno-coalesce</code></p></li><li><p><code>-fweak-coalesced</code></p></li><li><p><code>-fno-weak-coalesced</code></p></li><li><p><code>-fcoalesce-templates</code></p></li><li><p><code>-fno-coalesce-templates</code></p></li></ul><p>There is no need to use <code>-fcoalesce</code>, <code>-fweak-coalesced</code>, or <code>-fcoalesce-templates</code>, since the behavior specified by those flags is now the default. Those flags can safely be removed from any projects that use them.</p><p>The vast majority of projects also have no need to use <code>-fno-coalesce</code>, <code>-fno-weak-coalesced</code>, or <code>-fno-coalesce-templates</code>. The projects that used those flags in earlier compiler versions usually did so as workarounds for compiler bugs that no longer exist, and those flags, too, can safely be removed. In the very rare cases where there is a real need to disable C++ "vague linkage", use the flag <code>-fno-weak</code>.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001825-DontLinkElementID_25" title="Objective-C selector checking"></a><h4>Objective-C selector checking</h4><p>When a message is sent to a receiver of type id, the compiler looks at all matching selectors and warns about argument type inconsistencies. The FSF version of GCC 4.0 is better at this than previous versions of GCC were, revealing inconsistencies that were previously hidden. To ease the transition, we have made Apple's version of GCC 4.0 slightly more lenient so that it will not warn about type inconsistencies so long as the types involved have the same size and alignment.</p><p>To match the behavior of the FSF version of GCC 4.0, specify <code>-Wstrict-selector-match</code>. Stricter selector type checking can be especially useful for framework vendors.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001825-DontLinkElementID_26" title="64-bit address space"></a><h3>64-bit address space</h3><p>GCC 4.0 on Tiger can build programs that run in a 64-bit address space. You do this by adding <code>-arch ppc64</code> to compile and link commands, or by choosing the <code>ppc64</code> architecture in Xcode 2.0. Note that programs compiled using this option will run only on a G5 machine.</p><p>The 64-bit programming model is "LP64", meaning that <code>int</code> remains 32 bits in size, while <code>long</code> and pointers are 64 bits. <code>long long</code> remains unchanged at 64 bits.</p><p>Most correctly-written code will not need any source changes, but beware of reading/writing binary files, uses of casts to store different types of data in the same memory location, and other low-level techniques that make assumptions about the sizes of fundamental types. By default 64-bit programs run in the low 4GB of the address space, but <code>malloc()</code> and other allocation calls will return 8-byte pointers, possibly with values far above four billion. Attempts to store these values in variables of type int will not go well, and a cast will merely silence the compiler's valid warning, not produce correct code.</p><p>64-bit programs use a 64-bit version of the Mach-O file format; these can be identified using the <code>file</code> command. 32-bit and 64-bit programs may not mix directly; a 64-bit application may use only 64-bit frameworks, and so forth. However 32-bit programs may use a shared memory region along with 64-bit programs.</p><p>It is possible to build an application that has both 32-bit and 64-bit versions bundled together (a "fat" binary); a G5 running Tiger will choose to run 64-bit version by default, otherwise the 32-bit version will be used. The debugger, GDB, can debug both types of programs.</p><p>In Tiger, only the System and Xcelerate frameworks have 64-bit versions, meaning that only C and C++ are supported (no Objective-C). Additional 64-bit frameworks may be available in future releases.</p><p>The 64-bit ABI is different from the 32-bit ABI in several ways; bool's are one byte in size, alignment in structs is "natural" (meaning that structs with pointer fields will be padded so the pointers are 8-byte aligned), and more kinds of structs are passed by value and in registers (for instance, a struct with three "double" fields will be passed using three float registers).</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001825-DontLinkElementID_27" title="New language features"></a><h3>New language features</h3><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001825-DontLinkElementID_28" title="Source-level control of symbol visibility"></a><h4>Source-level control of symbol visibility</h4><p>GCC 4.0 supports finer grain control over which symbols defined in a dynamic library are external, meaning that they are visible to other programs that link to that dylib, and which are <em>private extern</em>, meaning they are visible throughout the dylib but hidden to the dylib's clients. The compiler uses <em>hidden visibility</em> as a synonym for private extern, and <em>default visibility</em> as a synonym for external.</p><p>The new mechanism consists of two parts: a new compiler flag to choose whether symbols are exported unless explicitly hidden or hidden unless explicitly exported, and new syntax for explicitly specifying a symbol's visibility in the source code itself. The compiler flag is <code>-fvisibility=</code><em>vis</em>, where <em>vis</em> is either <code>default</code> or <code>hidden</code>. Using <code>-fvisibility=hidden</code> means that all symbols have hidden visibility unless explicitly exported. Using <code>-fvisibility=default</code> means that all symbols have default visibility unless explicitly hidden. If you don't use either flag, the behavior is the the same as if you had used <code>-fvisibility=default</code>.</p><p>Visibility within source code is controlled by an <em>attribute</em>, which is a GCC language extension. <code>__attribute__ ((visibility("hidden")))</code> gives a declaration hidden visibility, and <code>__attribute__ ((visibility("default")))</code> gives it default visibility.</p><p>The visibility attribute may be applied to functions, variables, and C++ classes.

It has an entirely new optimization infrastructure based on a higher level intermediate representation, the Static Single Assignment form (SSA). Many new optimization passes based on this framework have been added, and many bugs and missed optimization opportunities have been fixed. For more information on this framework see the <span class="content_text"><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/tree-ssa/" target="_blank">Tree SSA project page</a></span> and references therein.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001825-DontLinkElementID_35" title="Levels of optimization"></a><h4>Levels of optimization</h4><p>Xcode automatically chooses the recommended optimization level for you. Just be sure to build with the <code>xcodebuild</code> tool or to choose the Deployment build style before building your final product.</p><p>For deployment builds, the recommended setting is <code>-Os</code>, which produces the smallest possible binary size. Generally, a binary that's smaller is also faster. That's because a large application spends much of its time paging its binary code in and out of memory. The smaller the binary, the less the application needs to page. Since the disk is much slower than the CPU, optimizations that reduce the amount of work the CPU does, at the cost of increased paging, are usually a poor tradeoff. Smaller applications are also better for overall system performance.</p><p>For debugging versions, the recommended optimization level is <code>-O0</code>.</p><p>The different optimization levels are:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>No optimization (<code>-O0</code>). This option level is intended for debugging; it ensures that the debugger works as you would expect.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Simple optimizations (<code>-O</code>) performs simple optimizations, including automatic register allocation and jump threading. This optimization level makes a trade-off between compile speed and execution speed.</p></li><li class="li"><p>More optimizations (<code>-O2</code>) performs all of GCC's optimizations that don't involve a space-time trade-off. In addition to all the optimizations for level 1, it performs common subexpression elimination, strength reduction, and loop optimizations. It also considers any function declared with the inline keyword for inlining.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Optimization for speed (<code>-O3</code>) performs still more optimizations. It may be best for code with heavy use of loops and much computation. In addition to all the optimizations for level 2, it considers all functions for inlining, even if they aren't declared with the inline keyword.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Optimization for code size (<code>-Os</code>) produces the smallest binary size. It performs no loop unrolling or register renaming. The performance is similar to <code>-O2</code>.</p></li><li class="li"><p>-fast: see <span class="content_text">“Optimization using the -fast flag”</span>.</p></li></ul><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001825-SW1" title="Optimization using the -fast flag"></a><h4>Optimization using the -fast flag</h4><p><code>-fast</code> changes the overall optimization strategy of GCC 4.0 in order to produce the fastest possible running code for G4 and G5 architectures, at the expense of code size. Three flavors of <code>-fast</code> are provided to facilitate language specfic optimizations.</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p><code>-fast</code> is the most common flag and is intended for C and C++.</p></li><li class="li"><p><code>-fastcp</code> is intended for C++ only. Currently it is identical to <code>-fast</code>, but its meaning may change in the future to allow for better C++ optimization.</p></li><li class="li"><p><code>-fastf</code> is not intended for general use, but only for C code generated by the NAG FORTRAN-to-C translator. It allows the compiler to optimize these programs better by relying on FORTRAN semantics.</p></li></ul><p><code>-fast</code> sets the optimization level to <code>-O3</code>, the highest level of optimization curretly allowed by GCC 4.0. If any other optimization level(<code>-O0</code>, <code>-O1</code>, <code>-O2</code>, or <code>-Os</code>) is specified, it is ignored by the compiler. Additionally, <code>-fast</code> enables extra optimization options. The exact list of options it enables may change in a future release, but currently it is:</p><ul class="simple"><li><p><code>-falign-loops-max-skip=15</code></p></li><li><p><code>-falign-jumps-max-skip=15</code></p></li><li><p><code>-falign-loops=16</code></p></li><li><p><code>-falign-jumps=16</code></p></li><li><p><code>-falign-functions=16</code></p></li><li><p><code>-malign-natural</code></p></li><li><p><code>-ffast-math</code></p></li><li><p><code>-fstrict-aliasing</code></p></li><li><p><code>-funroll-loops</code></p></li><li><p><code>-ftree-loop-linear</code></p></li><li><p><code>-ftree-loop-memset</code></p></li><li><p><code>-mcpu=G5</code></p></li><li><p><code>-mtune=G5</code></p></li><li><p><code>-mpowerpc64</code></p></li><li><p><code>-mpowerpc-gpopt</code></p></li><li><p><code>-fsched-interblock</code></p></li><li><p><code>-fgcse-sm</code></p></li><li><p><code>-mdynamic-no-pic</code></p></li></ul><p>With only three exceptions, these options may not be overridden. The options enabled by <code>-fast</code> that may be overridden are <code>-mcpu=G5</code>, <code>-mtune=G5</code>, and <code>-mdynamic-no-pic</code>. The first may be overridden with <code>-mcpu=G3</code> or <code>-mcpu=G4</code>, the second may be overridden with <code>-mtune=G4</code>, and the last may be overridden with <code>-fPIC</code>.</p><p>There are important caveats to be aware of when considering the use of <code>-fast</code>:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p><code>-fast</code> enables floating-point transformations that are not permitted by the IEEE-754 standard. <em>If your application depends on strict IEEE-754 conformance, you should not use -fast or -fast-math.</em></p></li><li class="li"><p><code>-fast</code> allows the compiler to assume the strictest aliasing rules applicable to the language being compiled. For C and C++, this activates optimizations based on the type of expressions: an object of one type is assumed never to reside at the same address as an object of a different type, unless the types are almost the same. This will not change the behavior of programs that adhere strictly to the language standards but <em>it will cause programs that use types in nonstandard ways to behave incorrectly</em>. For example, the idiom <code>*((T*) &amp;x) = val</code> is nonstandard (unless <code>x</code> and <code>T</code> already have the same type) and will not work reliably with <code>-fast</code> or <code>-fstrict-aliasing</code>.</p></li><li class="li"><p><code>-fast</code> changes the compiler's alignment mode to <code>-malign-natural</code>, which is not the default mode for 32-bit PowerPC. This can create binary compatibility issues, especially for C++, because the alignment mode affects structure and class layout. <em>Code compiled with -fast cannot always be linked against code compiled without it.</em></p></li></ul><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001825-DontLinkElementID_36" title="Auto Vectorization"></a><h4>Auto Vectorization</h4><p>GCC 4.0 introduces a new optimization, <em>Auto Vectorization</em>.
