Paradigm</font></h2><!-- apple_doc: pageHeadingEnd -->

<p>A common and useful paradigm for object-oriented applications,
particularly business applications, is Model-View-Controller (MVC).
Derived from Smalltalk-80, MVC proposes three types of objects in
an application, separated by abstract boundaries and communicating
with each other across those boundaries.</p>
<p>Model objects represent special knowledge and expertise, such
as a company's data and business logic. Model objects are not
directly displayed. They often are reusable, distributed, persistent,
and portable to a variety of platforms.</p><br><table border = "0" BGCOLOR="#E6E6E6">

<tr>
<td scope="row"><b>Note: </b>"Model"
does not have the same meaning in WebObjects as it does in the MVC paradigm.
In WebObjects, a model (short for "EOModel") establishes and maintains
correspondance between an enterprise object class and data stored
in a relational database. In MVC, model objects represent the special
knowledge of the application.</td>
</tr>

</table><br>
<p>View objects represent things visible on the user interface
such as windows, table views, and buttons. A View object is "ignorant"
of the data it displays, as it relies exclusively on the Controller
object for data. View objects tend to be very reusable and so provide consistency
between applications.</p>
<p>The Controller object acts as a mediator between Model objects
and View objects. Usually there is one Controller per application
or per window. Controller objects communicate data back and forth
between the Model objects and the View objects. A Controller's function
is usually very specific to an application, so it is generally not
reusable like View and Model objects are.</p>
<p>Because of the Controller's central mediating role, Model
objects need not know about the state and events of the user interface,
and View objects need not know about the programmatic interfaces
of Model objects.</p>
<p>Within the MVC paradigm, enterprise objects are Model objects.
By definition, Model objects represent data and business logic.
The Enterprise Object technology extends the MVC paradigm so enterprise
objects are independent of their persistent storage mechanism. Enterprise
objects do not need to know about the database that holds their data,
and the database doesn't need to know about the enterprise object
formed from its data.</p>
