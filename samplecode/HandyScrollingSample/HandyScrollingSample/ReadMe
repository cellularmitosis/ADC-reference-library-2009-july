Handy Scrolling Sample Illustrates a number of techniques that can be used for providing convenient and easy to use scrolling facilities in your application's windows.Scrolling techniques illustrated include:- implementing live scrolling scroll bars,- drawing proportional scroll bars,- using the hand cursor for scrolling allowing users to 'virtually' grab a window's contents and drag it around with the mouse.- scrolling using the keyboard.Other interesting techniques illustrated include:- Setting the cursor and handling mouse moved events for various regions of the screen,- Optimizing drawing performance by limiting drawing operations to those ones that will have a visual effect on the screen (This can dramatically improve the speed of drawing during scrolling operations).It's just plain handy!!!Copyright:© Copyright 2000 Apple Computer, Inc.
