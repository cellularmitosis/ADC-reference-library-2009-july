<H2>Load Balancing</H2>



<P><A NAME="5125"></A>You can improve the performance of a WebObjects application

by distributing the processing load among multiple instances of the application.

These application processes can be running on the same machine as the server

or on remote machines. The task that accomplishes this distribution is

called <I>load balancing</I>.</P>



<P> <A NAME="5126"></A>As an example of how load balancing works, suppose

you have an application called MyApp and you have configured WebObjects

to run two instances of MyApp on the host toga and two instances on the

host tutu. When a user types this URL:</P>



<P> </P>



<PRE><A NAME="5127"></A>        http://toga.acme.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MyApp

</PRE>



<P><A NAME="5128"></A>the WebObjects adaptor looks for an instance of MyApp

on the host toga. If it finds an instance and the instance is ready to

receive requests, the adaptor sends the request to that instance. If both

of the instances of MyApp on toga are busy, it accesses an instance on

the host tutu. </P>



<P><A NAME="5129"></A>Use the Monitor application to create new instances

of an application for load balancing. To create new instances of an application,

do the following:</P>



<P> </P>



<OL>

<P><A NAME="5130"></A></P>



<LI>Locate the application in the left frame and click the inspector button

to its left. <A NAME="5131"></A></LI>



<P>The Application Inspector opens in the right frame.</P>



<P> <A NAME="5145"></A></P>



<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="ServingWebObjects2.anc13.gif" HEIGHT=413 WIDTH=761></P></CENTER>



<P> <A NAME="5146"></A></P>



<LI>Click the Add Instance button to add a new instance of the application.

<A NAME="5147"></A></LI>



<LI>If you want the instance to run on a different host, click the More

button for that instance, scroll down in the bottom frame until you see

the host name field, enter the name of the host you want that instance

to run on, and click the Save Settings button at the bottom of the frame.

<A NAME="5148"></A></LI>



<LI>To start the application instance, click the On/Off switch in the Instance

Status field. </LI>

</OL>



<P><A NAME="5149"></A>When you create multiple application instances in

this manner, you are creating the public configuration file <I>NeXT_ROOT</I><B>/NextLibrary/WOAdaptors/Configuration/WebObjects.conf</B>.

When the adaptor receives an HTTP request for an application, it first

(in its initial mode) checks <B>WebObjects.conf</B> for an application

instance that is accepting connections and forwards the request to it.

The section &quot;<A HREF="HTTPAdaptors.html#4585">WebObjects HTTP Adaptors</A>&quot;

describes in some detail both the public configuration file and the adaptor

modes involved in load balancing. </P>



<P><A NAME="5153"></A>Note that Monitor always assigns a unique number

to each application instance, even if it is running on a different host.

It does this so that it can recover a crashed instance for you. If an instance

dies, Monitor can try to recover it by launching it on another host. Because

of this, instance numbers must be unique across hosts. </P>



<P><A NAME="5154"></A>The <B>WebObjects.conf</B> file, however, only requires

an instance number to be unique on a given host. Consider the example given

previously, where two instances of MyApp run on host toga and two instances

run on host tutu. If you were to set up a <B>WebObjects.conf</B> file by

hand, you could assign instance numbers 1 and 2 to the two instances on

toga and instance numbers 1 and 2 to the instances on tutu. This is legal,

but it's not supported by the Monitor, and if you do this, you won't be

able to use Monitor for the instances you've created. </P>



<P><A NAME="5158"></A></P>



<P><IMG SRC="LoadBalancingConfig.gif" HEIGHT=540 WIDTH=513></P>



<P><A NAME="5159"></A>To determine how many instances of an application

you should run, do the following:</P>



<P> </P>



<OL>

<P><A NAME="5162"></A></P>



<LI>Test the application using the recording and playback performance tools

as described in the section &quot;<A HREF="PerformanceTesting.html#5032">Performance

Testing</A>.&quot; <A NAME="5164"></A></LI>



<LI>Check the application's response times using the Application Inspector

in the Monitor application. <A NAME="5165"></A></LI>



<LI>If the response time is slow, use Monitor to add another instance of

the application. <A NAME="5166"></A></LI>



<LI>Continue to add instances and check their response times. When all

instances have reasonable response times, you have the number of instances

you need. </LI>

</OL>



<P><A NAME="5167"></A>Your application's state-storage strategy affects

load balancing. By default, applications store state in memory in the server.

If the application uses this default state-storage strategy, the instance

that processed a session's first request must be used to process all subsequent

requests. That is, the load-balancing granularity is per session. If you

store state using some other strategy (for example, if you store state

in the file system), true load-balancing can be achieved; each request

from a session can be processed by any application instance (that is, the

load-balancing granularity is per request).</P>
