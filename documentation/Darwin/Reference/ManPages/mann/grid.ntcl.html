<b>NAME</b>
       grid - Geometry manager that arranges widgets in a grid

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>grid</b> <u>option</u> <u>arg</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________


<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  <b>grid</b> command is used to communicate with the grid geometry manager that arranges widgets in rows
       and columns inside of another window, called the geometry master (or master window).  The  <b>grid</b>  com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
       mand can have any of several forms, depending on the <u>option</u> argument:

       <b>grid</b> <u>slave</u> ?<u>slave</u> <u>...</u>? ?<u>options</u>?
              If  the  first  argument  to  <b>grid</b>  is suitable as the first slave argument to <b>grid</b> <b>configure</b>,
              either a window name (any value starting with <b>.</b>) or one of the characters  <b>x</b>  or  <b>^</b>  (see  the
              ``RELATIVE  PLACEMENT''  section below), then the command is processed in the same way as <b>grid</b>
              <b>configure</b>.

       <b>grid</b> <b>bbox</b> <u>master</u> ?<u>column</u> <u>row</u>? ?<u>column2</u> <u>row2</u>?
              With no arguments, the bounding box (in pixels) of the grid is  returned.   The  return  value
              consists  of 4 integers.  The first two are the pixel offset from the master window (x then y)
              of the top-left corner of the grid, and the second two integers are the width  and  height  of
              the  grid,  also in pixels.  If a single <u>column</u> and <u>row</u> is specified on the command line, then
              the bounding box for that cell is returned, where the top left cell is numbered from zero.  If
              both  <u>column</u> and <u>row</u> arguments are specified, then the bounding box spanning the rows and col-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">umns&nbsp;columns</font>
              umns indicated is returned.

       <b>grid</b> <b>columnconfigure</b> <u>master</u> <u>index</u> ?<u>-option</u> <u>value...</u>?
              Query or set the column properties of the <u>index</u> column of the geometry  master,  <u>master</u>.   The |
              valid  options are <b>-minsize</b>, <b>-weight</b>, <b>-uniform</b> and <b>-pad</b>.  If one or more options are provided,
              then <u>index</u> may be given as a list of column indeces to which the  configuration  options  will
              operate  on.  The <b>-minsize</b> option sets the minimum size, in screen units, that will be permit-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ted&nbsp;permitted</font>
              ted for this column.  The <b>-weight</b> option (an integer  value)  sets  the  relative  weight  for
              apportioning  any  extra spaces among columns.  A weight of zero (0) indicates the column will
              not deviate from its requested size.  A column whose weight is two will grow at twice the rate
              as  a  column of weight one when extra space is allocated to the layout.  The <b>-uniform</b> option, |
              when a non-empty value is supplied, places the column in a <u>uniform</u> <u>group</u>  with  other  columns |
              that  have the same value for <b>-uniform</b>.  The space for columns belonging to a uniform group is |
              allocated so that their sizes are always in strict proportion to their  <b>-weight</b>  values.   See |
              ``THE  GRID  ALGORITHM''  below  for further details.  The <b>-pad</b> option specifies the number of
              screen units that will be added to the largest window contained completely in that column when
              the  grid  geometry  manager requests a size from the containing window.  If only an option is
              specified, with no value, the current value of that option is returned.  If  only  the  master
              window  and  index  is specified, all the current settings are returned in an list of "-option
              value" pairs.

       <b>grid</b> <b>configure</b> <u>slave</u> ?<u>slave</u> <u>...</u>? ?<u>options</u>?
              The arguments consist of the names of one or more slave windows followed by pairs of arguments
              that  specify  how to manage the slaves.  The characters <b>-</b>,  <b>x</b> and <b>^</b>, can be specified instead
              of a window name to alter the default location of a <u>slave</u>,  as  described  in  the  ``RELATIVE
              PLACEMENT'' section, below.  The following options are supported:

              <b>-column</b> <u>n</u>
                     Insert  the slave so that it occupies the <u>n</u>th column in the grid.  Column numbers start
                     with 0.  If this option is not supplied, then the slave is arranged just to  the  right
                     of  previous  slave  specified  on  this call to <u>grid</u>, or column "0" if it is the first
                     slave.  For each <b>x</b> that immediately precedes the <u>slave</u>, the column position  is  incre-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mented&nbsp;incremented</font>
                     mented by one.  Thus the <b>x</b> represents a blank column for this row in the grid.

              <b>-columnspan</b> <u>n</u>
                     Insert the slave so that it occupies <u>n</u> columns in the grid.  The default is one column,
                     unless the window name is followed by a <b>-</b>, in which case the columnspan is  incremented
                     once for each immediately following <b>-</b>.

              <b>-in</b> <u>other</u>
                     Insert  the  <!-- a -->slave(s)<!-- /a -->  in  the  master window given by <u>other</u>.  The default is the first
                     slave's parent window.

              <b>-ipadx</b> <u>amount</u>
                     The <u>amount</u> specifies how much horizontal internal padding to leave on each side of  the
                     <!-- a -->slave(s)<!-- /a -->.   This  is  space  is added inside the <!-- a -->slave(s)<!-- /a --> border.  The <u>amount</u> must be a
                     valid screen distance, such as <b>2</b> or <b>.5c</b>.  It defaults to 0.

              <b>-ipady</b> <u>amount</u>
                     The <u>amount</u> specifies how much vertical internal padding to leave on on the top and bot-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tom&nbsp;bottom</font>
                     tom  of  the  <!-- a -->slave(s)<!-- /a -->.   This  space  is added inside the <!-- a -->slave(s)<!-- /a --> border.  The <u>amount</u>
                     defaults to 0.

              <b>-padx</b> <u>amount</u>
                     The <u>amount</u> specifies how much horizontal external padding to leave on each side of  the
                     <!-- a -->slave(s)<!-- /a -->,  in  screen units.  <u>Amount</u> may be a list of two values to specify padding for
                     left and right separately.  The <u>amount</u> defaults to 0.  This space is added outside  the
                     <!-- a -->slave(s)<!-- /a --> border.

              <b>-pady</b> <u>amount</u>
                     The  <u>amount</u> specifies how much vertical external padding to leave on the top and bottom
                     of the <!-- a -->slave(s)<!-- /a -->, in screen units.  <u>Amount</u> may be a list of two values to  specify  pad-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ding&nbsp;padding</font>
                     ding  for  top  and  bottom separately.  The <u>amount</u> defaults to 0.  This space is added
                     outside the <!-- a -->slave(s)<!-- /a --> border.

              <b>-row</b> <u>n</u> Insert the slave so that it occupies the <u>n</u>th row in the grid.  Row numbers  start  with
                     0.   If  this option is not supplied, then the slave is arranged on the same row as the
                     previous slave specified on this call to <b>grid</b>, or the first unoccupied row if  this  is
                     the first slave.

              <b>-rowspan</b> <u>n</u>
                     Insert  the  slave so that it occupies <u>n</u> rows in the grid.  The default is one row.  If
                     the next <b>grid</b> command contains <b>^</b> characters instead of <u>slaves</u> that  line  up  with  the
                     columns of this <u>slave</u>, then the <b>rowspan</b> of this <u>slave</u> is extended by one.

              <b>-sticky</b> <u>style</u>
                     If  a  slave's cell is larger than its requested dimensions, this option may be used to
                     position (or stretch) the slave within its cell.  <u>Style</u>  is a string that contains zero
                     or  more  of the characters <b>n</b>, <b>s</b>, <b>e</b> or <b>w</b>.  The string can optionally contains spaces or
                     commas, but they are ignored.  Each letter refers to a side  (north,  south,  east,  or
                     west)  that the slave will "stick" to.  If both <b>n</b> and <b>s</b> (or <b>e</b> and <b>w</b>) are specified, the
                     slave will be stretched to fill the entire height (or width) of its cavity.  The <b>sticky</b>
                     option subsumes the combination of <b>-anchor</b> and <b>-fill</b> that is used by <b>pack</b>.  The default
                     is <b>{}</b>, which causes the slave to be centered in its cavity, at its requested size.

              If any of the slaves are already managed by the geometry manager then any unspecified  options
              for them retain their previous values rather than receiving default values.

       <b>grid</b> <b>forget</b> <u>slave</u> ?<u>slave</u> <u>...</u>?
              Removes each of the <u>slave</u>s from grid for its master and unmaps their windows.  The slaves will
              no longer be managed by the grid geometry manager.  The configuration options for that  window
              are  forgotten,  so  that  if the slave is managed once more by the grid geometry manager, the
              initial default settings are used.

       <b>grid</b> <b>info</b> <u>slave</u>
              Returns a list whose elements are the current configuration state of the slave given by  <u>slave</u>
              in  the  same option-value form that might be specified to <b>grid</b> <b>configure</b>.  The first two ele-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ments&nbsp;elements</font>
              ments of the list are ``<b>-in</b> <u>master</u>'' where <u>master</u> is the slave's master.

       <b>grid</b> <b>location</b> <u>master</u> <u>x</u> <u>y</u>
              Given  <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> values in screen units relative to the master window, the column and row number
              at  that  <u>x</u>  and  <u>y</u>  location is returned.  For locations that are above or to the left of the
              grid, <b>-1</b> is returned.

       <b>grid</b> <b>propagate</b> <u>master</u> ?<u>boolean</u>?
              If <u>boolean</u> has a true boolean value such as <b>1</b> or <b>on</b> then propagation is  enabled  for  <u>master</u>,
              which  must  be  a  window  name (see ``GEOMETRY PROPAGATION'' below).  If <u>boolean</u> has a false
              boolean value then propagation is disabled for <u>master</u>.  In either  of  these  cases  an  empty
              string is returned.  If <u>boolean</u> is omitted then the command returns <b>0</b> or <b>1</b> to indicate whether
              propagation is currently enabled for <u>master</u>.  Propagation is enabled by default.

       <b>grid</b> <b>rowconfigure</b> <u>master</u> <u>index</u> ?<u>-option</u> <u>value...</u>?
              Query or set the row properties of the <u>index</u> row of the geometry master,  <u>master</u>.   The  valid |
              options  are  <b>-minsize</b>, <b>-weight</b>, <b>-uniform</b> and <b>-pad</b>.  If one or more options are provided, then
              <u>index</u> may be given as a list of row indeces to which the configuration  options  will  operate
              on.   The  <b>-minsize</b>  option sets the minimum size, in screen units, that will be permitted for
              this row.  The <b>-weight</b> option (an integer value) sets the relative weight for apportioning any
              extra  spaces  among  rows.   A weight of zero (0) indicates the row will not deviate from its
              requested size.  A row whose weight is two will grow at twice the rate as a row of weight  one
              when  extra  space is allocated to the layout.  The <b>-uniform</b> option, when a non-empty value is |
              supplied, places the row in a <u>uniform</u> <u>group</u> with other rows that have the same value for <b>-uni-</b> |
              <b>form</b>.   The  space  for rows belonging to a uniform group is allocated so that their sizes are |
              always in strict proportion to their <b>-weight</b> values.  See ``THE  GRID  ALGORITHM''  below  for |
              further  details.   The <b>-pad</b> option specifies the number of screen units that will be added to
              the largest window contained completely in that row when the grid geometry manager requests  a
              size  from  the containing window.  If only an option is specified, with no value, the current
              value of that option is returned.  If only the master window and index is specified,  all  the
              current settings are returned in an list of "-option value" pairs.

       <b>grid</b> <b>remove</b> <u>slave</u> ?<u>slave</u> <u>...</u>?
              Removes each of the <u>slave</u>s from grid for its master and unmaps their windows.  The slaves will
              no longer be managed by the grid geometry manager.  However,  the  configuration  options  for
              that  window  are  remembered,  so that if the slave is managed once more by the grid geometry
              manager, the previous values are retained.

       <b>grid</b> <b>size</b> <u>master</u>
              Returns the size of the grid (in columns then rows) for <u>master</u>.  The size is determined either
              by the <u>slave</u> occupying the largest row or column, or the largest column or row with a <b>minsize</b>,
              <b>weight</b>, or <b>pad</b> that is non-zero.

       <b>grid</b> <b>slaves</b> <u>master</u> ?<u>-option</u> <u>value</u>?
              If no options are supplied, a list of all of the slaves in <u>master</u> are returned, most  recently
              manages  first.   <u>Option</u> can be either <b>-row</b> or <b>-column</b> which causes only the slaves in the row
              (or column) specified by <u>value</u> to be returned.

<b>RELATIVE</b> <b>PLACEMENT</b>
       The <b>grid</b> command contains a limited set of capabilities that permit layouts  to  be  created  without
       specifying  the  row  and  column  information for each slave.  This permits slaves to be rearranged,
       added, or removed without the need to explicitly specify row and column information.  When no  column
       or  row  information  is specified for a <u>slave</u>, default values are chosen for <b>column</b>, <b>row</b>, <b>columnspan</b>
       and <b>rowspan</b> at the time the <u>slave</u> is managed. The values are chosen based upon the current layout  of
       the  grid, the position of the <u>slave</u> relative to other <u>slave</u>s in the same grid command, and the pres-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ence&nbsp;presence</font>
       ence of the characters <b>-</b>, <b>x</b>, and <b>^</b> in <b>grid</b> command where <u>slave</u> names are normally expected.

              <b>-</b>      This increases the columnspan of the <u>slave</u> to the left.  Several <b>-</b>'s in a row will suc-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cessively&nbsp;successively</font>
                     cessively  increase  the  columnspan.  A <b>-</b> may not follow a <b>^</b> or a <b>x</b>, nor may it be the
                     first <u>slave</u> argument to <b>grid</b> <b>configure</b>.

              <b>x</b>      This leaves an empty column between the <u>slave</u> on the left and the <u>slave</u> on the right.

              <b>^</b>      This extends the <b>rowspan</b> of the <u>slave</u> above the <b>^</b>'s in the grid.  The number of <b>^</b>'s  in
                     a row must match the number of columns spanned by the <u>slave</u> above it.

<b>THE</b> <b>GRID</b> <b>ALGORITHM</b>
       The  grid  geometry  manager lays out its slaves in three steps.  In the first step, the minimum size
       needed to fit all of the slaves is computed, then (if propagation is turned on), a request is made of
       the  master  window  to become that size.  In the second step, the requested size is compared against
       the actual size of the master.  If the sizes are different, then spaces is added  to  or  taken  away
       from  the layout as needed.  For the final step, each slave is positioned in its <!-- a -->row(s)<!-- /a --> and <!-- a -->column(s)<!-- /a -->
       based on the setting of its <u>sticky</u> flag.

       To compute the minimum size of a layout, the grid geometry manager first looks at  all  slaves  whose
       columnspan  and  rowspan  values  are  one, and computes the nominal size of each row or column to be
       either the <u>minsize</u> for that row or column, or the sum of the <u>pad</u>ding plus the  size  of  the  largest
       slave,  whichever  is  greater.   After  that the rows or columns in each uniform group adapt to each
       other.  Then the slaves whose rowspans or columnspans are greater than one are examined.  If a  group
       of  rows  or  columns  need  to be increased in size in order to accommodate these slaves, then extra
       space is added to each row or column in the group according to its  <u>weight</u>.   For  each  group  whose
       weights are all zero, the additional space is apportioned equally.

       When  multiple  rows  or  columns belong to a uniform group, the space allocated to them is always in
       proportion to their weights. (A weight of zero is considered to be 1.)  In other words, a row or col-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">umn&nbsp;column</font>
       umn  configured  with <b>-weight</b> <b>1</b> <b>-uniform</b> <b>a</b> will have exactly the same size as any other row or column
       configured with <b>-weight</b> <b>1</b> <b>-uniform</b> <b>a</b>.  A row or column configured with <b>-weight</b> <b>2</b> <b>-uniform</b> <b>b</b>  will  be
       exactly twice as large as one that is configured with <b>-weight</b> <b>1</b> <b>-uniform</b> <b>b</b>.

       More  technically,  each  row or column in the group will have a size equal to <u>k*weight</u> for some con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">stant&nbsp;constant</font>
       stant <u>k</u>.  The constant <u>k</u> is chosen so that no row or column becomes smaller than  its  minimum  size.
       For  example,  if  all  rows or columns in a group have the same weight, then each row or column will
       have the same size as the largest row or column in the group.

       For masters whose size is larger than the requested  layout,  the  additional  space  is  apportioned
       according  to  the  row  and  column weights.  If all of the weights are zero, the layout is centered
       within its master.  For masters whose size is smaller than the requested layout, space is taken  away
       from  columns and rows according to their weights.  However, once a column or row shrinks to its min-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">size,&nbsp;minsize,</font>
       size, its weight is taken to be zero.  If more space needs to be removed from a layout than would  be
       permitted,  as  when all the rows or columns are at there minimum sizes, the layout is clipped on the
       bottom and right.

<b>GEOMETRY</b> <b>PROPAGATION</b>
       The grid geometry manager normally computes how large a master must be to just exactly meet the needs
       of  its  slaves,  and it sets the requested width and height of the master to these dimensions.  This
       causes geometry information to propagate up through a window hierarchy to a top-level window so  that
       the  entire  sub-tree sizes itself to fit the needs of the leaf windows.  However, the <b>grid</b> <b>propagate</b>
       command may be used to turn off propagation for one or more masters.  If propagation is disabled then
       grid  will  not  set the requested width and height of the master window.  This may be useful if, for
       example, you wish for a master window to have a fixed size that you specify.


<b>RESTRICTIONS</b> <b>ON</b> <b>MASTER</b> <b>WINDOWS</b>
       The master for each slave must either be the slave's parent (the default)  or  a  descendant  of  the
       slave's  parent.   This  restriction  is necessary to guarantee that the slave can be placed over any
       part of its master that is visible without danger of the slave being clipped by its parent.  In addi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion,&nbsp;addition,</font>
       tion, all slaves in one call to <b>grid</b> must have the same master.

<b>STACKING</b> <b>ORDER</b>
       If  the  master for a slave is not its parent then you must make sure that the slave is higher in the
       stacking order than the master.  Otherwise the master will obscure the slave and it will appear as if
       the  slave  hasn't been managed correctly.  The easiest way to make sure the slave is higher than the
       master is to create the master window first:  the most recently created window will be highest in the
       stacking order.

<b>CREDITS</b>
       The  <b>grid</b>  command  is based on ideas taken from the <u>GridBag</u> geometry manager written by Doug. Stein,
       and the <b>blt_table</b> geometry manager, written by George Howlett.
