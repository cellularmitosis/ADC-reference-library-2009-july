They provide a straightforward deployment mechanismfor your applications. Servlets are deployed inside servlet containers,which are plug-ins to your HTTP server.</p><p>You should read this book if you want to deploy your WebObjectsapplications inside a servlet container or want to take advantageof WebObjects components (both standard and custom) in your JSPpages.</p><p>Deploying WebObjects applications as servlets allows you totake advantage of the features that your servlet container provides.Keep in mind that deployment tools such as Monitor and wotaskd dowork with servlets. WebObjects uses version 2.2 of the Servlet API,and version 1.1 of the JSP specification.</p><p>The book addresses two major points, each contained in itsown chapter:</p><ul><li> <a sector="mod" href="../Servlets/iDeploying_W_as_Servlets.html" target="_top">Chapter 2, "Deploying WebObjects Applications as Servlets"</a>, explainshow you develop WebObjects applications to be deployed as servletsand how to add servlet capability to existing applications.</font></li><li> <a sector="mod" href="../JavaServer_Pages/iDeveloping__pplications.html" target="_top">Chapter 3, "Developing JPS-Based WebObjects Applications"</a>, tellsyou how to write JSP-based applications, which can be thought ofas JSP applications that use WebObjects technology or hybrids&#151;applicationsthat use JSP pages to accomplish some tasks and WebObjects components ordirect actions to perform others.</font></li><li><a sector="mod" href="../Appendix/Special_Issues.html"target="_top">Appendix A, "Special Issues"</a>, addressesspecial issues to consider when you deploy WebObjects applicationsas servlets or when you develop JSP-based applications.</font></li></ul><p>To get the most out of this book, you must be familiar withWebObjects application development. In particular, you need to knowhow to create applications using Project Builder and how to layoutWebObjects components using WebObjects Builder.</p><p>If you need to learn the basics about developing WebObjectsapplications, you can find that information in the following books:</p><ul><li><i>InsideWebObjects: WebObjects Overview</i> provides you with a surveyof WebObjects technologies and capabilities.</font></li><li><i>Inside WebObjects: Discovering WebObjects for HTML</i> showsyou how to develop HTML-based applications.</font></li><li><i>Inside WebObjects: Deploying WebObjects Applications</i> describeshow to use WebObjects tools to deploy your applications as standaloneentities.</font></li></ul><p>For additional WebObjects documentation and links to otherresources, visit <a href="http://developer.apple.com/webobjects"target="_top">http://developer.apple.com/webobjects</a>.</p><p>In addition to WebObjects development experience, you alsoneed to be acquainted with the syntax used in JSP pages and withthe layout of WAR (Web Application Archive) files. You can findinformation about JSP and J2EE in the following books:</p><ul><li><i>JavaServlet Programming</i>, 2nd edition (O'Reilly) providesan in-depth treatise on servlets. You can find more informationat <a href="http://java.oreilly.com"target="_top">http://java.oreilly.com</a>.</font></li><li><i>J2EE Technology in Practice</i> (Sun) providesan overview of J2EE technology.</font></li><li><i>JavaServer Pages Technology Syntax</i> (Sun)is a short document that describes the syntax used in JSP pages.You can download it from <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/technical.html"target="_top">http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/technical.html</a>.For more information on JSP and servlets, see http://java.sun.com/products/jsp.</font></li><li><i>Java Servlet Technology</i> contains thelatest information on Sun's Java Servlet technology. You can viewit at <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/"target="_top">http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/</a>.</font></li></ul><p>WebObjects Developer also includes a commented, applicationproject that shows you how JSP pages can take advantage of WebObjectscomponents and direct actions. The example&#151;using the client/serverapproach&#151;includes two WebObjects application projects named SchoolToolsClientand SchoolToolsServer.You can find the projects in the <code>/Developer/Examples/JavaWebObjects</code> directory.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="../Servlets/index.html" target="_top"><img src="../images/next.gif" border="0"></a>&nbsp;<br><br><p><hr><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">&#169; 2002 Apple Computer, Inc.
