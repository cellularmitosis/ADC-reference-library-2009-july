<h1> Customizing Your Application With WebAssistant</h1>
</a><a name="5818">
The WebAssistant allows you to customize each page of your application. You can specify:<p>
</a><ul><a name="5819">
<p><li>Which entities of the model the application displays and, of these, which are read-only
</a><a name="10812">
<p><li>Global attributes of pages, such as style, color, and border thickness
</a><a name="10811">
<p><li>Which properties are displayed, and in what order
</a><a name="5820">
<p>By default, an entity's properties are listed in alphabetical order. Often, you'll want to change the order, as well as hiding some properties.<p>
</a><a name="5821">
<p><li>How number and date strings should be represented
</a><a name="5822">
<p><li>How relationships should be represented
</a></ul><a name="13212">
To activate the WebAssistant, click Customize in the Direct to Web header. A Java applet window appears showing the WebAssistant. <p>
</a><a name="13501">
When you have activated the WebAssistant in your browser, a frame appears at the bottom of each page in your application in the browser (assuming it supports Java applets), containing a "Show WebAssistant" button and a status field. To bring the WebAssistant to the front, click the Show WebAssistant button (rather than clicking Customize again).<p>
</a><a name="13465">
<h3> Running WebAssistant With appletviewer</h3>
</a><a name="13891">
If you browser is incapable of running applets (such as WebAssistant), or if you want to run WebAssistant in a different machine from your browser, you can launch WebAssistant using the Java program <strong>appletviewer</strong>. To do this:<p>
</a><ol>
<a name="13213">
<P><li>Launch your application with the command-line option D2WLiveAssistantEnabled set to YES.
</a><a name="13214">
<P><li>In the console output look for a line similar to the following:
</a><pre><a name="13215">Jul 23 10:29:48 D2WTest[527] Server-side Live Assistant launch line: 
appletviewer http://localhost:8888/cgi-
bin/WebObjects/D2WTest.woa/wa/D2WActions/openLiveAssistant
</a></pre><a name="13216">
<P><li>Open a shell such as provided by the Terminal application on Mac OS X Server systems or the Bourne Shell on Yellow Box for Windows systems.
</a><a name="13217">
<P><li>Copy the string from "appletviewer" to "openLiveAssistant" to the shell and press Return (or Enter).
</a><a name="13497">
<p>If the port number is -1, look in the console output for the actual port number of the application and substitute that.<p>
</a></ol>
<a name="13921">
When you complete this procedure, WebAssistant launches and is connected to your application. If you stop and restart the Direct to Web application, the WebAssistant will re-connect to it on the same port.<p>
</a><a name="13930">
A standalone WebAssistant has exactly the same functionality as one launched inside your browser. However, if the browser you are using is not Java-enabled, your pages are not automatically refreshed after you click Update. You must either click your browser's "reload" or "refresh" button or (when you are picking a new type of page, such as a MasterDetails page instead of a ListPage), you will have to re-navigate to the same page.<p>
