<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-SW25" title="Starting Up"></a><h2>Starting Up</h2><p>Using a <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_10"></a>framework of Objective-C classes and their methods differs from using a library of C functions. In the latter case, you can pretty much pick and choose which functions to use and when to use them, depending on the program you’re trying to write. But a framework, on the other hand, imposes a design on your program, or at least on a certain problem space your program is trying to address. With a procedural program, you call library functions as necessary to get the work of the program done. Using an object-oriented framework is similar in that you must invoke methods of the framework to do much of the work of the program. However, you’ll also need to customize the framework and adapt it to your needs by implementing methods that the framework will invoke at the appropriate time. These methods are “hooks” that introduce your code into the structure imposed by the framework, augmenting it with the behavior that characterizes your program. In a sense, the usual roles of program and library are reversed. Instead of incorporating library code into your program, you incorporate your program code into the framework.</p><p>You can gain some insight on the relationship between custom code and framework by considering what takes place when a Cocoa program begins executing.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-SW26" title="What Happens in the main Function"></a><h3>What Happens in the main Function</h3><p>Objective-C programs begin executing where C programs do, in the <code>main</code> <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_11"></a>function. In a complex Objective-C program, the job of <code>main</code> is fairly simple. It consists of two steps:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Set up a core group of objects.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Turn program control over to those objects.</p></li></ul><p>Objects in the core group might create other objects as the program runs, and those objects might create still other objects. From time to time, the program might also load classes, unarchive instances, connect to remote objects, and find other resources as they’re needed. However, all that’s required at the outset is enough structure—enough of the object network—to handle the program’s initial tasks. The <code>main</code> function puts this initial structure in place and gets it ready for the task ahead.</p><p>Typically, one of the core objects has the responsibility for overseeing the program or controlling its input. When the core structure is ready, <code>main</code> sets this overseer object to work. If the program is a command-line tool or a background server, what this entails might be as simple as passing command-line arguments or opening a remote connection. But for the most common type of Cocoa program, an application, what happens is a bit more involved.</p><p>For an application, the <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_12"></a>core group of objects that <code>main</code> sets up must include some objects that draw the user interface. This interface, or at least part of it (such as an application’s menu), must appear on the screen when the user launches the application. Once the initial user interface is on the screen, the application is thereafter driven by external events, the most important of which are those originated by users: clicking a button, choosing a menu item, dragging an icon, typing something in a field, and so on. Each such event is reported to the application along with a good deal of information about the circumstances of the user action—for example, which key was pressed, whether the mouse button was pressed or released, where the cursor was located, and which window was affected.</p><p>An application gets an <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_13"></a>event, looks at it, responds to it—often by drawing a part of the user interface—then waits for the next event. It keeps getting events, one after another, as long as the user or some other source (such as a timer) initiates them. From the time it’s launched to the time it terminates, almost everything the application does is driven by user actions in the form of events.</p><p>The mechanism for getting and responding to events is the <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_14"></a>main event loop (called “main” because an application can set up subordinate events loops for brief periods.) An <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_15"></a>event loop is essentially a run loop with one or more input sources attached to it. One object in the core group is responsible for running the main event loop—getting an event, dispatching the event to the object or objects that can best handle it, and then getting the next event. In a Cocoa application, this coordinating object is the global application object. On Mac OS X, this object is an instance of <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_16"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_17"></a><code><a href="../../../Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSApplication_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSApplication" target="_top">NSApplication</a></code>, and on iPhone OS, it’s an instance of <code><!--a target="_top" -->UIApplication<!--/a--></code>. <span class="content_text">Figure 3-1</span> illustrates the main event loop for Cocoa applications on Mac OS X.</p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-SW15" title="Figure 3-1The main event loop (Mac OS X)"></a><p><strong>Figure 3-1&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The main event loop (Mac OS X)</p><img src = "../Art/main_event_loop.gif" alt = "The main event loop (Mac OS X)" width="387" height="183"></div><br/><p>The <code>main</code> function in almost all Cocoa applications is extremely simple. In Mac OS X, it consists of only one function call (see <span class="content_text">Listing 3-1</span>). The <code>NSApplicationMain</code> function creates the application object, sets up an autorelease pool, loads the initial user interface from the main nib file, and runs the application, thereby requesting it to begin handling events received on the main event loop.<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_18"></a></p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-SW18" title="Listing 3-1The main function in a Cocoa for Mac OS X application"></a><p class="codesample"><strong>Listing 3-1&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The main function in a Cocoa for Mac OS X application</p><div class="codesample"><table><tr><td scope="row"><pre>#import &lt;AppKit/AppKit.h><span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre> <span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>int main(int argc, const char *argv[]) {<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>    return NSApplicationMain(argc, argv);<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>}<span></span></pre></td></tr></table></div><p>The main function for iPhone OS–based applications calls a similar function: <code><!--a-->UIApplicationMain<!--/a--></code>.</p><p>The appendix <span class="content_text"><a href="../CoreAppArchitecture/CoreAppArchitecture.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH8-SW45">“The Core Application Architecture on Mac OS X”</a></span> describes in greater detail the main event loop, the global <code>NSApplication</code> instance, and other core application objects in an application running on Mac OS X.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-SW27" title="Using a Cocoa Framework"></a><h2>Using a Cocoa Framework</h2><p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_19"></a>Library functions impose few restrictions on the programs that use them; you can call them whenever you need to. The methods in an object-oriented library or framework, on the other hand, are tied to class definitions and can’t be invoked unless you create or obtain an object that has access to those definitions. Moreover, in most programs the object must be connected to at least one other object so that it can operate in the program network. A class defines a program component; to access its services, you need to craft it into the structure of your application.</p><p>That said, some framework classes generate instances that behave much as a set of library functions does. You simply create an instance, initialize it, and either send it a message to accomplish a task, or you insert it into a waiting slot in your application. For example, you can use the <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_20"></a><code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSFileManager_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSFileManager" target="_top">NSFileManager</a></code> class to perform various file-system operations, such as moving, copying, and deleting files. If you need to display an alert dialog, you would create an instance of the <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_21"></a><code><a href="../../../Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSAlert_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSAlert" target="_top">NSAlert</a></code> class, or with UIKit, an instance of the <code><!--a target="_top" -->UIAlertView<!--/a--></code> class and send it the appropriate message.</p><p>In general, however, environments such as Cocoa are more than a grab bag of individual classes that offer their services. They consist of object-oriented <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_22"></a>frameworks, collections of classes that structure a problem space and present an integrated solution to it. Instead of providing discrete services that you can use as needed (as with function libraries), a framework maps out and implements an entire <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_23"></a>program structure—or model—that your own code must adapt to. Because this program model is generic, you can specialize it to meet the requirements of your particular program. Rather than design a program that you plug library functions into, you plug your own code into the design provided by the framework.</p><p>To use a framework, you must accept the program model it defines and employ and customize as many of its classes as necessary to mold your particular program to that model. The classes are mutually dependent and come as a group, not individually. At first glance, the need to adapt your code to a framework’s program model might seem restrictive. But the reality is quite the opposite. A framework offers you many ways in which you can alter and <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_24"></a>extend its generic behavior. It simply requires you to accept that all Cocoa programs behave in the same fundamental ways because they are all based on the same program model.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-SW28" title="Kinds of Framework Classes"></a><h3>Kinds of Framework Classes</h3><p>The classes in a Cocoa framework deliver their services in four ways:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p><strong>Off the shelf</strong>. Some classes define <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_25"></a>off-the-shelf objects, ready to be used. You simply create instances of the class and initialize them as needed. For the Application Kit, subclasses of <code><a href="../../../Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSControl_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSControl" target="_top">NSControl</a></code>, such as <code><a href="../../../Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSTextField_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSTextField" target="_top">NSTextField</a></code>, <code><a href="../../../Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSButton_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSButton" target="_top">NSButton</a></code>, and <code><a href="../../../Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSTableView_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSTableView" target="_top">NSTableView</a></code>, fall into this category. The corresponding UIKit classes are <code><!--a target="_top" -->UIControl<!--/a--></code>, <code><!--a target="_top" -->UITextField<!--/a--></code>, <code><!--a target="_top" -->UIButton<!--/a--></code>, and <code><!--a target="_top" -->UITableView<!--/a--></code>. You typically create and initialize off-the-shelf objects using Interface Builder, although you can create and initialize them programmatically.</p></li><li class="li"><p><strong>Behind the scenes</strong>. As a program runs, Cocoa creates some framework objects for it “<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_26"></a>behind the scenes.” You don’t need to explicitly allocate and initialize these objects; it’s done for you. Often the classes are private, but they are necessary to implement the desired behavior.</p></li><li class="li"><p><strong>Generically</strong>. Some framework classes are <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_27"></a>generic. A framework might provide some concrete subclasses of the generic class that you can use unchanged. Yet you can—and <em>must</em> in some circumstances—define your own subclasses and <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_28"></a>override the implementations of certain methods. <code><a href="../../../Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSView_Class/Reference/NSView.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSView" target="_top">NSView</a></code> and <code><a href="../../../Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSDocument_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSDocument" target="_top">NSDocument</a></code> are examples of this kind of class in the Application Kit, and <code><!--a target="_top" -->UIView<!--/a--></code> and <code><!--a target="_top" -->UIScrollView<!--/a--></code> are UIKit examples.</p></li><li class="li"><p><strong>Through delegation and notification</strong>. Many framework objects keep other objects informed of their actions and even delegate certain responsibilities to those other objects. The mechanisms for delivering this information are <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_29"></a>delegation and <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_30"></a>notification. A delegating object publishes an interface known as a protocol (see <span class="content_text"><a href="../CocoaObjects/CocoaObjects.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH4-SW41">“Protocols”</a></span> for details). Client objects must first register as delegates and then implement one or more methods of this interface. A notifying object publishes the list of notifications it broadcasts, and any client is free to observe one or more of them. Many framework classes broadcast notifications. </p></li></ul><p>Some classes provide more than one of these general kinds of services. For example, you can drag a ready-made <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_31"></a><code>NSWindow</code> object from an Interface Builder palette and use it with only minor initializations. Thus the <code>NSWindow</code> class provides off-the-shelf instances. But an <code>NSWindow</code> object also sends messages to its delegate and posts a variety of notifications. You can even subclass <code>NSWindow</code> if, for example, you want to have round windows.</p><p>It is the Cocoa classes in the last two categories—generic and delegation/notification—that offer the most possibilities for integrating your program-specific code into the structure provided by the frameworks. <span class="content_text"><a href="AddingBehaviorCocoa.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-SW19">“Inheriting From a Cocoa Class”</a></span> discusses in general terms how you create subclasses of framework classes, particularly generic classes. See <span class="content_text"><a href="../CommunicatingWithObjects/CommunicateWithObjects.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH7-SW15">“Communicating With Objects”</a></span> for information on delegation, notification, and other mechanisms for communication between objects in a program network.<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_32"></a></p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-SW29" title="Cocoa API Conventions"></a><h3>Cocoa API Conventions</h3><p>When you start using the classes, methods, and other API of the Cocoa frameworks, you should be aware of a few conventions that are intended to ensure efficiency and consistency in usage.</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Methods that return objects typically return <code>nil</code> to indicate “failure to create” or “no object to return.” They do not directly return a status code.</p><p>The convention of returning <code>nil</code> is often used to indicate a runtime error or other non-exceptional condition. The Cocoa frameworks deal with errors such as “array index out of bounds” or “method selector not recognized” by raising an exception (which is handled by a top-level handler) and, if the method signature so requires, returning <code>nil</code>.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Some of these same methods that might return <code>nil</code> include a final parameter for returning error information by reference.</p><p>This final parameter takes a pointer to an <code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSError_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSError" target="_top">NSError</a></code> object; upon return from a method call that fails (that is, returns <code>nil</code>), you can inspect the returned error object to determine the cause of the error or you can display the error to the user in a dialog.</p><p>As an example, here’s a method from the <code><a href="../../../Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSDocument_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSDocument" target="_top">NSDocument</a></code> class:</p><div class="codesample"><table><tr><td scope="row"><pre>- (id)initWithType:(NSString *)typeName error:(NSError **)outError;<span></span></pre></td></tr></table></div></li><li class="li"><p>In a similar fashion, methods that perform some system operation (such as reading or writing a file) often return a Boolean value to indicate success or failure.</p><p>These methods might also include a pointer to an <code>NSError</code> object as a final by-reference parameter. For example, there’s this method from the <code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSData_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSData" target="_top">NSData</a></code> class:</p><div class="codesample"><table><tr><td scope="row"><pre>- (BOOL)writeToFile:(NSString *)path options:(unsigned)writeOptionsMask error:(NSError **)errorPtr;<span></span></pre></td></tr></table></div></li><li class="li"><p>Empty container objects are used to indicate a default value or no value—<code>nil</code> is usually not a valid object argument. </p><p>Many objects encapsulate values or collections of objects, for example, instances of <code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSString_Class/Reference/NSString.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSString" target="_top">NSString</a></code>, <code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSDate_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSDate" target="_top">NSDate</a></code>, <code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSArray_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSArray" target="_top">NSArray</a></code>, and <code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSDictionary_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSDictionary" target="_top">NSDictionary</a></code>.  Methods that take these objects as parameters may accept an “empty” object (for example, <code>@""</code>) to indicate “no value” or “default value”. For example, the following message sets the represented filename for a window to “no value” by specifying an empty string:</p><div class="codesample"><table><tr><td scope="row"><pre>[aWindow setRepresentedFilename:@""];<span></span></pre></td></tr></table></div><div class="notebox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-SW48" title="Note"></a><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;The Objective-C construct <code>@"</code><em>characters</em><code>"</code> creates an <code>NSString</code> object containing the literal <em>characters</em>. Thus, <code>@""</code> would create a string object with no characters—or, an empty string. For more information, see <em><a href="../../Strings/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000035i" target="_top">String Programming Guide for Cocoa</a></em>.</p></div></li><li class="li"><p>The Cocoa frameworks expect that global string constants rather than string literals are used for dictionary keys, notification and exception names, and some method parameters that take strings. </p><p>You should always prefer string constants over string literals when you have a choice. By using string constants, you enlist the help of the compiler to check your spelling and thus avoid runtime errors. </p></li><li class="li"><p>The Cocoa frameworks use types consistently, giving higher impedance matching across their API sets.</p><p>For example, the frameworks use <code>float</code> for coordinate values, <code>CGFloat</code> for both graphical and coordinate values, <code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Miscellaneous/Foundation_DataTypes/Reference/reference.html#//apple_ref/c/tdef/NSPoint" target="_top">NSPoint</a></code> (Application Kit) or <code><a href="../../../../GraphicsImaging/Reference/CGGeometry/Reference/reference.html#//apple_ref/c/tdef/CGPoint" target="_top">CGPoint</a></code> (UIKit) for a location in a coordinate system,  <code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSString_Class/Reference/NSString.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSString" target="_top">NSString</a></code> objects for string values, <code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Miscellaneous/Foundation_DataTypes/Reference/reference.html#//apple_ref/c/tdef/NSRange" target="_top">NSRange</a></code> (Application Kit) for ranges, and <code>NSInteger</code> and <code>NSUInteger</code> for, respectively, signed  and unsigned integral values. When you design your own APIs, you should strive for similar type consistency.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Unless stated otherwise in the documentation or header files, sizes that are returned in methods such as <code><a href="../../../Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSView_Class/Reference/NSView.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSView/frame" target="_top">frame</a></code> and <code><a href="../../../Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSView_Class/Reference/NSView.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSView/bounds" target="_top">bounds</a></code> (<code>NSView</code>) are in points.</p></li></ul><p>A substantial subset of Cocoa API conventions concerns the naming of classes, methods, functions, constants, and other symbols. You should be aware of these conventions when you begin designing your own programmatic interfaces. Some of the more important of these naming conventions are the following:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Use prefixes for class names and for symbols associated with the class, such as functions and <code>typedef</code>’s.</p><p>A prefix protects against collisions and helps to differentiate functional areas. The prefix convention is two or three unique uppercase letters, for example, the “AC” in <code>ACCircle</code>.</p></li><li class="li"><p>With API names, it’s better to be clear than brief.</p><p>For example, it’s easy to understand what <code>removeObjectAtIndex:</code> does but <code>remove:</code> is ambiguous.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Avoid ambiguous names.</p><p>For example, <code>displayName</code> is ambiguous because it’s unclear whether it displays the name or returns the display name. </p></li><li class="li"><p>Use verbs in the names of methods or functions that represent actions.</p></li><li class="li"><p>If a method returns an attribute or computed value, the name of the method is the name of the attribute.</p><p>These methods are known as “getter” accessor methods. For example, if the attribute is background color, the getter method should be named <code>backgroundColor</code>. Getter methods that return a Boolean value are of a slight variation, using an “is” or “has” prefix—for example, <code>hasColor</code>.</p></li><li class="li"><p>If a method sets the value of an attribute—that is, a “setter” accessor method—it begins with “set” followed by the attribute name.</p><p>The first letter of the attribute name is in uppercase—for example, <code>setBackgroundColor:</code>.</p><div class="notebox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-SW49" title="Note"></a><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;The implementation of setter and getter methods are discussed in detail in <span class="content_text"><a href="AddingBehaviorCocoa.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-SW5">“Storing and Accessing Properties”</a></span> and in <em><a href="../../ModelObjects/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001931" target="_top">Model Object Implementation Guide</a></em>.</p></div></li><li class="li"><p>Do not abbreviate parts of API names unless the abbreviation is well known (for example, HTML or TIFF).</p></li></ul><p>For the complete set of naming guidelines for Objective-C programmatic interfaces, see <em><a href="../../CodingGuidelines/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000146i" target="_top">Coding Guidelines for Cocoa</a></em>.</p><p>A general, overarching API convention regards object ownership with memory-managed applications (versus garbage-collected applications). Briefly stated, the convention is that a client owns an object if it creates the object (by allocation then initialization), copies it, or retains it (by sending it <code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Protocols/NSObject_Protocol/Reference/NSObject.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/NSObject/retain" target="_top">retain</a></code>). An owner of an object is responsible for its disposal by sending <code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Protocols/NSObject_Protocol/Reference/NSObject.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/NSObject/release" target="_top">release</a></code> or <code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Protocols/NSObject_Protocol/Reference/NSObject.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/NSObject/autorelease" target="_top">autorelease</a></code> to the object when it no longer needs it.

Since the model is generic, it is not surprising that some framework classes are abstract or intentionally incomplete. A class often does much of its work in low-level and common code, but leaves significant portions of the work either undone or completed in a safe but generic “default” fashion. </p><p>An application often needs to create a subclass that fills in these gaps in its superclass, supplying the pieces the framework class is missing. A subclass is the primary way to add application-specific behavior to a framework. An instance of your custom subclass takes its place in the network of objects the framework defines. It inherits the ability to work with other objects from the framework. For example, if you create a subclass of <code><a href="../../../Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSCell_Class/Reference/NSCell.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSCell" target="_top">NSCell</a></code> (Application Kit), instances of this new class are able to appear in an <code><a href="../../../Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSMatrix_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSMatrix" target="_top">NSMatrix</a></code> object, just as <code><a href="../../../Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSButtonCell_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSButtonCell" target="_top">NSButtonCell</a></code>, <code><a href="../../../Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSTextFieldCell_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSTextFieldCell" target="_top">NSTextFieldCell</a></code>, and other framework-defined cell objects can.</p><p>When you make a subclass, one of your primary tasks is to implement a specific set of methods declared by a superclass (or in a protocol adopted by a superclass). Re-implementing an inherited method is known as <em>overriding</em> that method.<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_35"></a></p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-SW13" title="When to Override a Method"></a><h3>When to Override a Method</h3><p>Most methods defined in a framework class are fully implemented; they exist so you can invoke them to obtain the services the class provides. You rarely need to override such methods and shouldn’t attempt to. The framework depends on them doing just what they do—nothing more and nothing less. In other cases, you can override a method, but there’s no real reason to do so. The framework’s version of the method does an adequate job. But just as you might implement your own version of a string-comparison function rather than use <code>strcmp</code>, you can choose to override the framework method if you wish.</p><p>Some <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_36"></a>framework methods, however, are intended to be overridden; they exist to let you add program-specific behavior to the framework. Often the method, as implemented by the framework, does little or nothing that’s of value to your application, but is invoked in messages initiated by other framework methods. To give content to these kinds of methods, an application must implement its own version.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-SW30" title="Invoke or Override?"></a><h4>Invoke or Override?</h4><p>The framework methods you override in a subclass generally won’t be ones that you’ll invoke yourself, at least directly. You simply re-implement the method and leave the rest up to the framework. In fact, the more likely you are to write an application-specific version of a method, the less likely you are to invoke it in your own code. There’s a good reason for this. In a general sense, a framework class declares public methods so that you, the developer, can do one of two things:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Invoke them to avail yourself of the services the class provide</p></li><li class="li"><p>Override them to introduce your own code into the program model defined by the framework</p></li></ul><p>Sometimes a method falls into both these categories; it renders a valuable service upon invocation, and it can be strategically overridden. But generally, if a method is one that you can invoke, it’s fully defined by the framework and doesn’t need to be redefined in your code. If the method is one that you need to re-implement in a subclass, the framework has a particular job for it to do and so will invoke the method itself at the appropriate times. <span class="content_text">Figure 3-2</span> illustrates the two general types of framework methods.</p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-SW11" title="Figure 3-2Invoking a framework method that messages an overridden method"></a><p><strong>Figure 3-2&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Invoking a framework method that messages an overridden method</p><img src = "../Art/message_web.gif" alt = "Invoking a framework method that messages an overridden method" width="330" height="163"></div><br/><p>Much of the work of object-oriented programming with a Cocoa framework is implementing methods that your program uses only indirectly, through messages arranged by the framework.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-SW31" title="Types of Overridden Methods"></a><h4>Types of Overridden Methods</h4><p>You may choose to define several different <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_37"></a>types of methods in a subclass:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Some framework methods are fully implemented and are meant to be invoked by other framework methods. In other words, even though you may re-implement these methods, you often don’t invoke them elsewhere in your code. They provide some service—data or behavior—required by some other code at some point during program execution. These methods exist in the public interface for just one reason—so that you can override them if you want to. They give you an opportunity either to substitute your own algorithm for the one used by the framework or to modify or extend the framework algorithm.</p><p>An example of this type of method is <code><a href="../../../Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSMenuView_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSMenuView/trackWithEvent:" target="_top">trackWithEvent:</a></code>, defined in the <code><a href="../../../Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSMenuView_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSMenuView" target="_top">NSMenuView</a></code> class of the Application Kit. <code>NSMenuView</code> implements this method to satisfy the immediate requirement—handling menu tracking and item selection—but you may override it if you want different behavior.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Another type of method is one that makes an object-specific decision, such as whether an attribute is turned on or whether a certain policy is in effect. The framework implements a default version of this method that makes the decision one way, and you must implement your own version if you want a different decision. In most cases, implementation is simply a matter of returning <code>YES</code> or <code>NO</code>, or of calculating a value other than the default. </p><p>The   <code><a href="../../../Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSResponder_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSResponder/acceptsFirstResponder" target="_top">acceptsFirstResponder</a></code> method of <code>NSResponder</code> is typical of this kind. Views are sent <code>acceptsFirstResponder</code> messages asking, among other things, if they respond to key strokes or mouse clicks. By default, <code><a href="../../../Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSView_Class/Reference/NSView.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSView" target="_top">NSView</a></code> objects return <code>NO</code> for this method—most views don’t accept typed input. But some do, and they should override <code>acceptsFirstResponder</code> to return <code>YES</code>. A UIKit example is the <code><!--a target="_top" -->layerClass<!--/a--></code> class method of <code>UIView</code>; if you do not want the default layer class for the view, you can override the method and substitute your own.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Some methods must be overridden, but only to add something, not to replace what the framework implementation of the method does. The subclass version of the method augments the behavior of the superclass version. When your program implements one of these methods, it’s important that it incorporate the very method it overrides. It does this by sending a <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_38"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_39"></a>message to <code>super</code> (the superclass), invoking the framework-defined version of the method.</p><p>Often this kind of method is one that every class in a chain of inheritance is expected to contribute to. For example, objects that archive themselves must conform to the <code>NSCoding</code> protocol and implement the <code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Protocols/NSCoding_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/NSCoding/initWithCoder:" target="_top">initWithCoder:</a></code>and <code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Protocols/NSCoding_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/NSCoding/encodeWithCoder:" target="_top">encodeWithCoder:</a></code> methods. But before a class performs the encoding or decoding that is specific to its instance variables, it must invoke the superclass version of the method.</p><p>Sometimes a subclass version of a method wants to “reuse” the superclass behavior and then add something, however small, to the final result. In the <code>NSView</code> <code><a href="../../../Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSView_Class/Reference/NSView.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSView/drawRect:" target="_top">drawRect:</a></code> and <code>UIView</code> <code><!--a target="_top" -->drawRect:<!--/a--></code> methods, for example, a subclass of a view class that performs some complicated drawing might want to draw a border around the drawing, so it would invoke <code>super</code> first. </p></li><li class="li"><p>Some framework methods do nothing at all or merely return some trivial default value (such as <code>self</code>) to prevent runtime or compile-time errors. These methods are meant to be overridden. The framework cannot define these methods even in rudimentary form because they carry out tasks that are entirely <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_40"></a>program-specific. There’s no need to incorporate the framework implementation of the method with a message to <code>super</code>.</p><p>Most methods that a subclass overrides belong in this group. For example, the <code>NSDocument</code> methods <code><a href="../../../Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSDocument_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSDocument/dataOfType:error:" target="_top">dataOfType:error:</a></code> and <code><a href="../../../Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSDocument_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSDocument/readFromData:ofType:error:" target="_top">readFromData:ofType:error:</a></code> (among others) must be overridden when you create a document-based application.</p></li></ul><p>Overriding a method does not have to be a formidable task. You can often make significant change in superclass behavior by a careful re-implementation of the method that entails no more than one or two lines of code. And you are not entirely on your own when you implement your own version of a method. You can draw on the classes, methods, functions, and types already provided by the Cocoa frameworks. </p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-SW22" title="When to Make a Subclass"></a><h3>When to Make a Subclass</h3><p>Just as important as knowing which methods of a class to override—and indeed preceding that decision—is identifying those classes to inherit from. Sometimes these decisions can be obvious, and sometimes they can be far from simple. A few <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_41"></a>design considerations can guide your choices.</p><p>First, know the framework. You should become familiar with the purpose and capabilities of each framework class. Maybe there is a class that already does what you want to do. And if you find a class that does <em>almost</em> what you want done, you’re in luck. That class is a promising superclass for your custom class. <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_42"></a>Subclassing is a process of reusing an existing class and specializing it for your needs. Sometimes all a subclass needs to do is override a single inherited method and have the method do something slightly different from the original behavior. Other subclasses might add one or two attributes to their superclass (as instance variables), and then define the methods that access and operate on these attributes, integrating them into the superclass behavior.</p><p>There are other considerations that can help you decide where your subclass best fits into the class hierarchy. What is the nature of the application, or of the part of the application you’re trying to craft? Some Cocoa architectures impose their own subclassing requirements. For example, if yours is a multiple-document application on Mac OS X, the document-based architecture defined by the Application Kit requires you to subclass <code><a href="../../../Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSDocument_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSDocument" target="_top">NSDocument</a></code> and perhaps other classes as well. To make your Mac OS X application scriptable (that is, responsive to AppleScript commands), you might have to subclass one of the scripting classes of the Application Kit, such as <code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSScriptCommand_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSScriptCommand" target="_top">NSScriptCommand</a></code>. </p><p>Another factor is the role that instances of the subclass will play in the application. The Model-View-Control design pattern, a major one in Cocoa, assigns roles to objects: they’re view objects that appear on the user interface; model objects holding application data (and the algorithms that act on that data); or controller objects, which mediate between view and model objects. (For details, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../CocoaDesignPatterns/CocoaDesignPatterns.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH6-SW1">“The Model-View-Controller Design Pattern.”</a></span>) Knowing what role an object plays can narrow the decision for which superclass to use. If instances of your class are view objects that do their own custom drawing and event-handling, your class should probably inherit from <code><a href="../../../Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSView_Class/Reference/NSView.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSView" target="_top">NSView</a></code> (if you are using the Application Kit) or from <code><!--a target="_top" -->UIView<!--/a--></code> (if you are using UIKit). If your application needs a controller object, you can either use one of the off-the-shelf controller classes of the Application Kit (such as <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_43"></a><code><a href="../../../Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSObjectController_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSObjectController" target="_top">NSObjectController</a></code>) or, if you want a different behavior, subclass <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_44"></a><code><a href="../../../Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSController_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSController" target="_top">NSController</a></code> or <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_45"></a><code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSObject_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSObject" target="_top">NSObject</a></code>. If your class is a typical model class—say, one whose objects represent rows of corporate data in a spreadsheet—you probably should subclass <code>NSObject</code> or use the <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_46"></a>Core Data framework. </p><div class="notebox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-SW50" title="iPhone OS Note"></a><p><strong>iPhone OS Note:</strong>&nbsp;The controller classes of the Application Kit, including <code>NSController</code>, have no counterparts in UIKit. There are controller classes in UIKit—<code><!--a target="_top" -->UIViewController<!--/a--></code>, <code><!--a target="_top" -->UITableViewController<!--/a--></code>, <code><!--a target="_top" -->UINavigationController<!--/a--></code>, and <code><!--a target="_top" -->UITabBarController<!--/a--></code>—but these classes are based on a different design and have a different purpose—application navigation and mode selection (see <span class="content_text"><a href="../CocoaDesignPatterns/CocoaDesignPatterns.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH6-SW88">“View Controllers in UIKit”</a></span> for a summary). In addition, iPhone OS does not include the Core Data framework.</p></div><p>Yet <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_47"></a>subclassing is sometimes not the best way to solve a problem. There may be a better approach you could take. If you just want to add a few convenience methods to a class, you might create a <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_48"></a>category instead of a subclass. Or you could employ one of the many other design-pattern based resources of the Cocoa development “tool box,” such as <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_49"></a>delegation, <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_50"></a>notification, and <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_51"></a>target-action (described in <span class="content_text"><a href="../CommunicatingWithObjects/CommunicateWithObjects.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH7-SW15">“Communicating With Objects”</a></span>). When deciding on a candidate superclass, scan the header file of the class (or the reference documentation) to see if there is a delegation method, a notification, or some other mechanism that will enable you to do what you want without subclassing.</p><p>In a similar vein, you can also examine the header files or documentation for the framework’s <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_52"></a>protocols. By adopting a protocol, you might be able to accomplish your goal while avoiding the difficulties of a complex subclass. For example, if you want to manage the enabled states of menu items, you can adopt the <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_53"></a><code>NSMenuValidation</code> protocol in a custom controller class; you don’t have to subclass <code><a href="../../../Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSMenuItem_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSMenuItem" target="_top">NSMenuItem</a></code> or <code><a href="../../../Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSMenu_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSMenu" target="_top">NSMenu</a></code> to get this behavior. </p><p>Just as some framework methods are not intended to be overridden, some framework classes (such as <code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSFileManager_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSFileManager" target="_top">NSFileManager</a></code> in the Application Kit and, in UIKit, <code><!--a target="_top" -->UIWebView<!--/a--></code>) are not intended to be subclassed. If you do attempt such a subclass, you should proceed with caution. The implementations of certain framework classes are complicated and tightly integrated into the implementations of other classes and even different parts of the operating system. Often it is difficult to duplicate correctly what a framework method does or to anticipate interdependencies or effects the method might have. Changes that you make in some method implementations could have far-reaching, unforeseen, and unpleasant consequences. </p><p>In some cases, you can get around these difficulties by using <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_54"></a>object composition, a general technique of assembling objects in a “host” object, which manages them to get complex and highly customized behavior (see <span class="content_text">Figure 3-3</span>). Instead of inheriting directly from a complex framework superclass, you might create a custom class that holds an instance of that superclass as an instance variable. The custom class itself could be fairly simple, perhaps inheriting directly from the root class, <code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSObject_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSObject" target="_top">NSObject</a></code>; although simple in terms of inheritance, the class manipulates, extends, and augments the embedded instance. To client objects it can appear in some respects to be a subclass of the complex superclass, although it probably won’t share the interface of the superclass. The Foundation framework class <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_55"></a><code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSAttributedString_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSAttributedString" target="_top">NSAttributedString</a></code> gives an example of object composition. <code>NSAttributedString</code> holds an <code>NSString</code> object as an instance variable, and exposes it through the <code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSAttributedString_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSAttributedString/string" target="_top">string</a></code> method. <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_56"></a><code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSString_Class/Reference/NSString.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSString" target="_top">NSString</a></code> is a class with complex behaviors, including string encoding, string searching, and path manipulation. <code>NSAttributedString</code> augments these behaviors with the capability for attaching attributes such as font, color, alignment, and paragraph style to a range of characters.

The <code>#import</code><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_67"></a> preprocessor command is similar to <code>#include</code> in that it incorporates the specified header file. However, <code>#import</code> improves on efficiency by including the file only if it was not previously included, directly or indirectly, for compilation. The angle brackets (<code>&lt;...></code>) following the command identify the framework the header file is from and, after a slash character, the header file itself. Thus the syntax for an <code>#import</code> line takes the form:</p><p><code>#import &lt;</code><em>Framework</em><code>/</code><em>File</em><code>.h></code></p><p>The framework must be in one of the standard system locations for frameworks. In the example in <span class="content_text"><a href="AddingBehaviorCocoa.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-SW10">Listing 3-2</a></span>, the class interface file imports the file <code>Foundation.h</code> from the Foundation framework. As in this case, the Cocoa convention is that the header file having the same name as the framework contains a list of <code>#import</code> commands that include all the public interfaces (and other public headers) of the framework. Incidentally, if the class you’re defining is part of an application, all you need to do is import the <code>Cocoa.h</code> file of the Cocoa umbrella framework.</p><p>If you must import a header file that is part of your project, use quotation marks rather than angle brackets as delimiters; for example:</p><div class="codesample"><table><tr><td scope="row"><pre>#import "MyDataTypes.h"<span></span></pre></td></tr></table></div><p>The class <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_68"></a>implementation file has a simpler structure, as shown by <span class="content_text">Listing 3-3</span>.

When you design a subclass, an essential step is identifying the methods you are going to override and thinking about how you are going to re-implement them.</p><p>Although <span class="content_text"><a href="AddingBehaviorCocoa.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-SW13">“When to Override a Method”</a></span> offers some general guidelines, identifying which superclass methods to override requires you to investigate the class. Peruse the header files and documentation of the class. Also locate the <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_71"></a>designated initializer of the superclass because, for initialization to succeed, you must invoke the superclass version of this method in your class’s designated initializer. (See <span class="content_text"><a href="../CocoaObjects/CocoaObjects.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH4-SW17">“Object Creation”</a></span> for details.)</p><p>Once you have identified the methods, you can start—from a purely practical standpoint—by copying the declarations of the methods to be overridden into your interface file. Then copy those same declarations into your <code>.m</code> file as skeletal method implementations by replacing the terminating semicolon with enclosing braces. </p><p>Remember, as discussed in <span class="content_text"><a href="AddingBehaviorCocoa.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-SW13">“When to Override a Method,”</a></span> a Cocoa framework (and not your own code) usually invokes the framework methods that you override. In some situations you need to let the framework know that it should invoke your overridden version of a method and not the original method. Cocoa gives you various ways to accomplish this. The Interface Builder application, for example, allows you to substitute your class for a (compatible) framework class in its Info (inspector) window. If you create a custom <code><a href="../../../Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSCell_Class/Reference/NSCell.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSCell" target="_top">NSCell</a></code> class, you can associate it with a particular control using the  <code><a href="../../../Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSControl_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSControl/setCell:" target="_top">setCell:</a></code> method of the <code>NSControl</code> class. </p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-SW12" title="Instance Variables"></a><h3>Instance Variables</h3><p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_72"></a>The reason for creating a custom class, aside from modifying the behavior of the superclass, is to add <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_73"></a>properties  to it. (The word “properties” here is intended in a general sense, indicating both the attributes of an instance of the subclass and the relationships that instance has to other objects.) Given a hypothetical Circle class, if you are going to make a subclass that adds color to the shape, the subclass must somehow carry the attribute of color. To accomplish this, you might add a <code>color</code> instance variable (most likely typed as an <code><a href="../../../Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSColor_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSColor" target="_top">NSColor</a></code> object for a Mac OS X application, or a <code><!--a target="_top" -->UIColor<!--/a--></code> object for an iPhone application) to the class interface. Instances of your custom class encapsulate the new attribute, holding it as a persistent, characterizing piece of data. </p><p>Instance variables in Objective-C are declarations of objects, structures, and other data types that are part of the class definition. If they are objects, the declaration can either <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_74"></a>dynamically type (using <code>id</code>) or <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_75"></a>statically type the object. The following example shows both styles:</p><div class="codesample"><table><tr><td scope="row"><pre>id delegate;<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>NSColor *color;<span></span></pre></td></tr></table></div><p>Generally, you dynamically type an object instance variable when the class membership of the object is indeterminate or unimportant. Objects held as instances variables should be created, copied, or explicitly retained—unless they are already retained by a parent object (as is the case with delegates). If an instance is unarchived, it should retain its object instance variables as it decodes and assigns them in<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_76"></a> <code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Protocols/NSCoding_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/NSCoding/initWithCoder:" target="_top">initWithCoder:</a></code>. (For more on object archiving and unarchiving, see <span class="content_text"><a href="AddingBehaviorCocoa.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-SW6">“Entry and Exit Points.”</a></span>)</p><p>The convention for naming <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_77"></a>instance variables is to make them a lowercase string containing no punctuation marks or special characters. If the name contains multiple words, run them together, but make the first letter of the second and each succeeding word uppercase. For example: </p><div class="codesample"><table><tr><td scope="row"><pre>NSString *title;<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>UIColor *backgroundColor;<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>NSRange currentSelectedRange;<span></span></pre></td></tr></table></div><p>When the tag <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_78"></a><code>IBOutlet</code> precedes the declarations of instance variables, it identifies an outlet with (presumably) a connection archived in a nib file. The tag also enables <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_79"></a>Interface Builder and <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_80"></a>Xcode to synchronize their activities. <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_81"></a>When outlets are unarchived from an Interface Builder nib file, the connections are automatically reestablished.</p><p>Instance variables can hold more than an object’s attributes, vendable to clients of the object. Sometimes instance variables can hold private data that is used as the basis for some task performed by the object; a backing store or a cache are examples. (If data is not per-instance, but is to be shared among instances of a class, use global variables instead of instance variables.)</p><p>When you add instance variables to a subclass, it’s worthwhile to heed a few guidelines:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Add only instance variables that are absolutely necessary. The more instance variables you add, the more the instance size swells. And the more instances of your class that are created, the more of a concern this becomes. If it’s possible, compute a critical value from existing instance variables rather than add another instance variable to hold that value.</p></li><li class="li"><p>For the same reason of economy, try to represent the instance data of the class efficiently. For example, if you want to specify a number of flags as instance variables, use a bit field instead of a series of Boolean declarations. (Be aware, however, that there are archiving complications with bit fields). You might use an <code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSDictionary_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSDictionary" target="_top">NSDictionary</a></code> object to consolidate a number of related attributes as key-value pairs; if you do this, make sure that the keys are adequately documented. </p></li><li class="li"><p>Give the proper <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_82"></a>scope to your instance variables. Never scope a variable as <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_83"></a><code>@public</code> as this violates the principle of encapsulation. Use <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_84"></a><code>@protected</code> for instance variables if you know which are the likely subclasses of your class (such as the classes of your application) and you require efficient access of data. Otherwise, <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_85"></a><code>@private</code> is a reasonable choice for the high degree of implementation hiding it provides. This implementation hiding is especially important for classes exposed by a framework and used by applications or other frameworks; it permits the modification of the class implementation without the need to recompile all clients.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Make sure there are declared <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_86"></a> properties or <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_87"></a>accessor methods for those instance variables that are essential attributes or relationships of the class. Accessor methods and declared properties preserve encapsulation by enabling the values of instance variables to be set and retrieved.

The general notion comes from the design pattern of object modeling. The language-specific meaning relates to the language feature of declared properties. </p><p>As described in <span class="content_text"><a href="../CocoaDesignPatterns/CocoaDesignPatterns.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH6-SW2">“Object Modeling,”</a></span> a property is a defining characteristic of an object (called in the object modeling pattern an entity) and is part of its encapsulated data. A property can be of two sorts: an attribute, such as title and location, or a relationship. Relationships can be to-one or to-many, and can take many forms, such as an outlet, a delegate, or a collection of other objects. Properties are usually, but not necessarily, stored as instance variables.</p><p>Part of the overall strategy for a well-designed class is to enforce encapsulation. Client objects should not be able to directly access properties where they are stored, but instead access them through the interface of the class. The methods that grant access to the properties of an object are called accessor methods. <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_106"></a>Accessor methods (or, simply, “accessors”) get and set the values of <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_107"></a> an object’s properties. They function as the gates to those properties, regulating access to them and enforcing the encapsulation of the object’s instance data. The accessor method that gets a value is, by convention, called a “getter” method and the method that sets a property’s value is called a “setter” method.</p><p>The declared properties feature (introduced in Objective-C 2.0) has brought changes, some subtle, to how you control access to properties. A declared property is a syntactical shorthand for declaring the getter and setter methods of a class’s property. In the implementation block you can then request the compiler to synthesize those methods. As summarized in <span class="content_text"><a href="../CocoaObjects/CocoaObjects.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH4-SW38">“Declared Properties,”</a></span> you declare a property, using the <code>@property</code> directive, in the <code>@interface</code> block of a class definition. The declaration specifies the name and type of the property and may include qualifiers that tell the compiler <em>how</em> to implement the accessor methods. </p><p>When you design a class, several factors affect how you might store and access the properties of the class. You may choose to use the declared properties feature and have the compiler synthesize accessor methods for you. Or you may elect to implement the class’s accessor methods yourself; this is an option even if you do use declared properties. Another important factor is whether your code operates in a garbage-collected environment. If the garbage collector is enabled, the implementation of accessor methods is much simpler than it is in memory-managed code. The following sections describe the various alternatives for storing and accessing properties.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-SW36" title="Taking Advantage of Declared Properties"></a><h4>Taking Advantage of Declared Properties</h4><p>Unless you have a compelling reason otherwise, it is recommended that you use the declared properties feature of Objective-C 2.0 in new projects rather than manually writing all of your own accessor methods. First, declared properties relieve you of the tedious burden of accessor-method implementation. Second, by having the compiler synthesize accessor methods for you, you reduce the possibility of programming errors and ensure more consistent behavior in your class implementation. And finally, the declarative style of declared properties makes your intent clear to other developers.</p><p>You might declare some properties with <code>@property</code> but still need to implement your own accessor methods for them. The typical reason for doing this is wanting the method to do something more than simply get or set the value of the property. For example, the resource for an attribute has to be loaded from the file system—say, a large image file—and for performance reasons you want your getter method to load the resource lazily (that is, the first time it is requested). If you have to implement an accessor method for such a reason, see <span class="content_text"><a href="AddingBehaviorCocoa.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-SW23">“Implementing Accessor Methods”</a></span> for tips and guidelines. You tell the compiler not to synthesize accessor methods for a property either by designating that property with a <code>@dynamic</code> directive in the class’s <code>@implementation</code> block or simply by not specifying a <code>@synthesize</code> directive for the property (<code>@dynamic</code> is the default); the compiler refrains from synthesizing an accessor method if it sees that such a method already exists in the implementation and there is no <code>@synthesize</code> directive for it.</p><p>If garbage collection is disabled for your program, the attribute you use to qualify your property declarations is important. By default (the <code>assign</code> attribute), a synthesized setter method performs simple assignment,  which is appropriate for garbage-collected code. But in memory-managed code simple assignment is not appropriate for properties with object values. You must either retain or copy the assigned object in your setter method; you tell the compiler to do this when you qualify a property declaration with a <code>retain</code> or <code>copy</code> attribute. Note that you should <em>always</em> specify the <code>copy</code> attribute for an object property whose class conforms to the <code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Protocols/NSCopying_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/intf/NSCopying" target="_top">NSCopying</a></code> protocol, even if garbage collection is enabled.</p><p>The following examples illustrate a variety of behaviors you can achieve with property declarations (with different sets of qualifying attributes) in the <code>@interface</code> block and <code>@synthesize</code> and <code>@dynamic</code> directives in the <code>@implementation</code> block. The following code instructs the compiler to synthesize accessor methods for the declared <code>name</code> and <code>accountID</code> properties; because the <code>accountID</code> property is read-only, the compiler synthesizes only a getter method. In this case, garbage collection is assumed to be enabled. </p><div class="codesample"><table><tr><td scope="row"><pre>@interface MyClass : NSObject {<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>    NSString *name;<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>    NSNumber *accountID;<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>}<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>@property (copy) NSString *name;<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>@property (readonly) NSNumber *accountID;<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>// ...<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>@end<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>@implementation MyClass<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>@synthesize name, accountID;<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>// ...<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>@end<span></span></pre></td></tr></table></div><div class="notebox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-SW54" title="Note"></a><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;As shown in this and subsequent code examples, a property in a 32-bit process must be backed by an instance variable.

The assumption is that garbage collection is not enabled, so the declaration for the <code>currentHost</code> property has a <code>retain</code> attribute, which instructs the compiler to retain the new value in its synthesized getter method. In addition, the declaration for the <code>hidden</code> property includes a qualifying attribute that instructs the compiler to synthesize a getter method named <code>isHidden</code>.

For a <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_109"></a>method that returns the value of an instance variable (sometimes called the <em>getter</em>), the name of the method is simply the name of the instance variable.

The getter accessor vends the value of the instance variable to the object requesting it. The operations of both types of accessors have implications for memory management given two assumptions from the Cocoa object-ownership policy:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Objects returned from methods (such as from getter accessors) are valid in the scope of the invoking object.

The setter accessor, on the other hand, is busier. After verifying that the passed-in value for the instance variable isn’t the same as the current value, it autoreleases the current value before copying the new value to the instance variable. (Sending <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_113"></a><code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Protocols/NSObject_Protocol/Reference/NSObject.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/NSObject/autorelease" target="_top">autorelease</a></code> to the object is “more thread-safe” than sending it <code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Protocols/NSObject_Protocol/Reference/NSObject.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/NSObject/release" target="_top">release</a></code>.) However, there is still a potential danger with this approach. What if a client is using the object returned by the getter accessor and meanwhile the setter accessor autoreleases the old NSString object and then, soon after, that object is released and destroyed? The client object’s reference to the instance variable would no longer be valid. </p><p><span class="content_text">Listing 3-8</span> shows another implementation of the accessor methods that works around this problem by retaining and then autoreleasing the instance variable value in the getter method.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-SW16" title="Listing 3-8Implementing accessors for an object instance variable&acirc;&#128;&#148;better technique"></a><p class="codesample"><strong>Listing 3-8&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Implementing accessors for an object instance variable—better technique</p><div class="codesample"><table><tr><td scope="row"><pre> - (NSString *)title {<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>    return [[title retain] autorelease];<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre> }<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre> - (void)setTitle:(NSString *)newTitle {<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>    if (title != newTitle) {<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>        [title release];<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>        title = [newTitle copy];<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>    }<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>}<span></span></pre></td></tr></table></div><p>In both examples of the setter method above (<span class="content_text">Listing 3-5</span> and <span class="content_text">Listing 3-7</span>), the new <code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSString_Class/Reference/NSString.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSString" target="_top">NSString</a></code> instance variable is <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_114"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_115"></a>copied rather than retained. Why isn’t it retained? The general rule is this: When the object assigned to an instance variable is a <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_116"></a>value object—that is, an object that represents an attribute such as a string, date, number, or corporate record—you should copy it. You are interested in preserving the attribute value, and don't want to risk having it mutate from under you.  In other words, you want your own copy of the object.</p><p>However, if the object to be stored and accessed is an <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_117"></a>entity object, such as an <code><a href="../../../Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSView_Class/Reference/NSView.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSView" target="_top">NSView</a></code> or an <code><a href="../../../Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSWindow_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSWindow" target="_top">NSWindow</a></code> object, you should retain it. Entity objects are more aggregate and relational, and copying them can be expensive. One way to determine whether an object is a value object or entity object is to decide whether you’re interested in the value of the object or in the object itself. If you’re interested in the value, it’s probably a value object and you should copy it (assuming, of course, the object conforms to the <code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Protocols/NSCopying_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/intf/NSCopying" target="_top">NSCopying</a></code> protocol). </p><p>Another way to decide whether to retain or copy an instance variable in a setter method is to determine if the instance variable is an attribute or relationship. This is especially true for model objects, which are objects that represent the data of an application. An attribute is essentially the same thing as a value object: an object that is a defining characteristic of the object that encapsulates it, such as a color (<code><a href="../../../Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSColor_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSColor" target="_top">NSColor</a></code> object) or title (<code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSString_Class/Reference/NSString.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSString" target="_top">NSString</a></code> object). A relationship on the other hand is just that: a relationship with (or reference to) one or more other objects. Generally, in setter methods you copy the values of attributes and you retain relationships. However, relationships have a cardinality; they can be one-to-one or one-to-many. One-to-many relationships, which are typically represented by collection objects such as <code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSArray_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSArray" target="_top">NSArray</a></code> instances or <code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSSet_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSSet" target="_top">NSSet</a></code> instances, may require setter methods to do something other than simply retain the instance variable.

In object modeling, objects—particularly the data-bearing model objects of the <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_123"></a>Model-View-Controller pattern—have <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_124"></a>properties, which usually (but not always) take the form of instance variables. A property can either be an <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_125"></a>attribute, such as name or color, or it can be a reference to one or more other objects. These references are known as <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_126"></a>relationships, and relationships can be one-to-one or one-to-many. The network of objects in a program form an object graph through their relationships with each other. In object modeling you can use <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_127"></a>key paths—strings of dot-separated keys—to traverse the relationships in an object graph and access the properties of objects.</p><div class="notebox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-SW57" title="Note"></a><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;For a full description of object modeling, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../CocoaDesignPatterns/CocoaDesignPatterns.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH6-SW2">“Object Modeling.”</a></span></p></div><p>Key-value binding, key-value coding, and key-value observing are enabling mechanisms for this traversal.</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Key-value binding (KVB) establishes bindings between objects, and also removes and advertises those bindings.

Your program’s memory footprint is bloated for no good reason. You should load resources or allocate memory only when there is an immediate need.</p><p>For example, if your application’s preferences window is in a separate nib file, don’t load that file until the user first chooses Preferences from the application menu. The same caution goes for allocating memory for some task; hold off on allocation until the need for that memory arises. This technique of lazy-loading or lazy-allocation is easily implemented. For example, say your application has an image that it loads, upon the first user request, for displaying in the user interface. <span class="content_text">Listing 3-9</span> shows one approach: loading the image in the getter accessor for the image.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-SW20" title="Listing 3-9Lazy-loading of a resource"></a><br/><br/><p class="codesample"><strong>Listing 3-9&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Lazy-loading of a resource</p><div class="codesample"><table><tr><td scope="row"><pre>- (NSImage *)fooImage {<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>    if (!fooImage) { // fooImage is an instance variable<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>        NSString *imagePath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"Foo" ofType:@"jpg"];<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>        if (!imagePath) return nil;<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>        fooImage = [[NSImage alloc] initWithContentsOfFile:imagePath];<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>    }<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>    return fooImage;<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>}<span></span></pre></td></tr></table></div></li><li class="li"><p>Use the Cocoa API; don’t dig down into lower-level programming interfaces.</p><p>Much effort has gone into making the implementations of the Cocoa frameworks as robust, secure, and efficient as possible. Moreover, these implementations manage interdependencies that you might not be aware of. If, instead of using the Cocoa API for a certain task, you decide to “roll your own” solution using lower-level interfaces, you’ll probably end up writing more code, which introduces a greater risk of error or inefficiency. Also, by leveraging Cocoa, you are better prepared to take advantage of future enhancements while at the same time you are more insulated from changes in the underlying implementations.

By having data processing and I/O operations run on their own secondary threads and dedicating the main thread to user-interface management, you can enhance the responsiveness of your applications. But in recent years, multithreading has assumed even greater importance with the emergence of <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_165"></a> multicore computers and symmetric multiprocessing (SMP). Concurrent processing on such systems involves synchronizing the execution of not only multiple threads on the same processor but multiple threads on multiple processors.</p><p>But making your program <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_166"></a> multithreaded is not without risk or costs. Although threads share the virtual address space of their process, they still add to the process’s memory footprint; each thread requires an additional data structure, associated attributes, and its own stack space. Multithreading also requires greater complexity of program design to synchronize access to shared memory among multiple threads. Such designs make a program harder to maintain and debug. Moreover, multithreading designs that overuse locks can actually degrade performance (relative to a single-threaded program) because of the high contention for shared resources. Designing a program for multithreading often involves tradeoffs between performance and protection and requires careful consideration of your data structures and the intended usage pattern for extra threads. Indeed, in some situations the best approach is to avoid multithreading altogether and keep all program execution on the main thread.</p><div class="notebox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-SW59" title="Further Reading"></a><p><strong>Further Reading:</strong>&nbsp;To get a solid understanding of issues and guidelines related to multithreading, read <em><a href="../../Multithreading/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000057i" target="_top">Threading Programming Guide</a></em>.

An <code>NSOperation</code> object represents a discrete task that can be executed only once.

You might start by asking yourself the following questions; if you answer “yes” to any of them, you should consider multithreading:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Is there a CPU- or I/O-intensive task that could block your application’s user interface?</p><p>The main thread manages an application’s user interface—the view part of the Model-View-Controller pattern. Thus the application can perform work that involves the application’s data model on one or more secondary threads. In a Cocoa application, because controller objects are directly involved in the management of the user interface, you would run them on the main thread.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Does your program have multiple sources of input or multiple outputs, and is it feasible to handle them simultaneously?</p></li><li class="li"><p>Do you want to spread the work your program performs across multiple CPU cores?</p></li></ul><p>Let’s say one of these situations applies to your application. As noted earlier, multithreading can involve costs and risks as well as benefits, so it’s worthwhile to consider alternatives to multithreading. For example, you might try asynchronous processing. </p><p>Just as there are situations that are appropriate for multithreading, there are situations where it’s not:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>The work requires little processing time.</p></li><li class="li"><p>The work requires steps that must be performed serially.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Underlying subsystems are not thread safe.</p></li></ul><p>The last item brings up the important issue of thread safety. There are some guidelines you should observe to ensure—as much as possible—that your multithreaded code is thread safe. Some of these guidelines are general and others are specific to Cocoa applications. The general guidelines are as follows: </p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Avoid sharing data structures across threads if possible.</p><p>Instead you can give each thread its own copy of an object (or other data) and then synchronize changes using a transaction-based model. Ideally you want to minimize resource contention as much as possible.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Lock data at the right level.</p><p>Locks are an essential component of multithreaded code, but they do impose a performance bottleneck and may not work as planned if used at the wrong level.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Catch local exceptions in your thread.</p><p>Each thread has its own call stack and is therefore responsible for catching any local exceptions and cleaning things up. The exception cannot be thrown to the main thread or any other thread for handling. Failure to catch and handle an exception may result in the termination of the thread or the owning process.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Avoid <code>volatile</code> variables in protected code.</p></li></ul><p>The additional guidelines for Cocoa programs are few:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Deal with <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_185"></a> immutable objects in your code as much as possible, especially across interface boundaries.</p><p>Objects whose value or content cannot be modified—immutable objects—are usually thread safe. Mutable objects are often not. As a corollary to this guideline, respect the declared mutability status of objects returned from method calls; if you receive an object declared as immutable but it is mutable and you modify it, you can cause behavior that is catastrophic to the program.</p></li><li class="li"><p>The main thread of a Cocoa application is responsible for receiving and dispatching events. Although your application can handle events on a secondary thread instead of the main thread, if it does it must keep all event-handling code on that thread. If you spin off the handling of events to different threads, user events (such as the letters typed on the keyboard) can occur out of sequence.</p></li><li class="li"><p>If a secondary thread is to draw a view, ensure that all drawing code falls between calls to the <code>NSView</code> methods <code><a href="../../../Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSView_Class/Reference/NSView.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSView/lockFocusIfCanDraw" target="_top">lockFocusIfCanDraw</a></code> and <code><a href="../../../Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSView_Class/Reference/NSView.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSView/unlockFocus" target="_top">unlockFocus</a></code>.</p></li></ul><div class="notebox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-SW62" title="Note"></a><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;You can learn more about these guidelines in the “<span class="content_text"><!--a target="_top" -->Thread Safety Guidelines<!--/a--></span>“ and “<span class="content_text"><!--a target="_top" -->Cocoa Thread Safety<!--/a--></span>“ articles of <em><a href="../../Multithreading/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000057i" target="_top">Threading Programming Guide</a></em>.</p> </div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-SW47" title="Are the Cocoa Frameworks Thread Safe?"></a><h3>Are the Cocoa Frameworks Thread Safe?</h3><p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_186"></a>Before you can make your program thread safe, it’s essential to know the thread safety of the frameworks that your program relies on. The core Cocoa frameworks, Foundation and Application Kit, have parts that are thread safe and parts that are not. </p><p>Generally, the classes of Foundation whose objects are immutable collections (<code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSArray_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSArray" target="_top">NSArray</a></code>, <code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSDictionary_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSDictionary" target="_top">NSDictionary</a></code>, and so on) as well as those whose immutable objects encapsulate primitive values or constructs (for example, <code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSString_Class/Reference/NSString.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSString" target="_top">NSString</a></code>, <code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSNumber_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSNumber" target="_top">NSNumber</a></code>, <code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSException_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSException" target="_top">NSException</a></code>) are thread safe. Conversely, objects of the mutable versions of these collection and primitive-value classes are not thread safe. A number of classes whose objects represent system-level entities—<code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSTask_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSTask" target="_top">NSTask</a></code>, <code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSRunLoop_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSRunLoop" target="_top">NSRunLoop</a></code>, <code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSPipe_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSPipe" target="_top">NSPipe</a></code>, <code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSHost_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSHost" target="_top">NSHost</a></code>, and <code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSPort_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSPort" target="_top">NSPort</a></code>, among others—are not thread safe. (<code><a href="../../../Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSThread_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSThread" target="_top">NSThread</a></code> and the lock classes, on the other hand, are thread safe.)</p><p>In the Application Kit, windows (<code><a href="../../../Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSWindow_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSWindow" target="_top">NSWindow</a></code> objects) are generally thread safe in that you can create and manage them on a secondary thread. Events (<code><a href="../../../Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSEvent_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSEvent" target="_top">NSEvent</a></code> objects), however, are safely handled only on the same thread, whether that be the main thread or a secondary thread; otherwise you run the risk of having events get out of sequence. Drawing and views (<code><a href="../../../Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSView_Class/Reference/NSView.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSView" target="_top">NSView</a></code> objects) are generally thread safe, although operations on views such as creating, resizing, moving should happen on the main thread.</p><p>All UIKit objects should be used on the main thread only.</p><p>For more information on the thread safety of the Cocoa frameworks, <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH5-DontLinkElementID_187"></a>see “<span class="content_text"><!--a target="_top" -->Cocoa Thread Safety<!--/a--></span>“ in <em><a href="../../Multithreading/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000057i" target="_top">Threading Programming Guide</a></em>.</p>
