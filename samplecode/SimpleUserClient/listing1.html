<pre class="sourcecodebox">Read Me for SimpleUserClient 2.0
--------------------------------
August 13, 2008

Illustrates how to add a simple user client to an I/O Kit kernel driver and
also shows the corresponding user space routines for calling into the user
client. 


Sample Requirements
-------------------
This sample requires Mac OS X 10.5 and Xcode 3.0 or later to build. It will run
on Mac OS X 10.4 or later.


Supporting Multiple KPI Versions
--------------------------------
The user client in this sample demonstrates both the legacy kernel programming
interface (KPI) that supports 32-bit user processes and the current KPI that
works with both 32-bit and 64-bit user processes. (The current KPI was added in
Mac OS X 10.5.)

Because there is no weak linking in the kernel, there is no way to build a
single binary that uses KPIs added in a newer version of Mac OS X while
maintaining binary compatibility with older versions of the OS. The way to solve
this problem is to take advantage of the &quot;sub-KEXT&quot; feature of the kernel
extension loading mechanism. When the system enumerates all of the KEXTs in
/System/Library/Extensions, it also looks in each KEXT for a Contents/PlugIns
directory. If that directory is present, the system also enumerates any KEXTs
found there. (This search is not recursive; only KEXTs at the root of
/System/Library/Extensions are checked for sub-KEXTs.)

This sample builds a main KEXT using the Mac OS X 10.5 SDK and specifying a
deployment target of Mac OS X 10.5. This KEXT can use any KPIs that were added
in that OS version. The sample also builds a sub-KEXT using the Mac OS X 10.4
SDK and specifying a deployment target of Mac OS X 10.4. Both KEXTs are built
from the same sources, using a subset of the availability macros to
conditionally compile code which can only run on one of the target OS versions.

Next is how to control which KEXT is loaded on which OS version. It's trivial
to keep the Mac OS X 10.5 KEXT from loading on earlier versions by specifying
dependencies on later version numbers in the KEXT's OSBundleLibraries property.
However, this technique won't work in the reverse scenario because much kernel
code in a newer OS version will be binary compatible with older releases.
Instead, this sample uses the IOProbeScore property to break the matching tie
between the main KEXT and sub-KEXT.


User Clients and Rosetta
------------------------
The user client in this sample shows how to tell if it has been opened by a
process running using Rosetta. This technique is intended to be used only during
the transition period until the client applications that make use of the user
client are universal.

An application running using Rosetta has the opposite (PowerPC) endianness from
the user client and driver. I/O Kit will automatically endian-swap scalar
parameters passed between an application and a user client, but I/O Kit has no
knowledge of the layout of the fields within a structure parameter. This means
that the user client has to perform the endian swapping itself if it's running
&quot;cross-endian&quot;: that is, the user client and the calling application have
opposite endianness.

While it's possible to perform the endian swapping inside the driver, it is
strongly recommended that you do this inside the user client as shown in this
sample. This is for two reasons: the driver itself then doesn't need to be
changed, which makes testing easier. It also avoids the complexity of having to
track when the driver is currently running cross-endian. The lifecycle of a user
client instance is tightly coupled to the application that opens it, so a user
client only has to test for cross-endianness once at initialization time.


Using the Sample
----------------
The sample contains two pieces. The first is a sample I/O Kit driver KEXT
called SimpleDriver. This driver includes a user client that shows how to
marshal the various combinations of scalar and structure parameters supported by
I/O Kit to and from a userland process.

The second piece is a command-line tool that exercises the API exported by the
user client. Like the driver, it uses both the 32-bit and 64-bit I/O Kit APIs.
The tool is built four-way universal (i386, x86_64, ppc, and ppc64
architectures) and takes advantage of weak linking and conditional compilation
to call the appropriate I/O Kit APIs for the target OS and processor
architecture. 

The command-line tool also shows how you can provide an abstraction layer
between your application and your user client access code. 

You can build both the KEXT and the user space tool at the same time by
selecting the 'Build All' target from the pop-up menu. 

The best way to test the driver is to install it into
/System/Library/Extensions as follows:

    $ sudo cp -R build/Debug/SimpleDriver.kext /tmp
    $ sudo mv /tmp/SimpleDriver.kext /System/Library/Extensions
    $ sudo chown -R root:wheel /System/Library/Extensions/SimpleDriver.kext
    $ sudo touch /System/Library/Extensions
    $ sudo killall -HUP kextd

(Sending a SIGHUP to kextd causes it to update its internal list of KEXTs
available for loading. See Technical Q&amp;A QA1319 &quot;Installing an I/O Kit KEXT
Without Rebooting &lt;http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2001/qa1319.html&gt; for more
details.)

Once the driver is loaded, running SimpleUserClientTool will open a connection
and communicate with the user client inside the KEXT.

You can run SimpleUserClientTool from the command line or directly from within
Xcode. If you'd like to run the tool from within Xcode, select the
'SimpleUserClientTool' item from the pop-up menu and click the 'Build and Go'
icon in the toolbar. The Xcode project also contains custom executables to
simplify testing each slice of the universal binary independently by invoking
arch(1) (such as forcing the ppc slice to run and thus exercise the Rosetta
path). Prior to Mac OS X 10.5, the arch tool only prints the current processor
architecture. If you want to force a particular slice to run on an OS version
older than Mac OS X 10.5, you can use lipo(1) to thin the executable to the
desired architecture:

    $ lipo -thin i386 -output /tmp/SimpleUserClientTool SimpleUserClientTool
    $ /tmp/SimpleUserClientTool


Other Notes
-----------
SimpleDriver specifies IOResources as its provider class in its Info.plist.
IOResources is commonly used as the provider class for I/O Kit drivers which do
not control any actual hardware. Recall that I/O Kit will match only one driver
per match category to a provider. While most drivers do not need to define a
IOMatchCategory property, those with a IOProviderClass of IOResources must
specify a unique value for IOMatchCategory. The symptom of a missing
IOMatchCategory property in this case is that your driver will not start after
it has been loaded.

The convention is to use the same value for IOMatchCategory as for the driver's
class name (IOClass property). The KEXT loading mechanism will issue the
following warning if this convention isn't followed: 

extension SimpleDriver_10_4.kext/ has potential problems:
Warnings
{
&quot;A personality matches on IOResources but IOMatchCategory is missing or not
equal to its IOClass (driver may fail to win matching)&quot; = true
}

SimpleDriver uses the same IOMatchCategory value for both its main KEXT and its
sub-KEXT. This is to ensure that only one of the two KEXTs will be loaded. That
means that the sub-KEXT doesn't follow the IOMatchCategory value convention and
you'll see the above warning. In this case, the warning can be safely ignored.

This sample also shows how to conditionally modify the driver's Info.plist
file. Xcode 2.x supports preprocessing of Info.plist files via the build
settings INFOPLIST_PREPROCESS = YES and INFOPLIST_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS =
$(GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS). This capability is used to include the
IOKitDebug property only in debug builds.
