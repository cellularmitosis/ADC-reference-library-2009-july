About JDragNDrop
----------------

This project demonstrates building a simple view to implement drag and drop functionality in Cocoa-Java.

CLASSES:
< MyView.java >
sublcassed from NSView.  MyView creates a simple view and overrides the necessary init methods. The most important parts of MyView are registering for specific drag types and the concludeDragOperation method.  All of the methods must be there for the drag and drop to work correctly, due to messaging of Cocoa.

POSSIBLE ENHANCEMENTS:
Modify constructor to allow different drag types and modify concludeDragOperation to operate on the different types.
