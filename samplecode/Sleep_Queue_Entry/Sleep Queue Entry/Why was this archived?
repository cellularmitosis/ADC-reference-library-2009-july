Why Was This Archived?This sample was archived because it's implementation is too closely tied with Think C.  In particular, the construct:/* Important: this asm statement must be the last executable code in this** routine, or you won't return the proper value in D0.*/    asm {            MOVE.L  returnValue, D0    }Is just too evil for words.Quinn "The Eskimo!"Worldwide Developer Technical Support9 Jun 1999
