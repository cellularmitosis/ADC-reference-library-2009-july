<p><font face="Times">The Java Client architecture differs from the HTML-based WebObjects
architecture in that it's distributed across client and server
systems as shown in  <a href="#BBCCGJEC">Figure 6-2</a>. The server-side portion interacts with a database
server and the client-side portion provides all or part of the application's
user interface.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">The client and server applications have duties other than
merely providing the user interface and database access-for example,
each can contain business logic and each communicates with the other
through a Web server. However, the database access/user interface
division is significant because it provides a richness of user interface
without compromising security or performance. Sensitive business
logic and database connection logic is provided only by the server
application. Because compiled Java on the client side can be decompiled,
the client application is limited to user interface code and nonsensitive business
logic. At the same time, the ability to put some of the business
logic on the client (any nonsensitive logic) improves performance.
By performing as much processing as possible on the client (such
as field validation), round trips to the server are limited.</font></p>
<a name = "TPXREF111"></a><h3><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande">Managing
the User Interface</font></h3>
<p><font face="Times">Unlike in HTML-based applications, the WebObjects component
of the server-side application doesn't have to provide any user
interface management. Instead, the Java Client architecture moves
part or all of the user interface management to a client application,
as shown in  <a href="#BAJCFHED">Figure 6-3</a>. To support this division, the Java Client architecture duplicates
the graph of enterprise objects on the client application so the
graph and its management occur on both server and client. WebObjects
handles all client-server communication and distributes the object
graph across client and server.</font></p>

 <img src = "../Art/JavaClient-custom.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/JavaClient-custom.gif]">

<p><font face="Times">The user interface itself is implemented using Java Foundation
Classes (JFC). This is what gives a Java Client application the
appearance and functionality of a traditional desktop application.
WebObjects maps data between the application's user interface
and the graph of enterprise objects. Changes to the object graph
are automatically synchronized with the user interface and user-entered
data is automatically reflected in the object graph.</font></p>
<a name = "TPXREF103"></a><h3><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande">Data
Synchronization Between Client and Server</font></h3>
<p><font face="Times"> <a href="#BAJBHHIC">Figure 6-4</a> shows the flow of data between the client and server
applications for the Java Client architecture.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Starting in the upper left of the diagram and working down,
when the client application initiates a fetch, the client application
forwards the corresponding fetch specification to the server application.
From there the normal mechanisms take over and an SQL query is performed
in the database server.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Working back up the diagram on the right side, the database
server returns the rows of requested data and, as usual, this data
is converted to enterprise objects. The server then sends <em>copies</em> of
the requested objects to the client. When the client receives the
objects, it updates its user interface with values from the requested
objects.</font></p>
<a name = "BAJBHHIC"></a><p><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande"><b>Figure
6-4 Data flow in a Java Client application</b></font></p>
 <img src = "../Art/JavaClient-expanded.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/JavaClient-expanded.gif]">

<p><font face="Times">Although requested objects are copied from the server to the
client, and these objects exist in parallel object graphs on both
server and client, the enterprise objects on the client usually
do not exactly mirror the enterprise objects on the server. The
objects on the client usually have a subset of the properties of
the objects on the server. You can partition your application's
enterprise objects so the objects that exist on the client have
a restricted set of data and behaviors. This ability allows you
to restrict sensitive data and business logic to the server. For
example, in  <a href="#BAJBHHIC">Figure 6-4</a>, the client side enterprise objects don't have
the "whole" property, the price the seller paid to the manufacturer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Once the client has fetched data, this data is cached and
is represented internally by the client's object graph. As users
modify the data (or delete or add "rows" of data), the client application
updates the client's object graph to reflect the new state. When
the client application initiates a save, the changed objects are
"pushed" to the server. If the business logic on the server
validates these changes, the changes are committed to the database. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Note that Java Client automatically updates the client with
changes that have occurred on the server. Whenever the client makes
a request, the server passes updates along to the client with whatever
information the client requested. Similarly, Java Client has the opportunity
to update the client before client-side objects remotely invoke
methods on server-side objects.</font></p>
