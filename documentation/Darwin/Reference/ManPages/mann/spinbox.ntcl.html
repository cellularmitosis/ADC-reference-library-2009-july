       Database Name:  <b>buttonCursor</b>
       Database Class: <b>Cursor</b>

              The  cursor  to be used when over the spin buttons.  If this is empty (the default), a default
              cursor will be used.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-buttondownrelief</b>
       Database Name:  <b>buttonDownRelief</b>
       Database Class: <b>Relief</b>

              The relief to be used for the upper spin button.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-buttonuprelief</b>
       Database Name:  <b>buttonUpRelief</b>
       Database Class: <b>Relief</b>

              The relief to be used for the lower spin button.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-command</b>
       Database Name:  <b>command</b>
       Database Class: <b>Command</b>

              Specifies a Tcl command to invoke whenever a spinbutton is invoked.   The  command  recognizes
              several percent substitutions: <b>%W</b> for the widget path, <b>%s</b> for the current value of the widget,
              and <b>%d</b> for the direction of the button pressed (<b>up</b> or <b>down</b>).

       Command-Line Name:<b>-disabledbackground</b>
       Database Name:  <b>disabledBackground</b>
       Database Class: <b>DisabledBackground</b>

              Specifies the background color to use when the spinbox is disabled.  If  this  option  is  the
              empty string, the normal background color is used.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-disabledforeground</b>
       Database Name:  <b>disabledForeground</b>
       Database Class: <b>DisabledForeground</b>

              Specifies  the  foreground  color  to use when the spinbox is disabled.  If this option is the
              empty string, the normal foreground color is used.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-format</b>
       Database Name:  <b>format</b>
       Database Class: <b>Format</b>

              Specifies an alternate format to use when setting the string value when using  the  <b>-from</b>  and
              <b>-to</b>  range.   This  must  be a format specifier of the form <b>%&lt;pad&gt;.&lt;pad&gt;f</b>, as it will format a
              floating-point number.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-from</b>
       Database Name:  <b>from</b>
       Database Class: <b>From</b>

              A floating-point value corresponding to the lowest value for a spinbox, to be used in conjunc-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;conjunction</font>
              tion  with  <b>-to</b>  and <b>-increment</b>.  When all are specified correctly, the spinbox will use these
              values to control its contents.  This value must be less than the <b>-to</b> option.  If  <b>-values</b>  is
              specified, it supercedes this option.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-invalidcommand</b> <b>or</b> <b>-invcmd</b>
       Database Name:  <b>invalidCommand</b>
       Database Class: <b>InvalidCommand</b>

              Specifies a script to eval when <b>validateCommand</b> returns 0.  Setting it to an empty string dis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ables&nbsp;disables</font>
              ables this feature (the default).  The best use of this option is to set it to <u>bell</u>.  See <b>Val</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">idation&nbsp;Validation</font>
              <b>idation</b> below for more information.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-increment</b>
       Database Name:  <b>increment</b>
       Database Class: <b>Increment</b>

              A  floating-point  value specifying the increment.  When used with <b>-from</b> and <b>-to</b>, the value in
              the widget will be adjusted by <b>-increment</b> when a spin button is pressed (up  adds  the  value,
              down subtracts the value).

       Command-Line Name:<b>-readonlybackground</b>
       Database Name:  <b>readonlyBackground</b>
       Database Class: <b>ReadonlyBackground</b>

              Specifies  the  background  color  to use when the spinbox is readonly.  If this option is the
              empty string, the normal background color is used.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-state</b>
       Database Name:  <b>state</b>
       Database Class: <b>State</b>

              Specifies one of three states for the spinbox:  <b>normal</b>, <b>disabled</b>, or <b>readonly</b>.  If the spinbox
              is  readonly,  then the value may not be changed using widget commands and no insertion cursor
              will be displayed, even if the input focus is in the widget; the contents of  the  widget  may
              still  be  selected.   If  the spinbox is disabled, the value may not be changed, no insertion
              cursor will be displayed, the contents will not be selectable, and the  spinbox  may  be  dis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">played&nbsp;displayed</font>
              played in a different color, depending on the values of the <b>-disabledforeground</b> and <b>-disabled</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">background&nbsp;-disabledbackground</font>
              <b>background</b> options.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-to</b>
       Database Name:  <b>to</b>
       Database Class: <b>To</b>

              A floating-point value corresponding to the highest value for the spinbox, to be used in  con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">junction&nbsp;conjunction</font>
              junction  with  <b>-from</b>  and <b>-increment</b>.  When all are specified correctly, the spinbox will use
              these values to control its contents.  This value must be greater than the <b>-from</b>  option.   If
              <b>-values</b> is specified, it supercedes this option.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-validate</b>
       Database Name:  <b>validate</b>
       Database Class: <b>Validate</b>

              Specifies the mode in which validation should operate: <b>none</b>, <b>focus</b>, <b>focusin</b>, <b>focusout</b>, <b>key</b>, or
              <b>all</b>.  It defaults to <b>none</b>.  When you want validation, you must explicitly state which mode you
              wish to use.  See <b>Validation</b> below for more.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-validatecommand</b> <b>or</b> <b>-vcmd</b>
       Database Name:  <b>validateCommand</b>
       Database Class: <b>ValidateCommand</b>

              Specifies  a script to evaluate when you want to validate the input in the widget.  Setting it
              to an empty string disables this feature (the default).  Validation occurs  according  to  the
              value  of <b>-validate</b>.  This command must return a valid Tcl boolean value.  If it returns 0 (or
              the valid Tcl boolean equivalent) then the value  of  the  widget  will  not  change  and  the
              <b>invalidCommand</b>  will  be evaluated if it is set.  If it returns 1, then value will be changed.
              See <b>Validation</b> below for more information.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-values</b>
       Database Name:  <b>values</b>
       Database Class: <b>Values</b>

              Must be a proper list value.  If specified, the spinbox will use these values  as  to  control
              its  contents,  starting  with the first value.  This option has precedence over the <b>-from</b> and
              <b>-to</b> range.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-width</b>
       Database Name:  <b>width</b>
       Database Class: <b>Width</b>

              Specifies an integer value indicating the desired width of the spinbox window, in average-size
              characters of the widget's font.  If the value is less than or equal to zero, the widget picks
              a size just large enough to hold its current text.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-wrap</b>
       Database Name:  <b>wrap</b>
       Database Class: <b>wrap</b>

              Must be a proper boolean value.  If on, the spinbox will wrap around the values of data in the
              widget.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The <b>spinbox</b> command creates a new window (given by the <u>pathName</u> argument) and makes it into a spinbox
       widget.  Additional options, described above, may be specified on the command line or in  the  option
       database  to configure aspects of the spinbox such as its colors, font, and relief.  The <b>spinbox</b> com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
       mand returns its <u>pathName</u> argument.  At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a win-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dow&nbsp;window</font>
       dow named <u>pathName</u>, but <u>pathName</u>'s parent must exist.

       A  <b>spinbox</b>  is  an extended <b>entry</b> widget that allows he user to move, or spin, through a fixed set of
       ascending or descending values such as times or dates in addition to  editing  the  value  as  in  an
       <b>entry</b>.  When first created, a spinbox's string is empty.  A portion of the spinbox may be selected as
       described below.  If a spinbox is exporting its selection (see the <b>exportSelection</b> option),  then  it
       will  observe the standard protocols for handling the selection;  spinbox selections are available as
       type <b>STRING</b>.  Spinboxes also observe the standard Tk rules for dealing with the input focus.  When  a
       spinbox  has the input focus it displays an <u>insertion</u> <u>cursor</u> to indicate where new characters will be
       inserted.

       Spinboxes are capable of displaying strings that are too long to fit  entirely  within  the  widget's
       window.   In  this case, only a portion of the string will be displayed; commands described below may
       be used to change the view in the window.  Spinboxes use the standard  <b>xScrollCommand</b>  mechanism  for
       interacting  with  scrollbars  (see  the description of the <b>xScrollCommand</b> option for details).  They
       also support scanning, as described below.


<b>VALIDATION</b>
       Validation works by setting the <b>validateCommand</b> option to a script which will be evaluated  according
       to the <b>validate</b> option as follows:


       <b>none</b>      Default.  This means no validation will occur.

       <b>focus</b>     <b>validateCommand</b> will be called when the spinbox receives or loses focus.

       <b>focusin</b>   <b>validateCommand</b> will be called when the spinbox receives focus.

       <b>focusout</b>  <b>validateCommand</b> will be called when the spinbox loses focus.

       <b>key</b>       <b>validateCommand</b> will be called when the spinbox is edited.

       <b>all</b>       <b>validateCommand</b> will be called for all above conditions.

       It is posible to perform percent substitutions on the <b>validateCommand</b> and <b>invalidCommand</b>, just as you
       would in a <b>bind</b> script.  The following substitutions are recognized:


       <b>%d</b>   Type of action: 1 for <b>insert</b>, 0 for <b>delete</b>, or -1 for focus, forced or textvariable  validation.

       <b>%i</b>   Index of char string to be inserted/deleted, if any, otherwise -1.

       <b>%P</b>   The  value  of  the  spinbox should edition occur.  If you are configuring the spinbox widget to
            have a new textvariable, this will be the value of that textvariable.

       <b>%s</b>   The current value of spinbox before edition.

       <b>%S</b>   The text string being inserted/deleted, if any.  Otherwise it is an empty string.

       <b>%v</b>   The type of validation currently set.

       <b>%V</b>   The type of validation that triggered the callback (key, focusin, focusout, forced).

       <b>%W</b>   The name of the spinbox widget.

       In general, the <b>textVariable</b> and <b>validateCommand</b> can be dangerous to mix.   Any  problems  have  been
       overcome  so  that  using the <b>validateCommand</b> will not interfere with the traditional behavior of the
       spinbox widget.  Using the <b>textVariable</b> for read-only purposes will never cause problems.  The danger
       comes when you try set the <b>textVariable</b> to something that the <b>validateCommand</b> would not accept, which
       causes <b>validate</b> to become <u>none</u> (the <b>invalidCommand</b> will not be triggered).  The same happens when  an
       error occurs evaluating the <b>validateCommand</b>.

       Primarily,  an error will occur when the <b>validateCommand</b> or <b>invalidCommand</b> encounters an error in its
       script while evaluating or <b>validateCommand</b> does not return a valid Tcl boolean value.   The  <b>validate</b>
       option will also set itself to <b>none</b> when you edit the spinbox widget from within either the <b>validate</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">Command&nbsp;validateCommand</font>
       <b>Command</b> or the <b>invalidCommand</b>.  Such editions will override the one that was being validated.  If you
       wish  to  edit  the value of the widget during validation and still have the <b>validate</b> option set, you
       should include the command
                   <u>%W</u> <u>config</u> <u>-validate</u> <u>%v</u>
       in the <b>validateCommand</b> or <b>invalidCommand</b> (whichever one you were editing the  spinbox  widget  from).
       It is also recommended to not set an associated <b>textVariable</b> during validation, as that can cause the
       spinbox widget to become out of sync with the <b>textVariable</b>.


<b>WIDGET</b> <b>COMMAND</b>
       The <b>spinbox</b> command creates a new Tcl command whose name is <u>pathName</u>.  This command may  be  used  to
       invoke various operations on the widget.  It has the following general form:
              <u>pathName</u> <u>option</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
       <u>Option</u> and the <u>arg</u>s determine the exact behavior of the command.

       Many  of the widget commands for spinboxes take one or more indices as arguments.  An index specifies
       a particular character in the spinbox's string, in any of the following ways:

       <u>number</u>      Specifies the character as a numerical index, where 0 corresponds to the first  character
                   in the string.

       <b>anchor</b>      Indicates  the  anchor  point  for  the  selection, which is set with the <b>select</b> <b>from</b> and
                   <b>select</b> <b>adjust</b> widget commands.

       <b>end</b>         Indicates the character just after the last one in the spinbox's string.  This is equiva-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lent&nbsp;equivalent</font>
                   lent to specifying a numerical index equal to the length of the spinbox's string.

       <b>insert</b>      Indicates the character adjacent to and immediately following the insertion cursor.

       <b>sel.first</b>   Indicates  the  first character in the selection.  It is an error to use this form if the
                   selection isn't in the spinbox window.

       <b>sel.last</b>    Indicates the character just after the last one in the selection.  It is an error to  use
                   this form if the selection isn't in the spinbox window.

       <b>@</b><u>number</u>     In  this form, <u>number</u> is treated as an x-coordinate in the spinbox's window;  the charac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ter&nbsp;character</font>
                   ter spanning that x-coordinate is used.  For  example,  ``<b>@0</b>''  indicates  the  left-most
                   character in the window.

       Abbreviations  may  be used for any of the forms above, e.g. ``<b>e</b>'' or ``<b>sel.f</b>''.  In general, out-of-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">range&nbsp;out-ofrange</font>
       range indices are automatically rounded to the nearest legal value.

       The following commands are possible for spinbox widgets:

       <u>pathName</u> <b>bbox</b> <u>index</u>
              Returns a list of four numbers describing the bounding box of the character  given  by  <u>index</u>.
              The  first  two  elements of the list give the x and y coordinates of the upper-left corner of
              the screen area covered by the character (in pixels relative to the widget) and the  last  two
              elements give the width and height of the character, in pixels.  The bounding box may refer to
              a region outside the visible area of the window.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>cget</b> <u>option</u>
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <u>option</u>.  <u>Option</u> may have any of
              the values accepted by the <b>spinbox</b> command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>configure</b> ?<u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no <u>option</u> is specified, returns a
              list describing all of the available options for <u>pathName</u> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b>  for  informa-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;information</font>
              tion  on  the  format  of  this list).  If <u>option</u> is specified with no <u>value</u>, then the command
              returns a list describing the one named option (this list will be identical to the correspond-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;corresponding</font>
              ing  sublist  of  the  value returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).  If one or more <u>option-value</u>
              pairs are specified, then the command modifies the given widget <!-- a -->option(s)<!-- /a --> to  have  the  given
              <!-- a -->value(s)<!-- /a -->;   in this case the command returns an empty string.  <u>Option</u> may have any of the val-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ues&nbsp;values</font>
              ues accepted by the <b>spinbox</b> command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>delete</b> <u>first</u> ?<u>last</u>?
              Delete one or more elements of the spinbox.  <u>First</u> is the index  of  the  first  character  to
              delete,  and  <u>last</u>  is  the index of the character just after the last one to delete.  If <u>last</u>
              isn't specified it defaults to <u>first</u>+1, i.e. a single  character  is  deleted.   This  command
              returns an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>get</b>
              Returns the spinbox's string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>icursor</b> <u>index</u>
              Arrange  for  the  insertion  cursor to be displayed just before the character given by <u>index</u>.
              Returns an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>identify</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u>
              Returns the name of the window element corresponding to coordinates <u>x</u> and <u>y</u>  in  the  spinbox.
              Return value is one of: <b>none</b>, <b>buttondown</b>, <b>buttonup</b>, <b>entry</b>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>index</b> <u>index</u>
              Returns the numerical index corresponding to <u>index</u>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>insert</b> <u>index</u> <u>string</u>
              Insert  the  characters  of  <u>string</u>  just before the character indicated by <u>index</u>.  Returns an
              empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>invoke</b> <u>element</u>
              Causes the specified element, either <b>buttondown</b> or <b>buttonup</b>, to  be  invoked,  triggering  the
              action associated with it.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>scan</b> <u>option</u> <u>args</u>
              This  command  is  used  to  implement  scanning on spinboxes.  It has two forms, depending on
              <u>option</u>:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>scan</b> <b>mark</b> <u>x</u>
                     Records <u>x</u> and the current view in the spinbox window;  used in conjunction  with  later
                     <b>scan</b>  <b>dragto</b>  commands.  Typically this command is associated with a mouse button press
                     in the widget.  It returns an empty string.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>scan</b> <b>dragto</b> <u>x</u>
                     This command computes the difference between its <u>x</u> argument and the <u>x</u> argument  to  the
                     last  <b>scan</b>  <b>mark</b>  command for the widget.  It then adjusts the view left or right by 10
                     times the difference in x-coordinates.  This command is typically associated with mouse
                     motion  events  in  the  widget,  to produce the effect of dragging the spinbox at high
                     speed through the window.  The return value is an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <u>option</u> <u>arg</u>
              This command is used to adjust the selection within a spinbox.  It has several forms,  depend-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;depending</font>
              ing on <u>option</u>:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>adjust</b> <u>index</u>
                     Locate  the  end  of  the selection nearest to the character given by <u>index</u>, and adjust
                     that end of the selection to be at <u>index</u> (i.e including but not  going  beyond  <u>index</u>).
                     The  other end of the selection is made the anchor point for future <b>select</b> <b>to</b> commands.
                     If the selection isn't currently in the spinbox, then a new  selection  is  created  to
                     include the characters between <u>index</u> and the most recent selection anchor point, inclu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sive.&nbsp;inclusive.</font>
                     sive.  Returns an empty string.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>clear</b>
                     Clear the selection if it is currently in this widget.  If the selection isn't in  this
                     widget then the command has no effect.  Returns an empty string.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>element</b> ?<u>element</u>?
                     Sets  or gets the currently selected element.  If a spinbutton element is specified, it
                     will be displayed depressed.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>from</b> <u>index</u>
                     Set the selection anchor point to just before the character given  by  <u>index</u>.   Doesn't
                     change the selection.  Returns an empty string.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>present</b>
                     Returns 1 if there is are characters selected in the spinbox, 0 if nothing is selected.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>range</b> <u>start</u> <u>end</u>
                     Sets the selection to include the characters starting with the one indexed by <u>start</u> and
                     ending  with  the one just before <u>end</u>.  If <u>end</u> refers to the same character as <u>start</u> or
                     an earlier one, then the spinbox's selection is cleared.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>to</b> <u>index</u>
                     If <u>index</u> is before the anchor point, set the selection to the characters from <u>index</u>  up
                     to  but  not  including the anchor point.  If <u>index</u> is the same as the anchor point, do
                     nothing.  If <u>index</u> is after the anchor point, set the selection to the characters  from
                     the  anchor point up to but not including <u>index</u>.  The anchor point is determined by the
                     most recent <b>select</b> <b>from</b> or <b>select</b> <b>adjust</b> command in  this  widget.   If  the  selection
                     isn't in this widget then a new selection is created using the most recent anchor point
                     specified for the widget.  Returns an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>set</b> ?<u>string</u>?
              If <u>string</u> is specified, the spinbox will try and set it  to  this  value,  otherwise  it  just
              returns the spinbox's string.  If validation is on, it will occur when setting the string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>validate</b>
              This  command  is used to force an evaluation of the <b>validateCommand</b> independent of the condi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tions&nbsp;conditions</font>
              tions specified by the <b>validate</b> option.  This is done  by  temporarily  setting  the  <b>validate</b>
              option to <b>all</b>.  It returns 0 or 1.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b> <u>args</u>
              This  command  is used to query and change the horizontal position of the text in the widget's
              window.  It can take any of the following forms:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b>
                     Returns a list containing two elements.  Each element is a real fraction between 0  and
                     1;   together  they  describe  the  horizontal span that is visible in the window.  For
                     example, if the first element is .2 and the second element is .6, 20% of the  spinbox's
                     text is off-screen to the left, the middle 40% is visible in the window, and 40% of the
                     text is off-screen to the right.  These are the same values passed  to  scrollbars  via
                     the <b>-xscrollcommand</b> option.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b> <u>index</u>
                     Adjusts the view in the window so that the character given by <u>index</u> is displayed at the
                     left edge of the window.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b> <b>moveto</b> <u>fraction</u>
                     Adjusts the view in the window so that the character <u>fraction</u> of the  way  through  the
                     text appears at the left edge of the window.  <u>Fraction</u> must be a fraction between 0 and
                     1.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b> <b>scroll</b> <u>number</u> <u>what</u>
                     This command shifts the view in the window left or right according to <u>number</u> and  <u>what</u>.
                     <u>Number</u>  must  be  an integer.  <u>What</u> must be either <b>units</b> or <b>pages</b> or an abbreviation of
                     one of these.  If <u>what</u> is <b>units</b>, the view adjusts left or right by <u>number</u> average-width
                     characters  on the display;  if it is <b>pages</b> then the view adjusts by <u>number</u> screenfuls.
                     If <u>number</u> is negative then characters farther to the left become  visible;   if  it  is
                     positive then characters farther to the right become visible.


<b>DEFAULT</b> <b>BINDINGS</b>
       Tk  automatically creates class bindings for spinboxes that give them the following default behavior.
       In the descriptions below, ``word'' refers to a contiguous group of letters, digits, or ``_'' charac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ters,&nbsp;characters,</font>
       ters, or any single character other than these.

       [1]    Clicking  mouse  button  1 positions the insertion cursor just before the character underneath
              the mouse cursor, sets the input focus to this widget, and clears any selection in the widget.
              Dragging  with  mouse  button  1  strokes out a selection between the insertion cursor and the
              character under the mouse.

       [2]    Double-clicking with mouse button 1 selects the word under the mouse and positions the  inser-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;insertion</font>
              tion  cursor  at  the  beginning of the word.  Dragging after a double click will stroke out a
              selection consisting of whole words.

       [3]    Triple-clicking with mouse button 1 selects all of the text in the spinbox and  positions  the
              insertion cursor before the first character.

       [4]    The  ends of the selection can be adjusted by dragging with mouse button 1 while the Shift key
              is down;  this will adjust the end of the selection that was nearest to the mouse cursor  when
              button 1 was pressed.  If the button is double-clicked before dragging then the selection will
              be adjusted in units of whole words.

       [5]    Clicking mouse button 1 with the Control key down will position the insertion  cursor  in  the
              spinbox without affecting the selection.

       [6]    If  any  normal  printing characters are typed in a spinbox, they are inserted at the point of
              the insertion cursor.

       [7]    The view in the spinbox can be adjusted by dragging with mouse button 2.  If mouse button 2 is
              clicked  without moving the mouse, the selection is copied into the spinbox at the position of
              the mouse cursor.

       [8]    If the mouse is dragged out of the spinbox on the left  or  right  sides  while  button  1  is
              pressed,  the  spinbox  will  automatically scroll to make more text visible (if there is more
              text off-screen on the side where the mouse left the window).

       [9]    The Left and Right keys move the insertion cursor one character to the left  or  right;   they
              also  clear  any  selection  in the spinbox and set the selection anchor.  If Left or Right is
              typed with the Shift key down, then the insertion cursor moves and the selection  is  extended
              to  include  the  new  character.  Control-Left and Control-Right move the insertion cursor by
              words, and Control-Shift-Left and Control-Shift-Right move the insertion cursor by  words  and
              also extend the selection.  Control-b and Control-f behave the same as Left and Right, respec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tively.&nbsp;respectively.</font>
              tively.  Meta-b and Meta-f behave the same as Control-Left and Control-Right, respectively.

       [10]   The Home key, or Control-a, will move the insertion cursor to the beginning of the spinbox and
              clear any selection in the spinbox.  Shift-Home moves the insertion cursor to the beginning of
              the spinbox and also extends the selection to that point.

       [11]   The End key, or Control-e, will move the insertion cursor to the end of the spinbox and  clear
              any selection in the spinbox.  Shift-End moves the cursor to the end and extends the selection
              to that point.

       [12]   The Select key and Control-Space set the selection anchor to the  position  of  the  insertion
              cursor.  They don't affect the current selection.  Shift-Select and Control-Shift-Space adjust
              the selection to the current position of the insertion cursor, selecting from  the  anchor  to
              the insertion cursor if there was not any selection previously.

       [13]   Control-/ selects all the text in the spinbox.

       [14]   Control-\ clears any selection in the spinbox.

       [15]   The  F16  key  (labelled  Copy on many Sun workstations) or Meta-w copies the selection in the
              widget to the clipboard, if there is a selection.

       [16]   The F20 key (labelled Cut on many Sun workstations) or Control-w copies the selection  in  the
              widget  to  the  clipboard  and deletes the selection.  If there is no selection in the widget
              then these keys have no effect.

       [17]   The F18 key (labelled Paste on many Sun workstations) or Control-y inserts the contents of the
              clipboard at the position of the insertion cursor.

       [18]   The  Delete  key deletes the selection, if there is one in the spinbox.  If there is no selec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion,&nbsp;selection,</font>
              tion, it deletes the character to the right of the insertion cursor.

       [19]   The BackSpace key and Control-h delete the selection, if there is  one  in  the  spinbox.   If
              there is no selection, it deletes the character to the left of the insertion cursor.

       [20]   Control-d deletes the character to the right of the insertion cursor.

       [21]   Meta-d deletes the word to the right of the insertion cursor.

       [22]   Control-k deletes all the characters to the right of the insertion cursor.

       [23]   Control-t reverses the order of the two characters to the right of the insertion cursor.

       If the spinbox is disabled using the <b>-state</b> option, then the spinbox's view can still be adjusted and
       text in the spinbox can still be selected, but no insertion cursor will be displayed and no text mod-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ifications&nbsp;modifications</font>
       ifications will take place.

       The  behavior  of  spinboxes  can  be  changed  by defining new bindings for individual widgets or by
       redefining the class bindings.
