In a single processorsystem the processor is running at full speed. In a multi-processorsystem all processors are running at full speed. </font></li><li>Run Single: One processor is running at maximum processingcapacity. In a single processor system, this is the same as RunMultiple. In a multi-processor system, only one processor is runningat full speed; all other processors are in sleep mode with their cachesflushed and their states saved.</font></li><li>Idle One: The system is idling. All clocks are running andthe system can return to running code within a few nanoseconds.In a single processor system, the main processor is stopped in Dozemode. Cache coherency is maintained in this level of idle. In amulti-processor system, all other processors will be sleeping asdescribed in Run Single. </font></li><li>Idle Two: The system is in power saving mode. This mode isentered only when a system has been in Idle One state for a substantialperiod of time (a half second or so) with no activity. In a singleprocessor system, the main processor cache is flushed, and the processoris put into sleep mode&#151;the external processor bus clock is stopped.The delay in coming out of this state is on the order of a millisecond.Cache coherency is maintained by the flush on entry. In a multi-processorsystem, the other processors will be sleeping as described in RunSingle. </font></li></ul><br><a name = "TPXREF112"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">System Modes</font></h4><p>The Macintosh system has two power saving modes.</p><ul><li>Partial Sleep: Thepower to the disk drive motors and the display is turned off, butthe power supply and fans are still on. The computer can still respondto network activity. </font></li><li>Full Sleep: The main power supply is shut down. A tricklesupply provides auxiliary power to the PCI slots and keeps the DRAMstate preserved for a quick recovery. All processors are poweredoff with their state preserved in DRAM. All clocks in the systemare suspended except for the 32.768Khz timebase crystal on the PMU99IC. This mode allows the computer to meet the 5W sleep requirementwhile providing the ability to start up without rebooting. </font></li></ul><br>    <br><a href="Dual_Proces_nd_Mac_OS_9.html" target="content"><img src="../images/previous.gif" border="0"></a><a href="Velocity_En_cceleration.html" target="content"><img src="../images/next.gif" border="0"></a>&nbsp;<br><br><p><hr><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">&#169; 2002 Apple Computer, Inc.
