Associationswere also involved when you created a table view by dragging anentity from EOModeler into Interface Builder-the associationswere formed for you as a by-product of dragging in the entity.</font></p><p><font face="Times">EODisplayGroups use associations (EOAssociations) to mediatebetween enterprise objects and the user interface. An associationties a single user interface object, such as a table column, toa key (a named property) in an enterprise object or objects managedby the EODisplayGroup. </font></p><p><font face="Times">Associations keep the user interface synchronized with enterpriseobject values. When an object changes, its display in the user interfaceupdates to reflect the change. Likewise, when the user edits theuser interface, the values in the object are updated accordingly.</font></p><p><font face="Times">Associations can have multiple aspects. For example, in thepreceding exercise you selected the <code>titles</code> aspectfor the EOValueSelectionAssociation to display all of the class keyswhose values you could choose to display in the pop-up list. EOValueSelectionAssociationalso has several other aspects: <code>selectedTitle</code>, <code>selectedIndex</code>, <code>selectedObject</code>,and <code>enabled</code>.</font></p><p><font face="Times">Enterprise Objects Framework includes associations for differenttypes of user interface objects, such as table columns, text fields,pop-up lists, and so on. Each association has multiple aspects.</font></p><p><font face="Times">For a complete discussion of this subject and a listing ofall possible associations, see the EOAssociation class and subclassspecifications in the <em>Enterprise Objects Framework Reference</em>.</font></p><br>    <br><a href="What_Are_EO_ngContexts_.html" target="_right"><img src="../Images/previous.gif" border="0" alt="Previous"></a><a href="When_Do_You_ject_Class_.html" target="_right"><img src="../Images/next.gif" border="0" alt="Next"></a>&nbsp;<p><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="1">&#169; 2001 Apple Computer, Inc.</font></p><!-- start of footer --><!--#include virtual="/includes/framesetfooter" --><!-- end of footer --></body></html>
