\cf0 "ViewController" is a Cocoa sample application that demonstrates how to use the 
\f1\fs20 NSViewController
\f0\fs24  class.  The 
\f1\fs20 NSViewController
\f0\fs24  class serves roughly the same purpose of 
\f1\fs20 NSWindowController
\f0\fs24 , in that it manages an associated 
\f1\fs20 NSView
\f0\fs24  from a nib file.  It does the same sort of memory management of top-level objects that 
\f1\fs20 NSWindowController
\f0\fs24  does.  The 
\f1\fs20 NSViewController 
\f0\fs24 is usually the File's Owner of the nib file.\

\b \cf0 About the Sample
\b0 \
"ViewController" shows how you can swap in and out NSViews from separate nib files onto your window.\
\
A popup button will present four different choices -\
1) \ul CustomImageView\ulnone  - loads the custom 
\f1\fs20 NSView
\f0\fs24  found in "CustomImageView.nib" which h olds the 
\f1\fs20 NSImageView
\f0\fs24 .\
The File's Owner of this nib is CustomImageViewController, a subclass of 
\f1\fs20 NSViewController
\f0\fs24 .\
\
2) \ul CustomTableView\ulnone  - loads the custom 
\f1\fs20 NSView
\f0\fs24  found in "CustomTableView.nib" which holds the 
\f1\fs20 NSTableView
\f0\fs24 .\
The File's Owner of this nib is CustomTableViewController, a subclass of 
\f1\fs20 NSViewController
\f0\fs24 .\
\
3) \ul CustomVideoView\ulnone  - load the custom 
\f1\fs20 NSView
\f0\fs24  found in "CustomVideoView.nib" which holds a 
\f1\fs20 QTMovieView
\f0\fs24 .\
The File's Owner of this nib is CustomVideoViewController, a subclass of 
\f1\fs20 NSViewController
\f0\fs24 .\
\
4) \ul CustomCameraView\ulnone  - load the custom 
\f1\fs20 NSView
\f0\fs24  found in "CustomCameraView.nib" which holds a QCView (Quartz Composer).\
This does not use a subclass of NSViewController as QC gives easy access to the iSight camera without using any code.\
The file "iSight.qtz" is used to hook up the iSight camera.\
\
Two NSTextField values in the window are bound to:\
1) The view controller's title which is obtained from 
\f1\fs20 [NSViewController title] 
\f0\fs24 method.\
2) The View controller's 
\f1\fs20 representedObject
\f0\fs24  - which in this case is the number of subviews found in the nib (i.e. the 
\f1\fs20 representedObject
\f0\fs24  is an 
\f1\fs20 NSNumber
\f0\fs24 ).\
So case number two illustrates how you can bind to the 
\f1\fs20 representedObject
\f0\fs24 .\
\

\b Using the Sample
\b0 \
Simply build and run the sample using Xcode.  Choose between the four popup choices to display each corresponding NSViews.\
