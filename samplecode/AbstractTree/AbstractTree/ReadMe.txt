AbstractTree
November 28, 2007


"AbstractTree" is a Cocoa sample application that demonstrates how to use Core Data and Bindings with NSTreeController. The data model is intentionally simple and abstract - you can extend it to any hierarchical model suitable for your problem domain. Likewise, the user interface is minimal - just an outline view and buttons for creating and removing nodes in the tree. In addition, the project shows how to implement drag and drop for managing parent-child relationships of the Core Data content.

A detailed description in html format is included in the Tutorial directory.

Sample Requirements
The supplied Xcode project was created using Xcode v3.0 running under Mac OS X 10.5.x or later. The project will create a Universal Binary.

Notes
1) This sample leverages Leopard APIs and improvements to NSTreeController. For this reason, the sample will only run on Mac OS X 10.5 and higher.
2) For simplicity, the sample uses the Xcode template generated for Core Data Applications with minimal modifications.
