With that powerand flexibility, however, comes a certain degree of complexity.For many applications, whether HTML-based or Java Client&#150;based,it's more important to develop the application quickly than strivefor maximum flexibility or polish. As an example, a simple data-browsingand editing application, intended only for internal use by a systemadministrator, probably wouldn't warrant the same degree of effortyou would put into an Internet-enabled application accessible bythe general public. To simplify the development of applicationslike the former, WebObjects includes a set of rapid-developmenttechnologies: Direct to Web and Direct to Java Client.</p><p>Direct to Web and Direct to Java Client are similar in approach.Their primary difference is in how the application interacts withthe end user. Direct to Web creates HTML-based WebObjects applications,whereas Direct to Java Client creates WebObjects applications thatemploy Java Client to partition the application between server andclient. Both are useful not only for creating simple database browserapplications, but in many situations can also serve as rapid prototypingtools. Because Direct to Web and Direct to Java Client both allowcustomization on various levels, they are well-suited for bootstrappingand creating your mission-critical applications.</p><br>    <br><a href="Java_Client_Applications.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/previous.gif" border="0"></a><a href="Direct_to_Web.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/next.gif" border="0"></a>&nbsp;<br><br><p><hr><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">&#169; 2002 Apple Computer, Inc.
