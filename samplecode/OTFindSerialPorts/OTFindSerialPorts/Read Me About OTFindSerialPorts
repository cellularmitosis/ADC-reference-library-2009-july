Read Me About OTFindSerialPorts1.0d1This sample demonstrates how to use the Open Transport API to find all the serial ports available to Open Transport programs.  The code from this sample is featured in the latest release (v1.2) of the book “Inside Macintosh: Open Transport”.Packing ListThe package contains the following items items: • OTFindSerialPorts-PPC.µ — A project to build the PPC version. • OTFindSerialPorts-PPC — A compiled version of the above.• OTFindSerialPorts-68K.µ — A project to build the 68K version.• OTFindSerialPorts-68K — A compiled version of the above.• OTFindSerialPorts.c — Source code common to both projects.Sample RequirementsI tested this code with OT 1.2 running under Mac OS 8 on both 68K and PPC.  The code should run just fine with OT 1.1.1 or newer.  I do not support this code on OT versions prior to 1.1.1.Because OT does not provide mixed mode glue for all the API routines in this sample (specificall OTGetUserPortNameFromPortRef), you should make sure to run the 68K version only on 68K machines.Running the SampleTo run the sample, simply double click the application and read the output on the console window.Building the SampleThe sample was built using the Metrowerks CodeWarrior 11 environment and the Open Transport 1.1.1 SDK interfaces and libraries.To rebuild the sample, first open the project and change the “LatestInterfaces” and “LatestLibraries” access paths to point to the interfaces and libraries from the OT 1.1.1 (or newer) SDK.  Then choose Make from the Project menu.Credits and Version HistoryIf you find any problems with this sample, mail <DevSupport@apple.com> with “Attn: Quinn” as the first line of your mail and I’ll try to fix them up.Version 1.0d1 is the first release.Share and EnjoyQuinn “The Eskimo!”Apple Developer Technical SupportNetworking, Communications, Hardware2 Sep 1997
