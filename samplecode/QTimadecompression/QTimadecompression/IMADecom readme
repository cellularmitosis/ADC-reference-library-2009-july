/*IMADecompression information:This sample is designed to show you how to create the required QuickTime atom and sendit to the IMA decompression codecs so that you can decompress IMA compressed WAVE filesusing the Sound Manager's SoundConvert routines and the QuickTime IMA codecs.This sample also shows a tecnique of playing a sound that doesn't rely on doing anywork, other than setting a flag, at interrupt time.  Use this tecnique if you want tobe a friendly application, but not if you can't stand to have sound dropouts.The interesting bits are in PlaySound, DoIdle, and SoundCallBackFcn.While this code has a basic knowledge of the structure of a WAVE file, I would not usethis code as a sample showing the most correct and complete way to parse a WAVE file.*/
