  <h2>Object Storage Abstraction</h2>
  The control layer provides an infrastructure that's independent of
  the application's storage mechanism (typically a database) by defining an
  API for an "intelligent" repository of objects,
  whether it's based on external data or whether it manages objects
  entirely in memory. EOObjectStore is an abstract class that defines that
  basic API, setting up the framework for constructing and registering
  enterprise objects, servicing object faults, and committing changes
  made in an EOEditingContext. Subclasses of EOObjectStore implement the
  API in terms of their specific storage mechanism.<P>
  <h2>EOObjectStore Methods</h2>
  <p>EOObjectStoreCoordinator overrides the following EOObjectStore methods:
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>objectsWithFetchSpecification
  <li>objectsForSourceGlobalID
  <li>faultForGlobalID
  <li>arrayFaultWithSourceGlobalID
  <li>refaultObject
  <li>saveChangesInEditingContext
  <li>invalidateAllObjects
  <li>invalidateObjectsWithGlobalIDs:
  </ul>
  <p>With the exception of <b>saveChangesInEditingContext</b>,
  EOObjectStoreCoordinator's implementation of these methods simply forwards
  the message to an EOCooperatingObjectStore or stores. The message
  <b>invalidateAllObjects</b> is forwarded to all of a coordinator's
  cooperating stores. The rest of the messages are forwarded to the appropriate
  store based on which store responds true to the messages ownsGlobalID,
  ownsObject, and handlesFetchSpecification (which message is used depends on
  the context). The EOObjectStore methods listed above aren't documented in
  this class specification (except for <b>saveChangesInEditingContext</b>) for
  descriptions of them, the EOObjectStore and EODatabaseContext (EOAccess)
  class specifications can be referred to.</p>
  <p>For the method saveChangesInEditingContext, the coordinator guides its
  cooperating stores through a multi pass save protocol in which each
  cooperating store saves its own changes and forwards remaining changes to the
  other of the coordinator's stores. For example, if in its
  recordChangesInEditingContext method one cooperating store notices the removal
  of an object from an&quot;owning&quot; relationship but that object belongs
  to another cooperating store, it informs the other store by sending the
  coordinator a forwardUpdateForObject message.</p>
  <p>Although it manages objects from multiple repositories,
  EOObjectStoreCoordinator doesn't absolutely guarantee consistent updates when
  saving changes across object stores. If the application requires guaranteed
  distributed transactions, you can either provide his own solution by
  creating a subclass of EOObjectStoreCoordinator that integrates with a TP
  monitor, use a database server with built in distributed transaction support,
  or design the application to write to only one object store per save
  operation (though it may read from multiple object stores).</P>
