Not only can it be a challengeto create a website or Web application to present your data usingconventional tools, it can also be a challenge just to access thedata itself. Some products rely on hand- or assistant-generatedSQL (Structured Query Language), leading to database-specific codethat is difficult to optimize. WebObjects avoids these problems byusing Enterprise Objects, a model-based mechanism for cleanly instantiatingbusiness objects directly from database tables. WebObjects handlesall the interactions with the database including fetching, caching,and saving. This allows you to write your business logic againstactual objects independent of the underlying data source. You canmodify schemas, add or change databases, or even use totally a differentstorage mechanism without needing to rewrite your application.</font></p><p><font face="Times">WebObjects applications can access any database with a JDBC2.0 driver. JDBC is an interface between Java platforms and databases.</font></p><a name = "TPXREF109"></a><h3><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande">Separationof Presentation, Logic, and Data</font></h3><p><font face="Times">An ideal Web application development system simplifies maintenanceand encourages code reuse by enforcing a clean separation of presentation(HTML), logic (Java), and data (SQL). This modularity is inherentin the WebObjects programming model, which uses reusable componentsto generate Web pages directly from enterprise objects without the needto embed scripts or Java code inside your HTML. A component containsa template, which you-or a professional Web designer-can designand edit using standard Web authoring tools. A component can alsoimplement custom behavior using a separate Java source file. Neitherthe template or the Java source file includes model-specific information.</font></p><a name = "TPXREF115"></a><h3><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande">StateManagement</font></h3><p><font face="Times">The HTTP protocol used on the Web is inherently stateless;that is, each HTTP request arrives independently of earlier requests,and it's up to Web applications to recognize which ones come froman individual user or session. Therefore, most Web applicationsof consequence-as well as some of the more interesting dynamicpublishing sites-need to keep state information, such as logininformation or a shopping basket, associated with each user session.</font></p><p><font face="Times">Without using cookies, WebObjects provides objects that allowyou to maintain information for the life of a particular clientsession, or longer. This makes it particularly easy to implementan application like a Web-based online store: you don't have todo anything special to maintain the contents of the user's shoppingcart or other data over the life of the session. In addition, youronline store could even monitor individual customer buying patternsand then highlight items they're more likely to be interestedin the next time they visit your site.</font></p><a name = "TPXREF116"></a><h3><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande">ModularDevelopment</font></h3><p><font face="Times">The power of WebObjects comes from a tightly integrated setof tools and frameworks, facilitating the rapid assembly of complexapplications. At the heart of this system is the Project BuilderIntegrated Development Environment (IDE), which manages your Java businesslogic and tracks all the supporting models and components. As mentionedabove, WebObjects also includes powerful assistants and frameworksthat allow the rapid creation of HTML or Java Client applicationsdirectly from the database. Advanced developers can tap into theobject-oriented Java APIs underlying all the different frameworks,allowing virtually unlimited customization and expandability.</font></p><a name = "TPXREF107"></a><h3><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande">PureJava</font></h3><p><font face="Times">WebObjects applications are 100% Pure Java, which means theycan be deployed on any platform with a certified Java 2 virtualmachine. </font></p><a name = "TPXREF113"></a><h3><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande">Scalabilityand Performance</font></h3><p><font face="Times">Static websites and traditional client-server applicationshave one strong suit: they both leverage the power of the clientplatform, minimizing the load on the server. It doesn't take allthat much processing power to serve up a set of static Web pages.Dynamic Web applications, although a tremendous advance over staticpages, require additional server power to access the dynamic dataand construct the Web pages or Java Client user interface "onthe fly." </font></p><p><font face="Times">The WebObjects application server is both efficient and scalable.With WebObjects, if more power, reliability, or failover protectionis needed, you can run multiple instances of your application, eitheron one or on multiple application servers (see  <a href="#BABCEEJF">Figure 2-4</a>). You can choose fromone of several load-balancing algorithms (or create your own) thatdetermine which instance each new user should connect to. And, eitherlocally or from a remote location, you can analyze site loads andusage patterns and then start or stop additional application instancesas necessary. Load balancing is a very powerful feature of WebObjectsthat allows you to add more server capacity as the need arises without needingto implement a load-balancing algorithm yourself.</font></p><a name = "BABCEEJF"></a><p><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande"><b>Figure2-4 Multiple instances, multiple applications</b></font></p> <img src = "../Art/Multiple.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/Multiple.gif]"><br><a href="Rapid_Development.html" target="_right"><img src="../Images/previous.gif" border="0" alt="Previous"></a><a href="../EnterpriseObjects/index.html" target="_top"><img src="../Images/next.gif" border="0" alt="Next"></a>&nbsp;<p><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="1">&#169; 2001 Apple Computer, Inc.</font></p><!-- start of footer --><!--#include virtual="/includes/framesetfooter" --><!-- end of footer --></body></HTML>
