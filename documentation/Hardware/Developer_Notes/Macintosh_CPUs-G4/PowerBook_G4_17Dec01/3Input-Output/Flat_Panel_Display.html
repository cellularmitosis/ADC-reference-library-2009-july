It is a wide-screen display (1152 by 768 pixels) and is15.2 inches across, measured diagonally. </p><p>The display is backlit by a cold cathode fluorescent lamp(CCFL). The display uses TFT (thin-film transistor) technology forhigh contrast and fast response. </p><p>In addition to its native resolution (1152 by 768) the displayalso supports several non-native resolutions, as shown in Table3-12. The graphics controller IC includes a scaling function thatexpands displays with those smaller resolutions to fill the screen. </p><p>The display's native resolution, 1152 by 768, has an aspectratio of 3:2. When selecting a picture resolution with an aspectration of 4:3, the user can choose to have it displayed with squarepixels and black margins on the sides, or with stretched pixelsthat fill the display from side to side. These options are shownin Table 3-12. </p><br><table border = "1"><a name = "TPXREF166"></a><p><b><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">Table3-12 Flat panel display resolutions</font></b></p><br><b><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="1"><tr><td scope="row">Pictureresolution</td><td>Displayarea used</td><td>Blackmargins</td><td>Shape ofpixels</td></tr></b></font><tr><td scope="row">640 by 480</td><td>1024 by 768</td><td>yes</td><td>square</td></tr><tr><td scope="row">640 by 480</td><td>1152 by 768</td><td>no</td><td>stretched</td></tr><tr><td scope="row">720 by 480</td><td>1152 by 768</td><td>no</td><td>square</td></tr><tr><td scope="row">800 by 600</td><td>1024 by 768</td><td>yes</td><td>square</td></tr><tr><td scope="row">800 by 600</td><td>1152 by 768</td><td>no</td><td>stretched</td></tr><tr><td scope="row">896 by 600</td><td>1152 by 768</td><td>no</td><td>square</td></tr><tr><td scope="row">1024 by 768</td><td>1024 by 768</td><td>yes</td><td>square</td></tr><tr><td scope="row">1024 by 768</td><td>1152 by 768</td><td>no</td><td>stretched</td></tr><tr><td scope="row">1152 by 768</td><td>1152 by 768</td><td>no</td><td>square</td></tr></table><br><p>When the internal display and an external monitor are bothoperating and mirror mode is selected, the scaling function is notavailable. Both displays show full-sized images only when the displayresolution for the external monitor is set to the internal dispay'snative resolution: 1152 by 768. Both displays can operate with otherresolution settings, but in mirror mode, one of them will have adisplay that is smaller than the full screen and has a black borderaround it. With the resolution for the external monitor set to 640by 480 or 800 by 600, the image on the internal display is smallerthan its screen. For resolution settings larger than 1152 by 768,the image on the external monitor is smaller than its screen. </p><p>When the flat panel display and an external video monitorare operating at the same time, the system allocates 8 MB of videomemory for each, enough to support the full 24-bit pixel depth atresolutions up to 1600 by 1200 pixels.</p><br>    <br><a href="Keyboard_.html" target="content"><img src="../images/previous.gif" border="0"></a><a href="External_Monitors_.html" target="content"><img src="../images/next.gif" border="0"></a>&nbsp;<br><br><p><hr><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">&#169; 2001 Apple Computer, Inc.
