Here is a simple High Level Event sample.It posts two events, then uses a filter to accept the second one.Using AppleEvents is a much better solution than using High Level Events, since the AppleEvent Manager provides a great dal offormatting and accessing support, but HLEs are available if you want'em.C.K.
