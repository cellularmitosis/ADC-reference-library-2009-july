Full pathnames are	particularly unreliable as a means of identifying files, directories	or volumes within your application, for two primary reasons:		• 	The user can change the name of any element in the path at virtually		any time.	•	Volume names on the Macintosh are *not* unique. Multiple		mounted volumes can have the same name. For this reason, the use of		a full pathname to identify a specific volume may not produce the		results you expect. If more than one volume has the same name and		a full pathname is used, the File Manager currently uses the first		mounted volume it finds with a matching name in the volume queue.		In general, you should use a file’s name, parent directory ID, and	volume reference number to identify a file you want to open, delete,	or otherwise manipulate.		If you need to remember the location of a particular file across	subsequent system boots, use the Alias Manager to create an alias record	describing the file. If the Alias Manager is not available, you can save	the file’s name, its parent directory ID, and the name of the volume on	which it’s located. Although none of these methods is foolproof, they are	much more reliable than using full pathnames to identify files.		Nonetheless, it is sometimes useful to display a file’s full pathname to	the user. For example, a backup utility might display a list of full	pathnames of files as it copies them onto the backup medium. Or, a	utility might want to display a dialog box showing the full pathname of	a file when it needs the user’s confirmation to delete the file. No	matter how unreliable full pathnames may be from a file-specification	viewpoint, users understand them more readily than volume reference	numbers or directory IDs. (Hint: Use the TruncString function from	TextUtils.h with truncMiddle as the truncWhere argument to shorten	full pathnames to a displayable length.)		The following technique for constructing the full pathname of a file is	intended for display purposes only. Applications that depend on any	particular structure of a full pathname are likely to fail on alternate	foreign file systems or under future system software versions.*//*****************************************************************************/pascal	OSErr	GetFullPath(short vRefNum,							long dirID,							ConstStr255Param name,							short *fullPathLength,							Handle *fullPath){	OSErr		result;	FSSpec		spec;		*fullPathLength = 0;	*fullPath = NULL;		result = FSMakeFSSpecCompat(vRefNum, dirID, name, &spec);	if ( (result == noErr) || (result == fnfErr) )	{		result = FSpGetFullPath(&spec, fullPathLength, fullPath);	}		return ( result );}/*****************************************************************************/pascal	OSErr	FSpGetFullPath(const FSSpec *spec,							   short *fullPathLength,							   Handle *fullPath){	OSErr		result;	OSErr		realResult;	FSSpec		tempSpec;	CInfoPBRec	pb;		*fullPathLength = 0;	*fullPath = NULL;			/* Default to noErr */	realResult = result = noErr;		/* work around Nav Services "bug" (it returns invalid FSSpecs with empty names) */	if ( spec->name[0] == 0 )	{		result = FSMakeFSSpecCompat(spec->vRefNum, spec->parID, spec->name, &tempSpec);	}	else	{		/* Make a copy of the input FSSpec that can be modified */		BlockMoveData(spec, &tempSpec, sizeof(FSSpec));	}		if ( result == noErr )	{		if ( tempSpec.parID == fsRtParID )		{			/* The object is a volume */						/* Add a colon to make it a full pathname */			++tempSpec.name[0];			tempSpec.name[tempSpec.name[0]] = ':';						/* We're done */			result = PtrToHand(&tempSpec.name[1], fullPath, tempSpec.name[0]);		}		else		{			/* The object isn't a volume */						/* Is the object a file or a directory?
