<P>When you create a variable in a component window, you are creating a <i>component             
 variable</i> that's visible only inside that component. No other components can access         
 it. A component variable lives only as long as the component that created it. If the       
 component's page is deallocated, so is the component variable. If the page is              
 redrawn after the component has been deallocated, the component variable is reinitialized.                                                                                 
 <P>To create a variable with a longer lifetime, create an application or session variable.    
 An <i>application variable's</i> lifetime is the lifetime of the application. One instance of     
 an application variable is created per application. That is, if three users are running    
 sessions of the same application, they will share an instance of that application          
 variable.                                                                                  
 <P><i>Session variables</i> live as long as a session. An instance of a session variable is          
 created for each session. If three users are running sessions of the same application, three instances of a session variable are created. If one user changes the           
 value of that session variable, only that user sees the change.                            
 You can read more about application variables, session variables, and component            
 variables in "<A HREF="../../DevGuide/WebScript/WebScript.mif.book.html">Using WebScript</A>" in the <i>WebObjects Developer's Guide</I>.
