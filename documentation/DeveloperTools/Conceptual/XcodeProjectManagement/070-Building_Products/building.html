<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002693-SW10" title="Build Locations"></a><h2>Build Locations</h2><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002693-DontLinkElementID_44"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002693-DontLinkElementID_45"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002693-DontLinkElementID_46"></a><p>When Xcode builds a target, it generates intermediate files, such as object files, as well as the product described by the target. As you build software with Xcode, you need to know where Xcode places the output of a build. For example, suppose you have an application in one project that depends on a library created by a second project. When building the application, Xcode must be able to locate the library to link it into the application.</p><p>There are two build-location settings that you can specify to customize the location of build products and intermediate build files. These are build products directory and intermediate build files directory, respectively.</p><p>By default, Xcode places both the build products and the intermediate files that it generates in the <code>build</code> directory inside of your project directory. If the software you are developing is contained in a single project, this location is probably fine. However, if you have many interdependent targets—particularly if these targets are divided across multiple projects—you’ll need a shared build directory to ensure that Xcode can automatically find and use the product created by each of those targets.</p><div class="notebox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002693-SW21" title="Note"></a><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;Within the build directory, Xcode maintains separate subdirectories for each build configuration defined by the project.</p></div><p>Xcode also supports the concept of an installation location, using the Deployment Location (<code>DEPLOYMENT_LOCATION</code>) and Installation Directory (<code>INSTALL_PATH</code>) build settings. If you’re building a product for release, turn on the Deployment Location build setting and supply a path for the Installation Directory build setting. This places the built product at the specified location.</p><p>For information about the build settings that specify build locations and how the build products directory and intermediate build files directory settings affect them, see <em><a href="../../../Reference/XcodeBuildSettingRef/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003931" target="_top">Xcode Build Setting Reference</a></em>.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002693-SW2" title="Setting Default Build Locations"></a><h3>Setting Default Build Locations</h3><p>When you first start up Xcode, it asks you to specify the directories in which it places the files generated by the build system, both intermediate files and built products. These build locations are used for all new projects.</p><p>Each project can specify a value for its build products directory and intermediate build files directory. However, new projects defer to the default values for these settings, specified in Building preferences (see <span class="content_text"><a href="../010-Overview_of_an_Xcode_Project/xcode_project_overview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002663-SW3">“General Project Attributes”</a></span>). Therefore, setting custom build locations in Building preferences, sets the build locations for new projects. For example, to set shared build locations for all the projects you create, set those locations in Building preferences. And, for projects that don’t need to share those locations, you can customize their build location, as described in <span class="content_text"><a href="building.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002693-SW15">“Setting Project-Specific Build Locations.”</a></span></p><p>See <span class="content_text"><!--a target="_top" -->“Building Preferences”<!--/a--></span> in <em><a href="../../XcodeWorkspace/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006920" target="_top">Xcode Workspace Guide</a></em> for details.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002693-SW15" title="Setting Project-Specific Build Locations"></a><h3>Setting Project-Specific Build Locations</h3><p>Each time you create a project, Xcode sets the build locations for that project to the default build locations specified in the Building pane of Xcode preferences. You can, however, override these default build locations on a per-project basis. By taking advantage of this feature, you can choose default build locations that works best for most of your projects, and specify other default build locations for  individual projects as needed.</p><p>To override the default location for a project’s build products, use the build locations settings in the Project Info window.</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p><strong>Place Build Products In.</strong> Sets the project’s build products directory.</p></li><li class="li"><p><strong>Place Intermediate Build Files In.</strong> Sets the project’s intermediate build files directory.</p></li></ul><p>To learn how to change the default build location used for projects that you create, see <span class="content_text"><a href="building.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002693-SW2">“Setting Default Build Locations.”</a></span></p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002693-BCIIAAIE" title="Editing Build Settings"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/writerid/xcode_user_guide_build_settings_editing" title="Editing Build Settings"></a><h2>Editing Build Settings</h2><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002693-DontLinkElementID_47"></a><p>Build settings are variables that tell the Xcode build system how to build your product. Build settings provide a powerful and flexible mechanism for customizing the build process.</p><p>In the Xcode application, you can define build settings at two levels:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p><strong>Project level:</strong> The build settings defined at the project level specify build aspects that apply to all the targets contained in the project.</p></li><li class="li"><p><strong>Target level:</strong> A target inherits the build settings specified by the containing project. The target, however, may also override build settings defined by the project. In other words, the build settings at the target level are the ultimate determinant of how a product is built. (When you use the <code><a href="../../../../Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/xcodebuild.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/xcodebuild" target="_top">xcodebuild</a></code> command-line tool, you may override target build settings by defining them in the tool invocation.)</p></li></ul><p>To learn more about build settings, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../../XcodeBuildSystem/300-Build_Settings/bs_build_settings.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002691" target="_top">Build Settings</a></span>.</p><p>The Xcode application lets you access and edit build settings at the target and project layers. It provides a convenient graphical user interface for changing build setting specifications, the Build pane of Info windows for targets and projects. This section shows how to view and edit build settings using the build settings editor.</p><div class="notebox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002693-SW40" title="Note"></a><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;Build settings defined at the command line (using <code><a href="../../../../Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/xcodebuild.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/xcodebuild" target="_top">xcodebuild</a></code>) and per-file compiler flags are not reflected in the Build pane.</p></div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002693-SW39" title="Viewing Build Settings"></a><h3>Viewing Build Settings</h3><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002693-DontLinkElementID_48"></a><p>You can view and edit build settings at the target and project levels in the Build pane of the Info window for targets and projects. <span class="content_text">Figure 7-1</span> shows the Build pane for a target.</p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002693-BACGEICB" title="Figure 7-1Build settings for a target"></a><p><strong>Figure 7-1&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Build settings for a target</p><img src = "../art/build_settings_editor_target.jpg" alt = "Build settings editor for a target" ></div><br/><p>These are the components of the Build pane:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p><strong>Configuration menu.</strong> The Configuration pop-up menu indicates which of the target’s build configurations is currently displayed.

If you have already configured a group of settings for a target, you can reuse them by selecting those build settings and dragging them into a text file, or by copying and pasting them between Info windows.</p><p>For a list of the available build settings, see <em><a href="../../../Reference/XcodeBuildSettingRef/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003931" target="_top">Xcode Build Setting Reference</a></em>.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002693-CJBBDFGD" title="Editing Build Setting Specifications"></a><h3>Editing Build Setting Specifications</h3><p>The interface for modifying a build setting’s specification in the build settings editor varies according to the possible values for that build setting. Depending on the value, Xcode may display, for example, a text field, a table, a checkbox, or a pop-up menu. This list describes the interface to edit the possible build setting value data types:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p><strong>String.</strong> If a build setting takes a string as its value, double-click the Value cell to edit it.</p><p>If you are entering a file path, you can simply drag the file or folder from the Finder into the text field.</p></li><li class="li"><p><strong>List.</strong> If a build setting can have a list of items as its value, the Value column displays the value as a space-separated list. You can add or remove items from a lis of values by double-clicking anywhere in the row and using the plus and minus buttons in the dialog that appears.</p><p>If you are entering file paths, you can simply drag the file or folder from the Finder into the list, instead of typing the paths in yourself.</p></li><li class="li"><p><strong>Boolean.</strong> If a build setting can have two states—on or off—the Value cell contains a checkbox. A checkmark indicates that the build setting is turned on.</p></li><li class="li"><p><strong>Choice.</strong> If a build setting has a finite number of possible values, the build setting’s Value cell contains a pop-up menu with the possible values.</p><p>For some build settings, in addition to the standard values shown in the value pop-up menu, you may specify a custom value by choosing Other from the value list.</p><div class="item_figure"><img src = "../art/build_settings_editor_value_other.jpg" alt = "Value list in the Build pane of the project or target Info window" ></div></li></ul><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002693-SW42" title="Adding and Deleting Build Settings"></a><h3>Adding and Deleting Build Settings</h3><p>If you do not see the build setting you want to modify, or if you want to define custom build settings, you can add build settings to the build settings table in the Build pane of the Info window for a target or project.</p><p>To add a build setting definition to a target or project, choose Add User-Defined Setting from the Action menu in the bottom-left corner of the window.</p><p>To remove a build setting from a target or project, select the build setting definition to remove and choose Delete Definition at This Level from the Action menu.</p><p>If the build setting definition that you deleted is defined at a lower layer, Xcode continues to display that build setting in the build settings table.

It includes the Other C Flags (<code>OTHER_CFLAGS</code>), Other C++ Flags (<code>OTHER_CPLUSPLUSFLAGS</code>), Other Warning Flags (<code>WARNING_CFLAGS</code>), and Preprocessor Macros (<code>GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS</code>) build settings, among many others, to customize the invocation of the compiler when processing C-based source files. However, sometimes it’s necessary to specify compiler flags for particular files. For example, in a project that treats warnings as errors in general, you may have a set of cross-platform source files whose warnings you want the compiler to ignore.</p><p>To view the compiler flags for a file:</p><ol class="ol"><li class="li"><p>Select the source file in the Groups &amp; Files list.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Choose File > Get Info to open the File Info window.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Display the Build pane (<span class="content_text">Figure 7-5</span>).</p></li></ol><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002693-CHDIAFJF" title="Figure 7-5File compiler flags"></a><p><strong>Figure 7-5&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>File compiler flags</p><img src = "../art/file_info_editor_build.jpg" alt = "File compiler flags" ></div><br/><div class="notebox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002693-SW47" title="Note"></a><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;The Build pane of the File Info window is available only for files containing source code.</p></div><p>In the Additional Compiler Flags for Target field, you can enter any compiler flags you want to assign to the file. Use spaces to separate flags.</p><p>You can use multiple selection to assign compiler flags to a subset of the files in a target.</p><p>For each target that a file belongs to, Xcode maintains a separate list of compiler flags assigned to the file. To specify compiler flags for use with a file when it is built as part of a particular target, select the file from the appropriate build phase in that target and open the File Info window, as described earlier. If you open an Info window for the same file from any other group in the project window, Xcode assumes you want to assign compiler flags to the file in the active target; thus, the Build pane is available only if the file is part of the active target.</p><p>When the build system constructs the command-line invocation for the tool that processes the source file, it adds the additional compiler flags assigned to the file to the invocation. The build system doesn’t validate the flags you add; that is, it doesn’t test whether the compiler actually supports the options you add, and it doesn’t investigate whether the options you add conflict with the ones it generates. If you add a group of compiler options for a file that produce build errors or warnings, you should remove all the options you added and add them back one at a time, making sure the file compiles after you add each option, to determine which option is not supported. You should also consult the tool’s documentation to learn about possible conflicts.</p><p>The additional compiler options specified for a file are always used when the file is processed as part of a build, and these compiler options cannot be overridden in any of the build setting layers.

In a build, the target being built is known as the current target. The first time you build a target, the build system creates all the intermediate files, such as object files, needed to build the product. In subsequent builds of the same target, the build system processes only the files that have changed since the target’s previous build. For example, if the only change to the target since the last time it was built was a minor edit to a single source code file, the build system recompiles that file and relinks the object files to create the finished product. That is, changes to the contents of the file and changes to build settings that affect the way a source file is built cause the build system to rebuild the file.</p><p>To build the active target, choose Build > Build.</p><div class="notebox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002693-SW32" title="Note"></a><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;If you want to force Xcode to rebuild a build file the next time you build the target, you can touch the file, to mark it as changed.

You should add header files to your target—as part of the Copy Header Files build phase—only if they are embedded in your product, as with a framework.</p><p>By default, Xcode searches user paths before system paths. This means that, by default, your project headers have precedence over system headers. Thus, if your project defines a header file named <code>String.h</code>, source code in your project that includes <code>String.h</code> incorporates your project’s version of the header, not the system version. You can override this behavior by turning off the Always Search User Paths (<code>ALWAYS_SEARCH_USER_PATHS</code>) build setting.</p><p>When Always Search User Paths is inactive, project headers can be incorporated into translation units only by surrounding the header filename with quotation marks (a translation unit is a single source file with its imported/included files). For example, <code>#include "String.h"</code> incorporates the <code>String.h</code> header file defined in the project into generated translation unit. Furthermore, system headers can be incorporated into translation units only by surrounding the header filename with angle brackets.
