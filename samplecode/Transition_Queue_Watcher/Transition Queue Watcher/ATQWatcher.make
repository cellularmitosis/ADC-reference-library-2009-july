The fundamental TextEdit #	toolbox calls and TextEdit autoscroll are demonstrated. It #	also shows how to create and maintain scrollbar controls.##	It does not by any means demonstrate all the techniques you #	need for a large application. In particular, Sample does not #	cover exception handling, multiple windows/documents, #	sophisticated memory management, printing, or undo. All of #	these are vital parts of a normal full-sized application.##	This application is an example of the form of a Macintosh #	application; it is NOT a template. It is NOT intended to be #	used as a foundation for the next world-class, best-selling, #	600K application. A stick figure drawing of the human body may #	be a good example of the form for a painting, but that does not #	mean it should be used as the basis for the next Mona Lisa.##	We recommend that you review this program or Sample before #	beginning a new application. Sample is a simple app. which doesnÕt #	use TextEdit or the Control Manager.## 	You can define {SymOptions} as "-sym on" or "-sym off" for use with SADEPOptions = {SymOptions}PObjs	=	ATQWatcher.p.o ¶			ATQWatcherGlue.a.o ¶			ATQCGlue.c.o ¶			TransQueue.p.o ¶			"{Libraries}"Runtime.o ¶			"{Libraries}"Interface.o ¶			"{PLibraries}"PasLib.oATQWatcher		ÄÄ {PObjs} makefile			Link -o {Targ} {PObjs} {SymOptions}			SetFile {Targ} -t APPL -c 'MOOT' -a BATQWatcher		ÄÄ ATQWatcher.r ATQWatcher.h makefile			Rez -rd -append -o {Targ} ATQWatcher.rATQWatcher.p.o	ÄÄ ATQWatcher.p makefileATQWatcherGlue.a.o ÄÄ ATQWatcherGlue.a makefileTransQueue.p.o ÄÄ TransQueue.p makefileATQCGlue.c.o ÄÄ ATQCGlue.c makefile
