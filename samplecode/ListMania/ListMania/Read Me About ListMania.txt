Read Me About ListMania for CodeWarrior (ProjectBuilder is below)2.0This sample demonstrates a variety of techniques for using Open Transport’s (in Carbon) list utility routines.  Specifically, it shows how to use OTLIFO lists in a simple producer/consumer application.  The code from this sample is featured in the latest release (v1.2) of the book “Inside Macintosh: Open Transport”.  Packing ListThe package contains the following items items: • ListMania.mcp — A project to build the PPC version. • ListMania(PPC) — A compiled version of the above which is carbonized and will run on OS9 and OSX.• ListMania.c — Source code to the project.Sample RequirementsI tested this code with Carbon 1.2.5 running under Mac OS 9 and on Mac OSX.  The code should run just fine with Carbon 1.2.5 (or newer) and Universal Interfaces 3.3.2 (or newer).  Running the SampleTo run the sample, simply double click the application and follow the onscreen instructions.Building the SampleThe sample was built using the Metrowerks CodeWarrior IDE 4.1 environment Carbon SDK 1.2.5 and Universal Interfaces 3.3.2.  Both the Carbon SDK and Universal intefaces can be downloaded from Apple website at : http://developer.apple.com/sdk/index.htmlTo rebuild the sample, first open the project and change the “Access Paths” to point to the interfaces and libraries from the Carbon 1.2.5 SDK (or newer) and the Universal Interfaces 3.3.2 (or newer).  Then choose Make from the Project menu.Credits and Version History If you find any problems with this sample, mail <DevSupport@apple.com> with “Attn: Quinn” as the first line of your mail and I’ll try to fix them up.Version 2.0 Carbonized the Sample.  Share and EnjoyQuinn “The Eskimo!”Apple Developer Technical SupportNetworking, Communications, Hardware2 Sep 1997==========Read Me About ListMania For ProjectBuilder2.0This sample demonstrates a variety of techniques for using Open Transport’s (in CoreServices under OSX) list utility routines.
