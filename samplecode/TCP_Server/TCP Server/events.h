/*	TCP Client/Server Queuing Example	Steve Falkenburg, MacDTS, Apple Computer	3/11/92		this client/server sample uses MacTCP to implement a simple "greeting" server.  the server	opens up several listeners on kGreetingPort (1235).  when a client connects, the data entered	in the greeting dialog is sent to the remote connection, and the connection is closed.		connection management is done through the use of Operating System queues to simplify tracking	and usage.*/void HandleEvent(EventRecord *ev);void HandleIdleTime(EventRecord *ev);
