OpenGL ImageA sample showing an example of render to texture/texture from surface using aglSurfaceTexture.  This sample is not meant to show full window event handling.Version 1.1: bug fix release- Uses lite stanford bunny.- fixes use of default texture (should not have been using) to use a named texture object.- fixes cleanup to explicitly delete texture object and flush to ensure we are in a good state prior to quit.- Removed CW project, though developers can stil use source with CW, but I am not maintaining compatibility.Version 1.0: Initial releaseThis sample demonstrates using aglSurfaceTexture to texture from a surface which in turn is an aglContext thus also demonstrates render to texture.The basic concept to build an AGLcontext which, is the source for texturing.  This surface must comply with all the constraints for the current texturing mode, such as dimensions being a power of two for TEXTURE_2D.  This surface (identified by the AGLContext) is then used as the source for the aglSurfaceTexture API.  This API is very similar to Texture2D as it provides a current texture for GL to using in texturing operations.  All other texturing requirements remain the same (enable, texture coords, etc).The application code for this demo is designed to be very simplistic and should not be considered production quality.Requirements: Mac OS X v10.2
