A table can havezero or more rows.</p><br><a name = "TPXREF102"></a><h3><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Tables</font></h3><p>The table is the equivalent of a class definition. It definesthe attributes or properties that each <b>row</b> init has. Each property is called a <b>column</b>.</p><p>Much like in Java, in most databases there are certain primitivetypes&#151;like string, int, or double in Java&#151;and each column ona table is defined to be of a given one of these types. EnterpriseObjects handles the conversion from database internal types to Javatypes. Further, for each column, you can declare whether a givenrow is required to provide a value or whether it is allowed to be <code>null</code>.</p><p>You can think of a table as a class, columns as instance variables,and rows as individual object instances. Like a class definitionfile in Java, a table itself does not have variables. You must adda row to it to use any of its properties. </p><br><a name = "TPXREF103"></a><h3><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Rows</font></h3><p>A row is the equivalent of an instance of a Java class. Wherethe table is like a class, a row is like an instance of a class. </p><br><a name = "BCIGJDGB"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Uniquing</font></h4><p>Each row in a given table has to be different in some wayfrom the others. This is so the database system knows which rowto update or delete when you make changes to your data.</p><p>The database uses a <b>primary key</b> that definesa property (or set of properties) whose value uniquely identifieseach row. For each table you define, you provide a key (or listof keys), which define how the database system can be sure two givenrows are different. For example, if you are defining a table tocontain data about people, you might decide to use a person'slast name to differentiate each row from the others.</p><p>The database system ensures that each row has a unique valuein the column (or combination of values in the set of columns) youspecify as the primary key. Enterprise Objects hides many of thecomplexities of database interaction, including the conversion fromdatabase internal types to Java types. However, if you try to overrideit and set a value in a row that conflicts with a value in anotherrow, the database refuses to make the change and reports an errorthat your application should handle.</p><p>It's important to choose the primary keys for your tablescarefully. If you define your unique key as the column containinga person's last name, you could run into difficulty as soon asyou try to add two people with the same last name to your table.In general, it's best to make your primary key one you don'tplan on using for anything else and let Enterprise Objects handleit for you. </p><p>In the example Authors database (see  <a sector="mod" href="../EOMBasics/iThe_Authors_Application.html" target="_top">"Creating the Authors Database"</a>),each table has a column that servers as its primary key called <em>ENTITYNAME</em>_IDof type integer.</p><br><a name = "TPXREF104"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Not Null</font></h4><p>You may wish to declare that without certain data, a row isn'tvalid. By declaring a given column not-null, you tell the databasesystem to reject any new rows that don't provide the requireddata.</p><p>If you're gathering information for an email mailing list,for example, a row without a value for the EMAIL_ADDRESS columnisn't useful. </p><p>A table's primary key column must always be declared not-null. </p><br>    <br><a href="Database_Basics.html" target="_right"><img src="../Images/previous.gif" border="0" alt="Previous"></a><a href="Relationship.html" target="_right"><img src="../Images/next.gif" border="0" alt="Next"></a>&nbsp;<hr alt=""><p><font face="Palatino" size="1">&#169; 2001 Apple Computer, Inc.</font></p><!-- start of footer --><!--#include virtual="/includes/framesetfooter" --><!-- end of footer --></body></html>
