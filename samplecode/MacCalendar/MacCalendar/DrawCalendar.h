/*	File:		DrawCalendar.h	Contains:	Module for displaying the calendar (Gregorian).	Written by:	Martin Minow	Copyright:	© 1994-1997 by Apple Computer, Inc., all rights reserved.	Change History (most recent first):	You may incorporate this sample code into your applications without	restriction, though the sample code has been provided "AS IS" and the	responsibility for its operation is 100% yours.  However, what you are	not permitted to do is to redistribute the source as "DSC Sample Code"	after having made changes. If you're going to re-distribute the source,	we require that you make it clear in the source that the code was	descended from Apple Sample Code, but that you've made changes.	DrawCalendar displays the calendar (Gregorian) for the selected date. The	algorithm has been simplified and consequently will only work for dates within	the Macintosh epoch.	Note that DrawCalendar is common to the Control Strip and Setup application.	If you change it, you must rebuild both modules.*/#ifndef __DRAWCALENDAR__#define __DRAWCALENDAR__#include "MacCalendarCommon.h"#include <Types.h>/* * These functions are defined in DrawCalendar.c.
