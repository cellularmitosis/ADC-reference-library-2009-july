<b>NAME</b>
       idlj - The IDL-to-Java Compiler (RMI-IIOP version)

       <b>idlj</b> generates Java bindings from a given IDL file.

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>idlj</b> [ <u>options</u> ] <u>idl-file</u>

       where  <u>idl-file</u>  is  the  name  of a file containing Interface Definition Language (IDL) definitions.
       <u>Options</u> may appear in any order, but must precede the <u>idl-file</u>.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The IDL-to-Java Compiler generates the Java bindings for a given IDL file.  For binding details,  see
       the  OMG  IDL  to Java Language Mapping Specification. Some previous releases of the IDL-to-Java com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">piler&nbsp;compiler</font>
       piler were named <b>idltojava</b>.

<b>Emitting</b> <b>Client</b> <b>and</b> <b>Server</b> <b>Bindings</b>
       To generate Java bindings for an IDL file named <b>My.idl</b>:

              <b>idlj</b> <b>My.idl</b>

       This generates the client-side bindings and is equivalent to:

              <b>idlj</b> <b>-fclient</b> <b>My.idl</b>

       The client-side bindings do not include the server-side skeleton. If you want to generate the server-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">side&nbsp;serverside</font>
       side bindings for the interfaces:

              <b>idlj</b> <b>-fserver</b> <b>My.idl</b>

       Server-side  bindings  include the client-side bindings plus the skeleton, all of which are POA (that
       is, Inheritance Model) classes.  If you want to generate both client and  server-side  bindings,  use
       one of the following (equivalent) commands:

              <b>idlj</b> <b>-fclient</b> <b>-fserver</b> <b>My.idl</b>
              <b>idlj</b> <b>-fall</b> <b>My.idl</b>

       There are two possible server-side models: the Inneritance Model and the Tie Model.

       The  default  server-side  model  is  the  <b>Portable</b> <b>Servant</b> <b>Inheritance</b> <b>Model</b>.  Given an interface My
       defined in <b>My.idl</b>, the file <b>MyPOA.java</b> is generated. You must provide the implementation for  <b>My</b>  and
       it must inherit from <b>MyPOA</b>.

       <b>MyPOA.java</b>  is a stream-based skeleton that extends <b>org.omg.PortableServer.Servant</b> and implements the
       <b>InvokeHandler</b> interface and the operations interface associated with the IDL interface  the  skeleton
       implements.

       The  <b>PortableServer</b>  module for the <b>Portable</b> <b>Object</b> <b>Adapter</b> <b>(POA)</b> defines the native Servant type. In
       the Java programming language, the <b>Servant</b> type is mapped to the Java  <b>org.omg.PortableServer.Servant</b>
       class. It serves as the base class for all POA servant implementations and provides a number of meth-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ods&nbsp;methods</font>
       ods that may be invoked by the application programmer, as well as methods which are  invoked  by  the
       POA itself and may be overridden by the user to control aspects of servant behavior.

       Another option for the Inheritance Model is to use the <b>-oldImplBase</b> flag in order to generate server-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">side&nbsp;serverside</font>
       side bindings that are compatible with older version of the Java programming language (prior to  J2SE
       1.4). To generate server-side bindings that are backwards compatible:

              <b>idlj</b> <b>-fclient</b> <b>-fserver</b> <b>-oldImplBase</b> <b>My.idl</b>
              <b>idlj</b> <b>-fall</b> <b>-oldImplBase</b> <b>My.idl</b>

       Given  an  interface  <b>My</b> defined in <b>My.idl</b>, the file <b>_MyImpleBase.java</b> is generated. You must provide
       the implementation for <b>My</b> and it must inherit from <b>_MyImplBase</b>.

       The other server-side model is called the Tie Model. This is a delegation model. Because  it  is  not
       possible  to  generate  ties  and skeletons at the same time, they must be generated separately.  The
       following commands generate the bindings for the Tie Model:

              <b>idlj</b> <b>-fall</b> <b>My.idl</b>
              <b>idlj</b> <b>-fallTIE</b> <b>My.idl</b>

       For the interface <b>My</b>, the second command generates <b>MyPOATie.java</b>.  The constructor to <b>MyPOATie</b>  takes
       a  delegate.   You must provide the implementation for delegate, but it does not have to inherit from
       any other class, only the interface <b>MyOperations</b>.  But to use it with the ORB,  you  must  wrap  your
       implementation within <b>MyPOATie</b>.  For instance:

              <b>MyImpl</b> <b>myImpl</b> <b>=</b> <b>new</b> <b>MyImpl</b> <b>();</b>
              <b>My</b> <b>POATie</b> <b>tie</b> <b>=</b> <b>new</b> <b>MyPOATie</b> <b>(myImpl);</b>
              <b>orb.connect</b> <b>(tie);</b>

       You  might  want to use the Tie model instead of the typical Inheritance model if your implementation
       must inherit from some other implementation. Java allows any number  of  interface  inheritance,  but
       there is only one slot for class inheritance. If you the inheritance model, that slot is used up . By
       using the Tie Model, that slot is freed up for your own use. The drawback is  that  it  introduces  a
       level of indirection: one extra method call occurs when invoking a method.

       To generate server-side, Tie model bindings that are compatible with older version of the IDL to Java
       language mapping in versions of J2SE before 1.4.

              <b>idlj</b> <b>-oldImplBase</b> <b>-fall</b> <b>My.idl</b>
              <b>idlj</b> <b>-oldImplBase</b> <b>-fallTIE</b> <b>My.idl</b>

       For the interface <b>My</b>, this will generate <b>My_Tie.java</b>.  The constructor to <b>My_Tie</b> takes a  <b>impl</b>.   You
       must  provide the implementation for <b>impl</b>, but it does not have to inherit from any other class, only
       the interface <b>HelloOperations</b>.  But to use it with the ORB, you must wrap your implementation  within
       <b>My_Tie</b>.  For instance:

              <b>MyImpl</b> <b>myImpl</b> <b>=</b> <b>new</b> <b>MyImpl</b> <b>();</b>
              <b>My_Tie</b> <b>tie</b> <b>=</b> <b>new</b> <b>My_Tie</b> <b>(myImpl);</b>
              <b>orb.connect</b> <b>(tie);</b>


<b>Specifying</b> <b>Alternate</b> <b>Locations</b> <b>for</b> <b>Emitted</b> <b>Files</b>
       If  you  want to direct the emitted files to a directory other than the current directory, invoke the
       compiler as:

              <b>idlj</b> <b>-td</b> <b>/altdir</b> <b>My.idl</b>

       For the interface <b>My</b>, the bindings will be emitted to <b>/altdir/My.java</b>, etc., instead of <b>./My.java.</b>

<b>Specifying</b> <b>Alternate</b> <b>Locations</b> <b>for</b> <b>Include</b> <b>Files</b>
       If <b>My.idl</b> included another idl file, <b>MyOther.idl</b>, the compiler assumes that  <b>MyOther.idl</b>  resides  in
       the local directory. If it resides in <b>/includes</b>, for example, then you would invoke the compiler with
       the following command:

              <b>idlj</b> <b>-i</b> <b>/includes</b> <b>My.idl</b>

       If <b>My.idl</b> also included <b>Another.idl</b> that resided in <b>/moreIncludes</b>, for example, then you would invoke
       the compiler with the following command:

              <b>idlj</b> <b>-i</b> <b>/includes</b> <b>-i</b> <b>/moreIncludes</b> <b>My.idl</b>

       Since  this form of include can become irritatingly long, another means of indicating to the compiler
       where to search for included files is provided. This technique is similar to the idea of an  environ-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment&nbsp;environment</font>
       ment variable. Create a file named <b>idl.config</b> in a directory that is listed in your CLASSPATH. Inside
       of <b>idl.config</b>, provide a line with the following form:

              <b>includes=/includes;/moreIncludes</b>

       The compiler will find this file and read in the includes list. Note that in this example the separa-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tor&nbsp;separator</font>
       tor  character  between  the two directories is a semicolon (;). This separator character is platform
       dependent. On NT it is a semicolon, on Solaris it is a colon, etc.  For more information on includes,
       read the CLASSPATH documentation.

<b>Emitting</b> <b>Bindings</b> <b>for</b> <b>Include</b> <b>Files</b>
       By default, only those interfaces, structs, etc, that are defined in the idl file on the command line
       have Java bindings generated for them. The types defined in included files are  not  generated.   For
       example, assume the following two idl files:

       <b>My.idl</b>

              #include &lt;MyOther.idl&gt;
              interface My
              {
              };

       <b>MyOther.idl</b>

              interface MyOther
              {
              };

       The following command will only generate the java bindings for <b>My</b>:

              <b>idlj</b> <b>My.idl</b>

       To  generate  all  of  the types in <b>My.idl</b> and all of the types in the files that <b>My.idl</b> includes (in
       this example, <b>MyOther.idl</b>), use the following command:

              <b>idlj</b> <b>-emitAll</b> <b>My.idl</b>

       There is a caveat to the default rule.  <b>#include</b> statements which appear at global scope are  treated
       as  described. These <b>#include</b> statements can be thought of as import statements.  <b>#include</b> statements
       which appear within some enclosing scope are treated as true <b>#include</b> statements,  meaning  that  the
       code  within the included file is treated as if it appeared in the original file and, therefore, Java
       bindings are emitted for it. Here is an example:

       <b>My.idl</b>

              #include &lt;MyOther.idl&gt;
              interface My
              {
                #include &lt;Embedded.idl&gt;
              };

       <b>MyOther.idl</b>

              interface MyOther
              {
              };

       <b>Embedded.idl</b>

              enum E {one, two, three};

       Running the following command:

              <b>idlj</b> <b>My.idl</b>

       will generate the following list of Java files:


       Notice that <b>MyOther.java</b> was not generated because it is defined in  an  import-like  <b>#include</b>.   But
       <b>E.java</b>  was generated because it was defined in a true <b>#include</b>.  Also notice that since <b>Embedded.idl</b>
       was included within the scope of the interface <b>My</b>, it appears within the  scope  of  <b>My</b>  (that  is,in
       <b>MyPackage</b>).

       If  the  <b>-emitAll</b>  flag  had  been used in the previous example, then all types in all included files
       would be emitted.

<b>Inserting</b> <b>Package</b> <b>Prefixes</b>
       Suppose that you work for a company named ABC that has constructed the following IDL file:

       <b>Widgets.</b> <b>idl</b>
              module Widgets
              {
                interface W1 {...};
                interface W2 {...};
              };

       Running this file through the IDL-to-Java compiler will place the Java bindings for W1 and W2  within
       the package Widgets. But there is an industry convention that states that a company's packages should
       reside within a package named <b>com.&lt;company</b>name&gt;<b>.</b>  The <b>Widgets</b> package is not good enough.  To  follow
       convention, it should be <b>com.abc.Widgets</b>.  To place this package prefix onto the <b>Widgets</b> module, exe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cute&nbsp;execute</font>
       cute the following:

              <b>idlj</b> <b>-pkgPrefix</b> <b>Widgets</b> <b>com.abc</b> <b>Widgets.idl</b>

       If you have an IDL file which includes <b>Widgets.idl</b>, the <b>-pkgPrefix</b> flag must appear in  that  command
       also.  If  it  does  not,  then  your  IDL  file  will be looking for a <b>Widgets</b> package rather than a
       <b>com.abc.Widgets</b> package.

       If you have a number of these packages that require prefixes, it might be easier to place  them  into
       the <b>idl.config</b> file described above. Each package prefix line should be of the form:

              <b>PkgPrefix.&lt;type&gt;=&lt;prefix&gt;</b>

       So the line for the above example would be:

              <b>PkgPrefix.Widgets=com.abc</b>

       The use of this options does not affect the Repository ID.

<b>Defining</b> <b>Symbols</b> <b>Before</b> <b>Compilation</b>
       You  may  need to define a symbol for compilation that is not defined within the IDL file, perhaps to
       include debugging code in the bindings. The command

              <b>idlj</b> <b>-d</b> <b>MYDEF</b> <b>My.idl</b>

       is the equivalent of putting the line <b>#define</b> <b>MYDEF</b> inside <b>My.idl</b>.

<b>Preserving</b> <b>Pre-Existing</b> <b>Bindings</b>
       If the Java binding files already exist, the <b>-keep</b> flag will keep the compiler from overwriting them.
       The  default is to generate all files without considering if they already exist. If you've customized
       those files (which you should not do unless you are very comfortable with their contents),  then  the
       <b>-keep</b> option is very useful. The command

              <b>idlj</b> <b>-keep</b> <b>My.idl</b>

       emit all client-side bindings that do not already exist.

<b>Viewing</b> <b>Progress</b> <b>of</b> <b>Compilation</b>
       The  IDL-to-Java compiler will generate status messages as it progresses through its phases of execu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion.&nbsp;execution.</font>
       tion. Use the <b>-v</b> option to activate this "verbose" mode:

              <b>idlj</b> <b>-v</b> <b>My.idl</b>

       By default the compiler does not operate in verbose mode.

<b>Displaying</b> <b>Version</b> <b>Information</b>
       To display the build version of the IDL-to-Java compiler, specify the <b>-version</b> option on the command-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">line:&nbsp;commandline:</font>
       line:

              <b>idlj</b> <b>-version</b>

       Version  information  also  appears  within  the  bindings  generated by the compiler. Any additional
       options appearing on the command-line are ignored.

<b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-d</b> <u>symbol</u>
              This is equivalent to the following line in an IDL file:

              <b>#define</b> <b>symbol</b>

       <b>-emitAll</b>
              Emit all types, including those found in <b>#include</b> files.

       <b>-fside</b> Defines what bindings to emit.  <b>side</b> is one of <b>client,</b> <b>server,</b> <b>serverTIE,</b> <b>all,</b>  or  <b>allTIE.</b>The
              <b>-fserverTIE</b>and <b>-fallTIE</b> options cause delegate model skeletons to be emitted. Assumes <b>-fclient</b>
              if the flag is not specified.

       <b>-i</b> <u>include-path</u>
              By default, the current directory is scanned for included  files.  This  option  adds  another
              directory.

       <b>-keep</b>  If  a file to be generated already exists, do not overwrite it.  By default it is overwritten.

       <b>-noWarn</b>
              Supresses warning messages.

       <b>-oldImplBase</b>
              Generates skeletons compatible with old (pre-1.4) JDK ORBs. By default,  the  POA  Inheritance
              Model  server-side  bindings  are  generated. This option provides backward-compatibility with
              older versions of the Java programming language by generating server-side  bindings  that  are
              <b>ImplBase</b> Inheritance Model classes.

       <b>-pkgPrefix</b> <u>type</u> <u>prefix</u>
              Wherever <b>type</b> is encountered at file scope, prefix the generated Java package name with <b>prefix</b>
              for all files generated for that type. The <b>type</b> is the simple name of either a top-level  mod-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ule,&nbsp;module,</font>
              ule, or an IDL type defined outside of any module.

       <b>-pkgTranslate</b> <u>type</u> <u>package</u>
              Wherever  the  type or module name <b>type</b> is encountered, replace it in the with <b>package</b> for all
              files in the generated Java package. Note that <b>pkgPrefix</b> changes are made first.  <b>type</b> is  the
              simple  name  of  either a top-level module, or an IDL type defined outside of any module, and
              must match the full package name exactly. Also note that the following package names cannot be
              translated:


               org

               org.omg or any subpackages of org.omg

              Any attempt to translate these packages will result in uncompilable code, and the use of these
              packages as the first argument after <b>-pkgTranslate</b> will be treated as an error.

       <b>-skeletonName</b> <u>xxx%yyy</u>
              Use <b>xxx%yyy</b> as the pattern for naming the skeleton. The defaults are


               %POA for the POA base class (
                <b>-fserver</b> or <b>-fall</b>)

               %ImplBase for the oldImplBase class (
                <b>-oldImplBase</b> and ( <b>-fserver</b> or <b>-fall</b>))

       <b>-td</b> <u>dir</u>
              Use <b>dir</b> for the output directory instead of the current directory.

       <b>-tieName</b> <u>xxx%yyy</u>
              Name the tie according to the pattern. The defaults are:


               %POATie for the POA tie base class (

<b>Restrictions</b>
        Escaped identifiers in the global scope may not have the
         same spelling as IDL primitive types, <b>Object</b>, or <b>ValueBase</b>.  This is because the  symbol  table  is
         pre-loaded  with  these  identifiers;  allowing them to be redefined would overwrite their original
         definitions. (Possible permanent restriction).

        The fixed IDL type is not supported.
