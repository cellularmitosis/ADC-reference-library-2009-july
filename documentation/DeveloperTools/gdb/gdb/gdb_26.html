<H1><A NAME="SEC259" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC259">GDB Annotations</A></H1>

<P>
This chapter describes annotations in GDB.  Annotations were
designed to interface GDB to graphical user interfaces or other
similar programs which want to interact with GDB at a
relatively high level.

</P>
<P>
The annotation mechanism has largely been superseeded by GDB/MI
(see section <A HREF="gdb_25.html#SEC236">The GDB/MI Interface</A>).

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC260" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC260">What is an Annotation?</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1506"></A>

</P>
<P>
Annotations start with a newline character, two <SAMP>`control-z'</SAMP>
characters, and the name of the annotation.  If there is no additional
information associated with this annotation, the name of the annotation
is followed immediately by a newline.  If there is additional
information, the name of the annotation is followed by a space, the
additional information, and a newline.  The additional information
cannot contain newline characters.

</P>
<P>
Any output not beginning with a newline and two <SAMP>`control-z'</SAMP>
characters denotes literal output from GDB.  Currently there is
no need for GDB to output a newline followed by two
<SAMP>`control-z'</SAMP> characters, but if there was such a need, the
annotations could be extended with an <SAMP>`escape'</SAMP> annotation which
means those three characters as output.

</P>
<P>
The annotation <VAR>level</VAR>, which is specified using the
@option{--annotate} command line option (see section <A HREF="gdb_3.html#SEC9">Choosing modes</A>), controls
how much information GDB prints together with its prompt,
values of expressions, source lines, and other types of output.  Level 0
is for no anntations, level 1 is for use when GDB is run as a
subprocess of GNU Emacs, level 3 is the maximum annotation suitable
for programs that control GDB, and level 2 annotations have
been made obsolete (see section `Limitations of the Annotation Interface' in <CITE>GDB's Obsolete Annotations</CITE>).

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>set annotate <VAR>level</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1507"></A>
 
The GDB command <CODE>set annotate</CODE> sets the level of
annotations to the specified <VAR>level</VAR>.

<DT><CODE>show annotate</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1508"></A>
Show the current annotation level.
</DL>

<P>
This chapter describes level 3 annotations.

</P>
<P>
A simple example of starting up GDB with annotations is:

</P>

<PRE>
$ <KBD>gdb --annotate=3</KBD>

^Z^Zpre-prompt
(gdb)
^Z^Zprompt
<KBD>quit</KBD>

^Z^Zpost-prompt
$
</PRE>

<P>
Here <SAMP>`quit'</SAMP> is input to GDB; the rest is output from
GDB.  The three lines beginning <SAMP>`^Z^Z'</SAMP> (where <SAMP>`^Z'</SAMP>
denotes a <SAMP>`control-z'</SAMP> character) are annotations; the rest is
output from GDB.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC261" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC261">Annotation for GDB Input</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1509"></A>
When GDB prompts for input, it annotates this fact so it is possible
to know when to send output, when the output from a given command is
over, etc.

</P>
<P>
Different kinds of input each have a different <STRONG>input type</STRONG>.  Each
input type has three annotations: a <CODE>pre-</CODE> annotation, which
denotes the beginning of any prompt which is being output, a plain
annotation, which denotes the end of the prompt, and then a <CODE>post-</CODE>
annotation which denotes the end of any echo which may (or may not) be
associated with the input.  For example, the <CODE>prompt</CODE> input type
features the following annotations:

</P>

<PRE>
^Z^Zpre-prompt
^Z^Zprompt
^Z^Zpost-prompt
</PRE>

<P>
The input types are

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>prompt</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1510"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX1511"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX1512"></A>
 
When GDB is prompting for a command (the main GDB prompt).

<A NAME="IDX1513"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1514"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1515"></A>
<DT><CODE>commands</CODE>
<DD>
When GDB prompts for a set of commands, like in the <CODE>commands</CODE>
command.  The annotations are repeated for each command which is input.

<A NAME="IDX1516"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1517"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1518"></A>
<DT><CODE>overload-choice</CODE>
<DD>
When GDB wants the user to select between various overloaded functions.

<A NAME="IDX1519"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1520"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1521"></A>
<DT><CODE>query</CODE>
<DD>
When GDB wants the user to confirm a potentially dangerous operation.

<A NAME="IDX1522"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1523"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1524"></A>
<DT><CODE>prompt-for-continue</CODE>
<DD>
When GDB is asking the user to press return to continue.  Note: Don't
expect this to work well; instead use <CODE>set height 0</CODE> to disable
prompting.  This is because the counting of lines is buggy in the
presence of annotations.
</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC262" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC262">Errors</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1525"></A>

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1526"></A>

<PRE>
^Z^Zquit
</PRE>

<P>
This annotation occurs right before GDB responds to an interrupt.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1527"></A>

<PRE>
^Z^Zerror
</PRE>

<P>
This annotation occurs right before GDB responds to an error.

</P>
<P>
Quit and error annotations indicate that any annotations which GDB was
in the middle of may end abruptly.  For example, if a
<CODE>value-history-begin</CODE> annotation is followed by a <CODE>error</CODE>, one
cannot expect to receive the matching <CODE>value-history-end</CODE>.  One
cannot expect not to receive it either, however; an error annotation
does not necessarily mean that GDB is immediately returning all the way
to the top level.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1528"></A>
A quit or error annotation may be preceded by

</P>

<PRE>
^Z^Zerror-begin
</PRE>

<P>
Any output between that and the quit or error annotation is the error
message.

</P>
<P>
Warning messages are not yet annotated.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC263" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC263">Invalidation Notices</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1529"></A>
The following annotations say that certain pieces of state may have
changed.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>^Z^Zframes-invalid</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1530"></A>
 

The frames (for example, output from the <CODE>backtrace</CODE> command) may
have changed.

<A NAME="IDX1531"></A>
<DT><CODE>^Z^Zbreakpoints-invalid</CODE>
<DD>
The breakpoints may have changed.  For example, the user just added or
deleted a breakpoint.
</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC264" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC264">Running the Program</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1532"></A>

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1533"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1534"></A>
When the program starts executing due to a GDB command such as
<CODE>step</CODE> or <CODE>continue</CODE>,

</P>

<PRE>
^Z^Zstarting
</PRE>

<P>
is output.  When the program stops,

</P>

<PRE>
^Z^Zstopped
</PRE>

<P>
is output.  Before the <CODE>stopped</CODE> annotation, a variety of
annotations describe how the program stopped.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>^Z^Zexited <VAR>exit-status</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1535"></A>
 
The program exited, and <VAR>exit-status</VAR> is the exit status (zero for
successful exit, otherwise nonzero).

<A NAME="IDX1536"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1537"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1538"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1539"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1540"></A>
<DT><CODE>^Z^Zsignalled</CODE>
<DD>
The program exited with a signal.  After the <CODE>^Z^Zsignalled</CODE>, the
annotation continues:


<PRE>
<VAR>intro-text</VAR>
^Z^Zsignal-name
<VAR>name</VAR>
^Z^Zsignal-name-end
<VAR>middle-text</VAR>
^Z^Zsignal-string
<VAR>string</VAR>
^Z^Zsignal-string-end
<VAR>end-text</VAR>
</PRE>

where <VAR>name</VAR> is the name of the signal, such as <CODE>SIGILL</CODE> or
<CODE>SIGSEGV</CODE>, and <VAR>string</VAR> is the explanation of the signal, such
as <CODE>Illegal Instruction</CODE> or <CODE>Segmentation fault</CODE>.
<VAR>intro-text</VAR>, <VAR>middle-text</VAR>, and <VAR>end-text</VAR> are for the
user's benefit and have no particular format.

<A NAME="IDX1541"></A>
<DT><CODE>^Z^Zsignal</CODE>
<DD>
The syntax of this annotation is just like <CODE>signalled</CODE>, but GDB is
just saying that the program received the signal, not that it was
terminated with it.

<A NAME="IDX1542"></A>
<DT><CODE>^Z^Zbreakpoint <VAR>number</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
The program hit breakpoint number <VAR>number</VAR>.

<A NAME="IDX1543"></A>
<DT><CODE>^Z^Zwatchpoint <VAR>number</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
The program hit watchpoint number <VAR>number</VAR>.
</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC265" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC265">Displaying Source</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1544"></A>

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1545"></A>
The following annotation is used instead of displaying source code:

</P>

<PRE>
^Z^Zsource <VAR>filename</VAR>:<VAR>line</VAR>:<VAR>character</VAR>:<VAR>middle</VAR>:<VAR>addr</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
where <VAR>filename</VAR> is an absolute file name indicating which source
file, <VAR>line</VAR> is the line number within that file (where 1 is the
first line in the file), <VAR>character</VAR> is the character position
within the file (where 0 is the first character in the file) (for most
debug formats this will necessarily point to the beginning of a line),
<VAR>middle</VAR> is <SAMP>`middle'</SAMP> if <VAR>addr</VAR> is in the middle of the
line, or <SAMP>`beg'</SAMP> if <VAR>addr</VAR> is at the beginning of the line, and
<VAR>addr</VAR> is the address in the target program associated with the
source which is being displayed.  <VAR>addr</VAR> is in the form <SAMP>`0x'</SAMP>
followed by one or more lowercase hex digits (note that this does not
depend on the language).
