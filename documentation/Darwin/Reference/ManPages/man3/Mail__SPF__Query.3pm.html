<b>NAME</b>
       Mail::SPF::Query - query Sender Policy Framework for an IP,email,helo

<b>VERSION</b>
       1.999.1

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
           my $query = new Mail::SPF::Query (ip =&gt; "127.0.0.1", sender=&gt;'foo@example.com', helo=&gt;"somehost.example.com", trusted=&gt;0, guess=&gt;0);
           my ($result,           # pass | fail | softfail | neutral | none | error | unknown [mechanism]
               $smtp_comment,     # "please see <a href="http://www.openspf.org/why.html?..">http://www.openspf.org/why.html?..</a>"  when rejecting, return this string to the SMTP client
               $header_comment,   # prepend_header("Received-SPF" =&gt; "$result ($header_comment)")
               $spf_record,       # "v=spf1 ..." original SPF record for the domain
              ) = $query-&gt;result();

           if    ($result eq "pass") { "Domain is not forged. Apply RHSBL and content filters." }
           elsif ($result eq "fail") { "Domain is forged. Reject or save to spambox." }

<b>ABSTRACT</b>
       The SPF protocol relies on sender domains to describe their designated outbound mailers in DNS.
       Given an email address, Mail::SPF::Query determines the legitimacy of an SMTP client IP address.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       There are two ways to use Mail::SPF::Query.  Your choice depends on whether the domains your server
       is an MX for have secondary MXes which your server doesn't know about.

       The first and more common style, calling -&gt;<u>result()</u>, is suitable when all mail is received directly
       from the originator's MTA.  If the domains you receive do not have secondary MX entries, this is
       appropriate.  This style of use is outlined in the SYNOPSIS above.  This is the common case.

       The second style is more complex, but works when your server receives mail from secondary MXes.  This
       performs checks as each recipient is handled.  If the message is coming from a valid MX secondary for
       a recipient, then the SPF check is not performed, and a "pass" response is returned right away.  To
       do this, call "result2()" and "message_result2()" instead of "result()".

       If you do not know what a secondary MX is, you probably don't have one.  Use the first style.

       You can try out Mail::SPF::Query on the command line with the following command:

           perl -MMail::SPF::Query -le 'print for Mail::SPF::Query-&gt;new(
               helo =&gt; shift, ipv4 =&gt; shift, sender =&gt; shift)-&gt;result' \
               helohost.example.com 1.2.3.4 user@example.com

<b>BUGS</b>
       Mail::SPF::Query tries to implement the SPF specification (see "SEE ALSO") as close as reasonably
       possible given that M:S:Q has been the very first SPF implementation and has changed with the SPF
       specification over time.  As a result, M:S:Q has various known deficiencies that cannot be corrected
       with reasonably little effort:

          <b>Unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>query</b> <b>HELO</b> <b>and</b> <b>MAIL</b> <b>FROM</b> <b>separately.</b>  M:S:Q is not designed to support the <u>separate</u>
           querying of the HELO and MAIL FROM identities.  Passing the HELO identity as the "sender"
           argument for a stand-alone HELO check might generally work but could yield unexpected results.

          <b>No</b> <b>IPv6</b> <b>support.</b>  IPv6 is not supported.  "ip6" mechanisms in SPF records and everywhere else are
           simply ignored.

          <b>Result</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>inappropriate</b> <b>for</b> <b>local</b> <b>policy</b> <b>results.</b>  If a query result was caused
           by anything other than a real SPF record (i.e. local policy, overrides, fallbacks, etc.), and no
           custom "default_explanation" was specified, the domain's explanation or M:S:Q's hard-coded
           default explanation will still be returned.  Be aware that in this case the explanation may not
           correctly explain the reason for such an artificial result.

<b>NON-STANDARD</b> <b>FEATURES</b>
       Also due to its long history, M:S:Q does have some legacy features that are not parts of the official
       SPF specification, most notably <u>best</u> <u>guess</u> <u>processing</u> and <u>trusted</u> <u>forwarder</u> <u>accreditation</u> <u>checking</u>.
       Please be careful when using these <u>non-standard</u> features or when reproducing them in your own SPF
       implementation, as they may cause unexpected results.

<b>METHODS</b>
       <b>"Mail::SPF::Query-&gt;new()"</b>

           my $query = eval { new Mail::SPF::Query (
               ip          =&gt; '127.0.0.1',
               sender      =&gt; 'foo@example.com',
               helo        =&gt; 'host.example.com',

               # Optional parameters:
               debug       =&gt; 1, debuglog =&gt; sub { print STDERR "@_\n" },
               local       =&gt; 'extra mechanisms',
               trusted     =&gt; 1,                   # do trusted forwarder processing
               guess       =&gt; 1,                   # do best guess if no SPF record
               default_explanation =&gt; 'Please see <a href="http://spf.my.isp/spferror.html">http://spf.my.isp/spferror.html</a> for details',
               max_lookup_count    =&gt; 10,          # total number of SPF includes/redirects
               sanitize    =&gt; 0,                   # do not sanitize all returned strings
               myhostname  =&gt; 'foo.example.com',   # prepended to header_comment
               override    =&gt; {   'example.net' =&gt; 'v=spf1 a mx -all',
                                '*.example.net' =&gt; 'v=spf1 a mx -all' },
               fallback    =&gt; {   'example.org' =&gt; 'v=spf1 a mx -all',
                                '*.example.org' =&gt; 'v=spf1 a mx -all' }
           ) };

           if ($@) { warn "bad input to Mail::SPF::Query: $@" }

       Set "trusted=&gt;1" to turned on "trusted-forwarder.org" accreditation checking.  The mechanism
       "include:spf.trusted-forwarder.org" is used just before a "-all" or "?all".  The precise
       circumstances are somewhat more complicated, but it does get the case of "v=spf1 -all" right -- i.e.
       "trusted-forwarder.org" is not checked.  <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>non-standard</b> <b>feature.</b>

       Set "guess=&gt;1" to turned on automatic best guess processing.  This will use the best_guess SPF record
       when one cannot be found in the DNS.  Note that this can only return "pass" or "neutral".  The
       "trusted" and "local" flags also operate when the best_guess is being used.  <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>non-standard</b>
       <b>feature.</b>

       Set "local=&gt;'include:local.domain'" to include some extra processing just before a "-all" or "?all".
       The local processing happens just before the trusted forwarder processing.  <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>non-standard</b>
       <b>feature.</b>

       Set "default_explanation" to a string to be used if the SPF record does not provide a specific
       explanation. The default value will direct the user to a page at www.openspf.org with the following
       message:

           Please see <a href="http://www.openspf.org/why.html?sender=%{S}&amp;ip=%{I}&amp;receiver=%{R}">http://www.openspf.org/why.html?sender=%{S}&amp;ip=%{I}&amp;receiver=%{R}</a>

       Note that the string has macro substitution performed.

       Set "sanitize" to 0 to get all the returned strings unsanitized.  Alternatively, pass a function
       reference and this function will be used to sanitize the returned values.  The function must take a
       single string argument and return a single string which contains the sanitized result.

       Set "debug=&gt;1" to watch the queries happen.

       Set "override" to define SPF records for domains that do publish but which you want to override
       anyway.  Wildcards are supported.  <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>non-standard</b> <b>feature.</b>

       Set "fallback" to define "pretend" SPF records for domains that don't publish them yet.  Wildcards
       are supported.  <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>non-standard</b> <b>feature.</b>

       Note: domain name arguments to override and fallback need to be in all lowercase.

       <b>"$query-&gt;result()"</b>

           my ($result, $smtp_comment, $header_comment, $spf_record, $detail) = $query-&gt;result();

       $result will be one of "pass", "fail", "softfail", "neutral", "none", "error" or "unknown [...]":

       "pass"
           The client IP address is an authorized mailer for the sender.  The mail should be accepted
           subject to local policy regarding the sender.

       "fail"
           The client IP address is not an authorized mailer, and the sender wants you to reject the
           transaction for fear of forgery.

       "softfail"
           The client IP address is not an authorized mailer, but the sender prefers that you accept the
           transaction because it isn't absolutely sure all its users are mailing through approved servers.
           The "softfail" status is often used during initial deployment of SPF records by a domain.

       "neutral"
           The sender makes no assertion about the status of the client IP.

       "none"
           There is no SPF record for this domain.

       "error"
           The DNS lookup encountered a temporary error during processing.

       "unknown [...]"
           The domain has a configuration error in the published data or defines a mechanism that this
           library does not understand.  If the data contained an unrecognized mechanism, it will be
           presented following "unknown".  You should test for unknown using a regexp "/^unknown/" rather
           than "eq "unknown"".

       Results are cached internally for a default of 120 seconds.  You can call "-&gt;result()" repeatedly;
       subsequent lookups won't hit your DNS.

       "smtp_comment" should be displayed to the SMTP client.

       "header_comment" goes into a "Received-SPF" header, like so:

           Received-SPF: $result ($header_comment)

       "spf_record" shows the original SPF record fetched for the query.  If there is no SPF record, it is
       blank.  Otherwise, it will start with "v=spf1" and contain the SPF mechanisms and such that describe
       the domain.

       Note that the strings returned by this method (and most of the other methods) are (at least
       partially) under the control of the sender's domain.  This means that, if the sender is an attacker,
       the contents can be assumed to be hostile.  The various methods that return these strings make sure
       that (by default) the strings returned contain only characters in the range 32 - 126.  This behavior
       can be changed by setting "sanitize" to 0 to turn off sanitization entirely.  You can also set
       "sanitize" to a function reference to perform custom sanitization.  In particular, assume that
       "smtp_comment" might contain a newline character.

       "detail" is a hash of all the foregoing result elements, plus extra data returned by the SPF result.

       <u>Why</u> <u>the</u> <u>weird</u> <u>duplication?</u>  In the beginning, "result()" returned only one value, the $result.  Then
       $smtp_comment and $header_comment came along.  Then $spf_record.  Past a certain number of positional
       results, it makes more sense to have a hash.  But we didn't want to break backwards compatibility, so
       we just declared that the fifth result would be a hash and future return value would go in there.

       The keys of the hash are:

           result
           smtp_comment
           header_comment
           header_pairs
           spf_record
           modifiers

       <b>"$query-&gt;result2()"</b>

           my ($result, $smtp_comment, $header_comment, $spf_record) = $query-&gt;result2('recipient@domain', 'recipient2@domain');

       "result2()" does everything that "result()" does, but it first checks to see if the sending system is
       a recognized MX secondary for the <!-- a -->recipient(s)<!-- /a -->.  If so, then it returns "pass" and does not perform
       the SPF query.  Note that the sending system may be a MX secondary for some (but not all) of the
       recipients for a multi-recipient message, which is why result2 takes an argument list.  See also
       "message_result2()".

       <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>non-standard</b> <b>feature.</b>  <b>This</b> <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>deprecated,</b> <b>because</b> <b>exemption</b> <b>of</b> <b>trusted</b>
       <b>relays,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>MXes,</b> <b>should</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>software</b> <b>that</b> <b>uses</b> <b>this</b> <b>library</b>
       <b>before</b> <b>doing</b> <b>an</b> <b>SPF</b> <b>check.</b>

       $result will be one of "pass", "fail", "neutral [...]", or "unknown".  See "result()" above for
       meanings.

       If you have secondary MXes and if you are unable to explicitly white-list them before SPF tests
       occur, you can use this method in place of "result()", calling it as many times as there are
       recipients, or just providing all the recipients at one time.

       "smtp_comment" can be displayed to the SMTP client.

       For example:

           my $query = new Mail::SPF::Query (ip =&gt; "127.0.0.1",
                                             sender=&gt;'foo@example.com',
                                             helo=&gt;"somehost.example.com");

           ...

           my ($result, $smtp_comment, $header_comment);

           ($result, $smtp_comment, $header_comment) = $query-&gt;result2('recip1@example.com');
           # return suitable error code based on $result eq 'fail' or not

           ($result, $smtp_comment, $header_comment) = $query-&gt;result2('recip2@example.org');
           # return suitable error code based on $result eq 'fail' or not

           ($result, $smtp_comment, $header_comment) = $query-&gt;message_result2();
           # return suitable error if $result eq 'fail'
           # prefix message with "Received-SPF: $result ($header_comment)"

       <b>"$query-&gt;message_result2()"</b>

           my ($result, $smtp_comment, $header_comment, $spf_record) = $query-&gt;message_result2();

       "message_result2()" returns an overall status for the message after zero or more calls to
       "result2()".  It will always be the last status returned by "result2()", or the status returned by
       "result()" if "result2()" was never called.

       $result will be one of "pass", "fail", "neutral [...]", or "error".  See "result()" above for
       meanings.

       <b>"$query-&gt;best_guess()"</b>

           my ($result, $smtp_comment, $header_comment) = $query-&gt;best_guess();

       When a domain does not publish an SPF record, this library can produce an educated guess anyway.

       It pretends the domain defined A, MX, and PTR mechanisms, plus a few others.  The default set of
       directives is

           a/24 mx/24 ptr

       That default set will return either "pass" or "neutral".

       If you want to experiment with a different default, you can pass it as an argument:
       "$query-&gt;best_guess("a mx ptr")"

       <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>non-standard</b> <b>feature.</b>  <b>This</b> <b>method</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>deprecated.</b>  You should set "guess=&gt;1" on the
       "new()" method instead.

       <b>"$query-&gt;trusted_forwarder()"</b>

           my ($result, $smtp_comment, $header_comment) = $query-&gt;best_guess();

       It is possible that the message is coming through a known-good relay like "acm.org" or "pobox.com".
       During the transitional period, many legitimate services may appear to forge a sender address: for
       example, a news website may have a "send me this article in email" link.

       The "trusted-forwarder.org" domain is a white-list of known-good hosts that either forward mail or
       perform benign envelope sender forgery:

           include:spf.trusted-forwarder.org

       This will return either "pass" or "neutral".

       <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>non-standard</b> <b>feature.</b>  <b>This</b> <b>method</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>deprecated.</b>  You should set "trusted=&gt;1" on the
       "new()" method instead.

       <b>"$query-&gt;sanitize('string')"</b>

       This applies the sanitization rules for the particular query object. These rules are controlled by
       the "sanitize" parameter to the c&lt;<u>new()&gt;</u> method.

       <b>"strict_sanitize('string')"</b>

       This ensures that all the characters in the returned string are printable.  All whitespace is
       converted into spaces, and all other non-printable characters are converted into question marks.
       This is probably over-aggressive for many applications.

       This function is used by default when the "sanitize" option is passed to the "new()" method.

       <b>This</b> <b>function</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>class</b> <b>method.</b>

       <b>"$query-&gt;debuglog()"</b>

       Subclasses may override this with their own debug logger.  "Log::Dispatch" is recommended.

       Alternatively, pass the "new()" constructor a "debuglog =&gt; sub { ... }" callback, and we'll pass
       debugging lines to that.

<b>WARNINGS</b>
       Mail::Query::SPF should only be used at the point where messages are received from the Internet.  The
       underlying assumption is that the sender of the e-mail is sending the message directly to you or one
       of your secondary MXes.  If your MTA does not have an exhaustive list of secondary MXes, then the
       "result2()" and "message_result2()" methods can be used.  These methods take care to permit mail from
