POSTCONF(5)                                                                                      POSTCONF(5)



<b>NAME</b>
       postconf - Postfix configuration parameters

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>postconf</b> <u>parameter</u> ...

       <b>postconf</b> <b>-e</b> "<u>parameter=value</u>" ...

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  Postfix  main.cf  configuration file specifies a small subset of all the parameters that control
       the operation of the Postfix mail system. Parameters not specified  in  main.cf  are  left  at  their
       default values.

       The general format of the main.cf file is as follows:

             Each  logical line has the form "parameter = value".  Whitespace around the "=" is ignored, as
              is whitespace at the end of a logical line.

             Empty lines and whitespace-only lines are ignored, as are  lines  whose  first  non-whitespace
              character is a `#'.

             A logical line starts with non-whitespace text. A line that starts with whitespace continues a
              logical line.

             A parameter value may refer to other parameters.

                    The expressions "$name", "${name}" or "$(name)" are recursively replaced by  the  value
                     of the named parameter.

                    The  expression "${name?value}" expands to "value" when "$name" is non-empty. This form
                     is supported with Postfix version 2.2 and later.

                    The expression "${name:value}" expands to "value" when "$name" is empty. This  form  is
                     supported with Postfix version 2.2 and later.

             When the same parameter is defined multiple times, only the last instance is remembered.

             Otherwise, the order of main.cf parameter definitions does not matter.

       The remainder of this document is a description of all Postfix configuration parameters. Default val-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ues&nbsp;values</font>
       ues are shown after the parameter name in parentheses, and can be looked up with  the  "<b>postconf</b>  <b>-d</b>"
       command.

       Note:  this  is  not  an  invitation to make changes to Postfix configuration parameters. Unnecessary
       changes can impair the operation of the mail system.

<b>2bounce_notice_recipient</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>postmaster)</b>
       The recipient of undeliverable mail that cannot be returned to the sender.  This feature  is  enabled
       with the notify_classes parameter.

<b>access_map_reject_code</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>554)</b>
       The  numerical  Postfix  SMTP  server  response  code  when  a client is rejected by an <a href="access.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/access"><b>access</b>(5)</a> map
       restriction.

       Do not change this unless you have a complete understanding of RFC 821.

<b>address_verify_default_transport</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$default_transport)</b>
       Overrides the default_transport parameter setting for address verification probes.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>address_verify_local_transport</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$local_transport)</b>
       Overrides the local_transport parameter setting for address verification probes.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>address_verify_map</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Optional lookup table for persistent address verification status storage.  The table is maintained by
       the <a href="../man8/verify.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/verify"><b>verify</b>(8)</a> service, and is opened before the process releases privileges.

       By  default, the information is kept in volatile memory, and is lost after "<b>postfix</b> <b>reload</b>" or "<b>post</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fix&nbsp;"postfix</font>
       <b>fix</b> <b>stop</b>".

       Specify a location in a file system that will not fill up. If the  database  becomes  corrupted,  the
       world comes to an end. To recover delete the file and do "<b>postfix</b> <b>reload</b>".

       Examples:

       address_verify_map = hash:/etc/postfix/verify
       address_verify_map = btree:/etc/postfix/verify

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>address_verify_negative_cache</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b>
       Enable caching of failed address verification probe results.  When this feature is enabled, the cache
       may pollute quickly with garbage.  When this feature is disabled, Postfix will  generate  an  address
       probe for every lookup.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>address_verify_negative_expire_time</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>3d)</b>
       The time after which a failed probe expires from the address verification cache.

       Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>address_verify_negative_refresh_time</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>3h)</b>
       The time after which a failed address verification probe needs to be refreshed.

       Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>address_verify_poll_count</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>3)</b>
       How  many  times to query the <a href="../man8/verify.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/verify"><b>verify</b>(8)</a> service for the completion of an address verification request
       in progress.

       The default poll count is 3.

       Specify 1 to implement a crude form of greylisting, that is, always defer the first delivery  request
       for a never seen before address.

       Example:

       address_verify_poll_count = 1

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>address_verify_poll_delay</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>3s)</b>
       The delay between queries for the completion of an address verification request in progress.

       The default polling delay is 3 seconds.

       Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>address_verify_positive_expire_time</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>31d)</b>
       The time after which a successful probe expires from the address verification cache.

       Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>address_verify_positive_refresh_time</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>7d)</b>
       The time after which a successful address verification probe needs to be refreshed.  The address ver-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ification&nbsp;verification</font>
       ification status is not updated when the probe fails (optimistic caching).

       Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>address_verify_relay_transport</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$relay_transport)</b>
       Overrides the relay_transport parameter setting for address verification probes.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>address_verify_relayhost</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$relayhost)</b>
       Overrides the relayhost parameter setting for address verification probes. This  information  can  be
       overruled with the <a href="transport.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/transport"><b>transport</b>(5)</a> table.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>address_verify_sender</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>postmaster)</b>
       The  sender address to use in address verification probes. To avoid problems with address probes that
       are sent in response to address probes, the Postfix SMTP server excludes  the  probe  sender  address
       from all SMTPD access blocks.

       Specify  an  empty  value (address_verify_sender =) or &lt;&gt; if you want to use the null sender address.
       Beware, some sites reject mail from &lt;&gt;, even though RFCs require that such addresses be accepted.

       Examples:

       address_verify_sender = &lt;&gt;
       address_verify_sender = postmaster@my.domain

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>address_verify_sender_dependent_relayhost_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Overrides the sender_dependent_relayhost_maps parameter setting for address verification probes.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>address_verify_service_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>verify)</b>
       The name of the <a href="../man8/verify.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/verify"><b>verify</b>(8)</a> address verification service. This service maintains the status  of  sender
       and/or  recipient  address verification probes, and generates probes on request by other Postfix pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cesses.&nbsp;processes.</font>
       cesses.

<b>address_verify_transport_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$transport_maps)</b>
       Overrides the transport_maps parameter setting for address verification probes.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>address_verify_virtual_transport</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$virtual_transport)</b>
       Overrides the virtual_transport parameter setting for address verification probes.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>alias_database</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b>
       The alias databases for <a href="../man8/local.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/local"><b>local</b>(8)</a> delivery that are updated with "<b>newaliases</b>" or with "<b>sendmail</b>  <b>-bi</b>".

       This is a separate configuration parameter because not all the tables specified with $alias_maps have
       to be local files.

       Examples:

       alias_database = hash:/etc/aliases
       alias_database = hash:/etc/mail/aliases

<b>alias_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b>
       The alias databases that are used for <a href="../man8/local.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/local"><b>local</b>(8)</a> delivery. See <a href="aliases.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/aliases"><b>aliases</b>(5)</a> for syntax details.

       The default list is system dependent.  On systems with NIS, the default is to search the local  alias
       database, then the NIS alias database.

       If  you  change  the alias database, run "<b>postalias</b> <b>/etc/aliases</b>" (or wherever your system stores the
       mail alias file), or simply run "<b>newaliases</b>" to build the necessary DBM or DB file.

       The <a href="../man8/local.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/local"><b>local</b>(8)</a> delivery agent disallows regular expression  substitution  of  $1  etc.  in  alias_maps,
       because that would open a security hole.

       The  <a href="../man8/local.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/local"><b>local</b>(8)</a>  delivery  agent  will  silently  ignore  requests to use the <a href="../man8/proxymap.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/proxymap"><b>proxymap</b>(8)</a> server within
       alias_maps. Instead it will open the table directly. Before Postfix version 2.2, the <a href="../man8/local.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/local"><b>local</b>(8)</a>  deliv-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ery&nbsp;delivery</font>
       ery agent will terminate with a fatal error.

       Examples:

       alias_maps = hash:/etc/aliases, nis:mail.aliases
       alias_maps = hash:/etc/aliases

<b>allow_mail_to_commands</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>alias,</b> <b>forward)</b>
       Restrict  <a href="../man8/local.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/local"><b>local</b>(8)</a> mail delivery to external commands.  The default is to disallow delivery to "|com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand"&nbsp;"|command"</font>
       mand" in :include:  files (see <a href="aliases.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/aliases"><b>aliases</b>(5)</a> for the text that defines this terminology).

       Specify zero or more of: <b>alias</b>, <b>forward</b> or <b>include</b>, in order to allow commands in  <a href="aliases.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/aliases"><b>aliases</b>(5)</a>,  .for-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ward&nbsp;.forward</font>
       ward files or in :include:  files, respectively.

       Example:

       allow_mail_to_commands = alias,forward,include

<b>allow_mail_to_files</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>alias,</b> <b>forward)</b>
       Restrict  <a href="../man8/local.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/local"><b>local</b>(8)</a>  mail delivery to external files. The default is to disallow "/file/name" destina-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tions&nbsp;destinations</font>
       tions in :include:  files (see <a href="aliases.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/aliases"><b>aliases</b>(5)</a> for the text that defines this terminology).

       Specify zero or more of: <b>alias</b>, <b>forward</b> or <b>include</b>, in order to allow  "/file/name"  destinations  in
       <a href="aliases.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/aliases"><b>aliases</b>(5)</a>, .forward files and in :include:  files, respectively.

       Example:

       allow_mail_to_files = alias,forward,include

<b>allow_min_user</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
       Allow  a  recipient  address to have `-' as the first character.  By default, this is not allowed, to
       avoid accidents with software that passes email addresses via the command line. Such  software  would
       not  be  able  to distinguish a malicious address from a bona fide command-line option. Although this
       can be prevented by inserting a "--" option terminator into the command line, this  is  difficult  to
       enforce consistently and globally.

<b>allow_percent_hack</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b>
       Enable the rewriting of the form "user%domain" to "user@domain".  This is enabled by default.

       Note: with Postfix version 2.2, message header address rewriting happens only when one of the follow-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;following</font>
       ing conditions is true:

             The message is received with the Postfix <a href="../man1/sendmail.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/sendmail"><b>sendmail</b>(1)</a> command,

             The message is received from a network client that matches $local_header_rewrite_clients,

             The message is received from the network, and the remote_header_rewrite_domain parameter spec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ifies&nbsp;specifies</font>
              ifies a non-empty value.

       To  get the behavior before Postfix version 2.2, specify "local_header_rewrite_clients = static:all".

       Example:

       allow_percent_hack = no

<b>allow_untrusted_routing</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
       Forward mail with sender-specified routing (user[@%!]remote[@%!]site) from untrusted clients to  des-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tinations&nbsp;destinations</font>
       tinations matching $relay_domains.

       By  default,  this  feature is turned off.  This closes a nasty open relay loophole where a backup MX
       host can be tricked into forwarding junk mail to a primary MX host which then spams  it  out  to  the
       world.

       This  parameter  also controls if non-local addresses with sender-specified routing can match Postfix
       access tables. By default, such addresses cannot match Postfix access tables, because the address  is
       ambiguous.

<b>alternate_config_directories</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       A  list of non-default Postfix configuration directories that may be specified with "-c config_direc-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tory"&nbsp;config_directory"</font>
       tory" on the command line, or via the MAIL_CONFIG environment parameter.

       This list must be specified in the default Postfix configuration directory, and is  used  by  set-gid
       Postfix commands such as <a href="../man1/postqueue.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/postqueue"><b>postqueue</b>(1)</a> and <a href="../man1/postdrop.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/postdrop"><b>postdrop</b>(1)</a>.

<b>always_bcc</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Optional  address that receives a "blind carbon copy" of each message that is received by the Postfix
       mail system.

       Note: if mail to the BCC address bounces it will be returned to the sender.

       Note: automatic BCC recipients are produced only for new mail.  To avoid mailer loops, automatic  BCC
       recipients  are  not  generated  for mail that Postfix forwards internally, nor for mail that Postfix
       generates itself.

<b>anvil_rate_time_unit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>60s)</b>
       The time unit over which client connection rates and other rates are calculated.

       This feature is implemented by the <a href="../man8/anvil.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/anvil"><b>anvil</b>(8)</a> service which is available in  Postfix  version  2.2  and
       later.

       The  default  interval  is  relatively  short. Because of the high frequency of updates, the <a href="../man8/anvil.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/anvil"><b>anvil</b>(8)</a>
       server uses volatile memory only. Thus, information is lost whenever the process terminates.

       Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default  time  unit  is  s
       (seconds).

<b>anvil_status_update_time</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>600s)</b>
       How frequently the <a href="../man8/anvil.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/anvil"><b>anvil</b>(8)</a> connection and rate limiting server logs peak usage information.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

       Time  units:  s  (seconds),  m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit is s
       (seconds).

<b>append_at_myorigin</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b>
       With locally submitted mail, append the string "@$myorigin" to mail addresses without domain informa-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion.&nbsp;information.</font>
       tion. With remotely submitted mail, append the string "@$remote_header_rewrite_domain" instead.

       Note  1:  this  feature  is  enabled by default and must not be turned off.  Postfix does not support
       domain-less addresses.

       Note 2: with Postfix version 2.2, message header address rewriting happens only when one of the  fol-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lowing&nbsp;following</font>
       lowing conditions is true:

             The message is received with the Postfix <a href="../man1/sendmail.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/sendmail"><b>sendmail</b>(1)</a> command,

             The message is received from a network client that matches $local_header_rewrite_clients,

             The message is received from the network, and the remote_header_rewrite_domain parameter spec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ifies&nbsp;specifies</font>
              ifies a non-empty value.

       To get the behavior before Postfix version 2.2, specify "local_header_rewrite_clients =  static:all".

<b>append_dot_mydomain</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b>
       With  locally  submitted  mail,  append  the  string ".$mydomain" to addresses that have no ".domain"
       information.  With  remotely  submitted  mail,  append  the  string  ".$remote_header_rewrite_domain"
       instead.

       Note  1:  this  feature  is  enabled  by default. If disabled, users will not be able to send mail to
       "user@partialdomainname" but will have to specify full domain names instead.

       Note 2: with Postfix version 2.2, message header address rewriting happens only when one of the  fol-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lowing&nbsp;following</font>
       lowing conditions is true:

             The message is received with the Postfix <a href="../man1/sendmail.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/sendmail"><b>sendmail</b>(1)</a> command,

             The message is received from a network client that matches $local_header_rewrite_clients,

             The message is received from the network, and the remote_header_rewrite_domain parameter spec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ifies&nbsp;specifies</font>
              ifies a non-empty value.

       To get the behavior before Postfix version 2.2, specify "local_header_rewrite_clients =  static:all".

<b>application_event_drain_time</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>100s)</b>
       How long the <a href="../man1/postkick.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/postkick"><b>postkick</b>(1)</a> command waits for a request to enter the server's input buffer before giving
       up.

       Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default  time  unit  is  s
       (seconds).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>authorized_flush_users</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>static:anyone)</b>
       List of users who are authorized to flush the queue.

       By  default, all users are allowed to flush the queue.  Access is always granted if the invoking user
       is the super-user or the $mail_owner user.  Otherwise, the real UID of the process is  looked  up  in
       the system password file, and access is granted only if the corresponding login name is on the access
       list.  The username "unknown" is used for processes whose real UID is not found in the password file.

       Specify  a  list  of  user  names,  "/file/name" or "type:table" patterns, separated by commas and/or
       whitespace. The list is matched  left  to  right,  and  the  search  stops  on  the  first  match.  A
       "/file/name"  pattern is replaced by its contents; a "type:table" lookup table is matched when a name
       matches a lookup key (the lookup result is ignored).  Continue long lines by starting the  next  line
       with  whitespace.  Specify "!pattern" to exclude a name from the list. The form "!/file/name" is sup-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ported&nbsp;supported</font>
       ported only in Postfix version 2.4 and later.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>authorized_mailq_users</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>static:anyone)</b>
       List of users who are authorized to view the queue.

       By default, all users are allowed to view the queue.  Access is always granted if the  invoking  user
       is  the  super-user  or the $mail_owner user.  Otherwise, the real UID of the process is looked up in
       the system password file, and access is granted only if the corresponding login name is on the access
       list.  The username "unknown" is used for processes whose real UID is not found in the password file.

       Specify a list of user names, "/file/name" or  "type:table"  patterns,  separated  by  commas  and/or
       whitespace.  The  list  is  matched  left  to  right,  and  the  search  stops  on the first match. A
       "/file/name" pattern is replaced by its contents; a "type:table" lookup table is matched when a  name
       matches  a  lookup key (the lookup result is ignored).  Continue long lines by starting the next line
       with whitespace. Specify "!pattern" to exclude a user name from the list. The form  "!/file/name"  is
       supported only in Postfix version 2.4 and later.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>authorized_submit_users</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>static:anyone)</b>
       List of users who are authorized to submit mail with the <a href="../man1/sendmail.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/sendmail"><b>sendmail</b>(1)</a> command (and with the privileged
       <a href="../man1/postdrop.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/postdrop"><b>postdrop</b>(1)</a> helper command).

       By default, all users are allowed to submit mail.  Otherwise, the real UID of the process  is  looked
       up  in the system password file, and access is granted only if the corresponding login name is on the
       access list.  The username "unknown" is used for processes whose real UID is not found in  the  pass-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">word&nbsp;password</font>
       word file. To deny mail submission access to all users specify an empty list.

       Specify  a  list  of  user  names,  "/file/name" or "type:table" patterns, separated by commas and/or
       whitespace. The list is matched  left  to  right,  and  the  search  stops  on  the  first  match.  A
       "/file/name"  pattern is replaced by its contents; a "type:table" lookup table is matched when a name
       matches a lookup key (the lookup result is ignored).  Continue long lines by starting the  next  line
       with  whitespace.  Specify "!pattern" to exclude a user name from the list. The form "!/file/name" is
       supported only in Postfix version 2.4 and later.

       Example:

       authorized_submit_users = !www, static:all

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>authorized_verp_clients</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$mynetworks)</b>
       What SMTP clients are allowed to specify the XVERP command.   This  command  requests  that  mail  be
       delivered one recipient at a time with a per recipient return address.

       By default, only trusted clients are allowed to specify XVERP.

       This  parameter  was introduced with Postfix version 1.1.  Postfix version 2.1 renamed this parameter
       to smtpd_authorized_verp_clients and changed the default to none.

       Specify a list of network/netmask patterns, separated by commas and/or whitespace. The mask specifies
       the number of bits in the network part of a host address. You can also specify hostnames or \&amp;.domain
       names (the initial dot causes the domain to match any name below it),  "/file/name"  or  "type:table"
       patterns.  A "/file/name" pattern is replaced by its contents; a "type:table" lookup table is matched
       when a table entry matches a lookup string (the lookup result is ignored).  Continue  long  lines  by
       starting  the  next  line  with whitespace. Specify "!pattern" to exclude an address or network block
       from the list. The form "!/file/name" is supported only in Postfix version 2.4 and later.

       Note: IP version 6 address information must be specified inside  []  in  the  authorized_verp_clients
       value,  and  in files specified with "/file/name".  IP version 6 addresses contain the ":" character,
       and would otherwise be confused with a "type:table" pattern.

<b>backwards_bounce_logfile_compatibility</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b>
       Produce additional <a href="../man8/bounce.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/bounce"><b>bounce</b>(8)</a> logfile records that can be read by Postfix  versions  before  2.0.  The
       current  and more extensible "name = value" format is needed in order to implement more sophisticated
       functionality.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>berkeley_db_create_buffer_size</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>16777216)</b>
       The per-table I/O buffer size for programs that create Berkeley DB hash or btree tables.   Specify  a
       byte count.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

<b>berkeley_db_read_buffer_size</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>131072)</b>
       The  per-table  I/O  buffer  size for programs that read Berkeley DB hash or btree tables.  Specify a
       byte count.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

<b>best_mx_transport</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Where the Postfix SMTP client should deliver mail when it detects a "mail loops back to myself" error
       condition.  This  happens  when  the  local MTA is the best SMTP mail exchanger for a destination not
       listed in  $mydestination,  $inet_interfaces,  $proxy_interfaces,  $virtual_alias_domains,  or  $vir-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tual_mailbox_domains.&nbsp;$virtual_mailbox_domains.</font>
       tual_mailbox_domains.  By default, the Postfix SMTP client returns such mail as undeliverable.

       Specify,  for  example,  "best_mx_transport = local" to pass the mail from the Postfix SMTP client to
       the <a href="../man8/local.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/local"><b>local</b>(8)</a> delivery agent. You can specify any message delivery "transport" or  "transport:nexthop"
       that is defined in the master.cf file. See the <a href="transport.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/transport"><b>transport</b>(5)</a> manual page for the syntax and meaning of
       "transport" or "transport:nexthop".

       However, this feature is expensive because it ties  up  a  Postfix  SMTP  client  process  while  the
       <a href="../man8/local.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/local"><b>local</b>(8)</a>  delivery  agent  is  doing  its work. It is more efficient (for Postfix) to list all hosted
       domains in a table or database.

<b>biff</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b>
       Whether or not to use the local biff service.  This service sends "new mail" notifications  to  users
       who have requested new mail notification with the UNIX command "biff y".

       For  compatibility reasons this feature is on by default.  On systems with lots of interactive users,
       the biff service can be a performance drain.  Specify "biff = no" in main.cf to disable.

<b>body_checks</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Optional lookup tables for content inspection as specified in the <a href="body_checks.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/body_checks"><b>body_checks</b>(5)</a> manual page.

       Note: with Postfix versions before 2.0, these rules inspect all content  after  the  primary  message
       headers.

<b>body_checks_size_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>51200)</b>
       How  much text in a message body segment (or attachment, if you prefer to use that term) is subjected
       to body_checks inspection.  The amount of text is limited to avoid scanning huge attachments.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

<b>bounce_notice_recipient</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>postmaster)</b>
       The recipient of postmaster notifications with the message headers  of  mail  that  Postfix  did  not
       deliver  and  of SMTP conversation transcripts of mail that Postfix did not receive.  This feature is
       enabled with the notify_classes parameter.

<b>bounce_queue_lifetime</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>5d)</b>
       The maximal time a bounce message is queued before it is considered undeliverable.  By default,  this
       is the same as the queue life time for regular mail.

       Time  units:  s  (seconds),  m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit is d
       (days).

       Specify 0 when mail delivery should be tried only once.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>bounce_service_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>bounce)</b>
       The name of the <a href="../man8/bounce.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/bounce"><b>bounce</b>(8)</a> service. This service maintains a record of failed  delivery  attempts  and
       generates non-delivery notifications.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

<b>bounce_size_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>50000)</b>
       The  maximal  amount  of original message text that is sent in a non-delivery notification. Specify a
       byte count. If you increase this limit, then you should increase the mime_nesting_limit value propor-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tionally.&nbsp;proportionally.</font>
       tionally.

<b>bounce_template_file</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Pathname  of  a  configuration  file with bounce message templates.  These override the built-in tem-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">plates&nbsp;templates</font>
       plates of delivery status notification (DSN) messages for undeliverable mail, for delayed mail,  suc-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cessful&nbsp;successful</font>
       cessful  delivery, or delivery verification. The <a href="bounce.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/bounce"><b>bounce</b>(5)</a> manual page describes how to edit and test
       template files.

       Template message body text may contain $name references  to  Postfix  configuration  parameters.  The
       result  of  $name  expansion  can be previewed with "<b>postconf</b> <b>-b</b> <u>file</u><b>_</b><u>name</u>" before the file is placed
       into the Postfix configuration directory.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>broken_sasl_auth_clients</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
       Enable inter-operability with SMTP clients that implement an obsolete version  of  the  AUTH  command
       (RFC  2554).  Examples of such clients are MicroSoft Outlook Express version 4 and MicroSoft Exchange
       version 5.0.

       Specify "broken_sasl_auth_clients = yes" to have Postfix advertise AUTH  support  in  a  non-standard
       way.

<b>canonical_classes</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>envelope_sender,</b> <b>envelope_recipient,</b> <b>header_sender,</b> <b>header_recipient)</b>
       What  addresses  are  subject  to canonical_maps address mapping.  By default, canonical_maps address
       mapping is applied to envelope sender and recipient addresses, and to header sender and header recip-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ient&nbsp;recipient</font>
       ient addresses.

       Specify one or more of: envelope_sender, envelope_recipient, header_sender, header_recipient

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>canonical_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Optional  address  mapping lookup tables for message headers and envelopes. The mapping is applied to
       both sender and recipient addresses, in both envelopes and in headers, as controlled with the canoni-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cal_classes&nbsp;canonical_classes</font>
       cal_classes  parameter.  This is typically used to clean up dirty addresses from legacy mail systems,
       or to replace login names by Firstname.Lastname.  The table format  and  lookups  are  documented  in
       <a href="canonical.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/canonical"><b>canonical</b>(5)</a>. For an overview of Postfix address manipulations see the ADDRESS_REWRITING_README docu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment.&nbsp;document.</font>
       ment.

       If you use this feature, run "<b>postmap</b> <b>/etc/postfix/canonical</b>" to build the necessary DBM or  DB  file
       after  every  change.  The changes will become visible after a minute or so.  Use "<b>postfix</b> <b>reload</b>" to
       eliminate the delay.

       Note: with Postfix version 2.2, message header address  mapping  happens  only  when  message  header
       address rewriting is enabled:

             The message is received with the Postfix <a href="../man1/sendmail.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/sendmail"><b>sendmail</b>(1)</a> command,

             The message is received from a network client that matches $local_header_rewrite_clients,

             The message is received from the network, and the remote_header_rewrite_domain parameter spec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ifies&nbsp;specifies</font>
              ifies a non-empty value.

       To get the behavior before Postfix version 2.2, specify "local_header_rewrite_clients =  static:all".

       Examples:

       canonical_maps = dbm:/etc/postfix/canonical
       canonical_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/canonical

<b>cleanup_service_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>cleanup)</b>
       The  name of the <a href="../man8/cleanup.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/cleanup"><b>cleanup</b>(8)</a> service. This service rewrites addresses into the standard form, and per-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">forms&nbsp;performs</font>
       forms <a href="canonical.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/canonical"><b>canonical</b>(5)</a> address mapping and <a href="virtual.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/virtual"><b>virtual</b>(5)</a> aliasing.

<b>command_execution_directory</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       The <a href="../man8/local.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/local"><b>local</b>(8)</a> delivery agent working directory for delivery to external command.   Failure  to  change
       directory causes the delivery to be deferred.

       The  following  $name  expansions  are  done  on  command_execution_directory before the directory is
       changed. Expansion happens in the context of the delivery request.  The result of $name expansion  is
       filtered  with  the  character  set  that  is specified with the execution_directory_expansion_filter
       parameter.

       <b>$user</b>  The recipient's username.

       <b>$shell</b> The recipient's login shell pathname.

       <b>$home</b>  The recipient's home directory.

       <b>$recipient</b>

              The recipient domain.

       <b>$local</b> The entire recipient localpart.

       <b>$recipient_delimiter</b>
              The system-wide recipient address extension delimiter.

       <b>${name?value}</b>
              Expands to <u>value</u> when <u>$name</u> is non-empty.

       <b>${name:value}</b>
              Expands to <u>value</u> when <u>$name</u> is empty.

       Instead of $name you can also specify ${name} or $(name).

<b>command_expansion_filter</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b>
       Restrict the characters that the <a href="../man8/local.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/local"><b>local</b>(8)</a> delivery agent allows in $name expansions of  $mailbox_com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand.&nbsp;$mailbox_command.</font>
       mand.  Characters outside the allowed set are replaced by underscores.

<b>command_time_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1000s)</b>
       Time  limit for delivery to external commands. This limit is used by the <a href="../man8/local.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/local"><b>local</b>(8)</a> delivery agent, and
       is the default time limit for delivery by the <a href="../man8/pipe.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/pipe"><b>pipe</b>(8)</a> delivery agent.

       Note: if you set this time limit to a large value you must update the global ipc_timeout parameter as
       well.

<b>config_directory</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b>
       The  default location of the Postfix main.cf and master.cf configuration files. This can be overruled
       via the following mechanisms:

             The MAIL_CONFIG environment variable (daemon processes and commands).

             The "-c" command-line option (commands only).

       With Postfix command that run with set-gid privileges, a config_directory  override  requires  either
       root  privileges,  or  it requires that the directory is listed with the alternate_config_directories
       parameter in the default main.cf file.

<b>connection_cache_protocol_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>5s)</b>
       Time limit for connection cache connect, send or receive operations.  The time limit is  enforced  in
       the client.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>connection_cache_service</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>scache)</b>
       The  name of the <a href="../man8/scache.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/scache"><b>scache</b>(8)</a> connection cache service.  This service maintains a limited pool of cached
       sessions.

<b>connection_cache_status_update_time</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>600s)</b>
       How frequently the <a href="../man8/scache.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/scache"><b>scache</b>(8)</a> server logs usage statistics with connection cache hit  and  miss  rates
       for logical destinations and for physical endpoints.

<b>connection_cache_ttl_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>2s)</b>
       The maximal time-to-live value that the <a href="../man8/scache.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/scache"><b>scache</b>(8)</a> connection cache server allows. Requests that spec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ify&nbsp;specify</font>
       ify a larger TTL will be stored with the maximum allowed TTL. The purpose of this additional  control
       is  to  protect  the  infrastructure  against  careless  people.  The cache TTL is already bounded by
       $max_idle.

<b>content_filter</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       The name of a mail delivery transport that filters mail after it is queued.

       This parameter uses the same syntax as the right-hand side of a Postfix <a href="transport.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/transport"><b>transport</b>(5)</a> table. This set-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ting&nbsp;setting</font>
       ting  has  a lower precedence than a content filter that is specified with an <a href="access.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/access"><b>access</b>(5)</a> table or in a
       <a href="header_checks.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/header_checks"><b>header_checks</b>(5)</a> or <a href="body_checks.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/body_checks"><b>body_checks</b>(5)</a> table.

<b>daemon_directory</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b>
       The directory with Postfix support programs  and  daemon  programs.   These  should  not  be  invoked
       directly by humans. The directory must be owned by root.

<b>daemon_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>18000s)</b>
       How  much  time  a  Postfix  daemon process may take to handle a request before it is terminated by a
       built-in watchdog timer.

       Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default  time  unit  is  s
       (seconds).

<b>debug_peer_level</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>2)</b>
       The  increment  in  verbose  logging  level  when  a remote client or server matches a pattern in the
       debug_peer_list parameter.

<b>debug_peer_list</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Optional list of remote client or server hostname or network address patterns that cause the  verbose
       logging level to increase by the amount specified in $debug_peer_level.

       Specify  domain names, network/netmask patterns, "/file/name" patterns or "type:table" lookup tables.
       The right-hand side result from "type:table" lookups is ignored.

       Pattern matching of domain names is controlled by the parent_domain_matches_subdomains parameter.

       Examples:

       debug_peer_list = 127.0.0.1
       debug_peer_list = some.domain

<b>debugger_command</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       The external command to execute when a Postfix daemon program is invoked with the -D option.

       Use "command .. &amp; sleep 5" so that the debugger can attach before the process marches on. If you  use
       an  X-based debugger, be sure to set up your XAUTHORITY environment variable before starting Postfix.

       Example:

       debugger_command =
           PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin
           xxgdb $daemon_directory/$process_name $process_id &amp; sleep 5

<b>default_database_type</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b>
       The default database type for use in <a href="../man1/newaliases.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/newaliases"><b>newaliases</b>(1)</a>, <a href="../man1/postalias.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/postalias"><b>postalias</b>(1)</a> and  <a href="../man1/postmap.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/postmap"><b>postmap</b>(1)</a>  commands.  On  many
       UNIX  systems  the default type is either <b>dbm</b> or <b>hash</b>. The default setting is frozen when the Postfix
       system is built.

       Examples:

       default_database_type = hash

<b>default_delivery_slot_cost</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>5)</b>
       How often the Postfix queue manager's scheduler is allowed to preempt delivery of  one  message  with
       another.

       Each  transport maintains a so-called "available delivery slot counter" for each message. One message
       can be preempted by another one when the other message can be delivered using no more delivery  slots
       (i.e.,  invocations  of  delivery  agents)  than the current message counter has accumulated (or will
       eventually accumulate - see about slot loans below). This parameter controls how often is the counter
       incremented - it happens after each default_delivery_slot_cost recipients have been delivered.

       The  cost of 0 is used to disable the preempting scheduling completely.  The minimum value the sched-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">uling&nbsp;scheduling</font>
       uling algorithm can use is 2 - use it if you want to maximize the message throughput  rate.  Although
       there is no maximum, it doesn't make much sense to use values above say 50.

       The  only reason why the value of 2 is not the default is the way this parameter affects the delivery
       of mailing-list mail. In the worst case, their delivery can take somewhere between (cost+1/cost)  and
       (cost/cost-1)  times more than if the preemptive scheduler was disabled. The default value of 5 turns
       out to provide reasonable message response times while making sure the  mailing-list  deliveries  are
       not extended by more than 20-25 percent even in the worst case.

       Examples:

       default_delivery_slot_cost = 0
       default_delivery_slot_cost = 2

<b>default_delivery_slot_discount</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>50)</b>
       The default value for transport-specific _delivery_slot_discount settings.

       This  parameter  speeds  up the moment when a message preemption can happen. Instead of waiting until
       the full amount of delivery slots required is  available,  the  preemption  can  happen  when  trans-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">port_delivery_slot_discount&nbsp;transport_delivery_slot_discount</font>
       port_delivery_slot_discount  percent  of  the required amount plus transport_delivery_slot_loan still
       remains to be accumulated.  Note that the full amount  will  still  have  to  be  accumulated  before
       another preemption can take place later.

<b>default_delivery_slot_loan</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>3)</b>
       The default value for transport-specific _delivery_slot_loan settings.

       This  parameter  speeds  up the moment when a message preemption can happen. Instead of waiting until
       the full amount of delivery slots required is  available,  the  preemption  can  happen  when  trans-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">port_delivery_slot_discount&nbsp;transport_delivery_slot_discount</font>
       port_delivery_slot_discount  percent  of  the required amount plus transport_delivery_slot_loan still
       remains to be accumulated.  Note that the full amount  will  still  have  to  be  accumulated  before
       another preemption can take place later.

<b>default_destination_concurrency_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>20)</b>
       The default maximal number of parallel deliveries to the same destination.  This is the default limit
       for delivery via the <a href="../man8/lmtp.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/lmtp"><b>lmtp</b>(8)</a>, <a href="../man8/pipe.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/pipe"><b>pipe</b>(8)</a>, <a href="../man8/smtp.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/smtp"><b>smtp</b>(8)</a> and <a href="../man8/virtual.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/virtual"><b>virtual</b>(8)</a> delivery agents.

<b>default_destination_recipient_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>50)</b>
       The default maximal number of recipients per message delivery.  This is the default limit for  deliv-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ery&nbsp;delivery</font>
       ery via the <a href="../man8/lmtp.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/lmtp"><b>lmtp</b>(8)</a>, <a href="../man8/pipe.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/pipe"><b>pipe</b>(8)</a>, <a href="../man8/smtp.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/smtp"><b>smtp</b>(8)</a> and <a href="../man8/virtual.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/virtual"><b>virtual</b>(8)</a> delivery agents.

       Setting  this parameter to a value of 1 changes the meaning of the corresponding per-destination con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">currency&nbsp;concurrency</font>
       currency limit from concurrency per domain into concurrency per recipient.

<b>default_extra_recipient_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1000)</b>
       The default value for the extra per-transport limit imposed on the number  of  in-memory  recipients.
       This  extra recipient space is reserved for the cases when the Postfix queue manager's scheduler pre-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">empts&nbsp;preempts</font>
       empts one message with another and suddenly needs some extra recipients slots for the chosen  message
       in order to avoid performance degradation.

<b>default_minimum_delivery_slots</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>3)</b>
       How  many  recipients  a  message must have in order to invoke the Postfix queue manager's scheduling
       algorithm at all.  Messages which would never accumulate at least this many delivery  slots  (subject
       to slot cost parameter as well) are never preempted.

<b>default_privs</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>nobody)</b>
       The  default  rights  used  by  the <a href="../man8/local.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/local"><b>local</b>(8)</a> delivery agent for delivery to external file or command.
       These rights are used when delivery is requested from an <a href="aliases.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/aliases"><b>aliases</b>(5)</a> file that is owned  by  <b>root</b>,  or
       when delivery is done on behalf of <b>root</b>. <b>DO</b> <b>NOT</b> <b>SPECIFY</b> <b>A</b> <b>PRIVILEGED</b> <b>USER</b> <b>OR</b> <b>THE</b> <b>POSTFIX</b> <b>OWNER</b>.

<b>default_process_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>100)</b>
       The default maximal number of Postfix child processes that provide a given service. This limit can be
       overruled for specific services in the master.cf file.

<b>default_rbl_reply</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b>
       The default SMTP server response template for a request that is rejected by an RBL-based restriction.
       This template can be overruled by specific entries in the optional rbl_reply_maps lookup table.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

       The template is subject to exactly one level of $name substitution:

       <b>$client</b>
              The client hostname and IP address, formatted as name[address].

       <b>$client_address</b>
              The client IP address.

       <b>$client_name</b>
              The client hostname or "unknown". See reject_unknown_client_hostname for more details.

       <b>$reverse_client_name</b>
              The     client     hostname     from     address-&gt;name     lookup,    or    "unknown".     See
              reject_unknown_reverse_client_hostname for more details.

       <b>$helo_name</b>
              The hostname given in HELO or EHLO command or empty string.

       <b>$rbl_class</b>
              The blacklisted entity type: Client host, Helo command, Sender address, or Recipient  address.

       <b>$rbl_code</b>
              The  numerical  SMTP  response  code, as specified with the maps_rbl_reject_code configuration
              parameter. Note: The numerical SMTP response code is required, and must appear at the start of
              the  reply. With Postfix version 2.3 and later this information may be followed by an RFC 3463
              enhanced status code.

       <b>$rbl_domain</b>
              The RBL domain where $rbl_what is blacklisted.

       <b>$rbl_reason</b>
              The reason why $rbl_what is blacklisted, or an empty string.

       <b>$rbl_what</b>
              The entity that is blacklisted (an IP address, a hostname, a domain name, or an email  address
              whose domain was blacklisted).

       <b>$recipient</b>
              The recipient address or &lt;&gt; in case of the null address.

       <b>$recipient_domain</b>
              The recipient domain or empty string.

       <b>$recipient_name</b>
              The recipient address localpart or &lt;&gt; in case of null address.

       <b>$sender</b>
              The sender address or &lt;&gt; in case of the null address.

       <b>$sender_domain</b>
              The sender domain or empty string.

       <b>$sender_name</b>
              The sender address localpart or &lt;&gt; in case of the null address.

       <b>${name?text}</b>
              Expands to `text' if $name is not empty.

       <b>${name:text}</b>
              Expands to `text' if $name is empty.

       Instead of $name you can also specify ${name} or $(name).

       Note:  when an enhanced status code is specified in an RBL reply template, it is subject to modifica-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion.&nbsp;modification.</font>
       tion.  The following transformations are needed when the same RBL reply template is used for  client,
       helo, sender, or recipient access restrictions.

             When rejecting a sender address, the Postfix SMTP server will transform a recipient DSN status
              (e.g., 4.1.1-4.1.6) into the corresponding sender DSN status, and vice versa.

             When rejecting non-address information (such as the HELO command argument or the client  host-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">name/address),&nbsp;hostname/address),</font>
              name/address),  the Postfix SMTP server will transform a sender or recipient DSN status into a
              generic non-address DSN status (e.g., 4.0.0).

<b>default_recipient_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>20000)</b>
       The default per-transport upper limit on the number of in-memory recipients.  These limits take  pri-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ority&nbsp;priority</font>
       ority over the global qmgr_message_recipient_limit after the message has been assigned to the respec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tive&nbsp;respective</font>
       tive transports.  See also default_extra_recipient_limit and qmgr_message_recipient_minimum.

<b>default_recipient_refill_delay</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>5s)</b>
       The default per-transport maximum delay between recipients refills.  When not all message  recipients
       fit  into  the memory at once, keep loading more of them at least once every this many seconds.  This
       is used to make sure the  recipients  are  refilled  in  timely  manner  even  when  $default_recipi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ent_refill_limit&nbsp;$default_recipient_refill_limit</font>
       ent_refill_limit is too high for too slow deliveries.

<b>default_recipient_refill_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>100)</b>
       The  default  per-transport limit on the number of recipients refilled at once.  When not all message
       recipients fit into the memory at once, keep loading more of them in batches of at least this many at
       a  time.   See also $default_recipient_refill_delay, which may result in recipient batches lower than
       this when this limit is too high for too slow deliveries.

<b>default_transport</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>smtp)</b>
       The default mail delivery transport and next-hop destination  for  destinations  that  do  not  match
       $mydestination,    $inet_interfaces,    $proxy_interfaces,   $virtual_alias_domains,   $virtual_mail-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">box_domains,&nbsp;$virtual_mailbox_domains,</font>
       box_domains, or $relay_domains.  In order of decreasing precedence, the nexthop destination is  taken
       from  $default_transport, $sender_dependent_relayhost_maps, $relayhost, or from the recipient domain.
       This information can be overruled with the <a href="transport.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/transport"><b>transport</b>(5)</a> table.

       Specify a string of the form <u>transport:nexthop</u>, where <u>transport</u> is the name of a mail delivery trans-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">port&nbsp;transport</font>
       port  defined  in  master.cf.   The <u>:nexthop</u> part is optional.  For more details see the <a href="transport.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/transport"><b>transport</b>(5)</a>
       manual page.

       Example:

       default_transport = uucp:relayhostname

<b>default_verp_delimiters</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>+=)</b>
       The two default VERP delimiter characters. These are used when no explicit delimiters  are  specified
       with  the  SMTP  XVERP command or with the "<b>sendmail</b> <b>-V</b>" command-line option. Specify characters that
       are allowed by the verp_delimiter_filter setting.

       This feature is available in Postfix 1.1 and later.

<b>defer_code</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>450)</b>
       The numerical Postfix SMTP server response code when a remote SMTP client request is rejected by  the
       "defer" restriction.

       Do not change this unless you have a complete understanding of RFC 821.

<b>defer_service_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>defer)</b>
       The  name  of  the defer service. This service is implemented by the <a href="../man8/bounce.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/bounce"><b>bounce</b>(8)</a> daemon and maintains a
       record of failed delivery attempts and generates non-delivery notifications.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

<b>defer_transports</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       The names of message delivery transports that should not deliver mail unless someone issues "<b>sendmail</b>
       <b>-q</b>"  or  equivalent.  Specify zero or more names of mail delivery transports names that appear in the
       first field of master.cf.

       Example:

       defer_transports = smtp

<b>delay_logging_resolution_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>2)</b>
       The maximal number of digits after the decimal point when logging sub-second delay values.  Specify a
       number in the range 0..6.

       Large  delay  values are rounded off to an integral number seconds; delay values below the delay_log-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ging_resolution_limit&nbsp;delay_logging_resolution_limit</font>
       ging_resolution_limit are logged as "0", and small delay values are logged  with  at  most  two-digit
       precision.

       The format of the "delays=a/b/c/d" logging is as follows:

             a = time from message arrival to last active queue entry

             b = time from last active queue entry to connection setup

             c = time in connection setup, including DNS, EHLO and TLS

             d = time in message transmission

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>delay_notice_recipient</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>postmaster)</b>
       The  recipient  of postmaster notifications with the message headers of mail that cannot be delivered
       within $delay_warning_time time units.

       This feature is enabled with the delay_warning_time parameter.

<b>delay_warning_time</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>0h)</b>
       The time after which the sender receives the message headers of mail that is still queued.

       To enable this feature, specify a non-zero time value (an integral value plus an optional  one-letter
       suffix that specifies the time unit).

       Time  units:  s  (seconds),  m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit is h
       (hours).

<b>deliver_lock_attempts</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>20)</b>
       The maximal number of attempts to acquire an exclusive lock on a mailbox file or <a href="../man8/bounce.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/bounce"><b>bounce</b>(8)</a> logfile.

<b>deliver_lock_delay</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1s)</b>
       The time between attempts to acquire an exclusive lock on a mailbox file or <a href="../man8/bounce.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/bounce"><b>bounce</b>(8)</a> logfile.

       Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default  time  unit  is  s
       (seconds).

<b>disable_dns_lookups</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
       Disable DNS lookups in the Postfix SMTP and LMTP clients. When disabled, hosts are looked up with the
       getaddrinfo() system library routine which normally also looks in /etc/hosts.

       DNS lookups are enabled by default.

<b>disable_mime_input_processing</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
       Turn off MIME processing while receiving mail. This means that no special treatment is given to  Con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tent-Type:&nbsp;Content-Type:</font>
       tent-Type:  message  headers, and that all text after the initial message headers is considered to be
       part of the message body.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

       Mime input processing is enabled by default, and is needed in order to recognize MIME headers in mes-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sage&nbsp;message</font>
       sage content.

<b>disable_mime_output_conversion</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
       Disable  the conversion of 8BITMIME format to 7BIT format.  Mime output conversion is needed when the
       destination does not advertise 8BITMIME support.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

<b>disable_verp_bounces</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
       Disable sending one bounce report per recipient.

       The default, one per recipient, is what ezmlm needs.

       This feature is available in Postfix 1.1 and later.

<b>disable_vrfy_command</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
       Disable the SMTP VRFY command. This stops some techniques used to harvest email addresses.

       Example:

       disable_vrfy_command = no

<b>dont_remove</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>0)</b>
       Don't remove queue files and save them to the "saved" mail queue.   This  is  a  debugging  aid.   To
       inspect the envelope information and content of a Postfix queue file, use the <a href="../man1/postcat.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/postcat"><b>postcat</b>(1)</a> command.

<b>double_bounce_sender</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>double-bounce)</b>
       The  sender  address  of  postmaster notifications that are generated by the mail system. All mail to
       this address is silently discarded, in order to terminate mail bounce loops.

<b>duplicate_filter_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1000)</b>
       The maximal number of addresses remembered by the address duplicate filter  for  <a href="aliases.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/aliases"><b>aliases</b>(5)</a>  or  <a href="virtual.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/virtual"><b>vir</b></a>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tual(5)&nbsp;virtual(5)</font>
       <a href="virtual.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/virtual"><b>tual</b>(5)</a> alias expansion, or for <a href="../man8/showq.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/showq"><b>showq</b>(8)</a> queue displays.

<b>empty_address_recipient</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>MAILER-DAEMON)</b>
       The  recipient of mail addressed to the null address.  Postfix does not accept such addresses in SMTP
       commands, but they may still be created locally as the result of configuration or software error.

<b>enable_errors_to</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
       Report mail delivery errors to the address specified with the non-standard Errors-To: message header,
       instead  of  the envelope sender address (this feature is removed with Postfix version 2.2, is turned
       off by default with Postfix version 2.1, and is always turned on with older Postfix versions).

<b>enable_original_recipient</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b>
       Enable support for the X-Original-To message header. This header is needed for multi-recipient  mail-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">boxes.&nbsp;mailboxes.</font>
       boxes.

       When  this  parameter is set to yes, the <a href="../man8/cleanup.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/cleanup"><b>cleanup</b>(8)</a> daemon performs duplicate elimination on distinct
       pairs of (original recipient, rewritten recipient), and generates non-empty original recipient  queue
       file records.

       When this parameter is set to no, the <a href="../man8/cleanup.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/cleanup"><b>cleanup</b>(8)</a> daemon performs duplicate elimination on the rewrit-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ten&nbsp;rewritten</font>
       ten recipient address only, and generates empty original recipient queue file records.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later. With Postfix version 2.0, support for the X-Orig-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">inal-To&nbsp;X-Original-To</font>
       inal-To  message  header  is always turned on. Postfix versions before 2.0 have no support for the X-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">Original-To&nbsp;XOriginal-To</font>
       Original-To message header.

<b>error_notice_recipient</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>postmaster)</b>
       The recipient of postmaster notifications about mail delivery problems that  are  caused  by  policy,
       resource,  software  or  protocol  errors.   These  notifications are enabled with the notify_classes
       parameter.

<b>error_service_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>error)</b>
       The name of the <a href="../man8/error.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/error"><b>error</b>(8)</a> pseudo delivery agent. This service always returns mail as undeliverable.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

<b>execution_directory_expansion_filter</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b>
       Restrict the characters that the <a href="../man8/local.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/local"><b>local</b>(8)</a> delivery agent allows in $name expansions of  $command_exe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cution_directory.&nbsp;$command_execution_directory.</font>
       cution_directory.  Characters outside the allowed set are replaced by underscores.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>expand_owner_alias</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
       When  delivering to an alias "aliasname" that has an "owner-aliasname" companion alias, set the enve-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lope&nbsp;envelope</font>
       lope sender address to the expansion of the "owner-aliasname" alias. Normally, Postfix sets the enve-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lope&nbsp;envelope</font>
       lope sender address to the name of the "owner-aliasname" alias.

<b>export_environment</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b>
       The list of environment variables that a Postfix process will export to non-Postfix processes. The TZ
       variable is needed for sane time keeping on System-V-ish systems.

       Specify a list of names and/or name=value pairs, separated by whitespace  or  comma.  The  name=value
       form is supported with Postfix version 2.1 and later.

       Example:

       export_environment = TZ PATH=/bin:/usr/bin

<b>extract_recipient_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>10240)</b>
       The maximal number of recipient addresses that Postfix will extract from message headers when mail is
       submitted with "<b>sendmail</b> <b>-t</b>".

       This feature was removed in Postfix version 2.1.

<b>fallback_relay</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Optional list of relay hosts for SMTP destinations that can't be found or that are unreachable.  With
       Postfix 2.3 this parameter is renamed to smtp_fallback_relay.

       By  default, mail is returned to the sender when a destination is not found, and delivery is deferred
       when a destination is unreachable.

       The fallback relays must be SMTP  destinations.  Specify  a  domain,  host,  host:port,  [host]:port,
       [address] or [address]:port; the form [host] turns off MX lookups.  If you specify multiple SMTP des-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tinations,&nbsp;destinations,</font>
       tinations, Postfix will try them in the specified order.

       Note: before Postfix 2.2, do not use the fallback_relay feature when relaying mail for  a  backup  or
       primary  MX  domain. Mail would loop between the Postfix MX host and the fallback_relay host when the
       final destination is unavailable.

             In main.cf specify "relay_transport = relay",

             In master.cf specify "-o fallback_relay =" (i.e., empty) at the end of the relay entry.

             In transport maps, specify "relay:<u>nexthop...</u>"  as the right-hand side for backup or primary MX
              domain entries.

       Postfix  version 2.2 and later will not use the fallback_relay feature for destinations that it is MX
       host for.

<b>fallback_transport</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Optional message delivery transport that the <a href="../man8/local.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/local"><b>local</b>(8)</a> delivery agent should use for  names  that  are
       not found in the <a href="aliases.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/aliases"><b>aliases</b>(5)</a> or UNIX password database.

<b>fallback_transport_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Optional  lookup  tables  with  per-recipient  message  delivery  transports  for recipients that the
       <a href="../man8/local.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/local"><b>local</b>(8)</a> delivery agent could not find in the <a href="aliases.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/aliases"><b>aliases</b>(5)</a> or UNIX password database.

       For safety reasons, this feature does not allow $number substitutions in regular expression maps.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>fast_flush_domains</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$relay_domains)</b>
       Optional list of destinations that are eligible for per-destination logfiles with mail that is queued
       to those destinations.

       By  default,  Postfix  maintains  "fast  flush"  logfiles only for destinations that the Postfix SMTP
       server is willing to relay to (i.e. the default is: "fast_flush_domains =  $relay_domains";  see  the
       relay_domains parameter in the <b>postconf</b>(5) manual).

       Specify a list of hosts or domains, "/file/name" patterns or "type:table" lookup tables, separated by
       commas and/or whitespace.  Continue  long  lines  by  starting  the  next  line  with  whitespace.  A
       "/file/name"  pattern  is  replaced  by its contents; a "type:table" lookup table is matched when the
       domain or its parent domain appears as lookup key.

       Specify "fast_flush_domains =" (i.e., empty) to disable the feature altogether.

<b>fast_flush_purge_time</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>7d)</b>
       The time after which an empty per-destination "fast flush" logfile is deleted.

       You can specify the time as a number, or as a number followed by a letter  that  indicates  the  time
       unit: s=seconds, m=minutes, h=hours, d=days, w=weeks.  The default time unit is days.

<b>fast_flush_refresh_time</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>12h)</b>
       The  time  after  which  a  non-empty  but  unread  per-destination  "fast flush" logfile needs to be
       refreshed.  The contents of a logfile are refreshed by requesting delivery of all messages listed  in
       the logfile.

       You  can  specify  the  time as a number, or as a number followed by a letter that indicates the time
       unit: s=seconds, m=minutes, h=hours, d=days, w=weeks.  The default time unit is hours.

<b>fault_injection_code</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>0)</b>
       Force specific internal tests to fail, to test the handling of errors that are difficult to reproduce
       otherwise.

<b>flush_service_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>flush)</b>
       The name of the <a href="../man8/flush.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/flush"><b>flush</b>(8)</a> service. This service maintains per-destination logfiles with the queue file
       names of mail that is queued for those destinations.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

<b>fork_attempts</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>5)</b>
       The maximal number of attempts to fork() a child process.

<b>fork_delay</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1s)</b>
       The delay between attempts to fork() a child process.

       Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default  time  unit  is  s
       (seconds).

<b>forward_expansion_filter</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b>
       Restrict the characters that the <a href="../man8/local.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/local"><b>local</b>(8)</a> delivery agent allows in $name expansions of $forward_path.
       Characters outside the allowed set are replaced by underscores.

<b>forward_path</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b>
       The <a href="../man8/local.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/local"><b>local</b>(8)</a> delivery agent search list for finding a  .forward  file  with  user-specified  delivery
       methods. The first file that is found is used.

       The  following  $name  expansions  are  done  on forward_path before the search actually happens. The
       result of $name expansion is filtered with  the  character  set  that  is  specified  with  the  for-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ward_expansion_filter&nbsp;forward_expansion_filter</font>
       ward_expansion_filter parameter.

       <b>$user</b>  The recipient's username.

       <b>$shell</b> The recipient's login shell pathname.

       <b>$home</b>  The recipient's home directory.

       <b>$recipient</b>
              The full recipient address.

       <b>$extension</b>
              The optional recipient address extension.

       <b>$domain</b>
              The recipient domain.

       <b>$local</b> The entire recipient localpart.

       <b>$recipient_delimiter</b>
              The system-wide recipient address extension delimiter.

       <b>${name?value}</b>
              Expands to <u>value</u> when <u>$name</u> is non-empty.

       <b>${name:value}</b>
              Expands to <u>value</u> when <u>$name</u> is empty.

       Instead of $name you can also specify ${name} or $(name).

       Examples:

       forward_path = /var/forward/$user
       forward_path =
           /var/forward/$user/.forward$recipient_delimiter$extension,
           /var/forward/$user/.forward

<b>frozen_delivered_to</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b>
       Update the <a href="../man8/local.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/local"><b>local</b>(8)</a> delivery agent's idea of the Delivered-To: address (see prepend_delivered_header)
       only once, at the start of a delivery attempt; do not update the Delivered-To: address while  expand-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;expanding</font>
       ing aliases or .forward files.

       This  feature  is available in Postfix 2.3 and later. With older Postfix releases, the behavior is as
       if this parameter is set to "no". The old setting can be expensive  with  deeply  nested  aliases  or
       .forward  files.  When  an  alias  or .forward file changes the Delivered-To: address, it ties up one
       queue file and one cleanup process instance while mail is being forwarded.

<b>hash_queue_depth</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1)</b>
       The number of subdirectory levels for queue directories listed with the hash_queue_names parameter.

       After changing the hash_queue_names or  hash_queue_depth  parameter,  execute  the  command  "<b>postfix</b>
       <b>reload</b>".

<b>hash_queue_names</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>deferred,</b> <b>defer)</b>
       The names of queue directories that are split across multiple subdirectory levels.

       Before  Postfix version 2.2, the default list of hashed queues was significantly larger. Claims about
       improvements in file system technology suggest that hashing of the incoming and active queues  is  no
       longer needed. Fewer hashed directories speed up the time needed to restart Postfix.

       After  changing  the  hash_queue_names  or  hash_queue_depth  parameter, execute the command "<b>postfix</b>
       <b>reload</b>".

<b>header_address_token_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>10240)</b>
       The maximal number of address tokens are allowed in  an  address  message  header.  Information  that
       exceeds the limit is discarded.  The limit is enforced by the <a href="../man8/cleanup.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/cleanup"><b>cleanup</b>(8)</a> server.

<b>header_checks</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Optional  lookup  tables  for content inspection of primary non-MIME message headers, as specified in
       the <a href="header_checks.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/header_checks"><b>header_checks</b>(5)</a> manual page.

<b>header_size_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>102400)</b>
       The maximal amount of memory in bytes for storing a message header.   If  a  header  is  larger,  the
       excess is discarded.  The limit is enforced by the <a href="../man8/cleanup.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/cleanup"><b>cleanup</b>(8)</a> server.

<b>helpful_warnings</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b>
       Log warnings about problematic configuration settings, and provide helpful suggestions.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

<b>home_mailbox</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Optional pathname of a mailbox file relative to a <a href="../man8/local.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/local"><b>local</b>(8)</a> user's home directory.

       Specify a pathname ending in "/" for qmail-style delivery.

       The  precedence  of  <a href="../man8/local.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/local"><b>local</b>(8)</a>  delivery  features from high to low is: aliases, .forward files, mail-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">box_transport_maps,&nbsp;mailbox_transport_maps,</font>
       box_transport_maps,   mailbox_transport,   mailbox_command_maps,    mailbox_command,    home_mailbox,
       mail_spool_directory, fallback_transport_maps, fallback_transport and luser_relay.

       Examples:

       home_mailbox = Mailbox
       home_mailbox = Maildir/

<b>hopcount_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>50)</b>
       The  maximal  number  of Received:  message headers that is allowed in the primary message headers. A
       message that exceeds the limit is bounced, in order to stop a mailer loop.

<b>html_directory</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b>
       The location of Postfix HTML files that describe how to build, configure or operate a specific  Post-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fix&nbsp;Postfix</font>
       fix subsystem or feature.

<b>ignore_mx_lookup_error</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
       Ignore  DNS MX lookups that produce no response.  By default, the Postfix SMTP client defers delivery
       and tries again after some delay.  This behavior is required by the SMTP standard.

       Specify "ignore_mx_lookup_error = yes" to force a DNS A record lookup instead. This violates the SMTP
       standard and can result in mis-delivery of mail.

<b>import_environment</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b>
       The  list  of  environment  parameters  that  a Postfix process will import from a non-Postfix parent
       process. Examples of relevant parameters:

       <b>TZ</b>     Needed for sane time keeping on most System-V-ish systems.

       <b>DISPLAY</b>
              Needed for debugging Postfix daemons with an X-windows debugger.

       <b>XAUTHORITY</b>
              Needed for debugging Postfix daemons with an X-windows debugger.

       <b>MAIL_CONFIG</b>
              Needed to make "<b>postfix</b> <b>-c</b>" work.

       Specify a list of names and/or name=value pairs, separated by whitespace  or  comma.  The  name=value
       form is supported with Postfix version 2.1 and later.

<b>in_flow_delay</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1s)</b>
       Time  to  pause  before  accepting  a  new message, when the message arrival rate exceeds the message
       delivery rate. This feature is turned on by default (it's disabled on SCO UNIX due to an SCO bug).

       With the default 100 SMTP server process limit, "in_flow_delay = 1s" limits the mail  inflow  to  100
       messages per second above the number of messages delivered per second.

       Specify 0 to disable the feature. Valid delays are 0..10.

<b>inet_interfaces</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>all)</b>
       The network interface addresses that this mail system receives mail on. Specify "all" to receive mail
       on all network interfaces (default), and "loopback-only" to receive mail on loopback  network  inter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">faces&nbsp;interfaces</font>
       faces  only  (Postfix  version  2.2  and  later).   The  parameter  also controls delivery of mail to
       user@[ip.address].

       Note 1: you need to stop and start Postfix when this parameter changes.

       Note 2: address information may be enclosed inside [], but this form is not required here.

       When inet_interfaces specifies just one IPv4 and/or IPv6 address that is not a loopback address,  the
       Postfix  SMTP  client  will  use this address as the IP source address for outbound mail. Support for
       IPv6 is available in Postfix version 2.2 and later.

       On a multi-homed firewall with separate Postfix instances listening on  the  "inside"  and  "outside"
       interfaces,  this  can  prevent each instance from being able to reach servers on the "other side" of
       the firewall. Setting smtp_bind_address to 0.0.0.0 avoids the potential problem for IPv4, and setting
       smtp_bind_address6 to :: solves the problem for IPv6.

       A  better  solution  for  multi-homed  firewalls is to leave inet_interfaces at the default value and
       instead use explicit IP addresses in the master.cf SMTP server definitions.  This preserves the Post-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fix&nbsp;Postfix</font>
       fix  SMTP client's loop detection, by ensuring that each side of the firewall knows that the other IP
       address is still the same host. Setting $inet_interfaces to a single IPv4 and/or IPV6 address is pri-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">marily&nbsp;primarily</font>
       marily  useful with virtual hosting of domains on secondary IP addresses, when each IP address serves
       a different domain (and has a different $myhostname setting).

       See also the proxy_interfaces parameter, for network addresses that are forwarded to Postfix  by  way
       of a proxy or address translator.

       Examples:

       inet_interfaces = all (DEFAULT)
       inet_interfaces = loopback-only (Postfix version 2.2 and later)
       inet_interfaces = 127.0.0.1
       inet_interfaces = 127.0.0.1, [::1] (Postfix version 2.2 and later)
       inet_interfaces = 192.168.1.2, 127.0.0.1

<b>inet_protocols</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>ipv4)</b>
       The  Internet protocols Postfix will attempt to use when making or accepting connections. Specify one
       or more of "ipv4" or "ipv6", separated by whitespace or commas.  The  form  "all"  is  equivalent  to
       "ipv4, ipv6" or "ipv4", depending on whether the operating system implements IPv6.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

       Note: you MUST stop and start Postfix after changing this parameter.

       On systems that pre-date IPV6_V6ONLY support (RFC 3493), an IPv6 server will also accept IPv4 connec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tions,&nbsp;connections,</font>
       tions, even when IPv4 is turned off with the inet_protocols parameter.  On systems  with  IPV6_V6ONLY
       support,  Postfix  will use separate server sockets for IPv6 and IPv4, and each will accept only con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nections&nbsp;connections</font>
       nections for the corresponding protocol.

       When IPv4 support is enabled via the inet_protocols parameter, Postfix will  to  DNS  type  A  record
       lookups,  and  will  convert IPv4-in-IPv6 client IP addresses (::ffff:1.2.3.4) to their original IPv4
       form (1.2.3.4).  The latter is needed on hosts that pre-date IPV6_V6ONLY support (RFC 3493).

       When IPv6 support is enabled via the inet_protocols parameter, Postfix will do DNS type  AAAA  record
       lookups.

       When both IPv4 and IPv6 support are enabled, the Postfix SMTP client will attempt to connect via IPv6
       before attempting to use IPv4.

       Examples:

       inet_protocols = ipv4 (DEFAULT)
       inet_protocols = all
       inet_protocols = ipv6
       inet_protocols = ipv4, ipv6

<b>initial_destination_concurrency</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>5)</b>
       The initial per-destination concurrency level for parallel delivery to  the  same  destination.  This
       limit applies to delivery via <a href="../man8/smtp.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/smtp"><b>smtp</b>(8)</a>, and via the <a href="../man8/pipe.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/pipe"><b>pipe</b>(8)</a> and <a href="../man8/virtual.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/virtual"><b>virtual</b>(8)</a> delivery agents.

       Warning: with concurrency of 1, one bad message can be enough to block all mail to a site.

<b>internal_mail_filter_classes</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       What  categories  of  Postfix-generated  mail  are  subject  to  before-queue  content  inspection by
       non_smtpd_milters, header_checks and body_checks.  Specify zero or more of the  following,  separated
       by whitespace or comma.

       <b>bounce</b> Inspect the content of delivery status notifications.

       <b>notify</b> Inspect the content of postmaster notifications by the <a href="../man8/smtp.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/smtp"><b>smtp</b>(8)</a> and <a href="../man8/smtpd.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/smtpd"><b>smtpd</b>(8)</a> processes.

       NOTE:  It's  generally not safe to enable content inspection of Postfix-generated email messages. The
       user is warned.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>invalid_hostname_reject_code</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>501)</b>
       The numerical Postfix SMTP server response code when the client HELO or  EHLO  command  parameter  is
       rejected by the reject_invalid_helo_hostname restriction.

       Do not change this unless you have a complete understanding of RFC 821.

<b>ipc_idle</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>version</b> <b>dependent)</b>
       The time after which a client closes an idle internal communication channel.  The purpose is to allow
       servers to terminate voluntarily after they become idle. This is used, for example,  by  the  address
       resolving and rewriting clients.

       With Postfix 2.4 the default value was reduced from 100s to 5s.

       Time  units:  s  (seconds),  m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit is s
       (seconds).

<b>ipc_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>3600s)</b>
       The time limit for sending or receiving information over an internal communication channel.  The pur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pose&nbsp;purpose</font>
       pose is to break out of deadlock situations. If the time limit is exceeded the software aborts with a
       fatal error.

       Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default  time  unit  is  s
       (seconds).

<b>ipc_ttl</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1000s)</b>
       The  time  after  which  a client closes an active internal communication channel.  The purpose is to
       allow servers to terminate voluntarily after reaching their client limit.  This is used, for example,
       by the address resolving and rewriting clients.

       Time  units:  s  (seconds),  m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit is s
       (seconds).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>line_length_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>2048)</b>
       Upon input, long lines are chopped up into pieces of at most this length; upon delivery,  long  lines
       are reconstructed.

<b>lmtp_bind_address</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       The LMTP-specific version of the smtp_bind_address configuration parameter.  See there for details.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>lmtp_bind_address6</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       The  LMTP-specific version of the smtp_bind_address6 configuration parameter.  See there for details.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>lmtp_cache_connection</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b>
       Keep Postfix LMTP client connections open for up to $max_idle seconds. When the LMTP client  receives
       a request for the same connection the connection is reused.

       The  effectiveness of cached connections will be determined by the number of LMTP servers in use, and
       the concurrency limit specified for the LMTP client. Cached connections are closed under any  of  the
       following conditions:

             The LMTP client idle time limit is reached.  This limit is specified with the Postfix max_idle
              configuration parameter.

             A delivery request specifies a different destination than the one currently cached.

             The per-process limit on the number of delivery requests is reached.  This limit is  specified
              with the Postfix max_use configuration parameter.

             Upon  the  onset of another delivery request, the LMTP server associated with the current ses-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion&nbsp;session</font>
              sion does not respond to the RSET command.

       Most of these limitations will be removed after Postfix implements a connection cache that is  shared
       among multiple LMTP client programs.

<b>lmtp_cname_overrides_servername</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b>
       The  LMTP-specific version of the smtp_cname_overrides_servername configuration parameter.  See there
       for details.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>lmtp_connect_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>0s)</b>
       The LMTP client time limit for completing a TCP connection, or zero (use the operating system  built-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">in&nbsp;builtin</font>
       in  time  limit).  When no connection can be made within the deadline, the LMTP client tries the next
       address on the mail exchanger list.

       Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default  time  unit  is  s
       (seconds).

       Example:

       lmtp_connect_timeout = 30s

<b>lmtp_connection_cache_destinations</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       The  LMTP-specific  version  of  the smtp_connection_cache_destinations configuration parameter.  See
       there for details.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>lmtp_connection_cache_on_demand</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b>
       The LMTP-specific version of the smtp_connection_cache_on_demand configuration parameter.  See  there
       for details.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>lmtp_connection_cache_time_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>2s)</b>
       The LMTP-specific version of the smtp_connection_cache_time_limit configuration parameter.  See there

       mands are executed directly; commands are given to given to /bin/sh only when they contain shell meta
       characters or shell built-in commands.

       "sendmail's restricted shell" (smrsh) is what most people will use in order to restrict what programs
       can be run from e.g. .forward files (smrsh is part of the Sendmail distribution).

       Note: when a shell program is specified, it is invoked even when the command contains no shell built-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">in&nbsp;builtin</font>

       manager. The message delivery transport name is the first field in the entry in the master.cf file.

       A low limit of 2 is recommended, just in case someone has an expensive shell command  in  a  .forward
       file  or in an alias (e.g., a mailing list manager).  You don't want to run lots of those at the same
       time.

<b>local_destination_recipient_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1)</b>
       The maximal number of recipients per message delivery via the local  mail  delivery  transport.  This

       remote_header_rewrite_domain parameter.

       See the append_at_myorigin and append_dot_mydomain parameters for details of  how  domain  names  are
       appended to incomplete addresses.

       Specify a list of zero or more of the following:

       <b>permit_inet_interfaces</b>
              Append  the  domain  name  in  $myorigin  or  $mydomain  when  the  client  IP address matches

       <b>permit_mynetworks</b>
              Append the domain name in $myorigin or $mydomain when the client IP address matches  any  net-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">work&nbsp;network</font>
              work  or  network  address  listed  in  $mynetworks. This setting will not prevent remote mail
              header address rewriting when mail from a remote client is forwarded by a neighboring  system.

        <b>permit_sasl_authenticated</b>
              Append the domain name in $myorigin or $mydomain when the client is successfully authenticated
              via the RFC 2554 (AUTH) protocol.

              able for, e.g., pop-before-smtp lookup tables.

       Examples:

       The  Postfix &lt; 2.2 backwards compatible setting: always rewrite message headers, and always append my
       own domain to incomplete header addresses.

           local_header_rewrite_clients = static:all

       The purist (and default) setting: rewrite headers only in mail from Postfix sendmail and in SMTP mail
       from this machine.

           local_header_rewrite_clients = permit_inet_interfaces

       The intermediate setting: rewrite header addresses and append $myorigin or $mydomain information only
       with mail from Postfix sendmail, from local clients, or from authorized SMTP clients.

       Note: this setting will not prevent remote mail header address rewriting  when  mail  from  a  remote
       client is forwarded by a neighboring system.

           local_header_rewrite_clients = permit_mynetworks,
               permit_sasl_authenticated permit_tls_clientcerts

<b>local_recipient_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>proxy:unix:passwd.byname</b> <b>$alias_maps)</b>
       Lookup  tables with all names or addresses of local recipients: a recipient address is local when its
       domain matches $mydestination, $inet_interfaces or $proxy_interfaces.  Specify @domain as a wild-card
       for  domains that do not have a valid recipient list.  Technically, tables listed with $local_recipi-
       ent_maps are used as lists: Postfix needs to know only if a lookup string is found  or  not,  but  it
       does not use the result from table lookup.

       If  this  parameter  is  non-empty  (the  default), then the Postfix SMTP server will reject mail for
       unknown local users.

       To turn off local recipient checking in the Postfix SMTP  server,  specify  "local_recipient_maps  ="
       (i.e. empty).

       The default setting assumes that you use the default Postfix local delivery agent for local delivery.
       You need to update the local_recipient_maps setting if:

             You redefine the local delivery agent in master.cf.

             You redefine the "local_transport" setting in main.cf.

             You use the "luser_relay", "mailbox_transport", or "fallback_transport" feature of the Postfix
              <a href="../man8/local.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/local"><b>local</b>(8)</a> delivery agent.

       Details are described in the LOCAL_RECIPIENT_README file.

       Beware:  if  the  Postfix SMTP server runs chrooted, you need to access the passwd file via the <a href="../man8/proxymap.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/proxymap"><b>prox</b></a>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ymap(8)&nbsp;proxymap(8)</font>
       <a href="../man8/proxymap.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/proxymap"><b>ymap</b>(8)</a> service, in order to overcome chroot access restrictions. The alternative, maintaining a copy
       of the system password file in the chroot jail is not practical.

       Examples:

       local_recipient_maps =

<b>local_transport</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>local:$myhostname)</b>
       The  default  mail  delivery  transport and next-hop destination for final delivery to domains listed
       with mydestination, and for [ipaddress] destinations that  match  $inet_interfaces  or  $proxy_inter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">faces.&nbsp;$proxy_interfaces.</font>
       faces.  This information can be overruled with the <a href="transport.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/transport"><b>transport</b>(5)</a> table.

       By default, local mail is delivered to the transport called "local", which is just the name of a ser-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">vice&nbsp;service</font>
       vice that is defined the master.cf file.

       Specify a string of the form <u>transport:nexthop</u>, where <u>transport</u> is the name of a mail delivery trans-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">port&nbsp;transport</font>
       port  defined  in  master.cf.   The <u>:nexthop</u> part is optional.  For more details see the <a href="transport.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/transport"><b>transport</b>(5)</a>
       manual page.

       Beware: if you override the default local delivery agent then you need to  review  the  LOCAL_RECIPI-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ENT_README&nbsp;LOCAL_RECIPIENT_README</font>
       ENT_README document, otherwise the SMTP server may reject mail for local recipients.

<b>luser_relay</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Optional catch-all destination for unknown <a href="../man8/local.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/local"><b>local</b>(8)</a> recipients.  By default, mail for unknown recipi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ents&nbsp;recipients</font>
       ents in domains that match $mydestination, $inet_interfaces or $proxy_interfaces is returned as unde-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">liverable.&nbsp;undeliverable.</font>
       liverable.

       The following $name expansions are done on luser_relay:

       <b>$domain</b>
              The recipient domain.

       <b>$extension</b>
              The recipient address extension.

       <b>$home</b>  The recipient's home directory.

       <b>$local</b> The entire recipient address localpart.

       <b>$recipient</b>
              The full recipient address.

       <b>$recipient_delimiter</b>
              The system-wide recipient address extension delimiter.

       <b>$shell</b> The recipient's login shell.

       <b>$user</b>  The recipient username.

       <b>${name?value}</b>
              Expands to <u>value</u> when <u>$name</u> has a non-empty value.

       <b>${name:value}</b>
              Expands to <u>value</u> when <u>$name</u> has an empty value.

       Instead of $name you can also specify ${name} or $(name).

       Note: luser_relay works only for the Postfix <a href="../man8/local.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/local"><b>local</b>(8)</a> delivery agent.

       Note:  if  you  use  this  feature  for accounts not in the UNIX password file, then you must specify
       "local_recipient_maps =" (i.e. empty) in the main.cf file, otherwise the  Postfix  SMTP  server  will
       reject mail for non-UNIX accounts with "User unknown in local recipient table".

       Examples:

       luser_relay = $user@other.host
       luser_relay = $local@other.host
       luser_relay = admin+$local

<b>mail_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>Postfix)</b>
       The  mail  system  name  that  is displayed in Received: headers, in the SMTP greeting banner, and in
       bounced mail.

<b>mail_owner</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>postfix)</b>
       The UNIX system account that owns the Postfix queue and most Postfix daemon processes.   Specify  the
       name  of  a user account that does not share a group with other accounts and that owns no other files
       or processes on the system.  In particular, don't specify nobody or daemon.  PLEASE USE  A  DEDICATED
       USER ID AND GROUP ID.

       When  this parameter value is changed you need to re-run "<b>postfix</b> <b>set-permissions</b>" (with Postfix ver-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion&nbsp;version</font>
       sion 2.0 and earlier: "<b>/etc/postfix/post-install</b> <b>set-permissions</b>".

<b>mail_release_date</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b>
       The Postfix release date, in "YYYYMMDD" format.

<b>mail_spool_directory</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b>
       The directory where <a href="../man8/local.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/local"><b>local</b>(8)</a> UNIX-style mailboxes are kept. The default setting depends on the system
       type. Specify a name ending in / for maildir-style delivery.

       Note:   maildir   delivery   is  done  with  the  privileges  of  the  recipient.   If  you  use  the
       mail_spool_directory setting for maildir style delivery, then you must create the  top-level  maildir
       directory in advance. Postfix will not create it.

       Examples:

       mail_spool_directory = /var/mail
       mail_spool_directory = /var/spool/mail

<b>mail_version</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b>
       The  version  of  the  mail  system.  Stable  releases are named <u>major</u>.<u>minor</u>.<u>patchlevel</u>. Experimental
       releases also include the release date. The version string can be used  in,  for  example,  the  SMTP
       greeting banner.

<b>mailbox_command</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Optional external command that the <a href="../man8/local.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/local"><b>local</b>(8)</a> delivery agent should use for mailbox delivery.  The com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
       mand is run with the user ID and the primary group ID privileges of the recipient.   Exception:  com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
       mand  delivery  for  root executes with $default_privs privileges.  This is not a problem, because 1)
       mail for root should always be aliased to a real user and 2) don't log in as root, use "su"  instead.

       The following environment variables are exported to the command:

       <b>CLIENT_ADDRESS</b>
              Remote client network address. Available in Postfix version 2.2 and later.

       <b>CLIENT_HELO</b>
              Remote client EHLO command parameter. Available in Postfix version 2.2 and later.

       <b>CLIENT_HOSTNAME</b>
              Remote client hostname. Available in Postfix version 2.2 and later.

       <b>CLIENT_PROTOCOL</b>
              Remote client protocol. Available in Postfix version 2.2 and later.

       <b>DOMAIN</b> The domain part of the recipient address.

       <b>EXTENSION</b>
              The optional address extension.

       <b>HOME</b>   The recipient home directory.

       <b>LOCAL</b>  The recipient address localpart.

       <b>LOGNAME</b>
              The recipient's username.

       <b>RECIPIENT</b>
              The full recipient address.

       <b>SASL_METHOD</b>
              SASL  authentication  method specified in the remote client AUTH command. Available in Postfix
              version 2.2 and later.

       <b>SASL_SENDER</b>
              SASL sender address specified in the remote client MAIL FROM  command.  Available  in  Postfix
              version 2.2 and later.

       <b>SASL_USER</b>
              SASL  username  specified in the remote client AUTH command.  Available in Postfix version 2.2
              and later.

       <b>SENDER</b> The full sender address.

       <b>SHELL</b>  The recipient's login shell.

       <b>USER</b>   The recipient username.

       Unlike other Postfix configuration parameters, the mailbox_command  parameter  is  not  subjected  to
       $name substitutions. This is to make it easier to specify shell syntax (see example below).

       If  you  can,  avoid  shell meta characters because they will force Postfix to run an expensive shell
       process. If you're delivering via Procmail then running a shell won't make a noticeable difference in
       the total cost.

       Note:  if  you  use the mailbox_command feature to deliver mail system-wide, you must set up an alias
       that forwards mail for root to a real user.

       The precedence of <a href="../man8/local.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/local"><b>local</b>(8)</a> delivery features from high to low  is:  aliases,  .forward  files,  mail-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">box_transport_maps,&nbsp;mailbox_transport_maps,</font>

<b>mailbox_delivery_lock</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b>
       How  to  lock a UNIX-style <a href="../man8/local.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/local"><b>local</b>(8)</a> mailbox before attempting delivery.  For a list of available file
       locking methods, use the "<b>postconf</b> <b>-l</b>" command.

       This setting is ignored with <b>maildir</b>  style  delivery,  because  such  deliveries  are  safe  without
       explicit locks.

       Note: The <b>dotlock</b> method requires that the recipient UID or GID has write access to the parent direc-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tory&nbsp;directory</font>
       tory of the mailbox file.

       Note: the default setting of this parameter is system dependent.

<b>mailbox_size_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>51200000)</b>
       The maximal size of any <a href="../man8/local.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/local"><b>local</b>(8)</a> individual mailbox or maildir file, or zero (no  limit).   In  fact,
       this  limits  the size of any file that is written to upon local delivery, including files written by
       external commands that are executed by the <a href="../man8/local.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/local"><b>local</b>(8)</a> delivery agent.

       This limit must not be smaller than the message size limit.

<b>mailbox_transport</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Optional message delivery transport that the <a href="../man8/local.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/local"><b>local</b>(8)</a> delivery agent should use for mailbox  delivery
       to all local recipients, whether or not they are found in the UNIX passwd database.

<b>mailbox_transport_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Optional  lookup  tables  with  per-recipient message delivery transports to use for <a href="../man8/local.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/local"><b>local</b>(8)</a> mailbox
       delivery, whether or not the recipients are found in the UNIX passwd database.

       For safety reasons, this feature does not allow $number substitutions in regular expression maps.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>mailq_path</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b>
       Sendmail compatibility feature that specifies where the Postfix <a href="../man1/mailq.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/mailq"><b>mailq</b>(1)</a> command is  installed.  This
       command can be used to list the Postfix mail queue.

<b>manpage_directory</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b>
       Where the Postfix manual pages are installed.

<b>maps_rbl_domains</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Obsolete feature: use the reject_rbl_client feature instead.

<b>maps_rbl_reject_code</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>554)</b>
       The  numerical  Postfix SMTP server response code when a remote SMTP client request is blocked by the
       reject_rbl_client, reject_rhsbl_client, reject_rhsbl_sender or reject_rhsbl_recipient restriction.

       Do not change this unless you have a complete understanding of RFC 821.

<b>masquerade_classes</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>envelope_sender,</b> <b>header_sender,</b> <b>header_recipient)</b>
       What addresses are subject to address masquerading.

       By default, address masquerading is limited to envelope sender addresses, and to  header  sender  and
       header  recipient  addresses.   This  allows  you to use address masquerading on a mail gateway while
       still being able to forward mail to users on individual machines.

       Specify zero or more of: envelope_sender, envelope_recipient, header_sender, header_recipient

<b>masquerade_domains</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Optional list of domains whose subdomain structure will be stripped off in email addresses.

       The list is processed left to right, and processing stops at the first match.  Thus,

           masquerade_domains = foo.example.com example.com

       strips     "user@any.thing.foo.example.com"      to      "user@foo.example.com",      but      strips
       "user@any.thing.else.example.com" to "user@example.com".

       A domain name prefixed with ! means do not masquerade this domain or its subdomains. Thus,

           masquerade_domains = !foo.example.com example.com

       does    not   change   "user@any.thing.foo.example.com"   or   "user@foo.example.com",   but   strips
       "user@any.thing.else.example.com" to "user@example.com".

       Note: with Postfix version 2.2, message header address masquerading happens only when message  header
       address rewriting is enabled:

             The message is received with the Postfix <a href="../man1/sendmail.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/sendmail"><b>sendmail</b>(1)</a> command,

             The message is received from a network client that matches $local_header_rewrite_clients,

             The message is received from the network, and the remote_header_rewrite_domain parameter spec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ifies&nbsp;specifies</font>
              ifies a non-empty value.

       To get the behavior before Postfix version 2.2, specify "local_header_rewrite_clients =  static:all".

       Example:

       masquerade_domains = $mydomain

<b>masquerade_exceptions</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Optional  list  of user names that are not subjected to address masquerading, even when their address
       matches $masquerade_domains.

       By default, address masquerading makes no exceptions.

       Specify a list of user names, "/file/name" or  "type:table"  patterns,  separated  by  commas  and/or
       whitespace.  The  list  is  matched  left  to  right,  and  the  search  stops  on the first match. A
       "/file/name" pattern is replaced by its contents; a "type:table" lookup table is matched when a  name
       matches  a  lookup key (the lookup result is ignored).  Continue long lines by starting the next line
       with whitespace. Specify "!pattern" to exclude a name from the list. The form "!/file/name"  is  sup-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ported&nbsp;supported</font>
       ported only in Postfix version 2.4 and later.

       Examples:

       masquerade_exceptions = root, mailer-daemon
       masquerade_exceptions = root

<b>max_idle</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>100s)</b>
       The  maximum  amount  of  time  that  an idle Postfix daemon process waits for an incoming connection
       before terminating voluntarily.  This parameter is ignored by the Postfix queue manager and by  other
       long-lived Postfix daemon processes.

       Time  units:  s  (seconds),  m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit is s
       (seconds).

<b>max_use</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>100)</b>
       The maximal number of incoming connections that a Postfix daemon process will service  before  termi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nating&nbsp;terminating</font>
       nating  voluntarily.   This parameter is ignored by the Postfix queue manager and by other long-lived
       Postfix daemon processes.

<b>maximal_backoff_time</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>4000s)</b>
       The maximal time between attempts to deliver a deferred message.

       This parameter should be set to a value greater than or  equal  to  $minimal_backoff_time.  See  also
       $queue_run_delay.

       Time  units:  s  (seconds),  m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit is s
       (seconds).

<b>maximal_queue_lifetime</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>5d)</b>
       The maximal time a message is queued before it is sent back as undeliverable.

       Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default  time  unit  is  d
       (days).

       Specify 0 when mail delivery should be tried only once.

<b>message_reject_characters</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       The set of characters that Postfix will reject in message content.  The usual C-like escape sequences
       are recognized: \a \b \f \n \r \t \v \<u>ddd</u> (up to three octal digits) and \\.

       Example:

       message_reject_characters = \0

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>message_size_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>10240000)</b>
       The maximal size in bytes of a message, including envelope information.

<b>message_strip_characters</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       The set of characters that Postfix will  remove  from  message  content.   The  usual  C-like  escape
       sequences are recognized: \a \b \f \n \r \t \v \<u>ddd</u> (up to three octal digits) and \\.

       Example:

       message_strip_characters = \0

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>milter_command_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>30s)</b>
       The  time  limit for sending an SMTP command to a Milter (mail filter) application, and for receiving
       the response.

       Specify a non-zero time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter  suffix  that  specifies
       the time unit).

       Time  units:  s  (seconds),  m  (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks). The default time unit is s
       (seconds).

<b>mime_header_checks</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$header_checks)</b>
       Optional  lookup  tables  for content inspection of MIME related message headers, as described in the
       <a href="header_checks.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/header_checks"><b>header_checks</b>(5)</a> manual page.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

<b>mime_nesting_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>100)</b>

<b>minimal_backoff_time</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>300s)</b>
       The  minimal  time  between  attempts to deliver a deferred message; prior to Postfix 2.4 the default
       value was 1000s.

       This parameter also limits the time an unreachable destination is kept in the short-term,  in-memory,
       destination status cache.

       This  parameter  should  be  set  greater  than or equal to $queue_run_delay. See also $maximal_back-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">off_time.&nbsp;$maximal_backoff_time.</font>
       off_time.

       Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default  time  unit  is  s
       (seconds).

<b>multi_recipient_bounce_reject_code</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>550)</b>
       The  numerical  Postfix SMTP server response code when a remote SMTP client request is blocked by the
       reject_multi_recipient_bounce restriction.

       Do not change this unless you have a complete understanding of RFC 821.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>mydestination</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$myhostname,</b> <b>localhost.$mydomain,</b> <b>localhost)</b>
       The list of domains that are delivered via the $local_transport mail delivery transport.  By  default
       this  is  the  Postfix  <a href="../man8/local.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/local"><b>local</b>(8)</a>  delivery  agent  which  looks  up all recipients in /etc/passwd and
       /etc/aliases. The SMTP server validates recipient addresses with  $local_recipient_maps  and  rejects
       non-existent recipients. See also the local domain class in the ADDRESS_CLASS_README file.

       The  default  mydestination value specifies names for the local machine only.  On a mail domain gate-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">way,&nbsp;gateway,</font>
       way, you should also include $mydomain.

       The   $local_transport   delivery   method   is    also    selected    for    mail    addressed    to
       user@[the.net.work.address]  of  the mail system (the IP addresses specified with the inet_interfaces
       and proxy_interfaces parameters).

       Warnings:

             Do not specify the names of virtual domains - those domains are specified elsewhere. See  VIR-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">TUAL_README&nbsp;VIRTUAL_README</font>
              TUAL_README for more information.

             Do not specify the names of domains that this machine is backup MX host for. See STANDARD_CON-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">FIGURATION_README&nbsp;STANDARD_CONFIGURATION_README</font>
              FIGURATION_README for how to set up backup MX hosts.

             By default, the  Postfix  SMTP  server  rejects  mail  for  recipients  not  listed  with  the
              local_recipient_maps  parameter.   See  the  <b>postconf</b>(5)  manual  for  a  description  of  the
              local_recipient_maps and unknown_local_recipient_reject_code parameters.

       Specify a list of host or domain names, "/file/name" or "type:table" patterns,  separated  by  commas
       and/or whitespace. A "/file/name" pattern is replaced by its contents; a "type:table" lookup table is
       matched when a name matches a lookup key (the lookup result is  ignored).   Continue  long  lines  by
       starting the next line with whitespace.

       Examples:

       mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain $mydomain
       mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain www.$mydomain, ftp.$mydomain

<b>mydomain</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b>
       The internet domain name of this mail system.  The default is to use $myhostname minus the first com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ponent.&nbsp;component.</font>
       ponent.  $mydomain is used as a default value for many other configuration parameters.

       Example:

       mydomain = domain.tld

<b>myhostname</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b>
       The internet hostname of this mail system. The default is to use the fully-qualified domain name from
       gethostname(). $myhostname is used as a default value for many other configuration parameters.

       Example:

       myhostname = host.domain.tld

<b>mynetworks</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b>
       The list of "trusted" SMTP clients that have more privileges than "strangers".

       In  particular,  "trusted"  SMTP  clients  are  allowed  to  relay  mail  through  Postfix.   See the
       smtpd_recipient_restrictions parameter description in the <b>postconf</b>(5) manual.

       You can specify the list of "trusted" network addresses by hand or you can let Postfix do it for  you
       (which  is the default).  See the description of the mynetworks_style parameter for more information.

       If you specify the mynetworks list by hand, Postfix ignores the mynetworks_style setting.

       Specify a list of network addresses or network/netmask patterns, separated by  commas  and/or  white-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">space.&nbsp;whitespace.</font>
       space. Continue long lines by starting the next line with whitespace.

       The netmask specifies the number of bits in the network part of a host address.  You can also specify
       "/file/name" or "type:table" patterns.  A  "/file/name"  pattern  is  replaced  by  its  contents;  a
       "type:table" lookup table is matched when a table entry matches a lookup string (the lookup result is
       ignored).

       The list is matched left to right, and the search stops on the first match.   Specify  "!pattern"  to
       exclude  an address or network block from the list. The form "!/file/name" is supported only in Post-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fix&nbsp;Postfix</font>
       fix version 2.4 and later.

       Note: IP version 6 address information must be specified inside [] in the mynetworks  value,  and  in
       files  specified with "/file/name".  IP version 6 addresses contain the ":" character, and would oth-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">erwise&nbsp;otherwise</font>
       erwise be confused with a "type:table" pattern.

       Examples:

       mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8 168.100.189.0/28
       mynetworks = !192.168.0.1, 192.168.0.0/28
       mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8 168.100.189.0/28 [::1]/128 [2001:240:587::]/64
       mynetworks = $config_directory/mynetworks
       mynetworks = hash:/etc/postfix/network_table

<b>mynetworks_style</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>subnet)</b>
       The method to generate the default value for the mynetworks parameter.  This is the list  of  trusted
       networks for relay access control etc.

             Specify "mynetworks_style = host" when Postfix should "trust" only the local machine.

             Specify  "mynetworks_style  =  subnet" when Postfix should "trust" SMTP clients in the same IP
              subnetworks as the local machine.  On Linux, this works correctly only with interfaces  speci-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fied&nbsp;specified</font>
              fied with the "ifconfig" command.

             Specify  "mynetworks_style  =  class"  when Postfix should "trust" SMTP clients in the same IP
              class A/B/C networks as the local machine.  Don't do this with a dialup site - it would  cause
              Postfix  to  "trust"  your entire provider's network.  Instead, specify an explicit mynetworks
              list by hand, as described with the mynetworks configuration parameter.

<b>myorigin</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$myhostname)</b>
       The domain name that locally-posted mail appears to come from, and that locally posted mail is deliv-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ered&nbsp;delivered</font>
       ered  to.  The  default, $myhostname, is adequate for small sites.  If you run a domain with multiple
       machines, you should (1) change this to $mydomain and (2) set up a domain-wide  alias  database  that
       aliases each user to user@that.users.mailhost.

       Example:

       myorigin = $mydomain

<b>nested_header_checks</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$header_checks)</b>
       Optional  lookup  tables  for content inspection of non-MIME message headers in attached messages, as
       described in the <a href="header_checks.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/header_checks"><b>header_checks</b>(5)</a> manual page.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

<b>newaliases_path</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b>
       Sendmail compatibility feature that specifies the location of the <a href="../man1/newaliases.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/newaliases"><b>newaliases</b>(1)</a> command. This command
       can be used to rebuild the <a href="../man8/local.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/local"><b>local</b>(8)</a> <a href="aliases.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/aliases"><b>aliases</b>(5)</a> database.

<b>non_fqdn_reject_code</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>504)</b>
       The   numerical   Postfix  SMTP  server  reply  code  when  a  client  request  is  rejected  by  the
       reject_non_fqdn_helo_hostname, reject_non_fqdn_sender or reject_non_fqdn_recipient restriction.

<b>non_smtpd_milters</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       A list of Milter (mail filter) applications for new  mail  that  does  not  arrive  via  the  Postfix
       <a href="../man8/smtpd.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/smtpd"><b>smtpd</b>(8)</a>  server.  This  includes  local  submission  via the <a href="../man1/sendmail.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/sendmail"><b>sendmail</b>(1)</a> command line, new mail that
       arrives via the Postfix <a href="../man8/qmqpd.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/qmqpd"><b>qmqpd</b>(8)</a> server, and old mail that is re-injected into the queue with  "post-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">super&nbsp;"postsuper</font>
       super -r".  See the MILTER_README document for details.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>notify_classes</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>resource,</b> <b>software)</b>
       The list of error classes that are reported to the postmaster. The default is to report only the most
       serious problems. The paranoid may wish to turn on the policy (UCE and mail  relaying)  and  protocol
       error (broken mail software) reports.

       NOTE: postmaster notifications may contain confidential information such as SASL passwords or message
       content.  It is the system administrator's responsibility to treat such information with care.

       The error classes are:

       <b>bounce</b> (also implies <b>2bounce</b>)
              Send the postmaster copies of the headers of bounced mail, and send transcripts of  SMTP  ses-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sions&nbsp;sessions</font>
              sions  when  Postfix  rejects mail. The notification is sent to the address specified with the
              bounce_notice_recipient configuration parameter (default: postmaster).

       <b>2bounce</b>
              Send undeliverable bounced mail to the postmaster. The notification is  sent  to  the  address
              specified with the 2bounce_notice_recipient configuration parameter (default: postmaster).

       <b>delay</b>  Send  the  postmaster  copies  of the headers of delayed mail. The notification is sent to the
              address specified with the delay_notice_recipient configuration parameter  (default:  postmas-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ter).&nbsp;postmaster).</font>
              ter).

       <b>policy</b> Send  the  postmaster  a  transcript  of  the  SMTP session when a client request was rejected
              because of (UCE)  policy.  The  notification  is  sent  to  the  address  specified  with  the
              error_notice_recipient configuration parameter (default: postmaster).

       <b>protocol</b>
              Send  the  postmaster  a  transcript  of the SMTP session in case of client or server protocol
              errors. The notification is sent to the address specified with the error_notice_recipient con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">figuration&nbsp;configuration</font>
              figuration parameter (default: postmaster).

       <b>resource</b>
              Inform  the  postmaster  of  mail not delivered due to resource problems.  The notification is
              sent  to  the  address  specified  with  the  error_notice_recipient  configuration  parameter
              (default: postmaster).

       <b>software</b>
              Inform  the  postmaster  of  mail not delivered due to software problems.  The notification is
              sent  to  the  address  specified  with  the  error_notice_recipient  configuration  parameter
              (default: postmaster).

       Examples:

       notify_classes = bounce, delay, policy, protocol, resource, software
       notify_classes = 2bounce, resource, software

<b>owner_request_special</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b>
       Give  special  treatment  to owner-listname and listname-request address localparts: don't split such
       addresses when the recipient_delimiter is set to "-".  This feature is useful for mailing lists.

<b>parent_domain_matches_subdomains</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b>
       What Postfix features match  subdomains  of  "domain.tld"  automatically,  instead  of  requiring  an
       explicit  ".domain.tld"  pattern.   This is planned backwards compatibility:  eventually, all Postfix
       features are expected to require explicit ".domain.tld" style patterns when you really want to  match
       subdomains.

<b>permit_mx_backup_networks</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Restrict  the  use of the permit_mx_backup SMTP access feature to only domains whose primary MX hosts
       match the listed networks.

<b>pickup_service_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>pickup)</b>
       The name of the <a href="../man8/pickup.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/pickup"><b>pickup</b>(8)</a> service. This service picks up local  mail  submissions  from  the  Postfix
       maildrop queue.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

<b>plaintext_reject_code</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>450)</b>
       The  numerical  Postfix  SMTP  server  response  code when a request is rejected by the <b>reject_plain</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">text_session&nbsp;reject_plaintext_session</font>
       <b>text_session</b> restriction.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>prepend_delivered_header</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>command,</b> <b>file,</b> <b>forward)</b>
       The message delivery contexts where the Postfix <a href="../man8/local.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/local"><b>local</b>(8)</a>  delivery  agent  prepends  a  Delivered-To:
       message  header  with  the  address that the mail was delivered to. This information is used for mail
       delivery loop detection.

       By default, the Postfix local delivery agent prepends a Delivered-To: header when forwarding mail and
       when  delivering  to file (mailbox) and command. Turning off the Delivered-To: header when forwarding
       mail is not recommended.

       Specify zero or more of <b>forward</b>, <b>file</b>, or <b>command</b>.

       Example:

       prepend_delivered_header = forward

<b>process_id</b> <b>(read-only)</b>
       The process ID of a Postfix command or daemon process.

<b>process_id_directory</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>pid)</b>
       The location of Postfix PID files relative to $queue_directory.  This is a read-only parameter.

<b>process_name</b> <b>(read-only)</b>
       The process name of a Postfix command or daemon process.

<b>propagate_unmatched_extensions</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>canonical,</b> <b>virtual)</b>
       What address lookup tables copy an address extension from the lookup key to the lookup result.

       For example, with a <a href="virtual.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/virtual"><b>virtual</b>(5)</a> mapping of "<u>joe@domain</u>  <u>-&gt;</u>  <u>joe.user</u>",  the  address  "<u>joe+foo@domain</u>"
       would rewrite to "<u>joe.user+foo</u>".

       Specify  zero  or more of <b>canonical</b>, <b>virtual</b>, <b>alias</b>, <b>forward</b>, <b>include</b> or <b>generic</b>. These cause address
       extension propagation with <a href="canonical.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/canonical"><b>canonical</b>(5)</a>, <a href="virtual.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/virtual"><b>virtual</b>(5)</a>, and <a href="aliases.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/aliases"><b>aliases</b>(5)</a> maps, with <a href="../man8/local.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/local"><b>local</b>(8)</a> .forward  and
       :include: file lookups, and with <a href="../man8/smtp.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/smtp"><b>smtp</b>(8)</a> generic maps, respectively.

       Note:  enabling  this  feature for types other than <b>canonical</b> and <b>virtual</b> is likely to cause problems
       when mail is forwarded to other sites, especially with mail that is sent to a mailing  list  exploder
       address.

       Examples:

       propagate_unmatched_extensions = canonical, virtual, alias,
               forward, include
       propagate_unmatched_extensions = canonical, virtual

<b>proxy_interfaces</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       The  network  interface addresses that this mail system receives mail on by way of a proxy or network
       address translation unit.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

       You must specify your "outside" proxy/NAT addresses when your system is a backup MX  host  for  other
       domains, otherwise mail delivery loops will happen when the primary MX host is down.

       Example:

       proxy_interfaces = 1.2.3.4

<b>proxy_read_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b>
       The  lookup  tables  that  the  <a href="../man8/proxymap.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/proxymap"><b>proxymap</b>(8)</a> server is allowed to access.  Table references that don't
       begin with proxy: are ignored.  The <a href="../man8/proxymap.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/proxymap"><b>proxymap</b>(8)</a> table accesses are read-only.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

<b>qmgr_clog_warn_time</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>300s)</b>
       The minimal delay between warnings that a specific destination is  clogging  up  the  Postfix  active
       queue. Specify 0 to disable.

       This feature is enabled with the helpful_warnings parameter.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

<b>qmgr_fudge_factor</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>100)</b>
       Obsolete feature: the percentage of delivery resources that a busy mail system will use up for deliv-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ery&nbsp;delivery</font>
       ery of a large mailing  list message.

       This feature exists only in the <a href="../man8/oqmgr.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/oqmgr"><b>oqmgr</b>(8)</a> old queue manager. The  current  queue  manager  solves  the
       problem in a better way.

<b>qmgr_message_active_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>20000)</b>
       The maximal number of messages in the active queue.

<b>qmgr_message_recipient_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>20000)</b>
       The maximal number of recipients held in memory by the Postfix queue manager, and the maximal size of
       the size of the short-term, in-memory "dead" destination status cache.

<b>qmgr_message_recipient_minimum</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>10)</b>
       The minimal number of in-memory recipients for any message. This takes priority over  any  other  in-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">memory&nbsp;inmemory</font>
       memory recipient limits (i.e., the global qmgr_message_recipient_limit and the per transport _recipi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ent_limit)&nbsp;_recipient_limit)</font>
       ent_limit) if necessary. The minimum value allowed for this parameter is 1.

<b>qmqpd_authorized_clients</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       What clients are allowed to connect to the QMQP server port.

       By default, no client is allowed to use the service. This is because the QMQP server will relay  mail
       to any destination.

       Specify  a  list of client patterns. A list pattern specifies a host name, a domain name, an internet
       address, or a network/mask pattern, where the mask specifies the number of bits in the network  part.
       When  a pattern specifies a file name, its contents are substituted for the file name; when a pattern
       is a "type:table" table specification, table lookup is used instead.

       Patterns are separated by whitespace and/or commas. In order to reverse the result, precede a pattern
       with  an  exclamation  point (!). The form "!/file/name" is supported only in Postfix version 2.4 and
       later.

       Example:

       qmqpd_authorized_clients = !192.168.0.1, 192.168.0.0/24

<b>qmqpd_error_delay</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1s)</b>
       How long the QMQP server will pause before sending a negative reply to the client. The purpose is  to
       slow down confused or malicious clients.

       Time  units:  s  (seconds),  m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit is s
       (seconds).

<b>qmqpd_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>300s)</b>
       The time limit for sending or receiving information over the network.  If a read or  write  operation
       blocks for more than $qmqpd_timeout seconds the QMQP server gives up and disconnects.

       Time  units:  s  (seconds),  m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit is s
       (seconds).

<b>queue_directory</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b>
       The location of the Postfix top-level queue directory. This is the root directory of  Postfix  daemon
       processes that run chrooted.

<b>queue_file_attribute_count_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>100)</b>
       The  maximal  number of (name=value) attributes that may be stored in a Postfix queue file. The limit
       is enforced by the <a href="../man8/cleanup.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/cleanup"><b>cleanup</b>(8)</a> server.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

<b>queue_minfree</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>0)</b>
       The minimal amount of free space in bytes in the queue file system that is needed  to  receive  mail.
       This is currently used by the SMTP server to decide if it will accept any mail at all.

       By  default,  the  Postfix version 2.1 SMTP server rejects MAIL FROM commands when the amount of free
       space is less than 1.5*$message_size_limit.  To specify a higher minimum free space limit, specify  a
       queue_minfree value that is at least 1.5*$message_size_limit.

       With  Postfix  versions  2.0  and  earlier,  a  queue_minfree value of zero means there is no minimum
       required amount of free space.

<b>queue_run_delay</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>300s)</b>
       The time between deferred queue scans by the queue manager; prior to Postfix 2.4  the  default  value
       was 1000s.

       This  parameter  should  be  set less than or equal to $minimal_backoff_time. See also $maximal_back-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">off_time.&nbsp;$maximal_backoff_time.</font>
       off_time.

       Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default  time  unit  is  s
       (seconds).

<b>queue_service_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>qmgr)</b>
       The  name  of  the  <a href="../man8/qmgr.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/qmgr"><b>qmgr</b>(8)</a>  service.  This  service manages the Postfix queue and schedules delivery
       requests.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

<b>rbl_reply_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Optional lookup tables with RBL response templates. The tables are indexed by the RBL domain name. By
       default,  Postfix  uses  the  default  template as specified with the default_rbl_reply configuration
       parameter. See there for a discussion of the syntax of RBL reply templates.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

<b>readme_directory</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b>
       The location of Postfix README files that describe how to build,  configure  or  operate  a  specific
       Postfix subsystem or feature.

<b>receive_override_options</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Enable  or  disable  recipient validation, built-in content filtering, or address mapping. Typically,
       these are specified in master.cf as command-line arguments for the <a href="../man8/smtpd.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/smtpd"><b>smtpd</b>(8)</a>,  <a href="../man8/qmqpd.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/qmqpd"><b>qmqpd</b>(8)</a>  or  <a href="../man8/pickup.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/pickup"><b>pickup</b>(8)</a>
       daemons.

       Specify  zero or more of the following options.  The options override main.cf settings and are either
       implemented by <a href="../man8/smtpd.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/smtpd"><b>smtpd</b>(8)</a>, <a href="../man8/qmqpd.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/qmqpd"><b>qmqpd</b>(8)</a>, or <a href="../man8/pickup.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/pickup"><b>pickup</b>(8)</a> themselves, or they  are  forwarded  to  the  cleanup
       server.

       <b>no_unknown_recipient_checks</b>
              Do not try to reject unknown recipients (SMTP server only).  This is typically specified AFTER
              an external content filter.

       <b>no_address_mappings</b>
              Disable canonical address mapping, virtual alias  map  expansion,  address  masquerading,  and
              automatic  BCC  (blind carbon-copy) recipients. This is typically specified BEFORE an external
              content filter.

       <b>no_header_body_checks</b>
              Disable header/body_checks. This is typically specified AFTER an external content filter.

       <b>no_milters</b>
              Disable Milter (mail filter) applications. This is typically specified AFTER an external  con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tent&nbsp;content</font>
              tent filter.

       Note:  when  the "BEFORE content filter" receive_override_options setting is specified in the main.cf
       file, specify the "AFTER content filter" receive_override_options  setting  in  master.cf  (and  vice
       versa).

       Examples:

       receive_override_options =
           no_unknown_recipient_checks, no_header_body_checks
       receive_override_options = no_address_mappings

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>recipient_bcc_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Optional  BCC  (blind  carbon-copy)  address  lookup  tables,  indexed by recipient address.  The BCC
       address (multiple results are not supported) is added when mail enters from outside of Postfix.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

       The table search order is as follows:

             Look up the "user+extension@domain.tld" address including the optional address extension.

             Look up the "user@domain.tld" address without the optional address extension.

             Look up the "user+extension" address local part when the recipient  domain  equals  $myorigin,
              $mydestination, $inet_interfaces or $proxy_interfaces.

             Look  up the "user" address local part when the recipient domain equals $myorigin, $mydestina-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion,&nbsp;$mydestination,</font>
              tion, $inet_interfaces or $proxy_interfaces.

             Look up the "@domain.tld" part.

       Specify the types and names of databases to use.  After  change,  run  "<b>postmap</b>  <b>/etc/postfix/recipi</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ent_bcc".&nbsp;/etc/postfix/recipient_bcc".</font>
       <b>ent_bcc</b>".

       Note: if mail to the BCC address bounces it will be returned to the sender.

       Note:  automatic BCC recipients are produced only for new mail.  To avoid mailer loops, automatic BCC
       recipients are not generated for mail that Postfix forwards internally, nor  for  mail  that  Postfix
       generates itself.

       Example:

       recipient_bcc_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/recipient_bcc

<b>recipient_canonical_classes</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>envelope_recipient,</b> <b>header_recipient)</b>
       What addresses are subject to recipient_canonical_maps address mapping.  By default, recipient_canon-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ical_maps&nbsp;recipient_canonical_maps</font>
       ical_maps address mapping is applied  to  envelope  recipient  addresses,  and  to  header  recipient
       addresses.

       Specify one or more of: envelope_recipient, header_recipient

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>recipient_canonical_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Optional address mapping lookup tables for envelope and header recipient addresses.  The table format
       and lookups are documented in <a href="canonical.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/canonical"><b>canonical</b>(5)</a>.

       Note: $recipient_canonical_maps is processed before $canonical_maps.

       Example:

       recipient_canonical_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/recipient_canonical

<b>recipient_delimiter</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       The separator between user names and address  extensions  (user+foo).   See  <a href="canonical.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/canonical"><b>canonical</b>(5)</a>,  <a href="../man8/local.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/local"><b>local</b>(8)</a>,
       <a href="relocated.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/relocated"><b>relocated</b>(5)</a> and <a href="virtual.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/virtual"><b>virtual</b>(5)</a> for the effects this has on aliases, canonical, virtual, relocated and on
       .forward file lookups.  Basically, the software tries user+foo and .forward+foo  before  trying  user
       and .forward.

       Example:

       recipient_delimiter = +

<b>reject_code</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>554)</b>
       The  numerical Postfix SMTP server response code when a remote SMTP client request is rejected by the
       "reject" restriction.

       Do not change this unless you have a complete understanding of RFC 821.

<b>relay_clientcerts</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       The list of remote SMTP client certificates for which the Postfix SMTP server will allow access  with
       the  permit_tls_clientcerts  feature.   This  feature does not use certificate names, because Postfix
       list manipulation routines treat whitespace and some other characters as  special.   Instead  we  use
       certificate fingerprints as they are difficult to fake but easy to use for lookup.

       Postfix  lookup  tables are in the form of (key, value) pairs.  Since we only need the key, the value
       can     be     chosen     freely,     e.g.      the     name     of     the     user     or     host:
       D7:04:2F:A7:0B:8C:A5:21:FA:31:77:E1:41:8A:EE:80 lutzpc.at.home

       Example:

       relay_clientcerts = hash:/etc/postfix/relay_clientcerts

       For  more  fine-grained control, use check_ccert_access to select an appropriate <a href="access.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/access"><b>access</b>(5)</a> policy for
       each client.  See RESTRICTION_CLASS_README.

       This feature is available with Postfix version 2.2.

<b>relay_destination_concurrency_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$default_destination_concurrency_limit)</b>
       The maximal number of parallel deliveries to the same destination  via  the  relay  message  delivery
       transport.  This  limit  is enforced by the queue manager. The message delivery transport name is the
       first field in the entry in the master.cf file.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

<b>relay_destination_recipient_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$default_destination_recipient_limit)</b>
       The maximal number of recipients per delivery via the relay message delivery transport. This limit is
       enforced by the queue manager. The message delivery transport name is the first field in the entry in
       the master.cf file.

       Setting this parameter to a value of 1 changes  the  meaning  of  relay_destination_concurrency_limit
       from concurrency per domain into concurrency per recipient.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

<b>relay_domains</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$mydestination)</b>
       What  destination domains (and subdomains thereof) this system will relay mail to. Subdomain matching
       is controlled  with  the  parent_domain_matches_subdomains  parameter.  For  details  about  how  the
       relay_domains   value   is   used,   see   the   description   of   the  permit_auth_destination  and
       reject_unauth_destination SMTP recipient restrictions.

       Domains that match $relay_domains are delivered with the $relay_transport  mail  delivery  transport.
       The  SMTP  server  validates  recipient addresses with $relay_recipient_maps and rejects non-existent
       recipients. See also the relay domains address class in the ADDRESS_CLASS_README file.

       Note: Postfix will not automatically forward mail for domains that list this system as their  primary
       or backup MX host. See the permit_mx_backup restriction in the <b>postconf</b>(5) manual page.

       Specify  a  list  of host or domain names, "/file/name" patterns or "type:table" lookup tables, sepa-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rated&nbsp;separated</font>
       rated by commas and/or whitespace.  Continue long lines by starting the next line with whitespace.  A
       "/file/name" pattern is replaced by its contents; a "type:table" lookup table is matched when a (par-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ent)&nbsp;(parent)</font>
       ent) domain appears as lookup key. Specify "!pattern" to exclude a domain from  the  list.  The  form
       "!/file/name" is supported only in Postfix version 2.4 and later.

<b>relay_domains_reject_code</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>554)</b>
       The  numerical  Postfix  SMTP  server  response  code  when  a  client  request  is  rejected  by the
       reject_unauth_destination recipient restriction.

       Do not change this unless you have a complete understanding of RFC 821.

<b>relay_recipient_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Optional lookup tables with all valid addresses in the domains  that  match  $relay_domains.  Specify
       @domain  as  a  wild-card  for  domains  that  have  no  valid recipient list, and become a source of
       backscatter mail: Postfix accepts spam for non-existent recipients and then  floods  innocent  people
       with  undeliverable  mail.   Technically, tables listed with $relay_recipient_maps are used as lists:
       Postfix needs to know only if a lookup string is found or not, but it does not use  the  result  from
       table lookup.

       If this parameter is non-empty, then the Postfix SMTP server will reject mail to unknown relay users.
       This feature is off by default.

       See also the relay domains address class in the ADDRESS_CLASS_README file.

       Example:

       relay_recipient_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/relay_recipients

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

<b>relay_transport</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>relay)</b>
       The default mail delivery transport and next-hop destination for remote delivery  to  domains  listed
       with  $relay_domains.  In  order  of  decreasing  precedence,  the  nexthop destination is taken from
       $relay_transport, $sender_dependent_relayhost_maps, $relayhost, or from the  recipient  domain.  This
       information can be overruled with the <a href="transport.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/transport"><b>transport</b>(5)</a> table.

       Specify a string of the form <u>transport:nexthop</u>, where <u>transport</u> is the name of a mail delivery trans-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">port&nbsp;transport</font>
       port defined in master.cf.  The <u>:nexthop</u> part is optional.  For more  details  see  the  <a href="transport.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/transport"><b>transport</b>(5)</a>
       manual page.

       See also the relay domains address class in the ADDRESS_CLASS_README file.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

<b>relayhost</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       The  next-hop destination of non-local mail; overrides non-local domains in recipient addresses. This
       information is overruled with relay_transport, default_transport, sender_dependent_relayhost_maps and
       with the <a href="transport.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/transport"><b>transport</b>(5)</a> table.

       On  an  intranet,  specify  the  organizational domain name. If your internal DNS uses no MX records,
       specify the name of the intranet gateway host instead.

       In the case of SMTP, specify a domain name, hostname, hostname:port,  [hostname]:port,  [hostaddress]
       or [hostaddress]:port. The form [hostname] turns off MX lookups.

       If you're connected via UUCP, see the UUCP_README file for useful information.

       Examples:

       relayhost = $mydomain
       relayhost = [gateway.my.domain]
       relayhost = uucphost
       relayhost = [an.ip.add.ress]

<b>relocated_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Optional  lookup  tables with new contact information for users or domains that no longer exist.  The
       table format and lookups are documented in <a href="relocated.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/relocated"><b>relocated</b>(5)</a>.

       If you use this feature, run "<b>postmap</b> <b>/etc/postfix/relocated</b>" to build the necessary DBM or  DB  file
       after change, then "<b>postfix</b> <b>reload</b>" to make the changes visible.

       Examples:

       relocated_maps = dbm:/etc/postfix/relocated
       relocated_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/relocated

<b>remote_header_rewrite_domain</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Don't rewrite message headers from remote clients at all when this parameter is empty; otherwise, re-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">write&nbsp;rewrite</font>
       write  message  headers  and  append  the  specified  domain  name  to  incomplete  addresses.    The
       local_header_rewrite_clients parameter controls what clients Postfix considers local.

       Examples:

       The safe setting: append "domain.invalid" to incomplete header addresses from remote SMTP clients, so
       that those addresses cannot be confused with local addresses.

           remote_header_rewrite_domain = domain.invalid

       The default, purist, setting: don't rewrite headers from remote clients at all.

           remote_header_rewrite_domain =

<b>require_home_directory</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
       Whether or not a <a href="../man8/local.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/local"><b>local</b>(8)</a> recipient's home directory must exist before mail delivery is attempted. By
       default this test is disabled.  It can be useful for environments that import home directories to the
       mail server (NOT RECOMMENDED).

<b>resolve_dequoted_address</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b>
       Resolve a recipient address safely instead of correctly, by looking inside quotes.

       By default, the Postfix address resolver does not quote the address localpart as per RFC 822, so that
       additional  @  or  % or !  operators remain visible. This behavior is safe but it is also technically
       incorrect.

       If you specify "resolve_dequoted_address = no", then the Postfix resolver will not know  about  addi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tional&nbsp;additional</font>
       tional  @  etc.  operators  in the address localpart. This opens opportunities for obscure mail relay
       attacks with user@domain@domain addresses when Postfix provides backup MX service for  Sendmail  sys-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tems.&nbsp;systems.</font>
       tems.

<b>resolve_null_domain</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
       Resolve  an address that ends in the "@" null domain as if the local hostname were specified, instead
       of rejecting the address as invalid.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.  Earlier versions always resolve the null  domain
       as the local hostname.

       The  Postfix  SMTP  server  uses this feature to reject mail from or to addresses that end in the "@"
       null domain, and from addresses that rewrite into a form that ends in the "@" null domain.

<b>resolve_numeric_domain</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
       Resolve "user@ipaddress" as "user@[ipaddress]", instead of rejecting the address as invalid.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>rewrite_service_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>rewrite)</b>
       The name of the address rewriting service. This service  rewrites  addresses  to  standard  form  and
       resolves them to a (delivery method, next-hop host, recipient) triple.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

<b>sample_directory</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>/etc/postfix)</b>
       The name of the directory with example Postfix configuration files.

<b>sender_based_routing</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
       This parameter should not be used. It was replaced by sender_dependent_relayhost_maps in Postfix ver-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion&nbsp;version</font>
       sion 2.3.

<b>sender_bcc_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Optional BCC (blind carbon-copy) address lookup tables, indexed by sender address.  The  BCC  address
       (multiple results are not supported) is added when mail enters from outside of Postfix.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

       The table search order is as follows:

             Look up the "user+extension@domain.tld" address including the optional address extension.

             Look up the "user@domain.tld" address without the optional address extension.

             Look  up  the  "user+extension"  address  local  part when the sender domain equals $myorigin,
              $mydestination, $inet_interfaces or $proxy_interfaces.

             Look up the "user" address local part when the sender domain equals $myorigin, $mydestination,
              $inet_interfaces or $proxy_interfaces.

             Look up the "@domain.tld" part.

       Specify   the  types  and  names  of  databases  to  use.   After  change,  run  "<b>postmap</b>  <b>/etc/post</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fix/sender_bcc".&nbsp;/etc/postfix/sender_bcc".</font>
       <b>fix/sender_bcc</b>".

       Note: if mail to the BCC address bounces it will be returned to the sender.

       Note: automatic BCC recipients are produced only for new mail.  To avoid mailer loops, automatic  BCC
       recipients  are  not  generated  for mail that Postfix forwards internally, nor for mail that Postfix
       generates itself.

       Example:

       sender_bcc_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sender_bcc

<b>sender_canonical_classes</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>envelope_sender,</b> <b>header_sender)</b>
       What addresses are subject to sender_canonical_maps  address  mapping.   By  default,  sender_canoni-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cal_maps&nbsp;sender_canonical_maps</font>
       cal_maps address mapping is applied to envelope sender addresses, and to header sender addresses.

       Specify one or more of: envelope_sender, header_sender

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>sender_canonical_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Optional  address  mapping  lookup tables for envelope and header sender addresses.  The table format
       and lookups are documented in <a href="canonical.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/canonical"><b>canonical</b>(5)</a>.

       Example: you want to rewrite the SENDER address  "user@ugly.domain"  to  "user@pretty.domain",  while
       still being able to send mail to the RECIPIENT address "user@ugly.domain".

       Note: $sender_canonical_maps is processed before $canonical_maps.

       Example:

       sender_canonical_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sender_canonical

<b>sender_dependent_relayhost_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       A  sender-dependent  override  for the global relayhost parameter setting. The tables are searched by
       the envelope sender  address  and  @domain.  This  information  is  overruled  with  relay_transport,
       default_transport and with the <a href="transport.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/transport"><b>transport</b>(5)</a> table.

       For safety reasons, this feature does not allow $number substitutions in regular expression maps.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>sendmail_path</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b>
       A Sendmail compatibility feature that specifies the location of the Postfix <a href="../man1/sendmail.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/sendmail"><b>sendmail</b>(1)</a> command. This
       command can be used to submit mail into the Postfix queue.

<b>service_throttle_time</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>60s)</b>
       How long the Postfix <a href="../man8/master.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/master"><b>master</b>(8)</a> waits before forking a server that appears to be malfunctioning.

       Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default  time  unit  is  s
       (seconds).

<b>setgid_group</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>postdrop)</b>
       The  group ownership of set-gid Postfix commands and of group-writable Postfix directories. When this
       parameter value is changed you need to re-run "<b>postfix</b> <b>set-permissions</b>" (with Postfix version 2.0 and
       earlier: "<b>/etc/postfix/post-install</b> <b>set-permissions</b>".

<b>show_user_unknown_table_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b>
       Display  the  name  of  the  recipient table in the "User unknown" responses.  The extra detail makes
       trouble shooting easier but also reveals information that is nobody elses business.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

<b>showq_service_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>showq)</b>
       The name of the <a href="../man8/showq.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/showq"><b>showq</b>(8)</a> service. This service produces mail queue status reports.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

<b>smtp_always_send_ehlo</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b>
       Always send EHLO at the start of an SMTP session.

       With "smtp_always_send_ehlo = no", Postfix sends EHLO only when  the  word  "ESMTP"  appears  in  the
       server greeting banner (example: 220 spike.porcupine.org ESMTP Postfix).

<b>smtp_bind_address</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       An optional numerical network address that the Postfix SMTP client should bind to when making an IPv4
       connection.

       This can be specified in the main.cf file for all SMTP clients, or it can be specified  in  the  mas-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ter.cf&nbsp;master.cf</font>
       ter.cf file for a specific client, for example:

         /etc/postfix/master.cf:
               smtp ... smtp -o smtp_bind_address=11.22.33.44

       Note 1: when inet_interfaces specifies no more than one IPv4 address, and that address is a non-loop-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">back&nbsp;non-loopback</font>
       back address, it is automatically used as the smtp_bind_address.  This supports virtual  IP  hosting,
       but can be a problem on multi-homed firewalls. See the inet_interfaces documentation for more detail.

       Note 2: address information may be enclosed inside [], but this form is not required here.

<b>smtp_bind_address6</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       An optional numerical network address that the Postfix SMTP client should bind to when making an IPv6
       connection.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

       This  can  be  specified in the main.cf file for all SMTP clients, or it can be specified in the mas-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ter.cf&nbsp;master.cf</font>
       ter.cf file for a specific client, for example:

         /etc/postfix/master.cf:
               smtp ... smtp -o smtp_bind_address6=1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8

       Note 1: when inet_interfaces specifies no more than one IPv6 address, and that address is a non-loop-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">back&nbsp;non-loopback</font>
       back  address, it is automatically used as the smtp_bind_address6.  This supports virtual IP hosting,
       but can be a problem on multi-homed firewalls. See the inet_interfaces documentation for more detail.

       Note 2: address information may be enclosed inside [], but this form is not recommended here.

<b>smtp_cname_overrides_servername</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>version</b> <b>dependent)</b>
       Allow  DNS  CNAME  records  to override the servername that the Postfix SMTP client uses for logging,
       SASL password lookup, TLS policy decisions, or TLS certificate verification. The value  "no"  hardens
       Postfix  smtp_tls_per_site  hostname-based  policies  against false hostname information in DNS CNAME
       records, and makes SASL password file lookups more predictable. This is the  default  setting  as  of
       Postfix 2.3.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2.9 and later.

<b>smtp_connect_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>30s)</b>
       The  SMTP client time limit for completing a TCP connection, or zero (use the operating system built-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">in&nbsp;builtin</font>
       in time limit).

       When no connection can be made within the deadline, the Postfix SMTP client tries the next address on
       the  mail  exchanger  list.  Specify 0 to disable the time limit (i.e. use whatever timeout is imple-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mented&nbsp;implemented</font>
       mented by the operating system).

       Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default  time  unit  is  s
       (seconds).

<b>smtp_connection_cache_destinations</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Permanently  enable  SMTP  connection  caching  for the specified destinations.  With SMTP connection
       caching, a connection is not closed immediately after completion of a mail transaction.  Instead, the
       connection is kept open for up to $smtp_connection_cache_time_limit seconds.  This allows connections
       to be reused for other deliveries, and can improve mail delivery performance.

       Specify a comma or white space separated list of destinations or pseudo-destinations:

             if mail is sent without a relay host: a domain name (the right-hand side of an email  address,
              without the [] around a numeric IP address),

             if  mail  is sent via a relay host: a relay host name (without [] or non-default TCP port), as
              specified in main.cf or in the transport map,

             if mail is sent via a UNIX-domain socket: a pathname (without the unix: prefix),

             a /file/name with domain names and/or relay host names as defined above,

             a "type:table" with domain names and/or relay hosts name on the left-hand  side.   The  right-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">hand&nbsp;righthand</font>
              hand side result from "type:table" lookups is ignored.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>smtp_connection_cache_on_demand</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b>
       Temporarily  enable  SMTP  connection  caching  while  a destination has a high volume of mail in the
       active queue.  With SMTP connection caching, a connection is not closed immediately after  completion
       of   a   mail   transaction.    Instead,  the  connection  is  kept  open  for  up  to  $smtp_connec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion_cache_time_limit&nbsp;$smtp_connection_cache_time_limit</font>
       tion_cache_time_limit seconds.  This allows connections to be reused for other  deliveries,  and  can
       improve mail delivery performance.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>smtp_connection_cache_reuse_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>10)</b>
       When  SMTP  connection  caching  is  enabled,  the number of times that an SMTP session may be reused
       before it is closed.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2. In Postfix  2.3  it  is  replaced  by  $smtp_connection_re-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">use_time_limit.&nbsp;$smtp_connection_reuse_time_limit.</font>
       use_time_limit.

<b>smtp_connection_cache_time_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>2s)</b>
       When SMTP connection caching is enabled, the amount of time that an unused SMTP client socket is kept
       open before it is closed.  Do not specify larger values without permission from the remote sites.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>smtp_connection_reuse_time_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>300s)</b>
       The amount of time during which Postfix will use an SMTP connection  repeatedly.   The  timer  starts
       when  the  connection is initiated (i.e. it includes the connect, greeting and helo latency, in addi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;addition</font>
       tion to the latencies of subsequent mail delivery transactions).

       This feature addresses a performance stability problem with remote SMTP servers. This problem is  not
       specific  to Postfix: it can happen when any MTA sends large amounts of SMTP email to a site that has
       multiple MX hosts.

       The problem starts when one of a set of MX hosts becomes slower than  the  rest.   Even  though  SMTP
       clients  connect to fast and slow MX hosts with equal probability, the slow MX host ends up with more
       simultaneous inbound connections than the faster MX hosts, because the slow MX host needs  more  time
       to serve each client request.

       The  slow  MX  host  becomes  a connection attractor.  If one MX host becomes N times slower than the
       rest, it dominates mail delivery latency unless there are more than N fast MX hosts  to  counter  the
       effect.  And  if  the  number of MX hosts is smaller than N, the mail delivery latency becomes effec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tively&nbsp;effectively</font>
       tively that of the slowest MX host divided by the total number of MX hosts.

       The solution uses connection caching in a way that differs from Postfix version 2.2.  By limiting the
       amount  of  time  during which a connection can be used repeatedly (instead of limiting the number of
       deliveries over that connection), Postfix not only restores fairness in the distribution of  simulta-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">neous&nbsp;simultaneous</font>
       neous  connections  across a set of MX hosts, it also favors deliveries over connections that perform
       well, which is exactly what we want.

       The default reuse time limit, 300s, is comparable to the various smtp transaction timeouts which  are
       fair  estimates  of maximum excess latency for a slow delivery.  Note that hosts may accept thousands
       of messages over a single connection within the default connection reuse time limit. This  number  is
       much  larger  than the default Postfix version 2.2 limit of 10 messages per cached connection. It may
       prove necessary to lower the limit to avoid interoperability issues with MTAs that exhibit bugs  when
       many messages are delivered via a single connection.  A lower reuse time limit risks losing the bene-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fit&nbsp;benefit</font>
       fit of connection reuse when the average connection and mail delivery latency exceeds the reuse  time
       limit.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>smtp_data_done_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>600s)</b>
       The SMTP client time limit for sending the SMTP ".", and for receiving the server response.

       When  no response is received within the deadline, a warning is logged that the mail may be delivered
       multiple times.

       Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default  time  unit  is  s
       (seconds).

<b>smtp_data_init_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>120s)</b>
       The  SMTP client time limit for sending the SMTP DATA command, and for receiving the server response.

       Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default  time  unit  is  s
       (seconds).

<b>smtp_data_xfer_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>180s)</b>
       The  SMTP  client  time  limit  for  sending  the SMTP message content.  When the connection makes no
       progress for more than $smtp_data_xfer_timeout seconds the Postfix SMTP client terminates the  trans-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fer.&nbsp;transfer.</font>
       fer.

       Time  units:  s  (seconds),  m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit is s
       (seconds).

<b>smtp_defer_if_no_mx_address_found</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
       Defer mail delivery when no MX record resolves to an IP address.

       The default (no) is to return the mail as undeliverable. With older Postfix versions the default  was
       to keep trying to deliver the mail until someone fixed the MX record or until the mail was too old.

       Note: Postfix always ignores MX records with equal or worse preference than the local MTA itself.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>smtp_destination_concurrency_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$default_destination_concurrency_limit)</b>
       The  maximal  number  of  parallel  deliveries  to the same destination via the smtp message delivery
       transport. This limit is enforced by the queue manager. The message delivery transport  name  is  the
       first field in the entry in the master.cf file.

<b>smtp_destination_recipient_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$default_destination_recipient_limit)</b>
       The  maximal number of recipients per delivery via the smtp message delivery transport. This limit is
       enforced by the queue manager. The message delivery transport name is the first field in the entry in
       the master.cf file.

       Setting this parameter to a value of 1 changes the meaning of smtp_destination_concurrency_limit from
       concurrency per domain into concurrency per recipient.

<b>smtp_discard_ehlo_keyword_address_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Lookup tables, indexed by the remote SMTP server address, with case insensitive lists  of  EHLO  key-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">words&nbsp;keywords</font>
       words  (pipelining,  starttls,  auth,  etc.)  that  the  Postfix  SMTP client will ignore in the EHLO
       response from a remote SMTP server. See smtp_discard_ehlo_keywords for  details.  The  table  is  not
       indexed by hostname for consistency with smtpd_discard_ehlo_keyword_address_maps.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>smtp_discard_ehlo_keywords</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       A  case  insensitive  list  of EHLO keywords (pipelining, starttls, auth, etc.) that the Postfix SMTP
       client will ignore in the EHLO response from a remote SMTP server.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

       Notes:

             Specify the <b>silent-discard</b> pseudo keyword to prevent this action from being logged.

             Use the smtp_discard_ehlo_keyword_address_maps feature to discard EHLO keywords selectively.

<b>smtp_enforce_tls</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
       Enforcement mode: require that remote SMTP servers use TLS encryption, and never  send  mail  in  the
       clear.  This also requires that the remote SMTP server hostname matches the information in the remote
       server certificate, and that the remote SMTP server certificate was issued by a CA that is trusted by
       the Postfix SMTP client. If the certificate doesn't verify or the hostname doesn't match, delivery is
       deferred and mail stays in the queue.

       The server hostname is matched against all names provided as dNSNames in the  SubjectAlternativeName.
       If  no  dNSNames  are  specified,  the  CommonName  is checked.  The behavior may be changed with the
       smtp_tls_enforce_peername option.

       This option is useful only if you are definitely sure that you will only connect to servers that sup-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">port&nbsp;support</font>
       port RFC 2487 _and_ that provide valid server certificates.  Typical use is for clients that send all
       their email to a dedicated mailhub.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later. With Postfix 2.3  and  later  use  smtp_tls_secu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rity_level&nbsp;smtp_tls_security_level</font>
       rity_level instead.

<b>smtp_fallback_relay</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$fallback_relay)</b>
       Optional  list of relay hosts for SMTP destinations that can't be found or that are unreachable. With
       Postfix 2.2 and earlier this parameter is called fallback_relay.

       By default, mail is returned to the sender when a destination is not found, and delivery is  deferred
       when a destination is unreachable.

       The  fallback  relays  must  be  SMTP  destinations.  Specify a domain, host, host:port, [host]:port,
       [address] or [address]:port; the form [host] turns off MX lookups.  If you specify multiple SMTP des-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tinations,&nbsp;destinations,</font>
       tinations, Postfix will try them in the specified order.

       To  prevent mailer loops between MX hosts and fall-back hosts, Postfix version 2.3 and later will not
       use the smtp_fallback_relay feature for destinations that it is MX host for.

<b>smtp_generic_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Optional lookup tables that perform address rewriting in the SMTP client, typically  to  transform  a
       locally  valid  address into a globally valid address when sending mail across the Internet.  This is
       needed when the local machine does not have its own Internet domain name,  but  uses  something  like
       <u>localdomain.local</u> instead.

       The  table format and lookups are documented in <a href="generic.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/generic"><b>generic</b>(5)</a>; examples are shown in the ADDRESS_REWRIT-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ING_README&nbsp;ADDRESS_REWRITING_README</font>
       ING_README and STANDARD_CONFIGURATION_README documents.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>smtp_helo_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$myhostname)</b>
       The hostname to send in the SMTP EHLO or HELO command.

       The default value is the machine hostname.  Specify a hostname or [ip.add.re.ss].

       This information can be specified in the main.cf file for all SMTP clients, or it can be specified in
       the master.cf file for a specific client, for example:

         /etc/postfix/master.cf:
               mysmtp ... smtp -o smtp_helo_name=foo.bar.com

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

<b>smtp_helo_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>300s)</b>
       The SMTP client time limit for sending the HELO or EHLO command, and for receiving the initial server
       response.

       Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default  time  unit  is  s
       (seconds).

<b>smtp_host_lookup</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>dns)</b>
       What  mechanisms when the Postfix SMTP client uses to look up a host's IP address.  This parameter is
       ignored when DNS lookups are disabled.

       Specify one of the following:

       <b>dns</b>    Hosts can be found in the DNS (preferred).

       <b>native</b> Use the native naming service only (nsswitch.conf, or equivalent mechanism).

       <b>dns,</b> <b>native</b>
              Use the native service for hosts not found in the DNS.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>smtp_line_length_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>990)</b>
       The maximal length of message header and body lines that Postfix will send via  SMTP.   Longer  lines
       are broken by inserting "&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;&lt;SPACE&gt;". This minimizes the damage to MIME formatted mail.

       By  default, the line length is limited to 990 characters, because some server implementations cannot
       receive mail with long lines.

<b>smtp_mail_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>300s)</b>
       The SMTP client time limit for sending the MAIL FROM command, and for receiving the server  response.

       Time  units:  s  (seconds),  m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit is s
       (seconds).

<b>smtp_mx_address_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>5)</b>
       The maximal number of MX (mail exchanger) IP addresses that can result from mail  exchanger  lookups,
       or zero (no limit). Prior to Postfix version 2.3, this limit was disabled by default.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>smtp_mx_session_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>2)</b>
       The  maximal  number  of SMTP sessions per delivery request before giving up or delivering to a fall-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">back&nbsp;fallback</font>
       back relay host, or zero (no limit). This restriction ignores sessions that fail to complete the SMTP
       initial  handshake  (Postfix version 2.2 and earlier) or that fail to complete the EHLO and TLS hand-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">shake&nbsp;handshake</font>
       shake (Postfix version 2.3 and later).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>smtp_never_send_ehlo</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
       Never send EHLO at the start of an SMTP session. See also the smtp_always_send_ehlo parameter.

<b>smtp_pix_workaround_delay_time</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>10s)</b>
       How long the Postfix SMTP client pauses before sending ".&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;" in order to work  around  the  PIX
       firewall "&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;" bug.

       Choosing  a  too  short  time makes this workaround ineffective when sending large messages over slow
       network connections.

<b>smtp_pix_workaround_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Lookup tables, indexed by the remote SMTP server address, with per-destination workarounds for  CISCO
       PIX  firewall bugs.  The table is not indexed by hostname for consistency with smtp_discard_ehlo_key-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">word_address_maps.&nbsp;smtp_discard_ehlo_keyword_address_maps.</font>
       word_address_maps.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.4 and later.

<b>smtp_pix_workaround_threshold_time</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>500s)</b>
       How long a message must be  queued  before  the  Postfix  SMTP  client  turns  on  the  PIX  firewall
       "&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;" bug workaround for delivery through firewalls with "smtp fixup" mode turned on.

       By  default, the workaround is turned off for mail that is queued for less than 500 seconds. In other
       words, the workaround is normally turned off for the first delivery attempt.

       Specify 0 to enable the PIX firewall "&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;"  bug  workaround  upon  the  first  delivery
       attempt.

<b>smtp_pix_workarounds</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>disable_esmtp,</b> <b>delay_dotcrlf)</b>
       A  list  that  specifies  zero or more workarounds for CISCO PIX firewall bugs. These workarounds are
       implemented by the Postfix SMTP client. Workaround names are separated by comma  or  space,  and  are
       case  insensitive.   This  parameter  setting  can  be  overruled with per-destination smtp_pix_work-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">around_maps&nbsp;smtp_pix_workaround_maps</font>
       around_maps settings.

       <b>delay_dotcrlf</b>
              Insert a delay before sending ".&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;" after the end of the message content.  The delay  is
              subject to the smtp_pix_workaround_delay_time and smtp_pix_workaround_threshold_time parameter
              settings.

       <b>disable_esmtp</b>
              Disable all extended SMTP commands: send HELO instead of EHLO.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.4 and later. The default  settings  are  backwards  compatible
       with earlier Postfix versions.

<b>smtp_quit_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>300s)</b>
       The SMTP client time limit for sending the QUIT command, and for receiving the server response.

       Time  units:  s  (seconds),  m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit is s
       (seconds).

<b>smtp_quote_rfc821_envelope</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b>
       Quote addresses in SMTP MAIL FROM and RCPT TO commands as required by RFC 821. This includes  putting
       quotes around an address localpart that ends in ".".

       The  default is to comply with RFC 821. If you have to send mail to a broken SMTP server, configure a
       special SMTP client in master.cf:

           /etc/postfix/master.cf:
               broken-smtp . . . smtp -o smtp_quote_rfc821_envelope=no

       and route mail for the destination in question to the "broken-smtp" message delivery  with  a  <a href="transport.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/transport"><b>trans</b></a>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">port(5)&nbsp;transport(5)</font>
       <a href="transport.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/transport"><b>port</b>(5)</a> table.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>smtp_randomize_addresses</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b>
       Randomize  the  order  of  equal-preference  MX host addresses.  This is a performance feature of the
       Postfix SMTP client.

<b>smtp_rcpt_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>300s)</b>
       The SMTP client time limit for sending the SMTP  RCPT  TO  command,  and  for  receiving  the  server
       response.

       Time  units:  s  (seconds),  m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit is s
       (seconds).

<b>smtp_rset_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>20s)</b>
       The SMTP client time limit for sending the RSET command, and for receiving the server  response.  The
       SMTP  client sends RSET in order to finish a recipient address probe, or to verify that a cached ses-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion&nbsp;session</font>
       sion is still usable.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>smtp_sasl_auth_enable</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
       Enable SASL authentication in the Postfix SMTP client.  By default, the Postfix SMTP client  uses  no
       authentication.

       Example:

       smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes

<b>smtp_sasl_mechanism_filter</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       If  non-empty,  a Postfix SMTP client filter for the remote SMTP server's list of offered SASL mecha-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nisms.&nbsp;mechanisms.</font>
       nisms.  Different client and  server  implementations  may  support  different  mechanism  lists.  By
       default,  the  Postfix  SMTP  client will use the intersection of the two. smtp_sasl_mechanism_filter
       further restricts what server mechanisms the client will take into consideration.

       Specify mechanism names, "/file/name" patterns or "type:table" lookup  tables.  The  right-hand  side
       result  from "type:table" lookups is ignored. Specify "!pattern" to exclude a mechanism name from the
       list. The form "!/file/name" is supported only in Postfix version 2.4 and later.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

       Examples:

       smtp_sasl_mechanism_filter = plain, login
       smtp_sasl_mechanism_filter = /etc/postfix/smtp_mechs
       smtp_sasl_mechanism_filter = !gssapi, !login, static:rest

<b>smtp_sasl_password_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Optional SMTP client lookup tables with one username:password entry per remote hostname or domain, or
       sender  address  when  sender-dependent  authentication is enabled.  If no username:password entry is
       found, then the Postfix SMTP client will not attempt to authenticate to the remote host.

       The Postfix SMTP client opens the lookup table before going to chroot jail,  so  you  can  leave  the
       password file in /etc/postfix.

<b>smtp_sasl_path</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Implementation-specific information that is passed through to the SASL plug-in implementation that is
       selected with <b>smtp_sasl_type</b>.  Typically this specifies the name of  a  configuration  file  or  ren-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dezvous&nbsp;rendezvous</font>
       dezvous point.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>smtp_sasl_security_options</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>noplaintext,</b> <b>noanonymous)</b>
       SASL  security  options;  as of Postfix 2.3 the list of available features depends on the SASL client
       implementation that is selected with <b>smtp_sasl_type</b>.

       The following security features are defined for the <b>cyrus</b> client SASL implementation:

       Specify zero or more of the following:

       <b>noplaintext</b>
              Disallow methods that use plaintext passwords.

       <b>noactive</b>
              Disallow methods subject to active (non-dictionary) attack.

       <b>nodictionary</b>
              Disallow methods subject to passive (dictionary) attack.

       <b>noanonymous</b>
              Disallow methods that allow anonymous authentication.

       <b>mutual_auth</b>
              Only allow methods that provide mutual authentication (not available with SASL version 1).

       Example:

       smtp_sasl_security_options = noplaintext

<b>smtp_sasl_tls_security_options</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$smtp_sasl_security_options)</b>
       The SASL authentication security options that the Postfix SMTP client uses  for  TLS  encrypted  SMTP
       sessions.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>smtp_sasl_tls_verified_security_options</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$smtp_sasl_tls_security_options)</b>
       The  SASL  authentication  security  options that the Postfix SMTP client uses for TLS encrypted SMTP
       sessions with a verified server certificate. This feature is still under construction. It will not be
       included in the Postfix 2.3 release.

       This feature should be available in Postfix 2.4 and later.

<b>smtp_sasl_type</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>cyrus)</b>
       The  SASL  plug-in  type  that  the Postfix SMTP client should use for authentication.  The available
       types are listed with the "<b>postconf</b> <b>-A</b>" command.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>smtp_send_xforward_command</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
       Send the non-standard XFORWARD command when the Postfix SMTP server EHLO response announces  XFORWARD
       support.

       This  allows  an "smtp" delivery agent, used for injecting mail into a content filter, to forward the
       name, address, protocol and HELO name of the original client to the  content  filter  and  downstream
       queuing SMTP server. This can produce more useful logging than localhost[127.0.0.1] etc.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>smtp_sender_dependent_authentication</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
       Enable  sender-dependent  authentication in the Postfix SMTP client; this is available only with SASL
       authentication, and disables SMTP connection caching to ensure that mail from different senders  will
       use the appropriate credentials.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>smtp_skip_4xx_greeting</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b>
       Skip SMTP servers that greet with a 4XX status code (go away, try again later).

       By  default, Postfix moves on the next mail exchanger. Specify "smtp_skip_4xx_greeting = no" if Post-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fix&nbsp;Postfix</font>
       fix should defer delivery immediately.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and  earlier.   Later  Postfix  versions  always  skip  SMTP
       servers that greet with a 4XX status code.

<b>smtp_skip_5xx_greeting</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b>
       Skip SMTP servers that greet with a 5XX status code (go away, do not try again later).

       By default, the Postfix SMTP client moves on the next mail exchanger. Specify "smtp_skip_5xx_greeting
       = no" if Postfix should bounce the mail immediately. The default setting is incorrect, but it is what
       a lot of people expect to happen.

<b>smtp_skip_quit_response</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b>
       Do not wait for the response to the SMTP QUIT command.

<b>smtp_starttls_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>300s)</b>
       Time  limit  for  Postfix SMTP client write and read operations during TLS startup and shutdown hand-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">shake&nbsp;handshake</font>
       shake procedures.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>smtp_tls_CAfile</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       The file with the certificate of the certification authority (CA) that issued the Postfix SMTP client
       certificate.   This  is needed only when the CA certificate is not already present in the client cer-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tificate&nbsp;certificate</font>
       tificate file.

       Example:

       smtp_tls_CAfile = /etc/postfix/CAcert.pem

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>smtp_tls_CApath</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Directory with PEM format certificate authority certificates that the Postfix  SMTP  client  uses  to
       verify a remote SMTP server certificate.  Don't forget to create the necessary "hash" links with, for
       example, "$OPENSSL_HOME/bin/c_rehash /etc/postfix/certs".

       To use this option in chroot mode, this directory (or a copy) must be inside the chroot jail.

       Example:

       smtp_tls_CApath = /etc/postfix/certs

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>smtp_tls_cert_file</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       File with the Postfix SMTP client RSA certificate in PEM format.  This  file  may  also  contain  the
       Postfix  SMTP  client  private RSA key, and these may be the same as the Postfix SMTP server RSA cer-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tificate&nbsp;certificate</font>
       tificate and key file.

       Do not configure client certificates unless you <b>must</b> present client TLS certificates to one  or  more
       servers.  Client  certificates  are not usually needed, and can cause problems in configurations that
       work well without them. The recommended setting is to let the defaults stand:
               smtp_tls_cert_file =
               smtp_tls_dcert_file =
               smtp_tls_key_file =
               smtp_tls_dkey_file =

       The best way to use the default settings is to  comment  out  the  above  parameters  in  main.cf  if
       present.

       In  order to verify certificates, the CA certificate (in case of a certificate chain, all CA certifi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cates)&nbsp;certificates)</font>
       cates) must be available.  You should add these certificates to the client  certificate,  the  client
       certificate first, then the issuing <!-- a -->CA(s)<!-- /a -->.

       Example: the certificate for "client.dom.ain" was issued by "intermediate CA" which itself has a cer-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tificate&nbsp;certificate</font>
       tificate of "root CA".  Create the client.pem  file  with  "cat  client_cert.pem  intermediate_CA.pem
       root_CA.pem &gt; client.pem".

       If  you also want to verify remote SMTP server certificates issued by these CAs, you can also add the
       CA certificates to the smtp_tls_CAfile, in which case it  is  not  necessary  to  have  them  in  the
       smtp_tls_cert_file or smtp_tls_dcert_file.

       A  certificate  supplied here must be usable as an SSL client certificate and hence pass the "openssl
       verify -purpose sslclient ..." test.

       Example:

       smtp_tls_cert_file = /etc/postfix/client.pem

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>smtp_tls_cipherlist</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Obsolete Postfix &lt; 2.3 control for the Postfix SMTP client TLS cipher list. As this  feature  applies
       to all TLS security levels, it is easy to create inter-operability problems by choosing a non-default
       cipher list. Do not use a non-default TLS cipher list on hosts  that  deliver  email  to  the  public
       Internet:  you  will  be  unable  to send email to servers that only support the ciphers you exclude.
       Using a restricted cipher list may be more appropriate for an internal MTA, where one can exert  some
       control over the TLS software and settings of the peer servers.

       <b>Note:</b> do not use "" quotes around the parameter value.

       This  feature  is  available  in  Postfix version 2.2. It is not used with Postfix 2.3 and later; use
       smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers instead.

<b>smtp_tls_dcert_file</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       File with the Postfix SMTP client DSA certificate in PEM format.  This  file  may  also  contain  the
       Postfix SMTP client private DSA key.

       See the discussion under smtp_tls_cert_file for more details.

       Example:

       smtp_tls_dcert_file = /etc/postfix/client-dsa.pem

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>smtp_tls_dkey_file</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$smtp_tls_dcert_file)</b>
       File  with the Postfix SMTP client DSA private key in PEM format.  This file may be combined with the
       Postfix SMTP client DSA certificate file specified with $smtp_tls_dcert_file.

       The private key must be accessible without a pass-phrase, i.e. it must not  be  encrypted,  but  file
       permissions should grant read/write access only to the system superuser account ("root").

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>smtp_tls_enforce_peername</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b>
       With  mandatory  TLS encryption, require that the remote SMTP server hostname matches the information
       in the remote SMTP server certificate.  As of RFC 2487 the requirements for hostname checking for MTA
       clients are not specified.

       This  option  can  be set to "no" to disable strict peer name checking. This setting has no effect on
       sessions that are controlled via the smtp_tls_per_site table.

       Disabling the hostname verification can make sense in closed environment where special CAs  are  cre-
       ated.   If not used carefully, this option opens the danger of a "man-in-the-middle" attack (the Com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">monName&nbsp;CommonName</font>
       monName of this attacker will be logged).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later. With Postfix 2.3  and  later  use  smtp_tls_secu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rity_level&nbsp;smtp_tls_security_level</font>
       rity_level instead.

<b>smtp_tls_exclude_ciphers</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       List  of ciphers or cipher types to exclude from the Postfix SMTP client cipher list at all TLS secu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rity&nbsp;security</font>
       rity levels. This is not an OpenSSL cipherlist, it is a simple list separated  by  whitespace  and/or
       commas.  The  elements  are a single cipher, or one or more "+" separated cipher properties, in which
       case only ciphers matching <b>all</b> the properties are excluded.

       Examples (some of these will cause problems):

       smtp_tls_exclude_ciphers = aNULL
       smtp_tls_exclude_ciphers = MD5, DES
       smtp_tls_exclude_ciphers = DES+MD5
       smtp_tls_exclude_ciphers = AES256-SHA, DES-CBC3-MD5
       smtp_tls_exclude_ciphers = kEDH+aRSA

       The first setting, disables anonymous ciphers. The next setting disables ciphers  that  use  the  MD5
       digest algorithm or the (single) DES encryption algorithm. The next setting disables ciphers that use
       MD5 and DES together.  The next setting disables the two ciphers "AES256-SHA" and "DES-CBC3-MD5". The
       last setting disables ciphers that use "EDH" key exchange with RSA authentication.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>smtp_tls_key_file</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$smtp_tls_cert_file)</b>
       File  with the Postfix SMTP client RSA private key in PEM format.  This file may be combined with the
       Postfix SMTP client RSA certificate file specified with $smtp_tls_cert_file.

       The private key must be accessible without a pass-phrase, i.e. it must not  be  encrypted,  but  file
       permissions should grant read/write access only to the system superuser account ("root").

       Example:

       smtp_tls_key_file = $smtp_tls_cert_file

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>smtp_tls_loglevel</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>0)</b>
       Enable  additional Postfix SMTP client logging of TLS activity.  Each logging level also includes the
       information that is logged at a lower logging level.

              0 Disable logging of TLS activity.

              1 Log TLS handshake and certificate information.

              2 Log levels during TLS negotiation.

              3 Log hexadecimal and ASCII dump of TLS negotiation process.

              4 Log hexadecimal and ASCII dump of complete transmission after STARTTLS.

       Use "smtp_tls_loglevel = 3" only in case of problems. Use of loglevel 4 is strongly discouraged.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>medium)</b>
       The minimum TLS cipher grade that the Postfix SMTP client will use  with  mandatory  TLS  encryption.
       The  default value "medium" is suitable for most destinations with which you may want to enforce TLS,
       and is beyond the reach of today's crypt-analytic methods. See smtp_tls_policy_maps  for  information
       on how to configure ciphers on a per-destination basis.

       The following cipher grades are supported:

       <b>export</b> Enable  the  mainstream  "EXPORT"  grade  or  better OpenSSL ciphers.  This is always used for
              opportunistic encryption. It is not recommended  for  mandatory  encryption  unless  you  must
              enforce   TLS   with  "crippled"  peers.  The  underlying  cipherlist  is  specified  via  the
              tls_export_cipherlist configuration parameter,  which  you  are  strongly  encouraged  to  not
              change.  The  default value of tls_export_cipherlist includes anonymous ciphers, but these are
              automatically filtered out if the client is configured to verify server certificates.  If  you
              must  exclude  anonymous  ciphers  also  at the "encrypt" security level, set "smtp_tls_manda-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tory_exclude_ciphers&nbsp;"smtp_tls_mandatory_exclude_ciphers</font>
              tory_exclude_ciphers = aNULL".

       <b>low</b>    Enable the mainstream "LOW" grade or better OpenSSL ciphers.  This setting is only appropriate
              for  internal mail servers.  The underlying cipherlist is specified via the tls_low_cipherlist
              configuration parameter, which you are strongly encouraged to not change. The default value of
              tls_low_cipherlist includes anonymous ciphers, but these are automatically filtered out if the
              client is configured to verify server certificates. If you must exclude anonymous ciphers also
              at the "encrypt" security level, set "smtp_tls_mandatory_exclude_ciphers = aNULL".

       <b>medium</b> Enable  the mainstream "MEDIUM" grade or better OpenSSL ciphers.  The underlying cipherlist is
              specified via the  tls_medium_cipherlist  configuration  parameter,  which  you  are  strongly
              encouraged  to  not  change.   The  default  value of tls_medium_cipherlist includes anonymous
              ciphers, but these are automatically filtered out if the client is configured to verify server
              certificates.  If you must exclude anonymous ciphers also at the "encrypt" security level, set
              "smtp_tls_mandatory_exclude_ciphers = aNULL".

       <b>high</b>   Enable only the mainstream "HIGH" grade OpenSSL ciphers.  This setting is appropriate when all
              mandatory  TLS  destinations  support  some of "HIGH" grade ciphers, this is not uncommon. The
              underlying cipherlist is specified via the tls_high_cipherlist configuration parameter,  which
              you  are  strongly encouraged to not change. The default value of tls_high_cipherlist includes
              anonymous ciphers, but these are automatically filtered out if the  client  is  configured  to
              verify  server certificates. If you must exclude anonymous ciphers also at the "encrypt" secu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rity&nbsp;security</font>
              rity level, set "smtp_tls_mandatory_exclude_ciphers = aNULL".

       <b>null</b>   Enable only the "NULL" OpenSSL ciphers, these provide authentication without encryption.  This
              setting is only appropriate in the rare case that all servers are prepared to use NULL ciphers
              (not normally enabled in TLS servers). A plausible use-case is an LMTP server listening  on  a
              UNIX-domain  socket that is configured to support "NULL" ciphers. The underlying cipherlist is
              specified via the tls_null_cipherlist configuration parameter, which you are strongly  encour-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">aged&nbsp;encouraged</font>
              aged  to  not  change.  The  default  value  of tls_null_cipherlist excludes anonymous ciphers
              (OpenSSL 0.9.8 has NULL ciphers that offer data integrity without  encryption  or  authentica-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion).&nbsp;authentication).</font>
              tion).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>smtp_tls_mandatory_exclude_ciphers</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Additional  list  of ciphers or cipher types to exclude from the SMTP client cipher list at mandatory
       TLS  security   levels.   This   list   works   in   addition   to   the   exclusions   listed   with
       smtp_tls_exclude_ciphers (see there for syntax details).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>SSLv3,</b> <b>TLSv1)</b>
       List  of  TLS  protocols  that  the  Postfix  SMTP client will use with mandatory TLS encryption.  In
       main.cf the values are  separated  by  whitespace,  commas  or  colons.  In  the  policy  table  (see
       smtp_tls_policy_maps)  the  only  valid separator is colon. An empty value means allow all protocols.
       The valid protocol names, (see \fBfBSSL_get_version(3)), are "SSLv2", "SSLv3" and "TLSv1".

       Since SSL version 2 has known protocol weaknesses and is now deprecated,  the  default  setting  only
       lists  "SSLv3"  and  "TLSv1".  This  means  that  by  default,  SSL version 2 will not be used at the
       "encrypt" security level and higher.

       See the documentation of the smtp_tls_policy_maps parameter and TLS_README for more information about
       security levels.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>smtp_tls_note_starttls_offer</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
       Log  the  hostname  of a remote SMTP server that offers STARTTLS, when TLS is not already enabled for
       that server.

       The logfile record looks like:

       postfix/smtp[pid]:  Host offered STARTTLS: [name.of.host]

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>smtp_tls_per_site</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Optional lookup tables with the Postfix SMTP client TLS usage policy by next-hop destination  and  by
       remote  SMTP  server  hostname.   When both lookups succeed, the more specific per-site policy (NONE,
       MUST, etc) overrides the less specific one (MAY), and the more secure  per-site  policy  (MUST,  etc)
       overrides  the less secure one (NONE).  With Postfix 2.3 and later smtp_tls_per_site is strongly dis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">couraged:&nbsp;discouraged:</font>
       couraged: use smtp_tls_policy_maps instead.

       Use of the bare hostname as the per-site table lookup key is discouraged. Always use the full  desti-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nation&nbsp;destination</font>
       nation  nexthop  (enclosed  in  []  with a possible ":port" suffix). A recipient domain or MX-enabled
       transport next-hop with no port suffix may look like a bare hostname, but is still a suitable  <u>desti</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nation.&nbsp;destination.</font>
       <u>nation</u>.

       Specify  a  next-hop  destination or server hostname on the left-hand side; no wildcards are allowed.
       The next-hop destination is either the recipient domain, or the destination specified with  a  <a href="transport.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/transport"><b>trans</b></a>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">port(5)&nbsp;transport(5)</font>
       <a href="transport.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/transport"><b>port</b>(5)</a>  table,  the  relayhost  parameter, or the relay_transport parameter.  On the right hand side
       specify one of the following keywords:

       NONE   Don't use TLS at all. This overrides a less specific <b>MAY</b> lookup result from the alternate host
              or  next-hop  lookup  key,  and  overrides  the  global  smtp_use_tls,  smtp_enforce_tls,  and
              smtp_tls_enforce_peername settings.

       MAY    Try to use TLS if the server announces support, otherwise use the unencrypted connection. This
              has  less  precedence  than a more specific result (including <b>NONE</b>) from the alternate host or
              next-hop lookup key, and has less precedence than the more specific global "smtp_enforce_tls =
              yes" or "smtp_tls_enforce_peername = yes".

       MUST_NOPEERMATCH
              Require  TLS  encryption,  but do not require that the remote SMTP server hostname matches the
              information in the remote SMTP server certificate, or that the server certificate  was  issued
              by  a  trusted CA. This overrides a less secure <b>NONE</b> or a less specific <b>MAY</b> lookup result from
              the  alternate  host  or  next-hop  lookup  key,  and  overrides  the   global   smtp_use_tls,
              smtp_enforce_tls and smtp_tls_enforce_peername settings.

       MUST   Require  TLS  encryption, require that the remote SMTP server hostname matches the information
              in the remote SMTP server certificate, and require that the remote SMTP server certificate was
              issued  by a trusted CA. This overrides a less secure <b>NONE</b> and <b>MUST_NOPEERMATCH</b> or a less spe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cific&nbsp;specific</font>
              cific <b>MAY</b> lookup result from the alternate host or next-hop  lookup  key,  and  overrides  the
              global smtp_use_tls, smtp_enforce_tls and smtp_tls_enforce_peername settings.

       The  above  keywords  correspond to the "none", "may", "encrypt" and "verify" security levels for the
       new smtp_tls_security_level parameter introduced in Postfix 2.3. Starting with Postfix 2.3, and inde-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pendently&nbsp;independently</font>
       pendently  of how the policy is specified, the smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers and smtp_tls_mandatory_pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tocols&nbsp;smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols</font>
       tocols parameters only apply when TLS encryption is mandatory. Connections for  which  encryption  is
       optional enable all "export" grade and better ciphers.

       As  long as no secure DNS lookup mechanism is available, false hostnames in MX or CNAME responses can
       change the server hostname that Postfix uses for TLS policy lookup and server  certificate  verifica-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion.&nbsp;verification.</font>
       tion.  Even  with a perfect match between the server hostname and the server certificate, there is no
       guarantee that Postfix is connected to the right server.  See TLS_README (Closing a DNS loophole with
       obsolete per-site TLS policies) for a possible work-around.

       This  feature  is  available  in  Postfix 2.2 and later. With Postfix 2.3 and later use smtp_tls_pol-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">icy_maps&nbsp;smtp_tls_policy_maps</font>
       icy_maps instead.

<b>smtp_tls_policy_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Optional lookup tables with the Postfix SMTP client TLS security policy by next-hop destination; when
       a  non-empty  value  is  specified,  this  overrides  the  obsolete smtp_tls_per_site parameter.  See
       TLS_README for a more detailed discussion of TLS security levels.

       The TLS policy table is indexed by the full next-hop  destination,  which  is  either  the  recipient
       domain,  or the verbatim next-hop specified in the transport table, $local_transport, $virtual_trans-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">port,&nbsp;$virtual_transport,</font>
       port, $relay_transport or $default_transport. This includes any enclosing  square  brackets  and  any
       non-default  destination  server  port  suffix.  The  LMTP socket type prefix (inet: or unix:) is not
       included in the lookup key.

       Only the next-hop domain, or $myhostname with LMTP over UNIX-domain sockets, is used as  the  nexthop
       name  for  certificate verification. The port and any enclosing square brackets are used in the table
       lookup key, but are not used for server name verification.

       When the lookup key is a domain name without enclosing square brackets or any <u>:port</u> suffix (typically
       the  recipient  domain), and the full domain is not found in the table, just as with the <a href="transport.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/transport"><b>transport</b>(5)</a>
       table, the parent domain starting with a leading "." is matched recursively. This allows one to spec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ify&nbsp;specify</font>
       ify a security policy for a recipient domain and all its sub-domains.

       The  lookup result is a security level, followed by an optional list of whitespace and/or comma sepa-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rated&nbsp;separated</font>
       rated name=value attributes that override related main.cf settings. The TLS security levels in  order
       of increasing security are:

       <b>none</b>   No TLS. No additional attributes are supported at this level.

       <b>may</b>    Opportunistic  TLS. No additional attributes are supported at this level. Since sending in the
              clear is acceptable, demanding stronger than default TLS security  parameters  merely  reduces
              inter-operability.    Postfix   2.3   and  later  ignore  the  smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers  and
              smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols parameters at this security level; all protocols are allowed  and
              "export"  grade  or  better  ciphers  are  used.   When TLS handshakes fail, the connection is
              retried with TLS disabled.  This allows mail delivery  to  sites  with  non-interoperable  TLS
              implementations.

       <b>encrypt</b>
              Mandatory  TLS encryption. At this level and higher the optional "ciphers" attribute overrides
              the main.cf smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers parameter and the optional  "protocols"  keyword  over-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rides&nbsp;overrides</font>
              rides  the main.cf smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols parameter.  In the policy table, multiple pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tocols&nbsp;protocols</font>
              tocols must be separated by colons, as attribute values may not contain whitespace or  commas.

       <b>verify</b> Mandatory  TLS  verification.  At this security level, DNS MX lookups are trusted to be secure
              enough, and the name verified in the server certificate is  usually  obtained  indirectly  via
              unauthenticated  DNS  MX  lookups.   The  optional  "match"  attribute  overrides  the main.cf
              smtp_tls_verify_cert_match parameter. In the policy table, multiple match patterns and strate-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">gies&nbsp;strategies</font>
              gies  must  be separated by colons.  In practice explicit control over matching is more common
              with the "secure" policy, described below.

       <b>secure</b> Secure-channel TLS. At this security level, DNS MX lookups, though potentially used to  deter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mine&nbsp;determine</font>
              mine  the candidate next-hop gateway IP addresses, are <b>not</b> trusted to be secure enough for TLS
              peername verification. Instead, the  default  name  verified  in  the  server  certificate  is
              obtained  directly  from  the  next-hop,  or  is  explicitly  specified via the optional <b>match</b>
              attribute which overrides the main.cf smtp_tls_secure_cert_match parameter. In the policy  ta-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ble,&nbsp;table,</font>
              ble,  multiple match patterns and strategies must be separated by colons.  The match attribute
              is most useful when multiple domains are supported by common server, the  policy  entries  for
              additional  domains specify matching rules for the primary domain certificate. While transport
              table overrides routing the secondary domains to the primary nexthop also allow secure verifi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cation,&nbsp;verification,</font>
              cation,  they  risk  delivery  to  the  wrong destination when domains change hands or are re-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">assigned&nbsp;reassigned</font>
              assigned to new gateways. With the "match" attribute approach, routing is not  perturbed,  and
              mail is deferred if verification of a new MX host fails.

       Example:

       main.cf:
           smtp_tls_policy_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/tls_policy
       tls_policy:
           example.edu                 none
           example.mil                 may
           example.gov                 encrypt protocols=TLSv1
           example.com                 verify ciphers=high
           example.net                 secure
           .example.net                secure match=.example.net:example.net
           [mail.example.org]:587      secure match=nexthop

       <b>Note:</b>  The  <b>hostname</b>  strategy if listed in a non-default setting of smtp_tls_secure_cert_match or in
       the <b>match</b> attribute in the policy table can render the <b>secure</b> level vulnerable to DNS forgery. Do not
       use the <b>hostname</b> strategy for secure-channel configurations in environments where DNS security is not
       assured.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>smtp_tls_scert_verifydepth</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>5)</b>
       The verification depth for remote SMTP server certificates. A depth of 1 is sufficient, if  the  cer-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tificate&nbsp;certificate</font>
       tificate is directly issued by a CA listed in the CA files.  The default value (5) should suffice for
       longer chains (the root CA issues special CA which then issues the actual certificate...).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>smtp_tls_secure_cert_match</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>nexthop,</b> <b>dot-nexthop)</b>
       The server certificate peername verification method  for  the  "secure"  TLS  security  level.  In  a
       "secure" TLS policy table ($smtp_tls_policy_maps) entry the optional "match" attribute overrides this
       main.cf setting.

       This parameter specifies one or more patterns  or  strategies  separated  by  commas,  whitespace  or
       colons.  In the policy table the only valid separator is the colon character.

       For  a  description  of the pattern and strategy syntax see the smtp_tls_verify_cert_match parameter.
       The "hostname" strategy should be avoided in this context, as in the absence of a secure global  DNS,
       using  the results of MX lookups in certificate verification is not immune to active (man-in-the-mid-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dle)&nbsp;(man-in-the-middle)</font>
       dle) attacks on DNS.

       Sample main.cf setting:

       smtp_tls_secure_cert_match = nexthop

       Sample policy table override:

       example.net     secure match=example.com:.example.com
       \&amp;.example.net    secure match=example.com:.example.com

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>smtp_tls_security_level</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       The default SMTP TLS security level for the Postfix SMTP client; when a non-empty value is specified,
       this overrides the obsolete parameters smtp_use_tls, smtp_enforce_tls, and smtp_tls_enforce_peername.

       Specify one of the following security levels:

       <b>none</b>   TLS will not be used unless enabled for specific destinations via smtp_tls_policy_maps.

       <b>may</b>    Opportunistic TLS. TLS will be used if supported by the server. Since sending in the clear  is
              acceptable, demanding stronger than default TLS security parameters merely reduces inter-oper-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ability.&nbsp;inter-operability.</font>
              ability. Postfix 2.3 and  later  ignore  the  smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers  and  smtp_tls_manda-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tory_protocols&nbsp;smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols</font>
              tory_protocols parameters at this security level; all protocols are allowed and "export" grade
              or better ciphers are used.  When TLS handshakes fail, the connection is retried with TLS dis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">abled.&nbsp;disabled.</font>
              abled.  This allows mail delivery to sites with non-interoperable TLS implementations.

       <b>encrypt</b>
              Mandatory  TLS  encryption. Since a minimum level of security is intended, it reasonable to be
              specific about sufficiently secure protocol versions and ciphers. At this security  level  and
              higher,  the  main.cf  parameters  smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols and smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers
              specify the TLS protocols and minimum cipher grade which the  administrator  considers  secure
              enough for mandatory encrypted sessions. This security level is not an appropriate default for
              systems delivering mail to the Internet.

       <b>verify</b> Mandatory TLS verification. At this security level, DNS MX lookups are trusted  to  be  secure
              enough,  and  the  name  verified in the server certificate is usually obtained indirectly via
              unauthenticated DNS MX lookups. The  smtp_tls_verify_cert_match  parameter  controls  how  the
              server  name  is  verified.  In  practice explicit control over matching is more common at the
              "secure" level, described below. This security level is not an appropriate default for systems
              delivering mail to the Internet.

       <b>secure</b> Secure-channel TLS.  At this security level, DNS MX lookups, though potentially used to deter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mine&nbsp;determine</font>
              mine the candidate next-hop gateway IP addresses, are <b>not</b> trusted to be secure enough for  TLS
              peername  verification.  Instead,  the  default  name  verified  in  the server certificate is
              obtained from the next-hop domain as specified in the smtp_tls_secure_cert_match configuration
              parameter.  The  default  matching  rule is that a server certificate matches when its name is
              equal to or is a sub-domain of the nexthop domain. This security level is not  an  appropriate
              default for systems delivering mail to the Internet.

       Examples:

       No TLS, old-style: smtp_use_tls=no and smtp_enforce_tls=no.
       main.cf:
           smtp_tls_security_level = none

       Opportunistic TLS:
       main.cf:
           smtp_tls_security_level = may

       Mandatory (high-grade) TLS encryption:
       main.cf:
           smtp_tls_security_level = encrypt
           smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers = high

       Mandatory TLS verification, of hostname or nexthop domain:
       main.cf:
           smtp_tls_security_level = verify
           smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers = high
           smtp_tls_verify_cert_match = hostname, nexthop, dot-nexthop

       Secure channel TLS with exact nexthop name matching:
       main.cf:
           smtp_tls_security_level = secure
           smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols = TLSv1
           smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers = high
           smtp_tls_secure_cert_match = nexthop

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>smtp_tls_session_cache_database</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Name  of  the  file containing the optional Postfix SMTP client TLS session cache. Specify a database
       type that supports enumeration, such as <b>btree</b> or <b>sdbm</b>; there is no need to support concurrent access.
       The  file  is  created if it does not exist. The <a href="../man8/smtp.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/smtp"><b>smtp</b>(8)</a> daemon does not use this parameter directly,
       rather the cache is implemented indirectly in the <a href="../man8/tlsmgr.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/tlsmgr"><b>tlsmgr</b>(8)</a> daemon. This means that per-smtp-instance
       master.cf overrides of this parameter are not effective.  Note, that each of the cache databases sup-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ported&nbsp;supported</font>
       ported by <a href="../man8/tlsmgr.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/tlsmgr"><b>tlsmgr</b>(8)</a> daemon: $smtpd_tls_session_cache_database, $smtp_tls_session_cache_database  (and
       with Postfix 2.3 and later $lmtp_session_cache_database), needs to be stored separately, it is not at
       this time possible to store multiple caches in a single database.

       Note: <b>dbm</b> databases are not suitable. TLS session objects are too large.

       Example:

       smtp_tls_session_cache_database = btree:/var/spool/postfix/smtp_scache

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>smtp_tls_session_cache_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>3600s)</b>
       The expiration time of Postfix SMTP client TLS session cache information.  A cache  cleanup  is  per-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">formed&nbsp;performed</font>
       formed   periodically   every   $smtp_tls_session_cache_timeout   seconds.   As  with  $smtp_tls_ses-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion_cache_database,&nbsp;$smtp_tls_session_cache_database,</font>
       sion_cache_database, this parameter is implemented in the <a href="../man8/tlsmgr.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/tlsmgr"><b>tlsmgr</b>(8)</a> daemon  and  therefore  per-smtp-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">instance&nbsp;per-smtpinstance</font>
       instance master.cf overrides are not possible.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>smtp_tls_verify_cert_match</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>hostname)</b>
       The  server  certificate peername verification method for the "verify" TLS security level. In a "ver-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ify"&nbsp;"verify"</font>
       ify" TLS policy table ($smtp_tls_policy_maps) entry the optional  "match"  attribute  overrides  this
       main.cf setting.

       This  parameter  specifies  one  or  more  patterns  or strategies separated by commas, whitespace or
       colons.  In the policy table the only valid separator is the colon character.

       Patterns specify domain names, or domain name suffixes:

       <u>example.com</u>
              Match the <u>example.com</u> domain, i.e. one of the names  the  server  certificate  must  be  <u>exam</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ple.com,&nbsp;example.com,</font>
              <u>ple.com</u>, upper and lower case distinctions are ignored.

       <u>.example.com</u>
              Match  subdomains  of the <u>example.com</u> domain, i.e. match a name in the server certificate that
              consists of a non-zero number of labels followed by a <u>.example.com</u> suffix.  Case  distinctions
              are ignored.

       Strategies  specify a transformation from the next-hop domain to the expected name in the server cer-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tificate:&nbsp;certificate:</font>
       tificate:

       nexthop
              Match against the next-hop domain, which is either the  recipient  domain,  or  the  transport
              next-hop  configured  for  the  domain  stripped of any optional socket type prefix, enclosing
              square brackets and trailing port. When MX lookups are not suppressed, this  is  the  original
              nexthop  domain prior to the MX lookup, not the result of the MX lookup. For LMTP delivery via
              UNIX-domain sockets, the verified next-hop name is $myhostname.  This strategy is suitable for
              use with the "secure" policy. Case is ignored.

       dot-nexthop
              As  above, but match server certificate names that are subdomains of the next-hop domain. Case
              is ignored.

       hostname
              Match against the hostname of the server, often obtained via an unauthenticated DNS MX lookup.
              For  LMTP delivery via UNIX-domain sockets, the verified name is $myhostname. This matches the
              verification strategy of the "MUST" keyword in the obsolete smtp_tls_per_site  table,  and  is
              suitable  for  use  with  the  "verify"  security level. When the next-hop name is enclosed in
              square brackets to suppress MX lookups, the "hostname" strategy is the same as  the  "nexthop"
              strategy. Case is ignored.

       Sample main.cf setting:

       smtp_tls_verify_cert_match = hostname, nexthop, dot-nexthop

       Sample policy table override:

       example.com     verify  match=hostname:nexthop
       \&amp;.example.com    verify  match=example.com:.example.com:hostname

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>smtp_use_tls</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
       Opportunistic  mode: use TLS when a remote SMTP server announces STARTTLS support, otherwise send the
       mail in the clear. Beware: some SMTP servers offer STARTTLS even if it is not configured.  With Post-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fix&nbsp;Postfix</font>
       fix  &lt;  2.3,  if  the TLS handshake fails, and no other server is available, delivery is deferred and
       mail stays in the queue. If this is a concern for you, use the smtp_tls_per_site feature instead.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later. With Postfix 2.3  and  later  use  smtp_tls_secu-
       rity_level instead.

<b>smtp_xforward_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>300s)</b>
       The SMTP client time limit for sending the XFORWARD command, and for receiving the server response.

       Time  units:  s  (seconds),  m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit is s
       (seconds).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>smtpd_authorized_verp_clients</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$authorized_verp_clients)</b>
       What SMTP clients are allowed to specify the XVERP command.   This  command  requests  that  mail  be
       delivered one recipient at a time with a per recipient return address.

       By default, no clients are allowed to specify XVERP.

       This  parameter  was renamed with Postfix version 2.1. The default value is backwards compatible with
       Postfix version 2.0.

       Specify a list of network/netmask patterns, separated by commas and/or whitespace. The mask specifies
       the number of bits in the network part of a host address. You can also specify hostnames or \&amp;.domain
       names (the initial dot causes the domain to match any name below it),  "/file/name"  or  "type:table"
       patterns.  A "/file/name" pattern is replaced by its contents; a "type:table" lookup table is matched
       when a table entry matches a lookup string (the lookup result is ignored).  Continue  long  lines  by
       starting  the  next  line  with whitespace. Specify "!pattern" to exclude an address or network block
       from the list. The form "!/file/name" is supported only in Postfix version 2.4 and later.

       Note:  IP  version  6  address  information  must  be  specified  inside  []  in   the   smtpd_autho-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rized_verp_clients&nbsp;smtpd_authorized_verp_clients</font>

       the ":" character, and would otherwise be confused with a "type:table" pattern.

<b>smtpd_authorized_xclient_hosts</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       What SMTP clients are allowed to use the XCLIENT feature.  This command overrides SMTP client  infor-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mation&nbsp;information</font>
       mation that is used for access control. Typical use is for SMTP-based content filters, fetchmail-like
       programs, or SMTP server access rule testing. See the XCLIENT_README document for details.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

       By default, no clients are allowed to specify XCLIENT.

       Specify a list of network/netmask patterns, separated by commas and/or whitespace. The mask specifies
       the number of bits in the network part of a host address. You can also specify hostnames or \&amp;.domain
       names (the initial dot causes the domain to match any name below it),  "/file/name"  or  "type:table"
       patterns.  A "/file/name" pattern is replaced by its contents; a "type:table" lookup table is matched
       when a table entry matches a lookup string (the lookup result is ignored).  Continue  long  lines  by
       starting  the  next  line  with whitespace. Specify "!pattern" to exclude an address or network block
       from the list. The form "!/file/name" is supported only in Postfix version 2.4 and later.

       Note:  IP  version  6  address  information  must  be  specified  inside  []  in   the   smtpd_autho-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rized_xclient_hosts&nbsp;smtpd_authorized_xclient_hosts</font>
       rized_xclient_hosts  value, and in files specified with "/file/name".  IP version 6 addresses contain
       the ":" character, and would otherwise be confused with a "type:table" pattern.

<b>smtpd_authorized_xforward_hosts</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       What SMTP clients are allowed to use the XFORWARD feature.  This command forwards information that is
       used  to  improve  logging  after  SMTP-based  content  filters. See the XFORWARD_README document for
       details.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

       By default, no clients are allowed to specify XFORWARD.

       Specify a list of network/netmask patterns, separated by commas and/or whitespace. The mask specifies
       the number of bits in the network part of a host address. You can also specify hostnames or \&amp;.domain
       names (the initial dot causes the domain to match any name below it),  "/file/name"  or  "type:table"
       patterns.  A "/file/name" pattern is replaced by its contents; a "type:table" lookup table is matched
       when a table entry matches a lookup string (the lookup result is ignored).  Continue  long  lines  by
       starting  the  next  line  with whitespace. Specify "!pattern" to exclude an address or network block
       from the list. The form "!/file/name" is supported only in Postfix version 2.4 and later.

       Note: IP version 6 address information must be specified  inside  []  in  the  smtpd_authorized_xfor-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ward_hosts&nbsp;smtpd_authorized_xforward_hosts</font>
       ward_hosts  value,  and in files specified with "/file/name".  IP version 6 addresses contain the ":"
       character, and would otherwise be confused with a "type:table" pattern.

<b>smtpd_banner</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$myhostname</b> <b>ESMTP</b> <b>$mail_name)</b>
       The text that follows the 220 status code in the SMTP greeting banner. Some people like  to  see  the
       mail version advertised. By default, Postfix shows no version.

       You MUST specify $myhostname at the start of the text. This is required by the SMTP protocol.

       Example:

       smtpd_banner = $myhostname ESMTP $mail_name ($mail_version)

<b>smtpd_client_connection_count_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>50)</b>
       How  many  simultaneous  connections  any client is allowed to make to this service.  By default, the
       limit is set to half the default process limit value.

       To disable this feature, specify a limit of 0.

       Clients  that are excluded from connection count, connection rate, or SMTP request rate restrictions.
       See the mynetworks parameter description for the parameter value syntax.

       By default, clients in trusted networks are excluded. Specify a list of network blocks, hostnames  or
       .domain names (the initial dot causes the domain to match any name below it).

       Note:    IP    version    6    address   information   must   be   specified   inside   []   in   the

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>smtpd_client_message_rate_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>0)</b>
       The  maximal  number  of message delivery requests that any client is allowed to make to this service
       per time unit, regardless of whether or not Postfix actually accepts those messages.  The  time  unit
       is specified with the anvil_rate_time_unit configuration parameter.

       <b>permit_inet_interfaces</b>
              Permit the request when the client IP address matches $inet_interfaces.

       <b>permit_mynetworks</b>
              Permit the request when the client IP address matches any network or network address listed in
              $mynetworks.

              option must be used only if a special CA issues the certificates and only this CA is listed as
              trusted  CA,  otherwise  all  clients with a recognized certificate would be allowed to relay.
              This feature is available with Postfix version 2.2.

       <b>permit_tls_clientcerts</b>

              The maps_rbl_reject_code parameter specifies the response code for rejected requests (default:
              554),  the  default_rbl_reply   parameter  specifies  the  default  server  reply,   and   the

       <b>reject_unknown_client_hostname</b> (with Postfix &lt; 2.3: reject_unknown_client)
              Reject the request when 1) the client IP address-&gt;name mapping  fails,  2)  the  name-&gt;address
              mapping fails, or 3) the name-&gt;address mapping does not match the client IP address.
              This  is a stronger restriction than the reject_unknown_reverse_client_hostname feature, which
              triggers only under condition 1) above.
              The unknown_client_reject_code parameter specifies the response  code  for  rejected  requests
              (default:  450).  The  reply  is  always 450 in case the address-&gt;name or name-&gt;address lookup
              failed due to a temporary problem.

       <b>reject_unknown_reverse_client_hostname</b>
              Reject the request when the client IP address has no address-&gt;name mapping.
              This is a weaker restriction than the reject_unknown_client_hostname feature,  which  requires
              not  only  that the address-&gt;name and name-&gt;address mappings exist, but also that the two map-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pings&nbsp;mappings</font>
              pings reproduce the client IP address.
              The unknown_client_reject_code parameter specifies the response  code  for  rejected  requests
              (default: 450).  The reply is always 450 in case the address-&gt;name lookup failed due to a tem-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">porary&nbsp;temporary</font>
              porary problem.
              This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

       In addition, you can use any of the following generic restrictions.  These restrictions are  applica-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ble&nbsp;applicable</font>
       ble in any SMTP command context.

       <b>check_policy_service</b> <u>servername</u>
              Query the specified policy server. See the SMTPD_POLICY_README document for details. This fea-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ture&nbsp;feature</font>
              ture is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

       <b>defer</b>  Defer the request. The client is told to try again later. This restriction is  useful  at  the
              end of a restriction list, to make the default policy explicit.
              The defer_code parameter specifies the SMTP server reply code (default: 450).

       <b>defer_if_permit</b>
              Defer  the  request  if  some later restriction would result in an explicit or implicit PERMIT
              action.  This is useful when a blacklisting feature fails due to a  temporary  problem.   This
              feature is available in Postfix version 2.1 and later.

       <b>defer_if_reject</b>
              Defer  the  request if some later restriction would result in a REJECT action.  This is useful
              when a whitelisting feature fails due to a temporary problem.  This feature  is  available  in
              Postfix version 2.1 and later.

       <b>permit</b> Permit  the  request. This restriction is useful at the end of a restriction list, to make the
              default policy explicit.

       <b>reject_multi_recipient_bounce</b>
              Reject the request when the envelope sender is the null address, and the message has  multiple
              envelope  recipients.  This  usage  has rare but legitimate applications: under certain condi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tions,&nbsp;conditions,</font>
              tions, multi-recipient mail that was posted with the DSN option NOTIFY=NEVER may be  forwarded
              with the null sender address.
               Note:  this  restriction  can  only  work  reliably  when  used in smtpd_data_restrictions or
              smtpd_end_of_data_restrictions, because the total number of recipients is not known at an ear-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lier&nbsp;earlier</font>
              lier  stage  of the SMTP conversation.  Use at the RCPT stage will only reject the second etc.
              recipient.
              The multi_recipient_bounce_reject_code parameter specifies  the  response  code  for  rejected
              requests (default:  550).  This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

       <b>reject_plaintext_session</b>
              Reject  the  request when the connection is not encrypted. This restriction should not be used
              before the client has had a chance to negotiate encryption with the AUTH or STARTTLS commands.
              The  plaintext_reject_code  parameter  specifies  the  response  code  for  rejected  requests
              (default:  450).  This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

       <b>reject_unauth_pipelining</b>
              Reject the request when the client sends SMTP commands ahead of time where it is not  allowed,
              or  when  the  client  sends SMTP commands ahead of time without knowing that Postfix actually
              supports ESMTP command pipelining. This stops mail from bulk  mail  software  that  improperly
              uses ESMTP command pipelining in order to speed up deliveries.
              Note:  reject_unauth_pipelining  is  not  useful  outside  smtpd_data_restrictions when 1) the
              client uses ESMTP (EHLO instead of HELO) and 2) with "smtpd_delay_reject = yes" (the default).
              The  use of reject_unauth_pipelining in the other restriction contexts is therefore not recom-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mended.&nbsp;recommended.</font>
              mended.

       <b>reject</b> Reject the request. This restriction is useful at the end of a restriction list, to  make  the
              default  policy explicit.  The reject_code configuration parameter specifies the response code
              to rejected requests (default: 554).

       <b>sleep</b> <u>seconds</u>
              Pause for the specified number of seconds and proceed with the next restriction in  the  list,
              if any. This may stop zombie mail when used as:

       /etc/postfix/main.cf:
           smtpd_client_restrictions =
               sleep 1, reject_unauth_pipelining
           smtpd_delay_reject = no
       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3.

       <b>warn_if_reject</b>
              Change  the  meaning of the next restriction, so that it logs a warning instead of rejecting a
              request (look for logfile records that contain "reject_warning"). This is useful  for  testing
              new restrictions in a "live" environment without risking unnecessary loss of mail.

       Other restrictions that are valid in this context:

             SMTP  command  specific  restrictions  that  are  described under the smtpd_helo_restrictions,
              smtpd_sender_restrictions or smtpd_recipient_restrictions parameters.  When  helo,  sender  or
              recipient  restrictions are listed under smtpd_client_restrictions, they have effect only with
              "smtpd_delay_reject = yes", so that $smtpd_client_restrictions is evaluated at the time of the
              RCPT TO command.

       Example:

       smtpd_client_restrictions = permit_mynetworks, reject_unknown_client_hostname

<b>smtpd_data_restrictions</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Optional  access  restrictions  that  the Postfix SMTP server applies in the context of the SMTP DATA
       command.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

       Specify a list of restrictions, separated by commas and/or whitespace.  Continue long lines by start-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;starting</font>
       ing  the  next  line  with whitespace.  Restrictions are applied in the order as specified; the first
       restriction that matches wins.

       The following restrictions are valid in this context:

             Generic  restrictions  that  can  be  used  in  any  SMTP  command  context,  described  under
              smtpd_client_restrictions.

             SMTP    command    specific    restrictions    described    under   smtpd_client_restrictions,
              smtpd_helo_restrictions, smtpd_sender_restrictions or smtpd_recipient_restrictions.

       Examples:

       smtpd_data_restrictions = reject_unauth_pipelining
       smtpd_data_restrictions = reject_multi_recipient_bounce

<b>smtpd_delay_open_until_valid_rcpt</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b>
       Postpone the start of an SMTP mail transaction until a valid RCPT TO  command  is  received.  Specify
       "no" to create a mail transaction as soon as the SMTP server receives a valid MAIL FROM command.

       With  sites  that  reject  lots  of mail, the default setting reduces the use of disk, CPU and memory
       resources. The downside is that rejected recipients are logged with NOQUEUE instead of a mail  trans-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">action&nbsp;transaction</font>
       action ID. This complicates the logfile analysis of multi-recipient mail.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>smtpd_delay_reject</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b>
       Wait until the RCPT TO command before evaluating $smtpd_client_restrictions, $smtpd_helo_restrictions
       and   $smtpd_sender_restrictions,   or   wait   until   the   ETRN    command    before    evaluating
       $smtpd_client_restrictions and $smtpd_helo_restrictions.

       This feature is turned on by default because some clients apparently mis-behave when the Postfix SMTP
       server rejects commands before RCPT TO.

       The default setting has one major benefit: it allows Postfix to  log  recipient  address  information
       when rejecting a client name/address or sender address, so that it is possible to find out whose mail
       is being rejected.

<b>smtpd_discard_ehlo_keyword_address_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Lookup tables, indexed by the remote SMTP client address, with case insensitive lists  of  EHLO  key-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">words&nbsp;keywords</font>
       words (pipelining, starttls, auth, etc.) that the SMTP server will not send in the EHLO response to a
       remote SMTP client. See smtpd_discard_ehlo_keywords for details.  The table is not searched by  host-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">name&nbsp;hostname</font>
       name for robustness reasons.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>smtpd_discard_ehlo_keywords</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       A case insensitive list of EHLO keywords (pipelining, starttls, auth, etc.) that the SMTP server will
       not send in the EHLO response to a remote SMTP client.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

       Notes:

             Specify the <b>silent-discard</b> pseudo keyword to prevent this action from being logged.

             Use the smtpd_discard_ehlo_keyword_address_maps feature to discard EHLO keywords  selectively.

<b>smtpd_end_of_data_restrictions</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Optional  access restrictions that the Postfix SMTP server applies in the context of the SMTP END-OF-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">DATA&nbsp;END-OFDATA</font>
       DATA command.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

       See smtpd_data_restrictions for syntax details.

<b>smtpd_enforce_tls</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
       Mandatory TLS: announce STARTTLS support to SMTP clients, and require that clients  use  TLS  encryp-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion.&nbsp;encryption.</font>
       tion.   According  to RFC 2487 this MUST NOT be applied in case of a publicly-referenced SMTP server.
       This option is off by default and should be used only on dedicated servers.

       Note 1: "smtpd_enforce_tls = yes" implies "smtpd_tls_auth_only = yes".

       Note 2: when invoked via "<b>sendmail</b> <b>-bs</b>", Postfix will never offer STARTTLS due to insufficient privi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">leges&nbsp;privileges</font>
       leges to access the server private key. This is intended behavior.

       This  feature  is  available in Postfix 2.2 and later. With Postfix 2.3 and later use smtpd_tls_secu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rity_level&nbsp;smtpd_tls_security_level</font>
       rity_level instead.

<b>smtpd_error_sleep_time</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1s)</b>
       With Postfix version 2.1 and later: the SMTP server response delay after a client has made more  than
       $smtpd_soft_error_limit  errors,  and  fewer  than $smtpd_hard_error_limit errors, without delivering
       mail.

       With Postfix version 2.0 and earlier: the SMTP server delay before sending  a  reject  (4xx  or  5xx)
       response, when the client has made fewer than $smtpd_soft_error_limit errors without delivering mail.

<b>smtpd_etrn_restrictions</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Optional SMTP server access restrictions in the context of a client ETRN request.

       The Postfix ETRN implementation accepts only destinations that are eligible  for  the  Postfix  "fast
       flush" service. See the ETRN_README file for details.

       Specify a list of restrictions, separated by commas and/or whitespace.  Continue long lines by start-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;starting</font>
       ing the next line with whitespace.  Restrictions are applied in the order  as  specified;  the  first
       restriction that matches wins.

       The  following  restrictions  are specific to the domain name information received with the ETRN com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand.&nbsp;command.</font>
       mand.

       <b>check_etrn_access</b> <u>type:table</u>

       Other restrictions that are valid in this context:

             Generic  restrictions  that  can  be  used  in  any  SMTP  command  context,  described  under
              smtpd_client_restrictions.

             SMTP   command   specific   restrictions   described   under   smtpd_client_restrictions   and
              smtpd_helo_restrictions.

       Example:

<b>smtpd_expansion_filter</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b>
       What characters are allowed in $name expansions of RBL reply templates. Characters not in the allowed
       set are replaced by "_".  Use C like escapes to specify special characters such as whitespace.

       This parameter is not subjected to $parameter expansion.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

<b>smtpd_forbidden_commands</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>CONNECT,</b> <b>GET,</b> <b>POST)</b>
       List of commands that causes the Postfix SMTP server to immediately terminate the session with a  221
       code.  This can be used to disconnect clients that obviously attempt to abuse the system. In addition
       to the commands listed in this parameter, commands that follow the "Label:" format of message headers
       will also cause a disconnect.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>smtpd_hard_error_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>20)</b>
       The  maximal  number  of  errors a remote SMTP client is allowed to make without delivering mail. The
       Postfix SMTP server disconnects when the limit is exceeded.

<b>smtpd_helo_required</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
       Require that a remote SMTP client introduces itself at the beginning of an SMTP session with the HELO
       or EHLO command.

       Example:

       smtpd_helo_required = yes

<b>smtpd_helo_restrictions</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Optional restrictions that the Postfix SMTP server applies in the context of the SMTP HELO command.

       The default is to permit everything.

       <b>reject_invalid_helo_hostname</b> (with Postfix &lt; 2.3: reject_invalid_hostname)
              Reject the request when the HELO or EHLO hostname syntax is invalid.
              The  invalid_hostname_reject_code  specifies  the response code to rejected requests (default:
              501).

       <b>reject_non_fqdn_helo_hostname</b> (with Postfix &lt; 2.3: reject_non_fqdn_hostname)
              Reject the request when the HELO or EHLO hostname is not in fully-qualified  domain  form,  as

              Reject the request when the HELO or EHLO hostname has no DNS A or MX record.
              The unknown_hostname_reject_code specifies the response code to  rejected  requests  (default:
              450).

       Other restrictions that are valid in this context:

             Generic  restrictions  that  can  be  used  in  any  SMTP  command  context,  described  under
              smtpd_client_restrictions.

              tions, they have effect only with "smtpd_delay_reject = yes", so that $smtpd_helo_restrictions
              is evaluated at the time of the RCPT TO command.

       Examples:

       smtpd_helo_restrictions = permit_mynetworks, reject_invalid_helo_hostname
       smtpd_helo_restrictions = permit_mynetworks, reject_unknown_helo_hostname

<b>smtpd_history_flush_threshold</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>100)</b>
       The maximal number of lines in the Postfix SMTP server command history  before  it  is  flushed  upon
       receipt of EHLO, RSET, or end of DATA.

<b>smtpd_junk_command_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>100)</b>
       The  number of junk commands (NOOP, VRFY, ETRN or RSET) that a remote SMTP client can send before the
       Postfix SMTP server starts to increment the error counter with each junk command.  The  junk  command
       count   is   reset   after   mail   is   delivered.    See   also   the   smtpd_error_sleep_time  and
       smtpd_soft_error_limit configuration parameters.

<b>smtpd_milters</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>

<b>smtpd_noop_commands</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       List  of  commands  that  the  Postfix SMTP server replies to with "250 Ok", without doing any syntax
       checks and without changing state.  This list overrides any commands  built  into  the  Postfix  SMTP
       server.

<b>smtpd_null_access_lookup_key</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>&lt;&gt;)</b>
       The lookup key to be used in SMTP <a href="access.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/access"><b>access</b>(5)</a> tables instead of the null sender address.

<b>smtpd_peername_lookup</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b>
       Attempt  to  look  up the remote SMTP client hostname, and verify that the name matches the client IP
       address. A client name is set to "unknown" when it cannot be looked up  or  verified,  or  when  name
       lookup is disabled.  Turning off name lookup reduces delays due to DNS lookup and increases the maxi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mal&nbsp;maximal</font>
       mal inbound delivery rate.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>smtpd_policy_service_max_idle</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>300s)</b>
       The time after which an idle SMTPD policy service connection is closed.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>smtpd_policy_service_max_ttl</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1000s)</b>
       The time after which an active SMTPD policy service connection is closed.

<b>smtpd_policy_service_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>100s)</b>
       The time limit for connecting to, writing to or receiving from a delegated SMTPD policy server.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>smtpd_proxy_ehlo</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$myhostname)</b>
       How the Postfix SMTP server announces itself to the proxy filter.  By default, the  Postfix  hostname
       is used.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>smtpd_proxy_filter</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       The  hostname  and TCP port of the mail filtering proxy server.  The proxy receives all mail from the
       Postfix SMTP server, and is supposed to give the result to another Postfix SMTP server process.

       Specify "host:port" or "inet:host:port" for a TCP endpoint, or "unix:pathname" for a UNIX-domain end-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">point.&nbsp;endpoint.</font>
       point.  The  host  can  be  specified as an IP address or as a symbolic name; no MX lookups are done.
       When no "host" or "host:"  are specified, the local machine is assumed.  Pathname  interpretation  is
       relative to the Postfix queue directory.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

       The "inet:" and "unix:" prefixes are available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>smtpd_proxy_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>100s)</b>
       The  time  limit  for  connecting to a proxy filter and for sending or receiving information.  When a

<b>smtpd_recipient_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1000)</b>
       The maximal number of recipients that the Postfix SMTP server accepts per message delivery request.

<b>smtpd_recipient_overshoot_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1000)</b>
       The number of recipients that a remote SMTP client can send in excess of  the  limit  specified  with
       $smtpd_recipient_limit,  before  the  Postfix  SMTP server increments the per-session error count for
       each excess recipient.

<b>smtpd_recipient_restrictions</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>permit_mynetworks,</b> <b>reject_unauth_destination)</b>
       The access restrictions that the Postfix SMTP server applies in the context of the RCPT TO command.

       By default, the Postfix SMTP server accepts:

             Mail from clients whose IP address matches $mynetworks, or:

             Mail to remote destinations that match  $relay_domains,  except  for  addresses  that  contain
              sender-specified routing (user@elsewhere@domain), or:

             Mail  to  local destinations that match $inet_interfaces or $proxy_interfaces, $mydestination,
              $virtual_alias_domains, or $virtual_mailbox_domains.

       IMPORTANT: If you change this parameter setting, you must specify  at  least  one  of  the  following
       restrictions. Otherwise Postfix will refuse to receive mail:

           reject, defer, defer_if_permit, reject_unauth_destination

       Specify a list of restrictions, separated by commas and/or whitespace.  Continue long lines by start-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;starting</font>
       ing the next line with whitespace.  Restrictions are applied in the order  as  specified;  the  first
       restriction that matches wins.

       The  following  restrictions  are specific to the recipient address that is received with the RCPT TO
       command.

       <b>check_recipient_access</b> <u>type:table</u>
              Search the specified <a href="access.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/access"><b>access</b>(5)</a> database for the  resolved  RCPT  TO  address,  domain,  parent
              domains, or localpart@, and execute the corresponding action.

              Search  the specified <a href="access.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/access"><b>access</b>(5)</a> database for the MX hosts for the RCPT TO address, and execute
              the corresponding action.  Note: a result of "OK" is not allowed for safety reasons.  Instead,
              use  DUNNO  in  order to exclude specific hosts from blacklists.  This feature is available in
              Postfix 2.1 and later.

       <b>check_recipient_ns_access</b> <u>type:table</u>
              Search the specified <a href="access.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/access"><b>access</b>(5)</a> database for the DNS servers for the RCPT TO address, and  exe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cute&nbsp;execute</font>
              cute  the  corresponding  action.   Note:  a result of "OK" is not allowed for safety reasons.
              Instead, use DUNNO in order to exclude specific hosts from blacklists.  This feature is avail-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able&nbsp;available</font>
              able in Postfix 2.1 and later.

       <b>permit_auth_destination</b>
              Permit the request when one of the following is true:

             Postfix  is mail forwarder: the resolved RCPT TO address matches $relay_domains or a subdomain
              thereof, and the address contains no sender-specified routing (user@elsewhere@domain),

             Postfix is the final  destination:  the  resolved  RCPT  TO  address  matches  $mydestination,
              $inet_interfaces,  $proxy_interfaces, $virtual_alias_domains, or $virtual_mailbox_domains, and
              the address contains no sender-specified routing (user@elsewhere@domain).

       <b>permit_mx_backup</b>
              Permit the request when the local mail system is backup MX for the RCPT TO  address,  or  when
              the address is an authorized destination (see permit_auth_destination for definition).

             Safety: permit_mx_backup does not accept addresses that have sender-specified routing informa-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;information</font>
              tion (example: user@elsewhere@domain).

             Safety: permit_mx_backup can be vulnerable to mis-use when access is not restricted with  per-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mit_mx_backup_networks.&nbsp;permit_mx_backup_networks.</font>
              mit_mx_backup_networks.

             Safety:  as  of  Postfix  version 2.3, permit_mx_backup no longer accepts the address when the
              local mail system is primary MX for the recipient domain.  Exception: permit_mx_backup accepts
              the address when it specifies an authorized destination (see permit_auth_destination for defi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nition).&nbsp;definition).</font>
              nition).

             Limitation: mail may be rejected in case of a temporary DNS lookup problem with Postfix  prior
              to version 2.0.

       <b>reject_non_fqdn_recipient</b>
              Reject the request when the RCPT TO address is not in fully-qualified domain form, as required
              by the RFC.
              The non_fqdn_reject_code parameter specifies the response code to rejected requests  (default:
              504).

       <b>reject_rhsbl_recipient</b> <u>rbl</u><b>_</b><u>domain=d.d.d.d</u>
              Reject  the  request  when  the  RCPT  TO  domain  is listed with the A record "<u>d.d.d.d</u>" under
              <u>rbl</u><b>_</b><u>domain</u> (Postfix version 2.1 and later only).  If no "<u>=d.d.d.d</u>" is  specified,  reject  the
              request when the RCPT TO domain is listed with any A record under <u>rbl</u><b>_</b><u>domain</u>.
              The maps_rbl_reject_code parameter specifies the response code for rejected requests (default:
              554);  the  default_rbl_reply  parameter  specifies  the  default  server   reply;   and   the
              rbl_reply_maps  parameter  specifies  tables  with server replies indexed by <u>rbl</u><b>_</b><u>domain</u>.  This
              feature is available in Postfix version 2.0 and later.

       <b>reject_unauth_destination</b>
              Reject the request unless one of the following is true:

             Postfix is mail forwarder: the resolved RCPT TO address matches $relay_domains or a  subdomain
              thereof, and contains no sender-specified routing (user@elsewhere@domain),

             Postfix  is  the  final  destination:  the  resolved  RCPT  TO address matches $mydestination,
              $inet_interfaces, $proxy_interfaces, $virtual_alias_domains, or $virtual_mailbox_domains,  and
              contains no sender-specified routing (user@elsewhere@domain).
               The  relay_domains_reject_code  parameter  specifies  the response code for rejected requests
              (default: 554).

       <b>reject_unknown_recipient_domain</b>
              Reject the request when Postfix is not final destination for the recipient  address,  and  the
              RCPT  TO  address  has  no  DNS A or MX record, or when it has a malformed MX record such as a
              record with a zero-length MX hostname (Postfix version 2.3 and later).
              The unknown_address_reject_code parameter specifies the response code  for  rejected  requests
              (default: 450).  The response is always 450 in case of a temporary DNS error.

       <b>reject_unlisted_recipient</b> (with Postfix version 2.0: check_recipient_maps)
              Reject  the request when the RCPT TO address is not listed in the list of valid recipients for
              its domain class. See the smtpd_reject_unlisted_recipient parameter description  for  details.
              This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

       <b>reject_unverified_recipient</b>
              Reject  the request when mail to the RCPT TO address is known to bounce, or when the recipient
              address destination is not reachable.  Address verification information is managed by the <a href="../man8/verify.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/verify"><b>ver</b></a>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ify(8)&nbsp;verify(8)</font>

              The unverified_recipient_reject_code parameter specifies the response when an address is known
              to bounce (default: 450, change into 550 when you are confident that it is  safe  to  do  so).
              Postfix  replies  with 450 when an address probe failed due to a temporary problem.  This fea-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ture&nbsp;feature</font>
              ture is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

       Other restrictions that are valid in this context:

             Generic  restrictions  that  can  be  used  in  any  SMTP  command  context,  described  under
              smtpd_client_restrictions.

             SMTP    command    specific    restrictions    described    under   smtpd_client_restrictions,
              smtpd_helo_restrictions and smtpd_sender_restrictions.

       Example:

       smtpd_recipient_restrictions = permit_mynetworks, reject_unauth_destination

<b>smtpd_reject_unlisted_recipient</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b>
       Request that the Postfix SMTP server rejects mail for  unknown  recipient  addresses,  even  when  no
       explicit  reject_unlisted_recipient  access restriction is specified. This prevents the Postfix queue
       from filling up with undeliverable MAILER-DAEMON messages.

             The recipient domain matches $mydestination, $inet_interfaces or  $proxy_interfaces,  but  the
              recipient is not listed in $local_recipient_maps, and $local_recipient_maps is not null.

             The  recipient  domain matches $virtual_alias_domains but the recipient is not listed in $vir-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tual_alias_maps.&nbsp;$virtual_alias_maps.</font>
              tual_alias_maps.

              ent_maps, and $relay_recipient_maps is not null.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>smtpd_reject_unlisted_sender</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
       Request that the Postfix SMTP server rejects  mail  from  unknown  sender  addresses,  even  when  no
       explicit  reject_unlisted_sender  access restriction is specified. This can slow down an explosion of
       forged mail from worms or viruses.

             The sender domain matches  $mydestination,  $inet_interfaces  or  $proxy_interfaces,  but  the
              sender is not listed in $local_recipient_maps, and $local_recipient_maps is not null.

             The  sender  domain  matches  $virtual_alias_domains  but  the  sender  is not listed in $vir-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tual_alias_maps.&nbsp;$virtual_alias_maps.</font>
              tual_alias_maps.

              ent_maps, and $relay_recipient_maps is not null.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>smtpd_restriction_classes</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       User-defined aliases for groups of access restrictions. The aliases can be specified in smtpd_recipi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ent_restrictions&nbsp;smtpd_recipient_restrictions</font>
       ent_restrictions etc., and on the right-hand side of a Postfix <a href="access.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/access"><b>access</b>(5)</a> table.

       One   major   application   is   for  implementing  per-recipient  UCE  control.   See  the  RESTRIC-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">TION_CLASS_README&nbsp;RESTRICTION_CLASS_README</font>
       TION_CLASS_README document for other examples.

<b>smtpd_sasl_application_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>smtpd)</b>
       The application name used for SASL server initialization. This controls the name of the SASL configu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ration&nbsp;configuration</font>
       ration file. The default value is <b>smtpd</b>, corresponding to a SASL configuration file named <b>smtpd.conf</b>.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and 2.2. With Postfix 2.3 it was renamed to smtpd_sasl_path.

<b>smtpd_sasl_auth_enable</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
       Enable  SASL  authentication in the Postfix SMTP server. By default, the Postfix SMTP server does not
       use authentication.

       If a remote SMTP client is authenticated, the permit_sasl_authenticated  access  restriction  can  be
       used to permit relay access, like this:

           smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
               permit_mynetworks, permit_sasl_authenticated, ...

       To  reject  all  SMTP  connections  from  unauthenticated clients, specify "smtpd_delay_reject = yes"
       (which is the default) and use:

           smtpd_client_restrictions = permit_sasl_authenticated, reject

       See the SASL_README file for SASL configuration and operation details.

<b>smtpd_sasl_authenticated_header</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
       Report the SASL authenticated user name in the <a href="../man8/smtpd.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/smtpd"><b>smtpd</b>(8)</a> Received message header.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>smtpd_sasl_exceptions_networks</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       What SMTP clients Postfix will not offer AUTH support to.

       Some clients (Netscape 4 at least) have a bug that causes them to require a login and password  when-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ever&nbsp;whenever</font>
       ever  AUTH  is  offered,  whether  it's  necessary or not. To work around this, specify, for example,
       $mynetworks to prevent Postfix from offering AUTH to local clients.

       Specify a list of network/netmask patterns, separated by commas and/or whitespace. The mask specifies
       the  number  of bits in the network part of a host address. You can also "/file/name" or "type:table"
       patterns.  A "/file/name" pattern is replaced by its contents; a "type:table" lookup table is matched
       when  a  table  entry matches a lookup string (the lookup result is ignored).  Continue long lines by
       starting the next line with whitespace. Specify "!pattern" to exclude an  address  or  network  block
       from the list.  The form "!/file/name" is supported only in Postfix version 2.4 and later.

       Note:  IP version 6 address information must be specified inside [] in the smtpd_sasl_exceptions_net-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">works&nbsp;smtpd_sasl_exceptions_networks</font>
       works value, and in files specified with "/file/name".  IP version 6 addresses contain the ":"  char-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">acter,&nbsp;character,</font>
       acter, and would otherwise be confused with a "type:table" pattern.

       Example:

       smtpd_sasl_exceptions_networks = $mynetworks

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>smtpd_sasl_local_domain</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       The name of the local SASL authentication realm.

       By default, the local authentication realm name is the null string.

       Examples:

       smtpd_sasl_local_domain = $mydomain
       smtpd_sasl_local_domain = $myhostname

<b>smtpd_sasl_path</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>smtpd)</b>
       Implementation-specific information that is passed through to the SASL plug-in implementation that is
       selected with <b>smtpd_sasl_type</b>.  Typically this specifies the name of a  configuration  file  or  ren-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dezvous&nbsp;rendezvous</font>
       dezvous point.

       This   feature   is  available  in  Postfix  2.3  and  later.  In  earlier  releases  it  was  called
       smtpd_sasl_application.

<b>smtpd_sasl_security_options</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>noanonymous)</b>
       SASL security options; as of Postfix 2.3 the list of available features depends on  the  SASL  server
       implementation that is selected with <b>smtpd_sasl_type</b>.

       The following security features are defined for the <b>cyrus</b> server SASL implementation:

       Restrict  what  authentication mechanisms the Postfix SMTP server will offer to the client.  The list
       of available authentication mechanisms is system dependent.

       Specify zero or more of the following:

       <b>noplaintext</b>
              Disallow methods that use plaintext passwords.

       <b>noactive</b>
              Disallow methods subject to active (non-dictionary) attack.

       <b>nodictionary</b>
              Disallow methods subject to passive (dictionary) attack.

       <b>noanonymous</b>
              Disallow methods that allow anonymous authentication.

       <b>mutual_auth</b>
              Only allow methods that provide mutual authentication (not available with SASL version 1).

       By default, the Postfix SMTP server accepts plaintext passwords but not anonymous logins.

       Warning: it appears that clients try authentication methods in the order as advertised by the  server
       (e.g.,  PLAIN  ANONYMOUS  CRAM-MD5) which means that if you disable plaintext passwords, clients will
       log in anonymously, even when they should be able to use CRAM-MD5.   So,  if  you  disable  plaintext
       logins, disable anonymous logins too.  Postfix treats anonymous login as no authentication.

       Example:

       smtpd_sasl_security_options = noanonymous, noplaintext

<b>smtpd_sasl_tls_security_options</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$smtpd_sasl_security_options)</b>
       The  SASL  authentication  security  options that the Postfix SMTP server uses for TLS encrypted SMTP
       sessions.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>smtpd_sasl_type</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>cyrus)</b>
       The SASL plug-in type that the Postfix SMTP server should use for authentication. The available types
       are listed with the "<b>postconf</b> <b>-a</b>" command.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>smtpd_sender_login_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Optional lookup table with the SASL login names that own sender (MAIL FROM) addresses.

       Specify  zero  or more "type:table" lookup tables. With lookups from indexed files such as DB or DBM,
       or from networked tables such as NIS, LDAP or SQL, the following search operations are  done  with  a
       sender address of <u>user@domain</u>:

       1) <u>user@domain</u>
              This table lookup is always done and has the highest precedence.

       2) <u>user</u>
              This  table  lookup is done only when the <u>domain</u> part of the sender address matches $myorigin,
              $mydestination, $inet_interfaces or $proxy_interfaces.

       3) <u>@domain</u>
              This table lookup is done last and has the lowest precedence.

       In all cases the result of table lookup must be either "not found" or a list of SASL login names sep-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">arated&nbsp;separated</font>
       arated by comma and/or whitespace.

<b>smtpd_sender_restrictions</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Optional restrictions that the Postfix SMTP server applies in the context of the MAIL FROM command.

       The default is to permit everything.

       Specify a list of restrictions, separated by commas and/or whitespace.  Continue long lines by start-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;starting</font>
       ing the next line with whitespace.  Restrictions are applied in the order  as  specified;  the  first
       restriction that matches wins.

       The following restrictions are specific to the sender address received with the MAIL FROM command.

       <b>check_sender_access</b> <u>type:table</u>
              Search  the specified <a href="access.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/access"><b>access</b>(5)</a> database for the MAIL FROM address, domain, parent domains, or
              localpart@, and execute the corresponding action.

              cute  the  corresponding  action.   Note:  a result of "OK" is not allowed for safety reasons.
              Instead, use DUNNO in order to exclude specific hosts from blacklists.  This feature is avail-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able&nbsp;available</font>
              able in Postfix 2.1 and later.

       <b>check_sender_ns_access</b> <u>type:table</u>
              Search  the  specified  <a href="access.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/access"><b>access</b>(5)</a>  database for the DNS servers for the MAIL FROM address, and
              execute the corresponding action.  Note: a result of "OK" is not allowed for  safety  reasons.
              Instead, use DUNNO in order to exclude specific hosts from blacklists.  This feature is avail-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able&nbsp;available</font>
              able in Postfix 2.1 and later.

       <b>reject_authenticated_sender_login_mismatch</b>
              Enforces the reject_sender_login_mismatch restriction for  authenticated  clients  only.  This
              feature is available in Postfix version 2.1 and later.

       <b>reject_non_fqdn_sender</b>
              Reject  the  request  when  the  MAIL  FROM  address is not in fully-qualified domain form, as
              required by the RFC.
              The non_fqdn_reject_code parameter specifies the response code to rejected requests  (default:
              504).

       <b>reject_rhsbl_sender</b> <u>rbl</u><b>_</b><u>domain=d.d.d.d</u>
              Reject  the  request  when  the  MAIL  FROM domain is listed with the A record "<u>d.d.d.d</u>" under
              <u>rbl</u><b>_</b><u>domain</u> (Postfix version 2.1 and later only).  If no "<u>=d.d.d.d</u>" is  specified,  reject  the
              request when the MAIL FROM domain is listed with any A record under <u>rbl</u><b>_</b><u>domain</u>.
              The maps_rbl_reject_code parameter specifies the response code for rejected requests (default:
              554);  the  default_rbl_reply  parameter  specifies  the  default  server   reply;   and   the
              rbl_reply_maps  parameter  specifies  tables  with server replies indexed by <u>rbl</u><b>_</b><u>domain</u>.  This
              feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

       <b>reject_sender_login_mismatch</b>
              Reject the request when $smtpd_sender_login_maps specifies an owner for the MAIL FROM address,
              but  the client is not (SASL) logged in as that MAIL FROM address owner; or when the client is
              (SASL) logged in, but the client login name doesn't own the MAIL  FROM  address  according  to
              $smtpd_sender_login_maps.

       <b>reject_unauthenticated_sender_login_mismatch</b>
              Enforces  the  reject_sender_login_mismatch restriction for unauthenticated clients only. This
              feature is available in Postfix version 2.1 and later.

       <b>reject_unknown_sender_domain</b>
              Reject the request when Postfix is not final destination for the sender address, and the  MAIL
              FROM  address has no DNS A or MX record, or when it has a malformed MX record such as a record
              with a zero-length MX hostname (Postfix version 2.3 and later).
              The unknown_address_reject_code parameter specifies the response code  for  rejected  requests
              (default: 450).  The response is always 450 in case of a temporary DNS error.

       <b>reject_unlisted_sender</b>
              Reject  the  request  when the MAIL FROM address is not listed in the list of valid recipients
              for its domain class. See the smtpd_reject_unlisted_sender parameter description for  details.
              This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

       <b>reject_unverified_sender</b>
              Reject  the  request when mail to the MAIL FROM address is known to bounce, or when the sender

              available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

       Other restrictions that are valid in this context:

             Generic  restrictions  that  can  be  used  in  any  SMTP  command  context,  described  under
              smtpd_client_restrictions.

             SMTP   command   specific   restrictions   described   under   smtpd_client_restrictions   and
              smtpd_helo_restrictions.

             SMTP command specific restrictions described under smtpd_recipient_restrictions. When  recipi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ent&nbsp;recipient</font>
              ent  restrictions  are  listed  under  smtpd_sender_restrictions,  they  have effect only with
              "smtpd_delay_reject = yes", so that $smtpd_sender_restrictions is evaluated at the time of the
              RCPT TO command.

       Examples:

       smtpd_sender_restrictions = reject_unknown_sender_domain
       smtpd_sender_restrictions = reject_unknown_sender_domain,
           check_sender_access hash:/etc/postfix/access

<b>smtpd_soft_error_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>10)</b>
       The number of errors a remote SMTP client is allowed to make without delivering mail before the Post-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fix&nbsp;Postfix</font>
       fix SMTP server slows down all its responses.

             With Postfix version  2.1  and  later,  the  Postfix  SMTP  server  delays  all  responses  by
              $smtpd_error_sleep_time seconds.

             With Postfix versions 2.0 and earlier, the Postfix SMTP server delays all responses by (number
              of errors) seconds.

<b>smtpd_starttls_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>300s)</b>
       The time limit for Postfix SMTP server write and read operations  during  TLS  startup  and  shutdown
       handshake procedures.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>smtpd_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>300s)</b>
       The  time  limit  for  sending  a Postfix SMTP server response and for receiving a remote SMTP client
       request.

       Note: if you set SMTP time limits to very large values you may have to update the global  ipc_timeout
       parameter.

       Time  units:  s  (seconds),  m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit is s
       (seconds).

<b>smtpd_tls_CAfile</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       The file with the certificate of the certification authority (CA) that issued the Postfix SMTP server
       certificate.   This  is needed only when the CA certificate is not already present in the server cer-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tificate&nbsp;certificate</font>
       tificate file.  This file may also contain the CA certificates of other trusted CAs.   You  must  use
       this file for the list of trusted CAs if you want to use chroot-mode.

       Example:

       smtpd_tls_CAfile = /etc/postfix/CAcert.pem

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>smtpd_tls_CApath</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Directory  with  PEM format certificate authority certificates that the Postfix SMTP server offers to
       remote SMTP clients for the purpose of client certificate verification.  Do not forget to create  the
       necessary "hash" links with, for example, "$OPENSSL_HOME/bin/c_rehash /etc/postfix/certs".

       To  use this option in chroot mode, this directory (or a copy) must be inside the chroot jail. Please
       note that in this case the CA certificates are not offered to the  client,  so  that  e.g.   Netscape
       clients  might  not  offer  certificates issued by them.  Use of this feature is therefore not recom-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mended.&nbsp;recommended.</font>
       mended.

       Example:

       smtpd_tls_CApath = /etc/postfix/certs

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>smtpd_tls_always_issue_session_ids</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b>
       Force the Postfix SMTP server to issue a TLS session id, even when TLS session caching is turned  off
       (smtpd_tls_session_cache_database is empty). This behavior is compatible with Postfix &lt; 2.3.

       With Postfix 2.3 and later the Postfix SMTP server can disable session id generation when TLS session
       caching is turned off. This keeps clients from caching sessions that almost certainly cannot  be  re-
       used.

       By  default,  the  Postfix  SMTP  server  always generates TLS session ids. This works around a known
       defect in mail client applications such as MS Outlook, and may also prevent  interoperability  issues
       with other MTAs.

       Example:
               smtpd_tls_always_issue_session_ids = no

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>smtpd_tls_ask_ccert</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
       Ask  a  remote SMTP client for a client certificate. This information is needed for certificate based
       mail relaying with, for example, the permit_tls_clientcerts feature.

       Some clients such as Netscape will either complain if no certificate is available (for  the  list  of
       CAs  in  $smtpd_tls_CAfile)  or  will  offer multiple client certificates to choose from. This may be
       annoying, so this option is "off" by default.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>smtpd_tls_auth_only</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
       When TLS encryption is optional in the Postfix SMTP server, do not announce or accept SASL  authenti-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cation&nbsp;authentication</font>
       cation over unencrypted connections.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>smtpd_tls_ccert_verifydepth</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>5)</b>
       The verification depth for remote SMTP client certificates. A depth of 1 is sufficient if the issuing
       CA is listed in a local CA file.  The default value should also suffice for longer chains  (the  root
       CA issues special CA which then issues the actual certificate...).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>smtpd_tls_cert_file</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       File  with  the  Postfix  SMTP  server RSA certificate in PEM format.  This file may also contain the
       Postfix SMTP server private RSA key.

       Public Internet MX hosts without certificates signed by a "reputable" CA must generate, and  be  pre-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pared&nbsp;prepared</font>
       pared to present to most clients, a self-signed or private-CA signed certificate. The client will not
       be able to authenticate the server, but unless it is running Postfix 2.3 or similar software, it will
       still insist on a server certificate.

       For  servers  that are <b>not</b> public Internet MX hosts, Postfix 2.3 supports configurations with no cer-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tificates.&nbsp;certificates.</font>
       tificates. This entails the use of just the anonymous TLS ciphers, which are not supported by typical
       SMTP  clients.  Since such clients will not, as a rule, fall back to plain text after a TLS handshake
       failure, the server will be unable to receive email from TLS enabled  clients.  To  avoid  accidental
       configurations  with  no  certificates,  Postfix 2.3 enables certificate-less operation only when the
       administrator explicitly sets "smtpd_tls_cert_file = none". This ensures that new Postfix  configura-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tions&nbsp;configurations</font>
       tions will not accidentally run with no certificates.

       Both RSA and DSA certificates are supported.  When both types are present, the cipher used determines
       which certificate will be presented to the client.  For Netscape and OpenSSL clients without  special
       cipher choices the RSA certificate is preferred.

       In order to verify a certificate, the CA certificate (in case of a certificate chain, all CA certifi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cates)&nbsp;certificates)</font>
       cates) must be available.  You should add these certificates to the server  certificate,  the  server
       certificate first, then the issuing <!-- a -->CA(s)<!-- /a -->.

       Example: the certificate for "server.dom.ain" was issued by "intermediate CA" which itself has a cer-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tificate&nbsp;certificate</font>
       tificate of "root CA".  Create the server.pem  file  with  "cat  server_cert.pem  intermediate_CA.pem
       root_CA.pem &gt; server.pem".

       If  you  also want to verify client certificates issued by these CAs, you can add the CA certificates
       to the smtpd_tls_CAfile, in which case it is not necessary to have them in the smtpd_tls_cert_file or
       smtpd_tls_dcert_file.

       A  certificate  supplied here must be usable as an SSL server certificate and hence pass the "openssl
       verify -purpose sslserver ..." test.

       Example:

       smtpd_tls_cert_file = /etc/postfix/server.pem

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>smtpd_tls_cipherlist</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Obsolete Postfix &lt; 2.3 control for the Postfix SMTP server TLS cipher list.  It  is  easy  to  create
       inter-operability  problems  by  choosing  a  non-default  cipher  list. Do not use a non-default TLS
       cipherlist for MX hosts on the public Internet. Clients that begin the TLS handshake, but are  unable
       to agree on a common cipher, may not be able to send any email to the SMTP server. Using a restricted
       cipher list may be more appropriate for a dedicated MSA or an internal mailhub, where one  can  exert
       some control over the TLS software and settings of the connecting clients.

       <b>Note:</b> do not use "" quotes around the parameter value.

       This  feature  is  available with Postfix version 2.2. It is not used with Postfix 2.3 and later; use
       smtpd_tls_mandatory_ciphers instead.

<b>smtpd_tls_dcert_file</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       File with the Postfix SMTP server DSA certificate in PEM format.  This  file  may  also  contain  the
       Postfix SMTP server private key.

       See the discussion under smtpd_tls_cert_file for more details.

       Example:

       smtpd_tls_dcert_file = /etc/postfix/server-dsa.pem

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>smtpd_tls_dh1024_param_file</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       File with DH parameters that the Postfix SMTP server should use with EDH ciphers.

       Instead  of  using  the  exact same parameter sets as distributed with other TLS packages, it is more
       secure to generate your own set of parameters with something like the following command:

       openssl gendh -out /etc/postfix/dh_1024.pem -2 -rand /var/run/egd-pool 1024

       Your actual source for entropy may differ. Some systems have /dev/random; on  other  system  you  may
       consider using the "Entropy Gathering Daemon EGD", available at <a href="http://egd.sourceforge.net/">http://egd.sourceforge.net/</a>

       Example:

       smtpd_tls_dh1024_param_file = /etc/postfix/dh_1024.pem

       This feature is available with Postfix version 2.2.

<b>smtpd_tls_dh512_param_file</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       File with DH parameters that the Postfix SMTP server should use with EDH ciphers.

       See also the discussion under the smtpd_tls_dh1024_param_file configuration parameter.

       Example:

       smtpd_tls_dh512_param_file = /etc/postfix/dh_512.pem

       This feature is available with Postfix version 2.2.

<b>smtpd_tls_dkey_file</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$smtpd_tls_dcert_file)</b>
       File  with the Postfix SMTP server DSA private key in PEM format.  This file may be combined with the
       Postfix SMTP server DSA certificate file specified with $smtpd_tls_dcert_file.

       The private key must be accessible without a pass-phrase, i.e. it must not  be  encrypted,  but  file
       permissions should grant read/write access only to the system superuser account ("root").

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>smtpd_tls_exclude_ciphers</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       List  of ciphers or cipher types to exclude from the SMTP server cipher list at all TLS security lev-
       els. Excluding valid ciphers can create interoperability problems. DO NOT exclude ciphers  unless  it
       is essential to do so. This is not an OpenSSL cipherlist; it is a simple list separated by whitespace
       and/or commas. The elements are a single cipher, or one or more "+" separated cipher  properties,  in
       which case only ciphers matching <b>all</b> the properties are excluded.

       Examples (some of these will cause problems):

       smtpd_tls_exclude_ciphers = aNULL
       smtpd_tls_exclude_ciphers = MD5, DES
       smtpd_tls_exclude_ciphers = DES+MD5
       smtpd_tls_exclude_ciphers = AES256-SHA, DES-CBC3-MD5
       smtpd_tls_exclude_ciphers = kEDH+aRSA

       The  first  setting  disables  anonymous  ciphers. The next setting disables ciphers that use the MD5
       digest algorithm or the (single) DES encryption algorithm. The next setting disables ciphers that use
       MD5 and DES together.  The next setting disables the two ciphers "AES256-SHA" and "DES-CBC3-MD5". The
       last setting disables ciphers that use "EDH" key exchange with RSA authentication.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>smtpd_tls_key_file</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$smtpd_tls_cert_file)</b>
       File with the Postfix SMTP server RSA private key in PEM format.  This file may be combined with  the
       Postfix SMTP server certificate file specified with $smtpd_tls_cert_file.

       The  private  key  must  be accessible without a pass-phrase, i.e. it must not be encrypted, but file
       permissions should grant read/write access only to the system superuser account ("root").

<b>smtpd_tls_loglevel</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>0)</b>
       Enable additional Postfix SMTP server logging of TLS activity.  Each logging level also includes  the
       information that is logged at a lower logging level.

              0 Disable logging of TLS activity.

              1 Log TLS handshake and certificate information.

              2 Log levels during TLS negotiation.

              3 Log hexadecimal and ASCII dump of TLS negotiation process.

              4 Also log hexadecimal and ASCII dump of complete transmission after STARTTLS.

       Use "smtpd_tls_loglevel = 3" only in case of problems. Use of loglevel 4 is strongly discouraged.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>smtpd_tls_mandatory_ciphers</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>medium)</b>
       The  minimum  TLS  cipher  grade that the Postfix SMTP server will use with mandatory TLS encryption.
       Cipher types listed in smtpd_tls_mandatory_exclude_ciphers or smtpd_tls_exclude_ciphers are  excluded
       from  the  base  definition  of  the  selected  cipher  grade. With opportunistic TLS encryption, the
       "export" grade is used unconditionally with exclusions specified only via  smtpd_tls_exclude_ciphers.

       The following cipher grades are supported:

       <b>export</b> Enable  the mainstream "EXPORT" grade or better OpenSSL ciphers.  This is the most appropriate
              setting for public MX hosts, and is always used with opportunistic TLS encryption. The  under-
              lying cipherlist is specified via the tls_export_cipherlist configuration parameter, which you
              are strongly encouraged to not change. The default  value  of  tls_export_cipherlist  includes
              anonymous ciphers, but these are automatically filtered out if the server is configured to ask
              for   client   certificates.   If   you   must   always   exclude   anonymous   ciphers,   set
              "smtpd_tls_exclude_ciphers  =  aNULL". To exclude anonymous ciphers only when TLS is enforced,
              set "smtpd_tls_mandatory_exclude_ciphers = aNULL".

       <b>low</b>    Enable the mainstream "LOW" grade or better OpenSSL  ciphers.  The  underlying  cipherlist  is
              specified  via  the tls_low_cipherlist configuration parameter, which you are strongly encour-
              aged to not change. The default value of tls_low_cipherlist includes  anonymous  ciphers,  but
              these  are  automatically  filtered out if the server is configured to ask for client certifi-
              cates. If you must always exclude anonymous ciphers, set "smtpd_tls_exclude_ciphers =  aNULL".
              To   exclude   anonymous   ciphers   only   when   TLS   is  enforced,  set  "smtpd_tls_manda-
              tory_exclude_ciphers = aNULL".

       <b>medium</b> Enable the mainstream "MEDIUM" grade or better OpenSSL  ciphers.  These  are  essentially  the
              128-bit  or  stronger  ciphers. This is the default minimum strength for mandatory TLS encryp-
              tion. MSAs that enforce TLS and have clients that do not support any "MEDIUM" or "HIGH"  grade
              ciphers, may need to configure a weaker ("low" or "export") minimum cipher grade. The underly-
              ing cipherlist is specified via the tls_medium_cipherlist configuration parameter,  which  you
              are  strongly  encouraged  to  not change. The default value of tls_medium_cipherlist includes
              anonymous ciphers, but these are automatically filtered out if the server is configured to ask
              for   client   certificates.   If   you   must   always   exclude   anonymous   ciphers,   set
              "smtpd_tls_exclude_ciphers = aNULL". To exclude anonymous ciphers only when TLS  is  enforced,
              set "smtpd_tls_mandatory_exclude_ciphers = aNULL".

       <b>high</b>   Enable  only  the mainstream "HIGH" grade OpenSSL ciphers. The underlying cipherlist is speci-
              fied via the tls_high_cipherlist configuration parameter, which you are strongly encouraged to
              not change. The default value of tls_high_cipherlist includes anonymous ciphers, but these are
              automatically filtered out if the server is configured to ask for client certificates. If  you
              must  always  exclude  anonymous  ciphers, set "smtpd_tls_exclude_ciphers = aNULL". To exclude
              anonymous ciphers only  when  TLS  is  enforced,  set  "smtpd_tls_mandatory_exclude_ciphers  =
              aNULL".

       <b>null</b>   Enable only the "NULL" OpenSSL ciphers, these provide authentication without encryption.  This
              setting is only appropriate in the rare case that all clients are prepared to use NULL ciphers
              (not  normally  enabled  in  TLS  clients).  The  underlying  cipherlist  is specified via the
              tls_null_cipherlist configuration parameter, which you are strongly encouraged to not  change.
              The  default  value  of tls_null_cipherlist excludes anonymous ciphers (OpenSSL 0.9.8 has NULL
              ciphers that offer data integrity without encryption or authentication).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>smtpd_tls_mandatory_exclude_ciphers</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Additional list of ciphers or cipher types to exclude from the SMTP server cipher list  at  mandatory
       TLS   security   levels.   This   list   works   in   addition   to   the   exclusions   listed  with
       smtpd_tls_exclude_ciphers (see there for syntax details).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>smtpd_tls_mandatory_protocols</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>SSLv3,</b> <b>TLSv1)</b>
       The TLS protocols accepted by the Postfix SMTP server with mandatory  TLS  encryption.   With  oppor-
       tunistic TLS encryption, all protocols are always accepted. If the list is empty, the server supports
       all available TLS protocol versions.  A non-empty value is a list  of  protocol  names  separated  by
       whitespace,  commas or colons. The supported protocol names are "SSLv2", "SSLv3" and "TLSv1", and are
       not case sensitive.

       Example:

       smtpd_tls_mandatory_protocols = SSLv3, TLSv1

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>smtpd_tls_received_header</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
       Request that the Postfix SMTP server produces Received:  message  headers  that  include  information
       about  the  protocol  and cipher used, as well as the client CommonName and client certificate issuer
       CommonName.  This is disabled by default, as the information may be modified in transit through other
       mail servers.  Only information that was recorded by the final destination can be trusted.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>smtpd_tls_req_ccert</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
       With mandatory TLS encryption, require a remote SMTP client certificate in order to allow TLS connec-
       tions to proceed.  This option implies "smtpd_tls_ask_ccert = yes".

       When TLS encryption is optional, this setting is ignored with a warning written to the mail log.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>smtpd_tls_security_level</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       The SMTP TLS security level for the Postfix SMTP server; when a non-empty value  is  specified,  this
       overrides the obsolete parameters smtpd_use_tls and smtpd_enforce_tls. This parameter is ignored with
       "smtpd_tls_wrappermode = yes".

       Specify one of the following security levels:

       <b>none</b>   TLS will not be used.

       <b>may</b>    Opportunistic TLS: announce STARTTLS support to SMTP clients, but do not require that  clients
              use TLS encryption.

       <b>encrypt</b>
              Mandatory  TLS encryption: announce STARTTLS support to SMTP clients, and require that clients
              use TLS encryption. According to RFC 2487 this MUST NOT be applied in case of a  publicly-ref-
              erenced SMTP server. Instead, this option should be used only on dedicated servers.

       Note  1:  the "verify" and "secure" levels are not supported.  The Postfix SMTP server logs a warning
       and uses "encrypt" instead.  To verify SMTP client certificates, see TLS_README for a  discussion  of
       the smtpd_tls_ask_ccert, smtpd_tls_req_ccert, and permit_tls_clientcerts features.

       Note  2:  The  parameter  setting "smtpd_tls_security_level = encrypt" implies "smtpd_tls_auth_only =
       yes".

       Note 3: when invoked via "sendmail -bs", Postfix will never offer STARTTLS due to insufficient privi-
       leges to access the server private key. This is intended behavior.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>smtpd_tls_session_cache_database</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Name  of  the  file containing the optional Postfix SMTP server TLS session cache. Specify a database
       type that supports enumeration, such as <b>btree</b> or <b>sdbm</b>; there is no need to support concurrent access.
       The  file  is created if it does not exist. The <a href="../man8/smtpd.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/smtpd"><b>smtpd</b>(8)</a> daemon does not use this parameter directly,
       rather the cache is implemented indirectly in  the  <a href="../man8/tlsmgr.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/tlsmgr"><b>tlsmgr</b>(8)</a>  daemon.  This  means  that  per-smtpd-
       instance  master.cf overrides of this parameter are not effective. Note, that each of the cache data-
       bases supported by <a href="../man8/tlsmgr.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/tlsmgr"><b>tlsmgr</b>(8)</a> daemon: $smtpd_tls_session_cache_database, $smtp_tls_session_cache_data-
       base (and with Postfix 2.3 and later $lmtp_session_cache_database), needs to be stored separately, it
       is not at this time possible to store multiple caches in a single database.

       Note: <b>dbm</b> databases are not suitable. TLS session objects are too large.

       Example:

       smtpd_tls_session_cache_database = btree:/var/spool/postfix/smtpd_scache

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>smtpd_tls_session_cache_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>3600s)</b>
       The expiration time of Postfix SMTP server TLS session cache information. A  cache  cleanup  is  per-
       formed   periodically   every   $smtpd_tls_session_cache_timeout  seconds.  As  with  $smtpd_tls_ses-
       sion_cache_database, this parameter is implemented in the <a href="../man8/tlsmgr.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/tlsmgr"><b>tlsmgr</b>(8)</a> daemon and  therefore  per-smtpd-
       instance master.cf overrides are not possible.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>smtpd_tls_wrappermode</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
       Run  the  Postfix  SMTP server in the non-standard "wrapper" mode, instead of using the STARTTLS com-
       mand.

       If you want  to  support  this  service,  enable  a  special  port  in  master.cf,  and  specify  "-o
       smtpd_tls_wrappermode=yes"  on  the  SMTP server's command line. Port 465 (smtps) was once chosen for
       this purpose.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>smtpd_use_tls</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
       Opportunistic TLS: announce STARTTLS support to SMTP clients, but do not require that clients use TLS
       encryption.

       Note:  when  invoked via "<b>sendmail</b> <b>-bs</b>", Postfix will never offer STARTTLS due to insufficient privi-
       leges to access the server private key. This is intended behavior.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later. With Postfix 2.3 and  later  use  smtpd_tls_secu-
       rity_level instead.

<b>soft_bounce</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
       Safety  net  to keep mail queued that would otherwise be returned to the sender.  This parameter dis-
       ables locally-generated bounces, and prevents the Postfix SMTP  server  from  rejecting  mail  perma-
       nently,  by changing 5xx reply codes into 4xx.  However, soft_bounce is no cure for address rewriting
       mistakes or mail routing mistakes.

       Example:

       soft_bounce = yes

<b>stale_lock_time</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>500s)</b>
       The time after which a stale exclusive mailbox lockfile is removed.  This is  used  for  delivery  to
       file or mailbox.

       Time  units:  s  (seconds),  m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit is s
       (seconds).

<b>strict_7bit_headers</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
       Reject mail with 8-bit text in message headers. This blocks mail from poorly written applications.

       This feature should not be enabled on a general purpose mail server, because it is likely  to  reject
       legitimate email.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

<b>strict_8bitmime</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
       Enable both strict_7bit_headers and strict_8bitmime_body.

       This  feature  should not be enabled on a general purpose mail server, because it is likely to reject
       legitimate email.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

<b>strict_8bitmime_body</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
       Reject 8-bit message body text without 8-bit MIME content encoding  information.   This  blocks  mail
       from poorly written applications.

       Unfortunately, this also rejects majordomo approval requests when the included request contains valid
       8-bit MIME mail, and it rejects bounces from mailers that do not MIME encapsulate 8-bit content  (for
       example, bounces from qmail or from old versions of Postfix).

       This  feature  should not be enabled on a general purpose mail server, because it is likely to reject
       legitimate email.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

<b>strict_mime_encoding_domain</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
       Reject mail with invalid Content-Transfer-Encoding: information for the message/* or multipart/* MIME
       content types.  This blocks mail from poorly written software.

       This  feature  should  not  be  enabled on a general purpose mail server, because it will reject mail
       after a single violation.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

<b>strict_rfc821_envelopes</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
       Require that addresses received in SMTP MAIL FROM and RCPT TO commands are enclosed with &lt;&gt;, and that
       those  addresses do not contain RFC 822 style comments or phrases.  This stops mail from poorly writ-
       ten software.

       By default, the Postfix SMTP server accepts RFC 822 syntax in MAIL FROM and RCPT TO addresses.

<b>sun_mailtool_compatibility</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
       Obsolete SUN mailtool compatibility feature. Instead, use "mailbox_delivery_lock = dotlock".

<b>swap_bangpath</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b>
       Enable the rewriting of "site!user" into "user@site".  This is necessary if your machine is connected
       to UUCP networks.  It is enabled by default.

       Note: with Postfix version 2.2, message header address rewriting happens only when one of the follow-
       ing conditions is true:

             The message is received with the Postfix <a href="../man1/sendmail.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/sendmail"><b>sendmail</b>(1)</a> command,

             The message is received from a network client that matches $local_header_rewrite_clients,

             The message is received from the network, and the remote_header_rewrite_domain parameter spec-
              ifies a non-empty value.

       To  get the behavior before Postfix version 2.2, specify "local_header_rewrite_clients = static:all".

       Example:

       swap_bangpath = no

<b>syslog_facility</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>mail)</b>
       The syslog facility of Postfix logging. Specify a facility as defined in <a href="syslog.conf.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/syslog.conf">syslog.<b>conf</b>(5)</a>. The  default
       facility is "mail".

       Warning:  a  non-default  syslog_facility  setting takes effect only after a Postfix process has com-
       pleted initialization.  Errors during process initialization will be logged with the  default  facil-
       ity.   Examples  are  errors while parsing the command line arguments, and errors while accessing the
       Postfix main.cf configuration file.

<b>syslog_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>postfix)</b>
       The mail system name that is prepended to the  process  name  in  syslog  records,  so  that  "smtpd"
       becomes, for example, "postfix/smtpd".

       Warning:  a  non-default  syslog_name setting takes effect only after a Postfix process has completed
       initialization. Errors during process initialization will be logged with the default  name.  Examples
       are  errors  while parsing the command line arguments, and errors while accessing the Postfix main.cf
       configuration file.

<b>tls_daemon_random_bytes</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>32)</b>
       The number of pseudo-random bytes that an <a href="../man8/smtp.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/smtp"><b>smtp</b>(8)</a> or <a href="../man8/smtpd.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/smtpd"><b>smtpd</b>(8)</a> process  requests  from  the  <a href="../man8/tlsmgr.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/tlsmgr"><b>tlsmgr</b>(8)</a>
       server  in order to seed its internal pseudo random number generator (PRNG).  The default of 32 bytes
       (equivalent to 256 bits) is sufficient to generate a 128bit (or 168bit) session key.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>tls_export_cipherlist</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>ALL:+RC4:@STRENGTH)</b>
       The OpenSSL cipherlist for "EXPORT" or higher grade ciphers. This defines the meaning of the "export"
       setting  in  smtpd_tls_mandatory_ciphers,  smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers and lmtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers.
       This is the cipherlist for the opportunistic ("may") TLS client security level  and  is  the  default
       cipherlist for the SMTP server. You are strongly encouraged to not change this setting.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>tls_high_cipherlist</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>ALL:!EXPORT:!LOW:!MEDIUM:+RC4:@STRENGTH)</b>
       The  OpenSSL  cipherlist  for "HIGH" grade ciphers. This defines the meaning of the "high" setting in
       smtpd_tls_mandatory_ciphers,  smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers  and  lmtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers.  You   are
       strongly encouraged to not change this setting.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>tls_low_cipherlist</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>ALL:!EXPORT:+RC4:@STRENGTH)</b>
       The  OpenSSL cipherlist for "LOW" or higher grade ciphers. This defines the meaning of the "low" set-
       ting in smtpd_tls_mandatory_ciphers, smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers and  lmtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers.  You
       are strongly encouraged to not change this setting.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>tls_medium_cipherlist</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>ALL:!EXPORT:!LOW:+RC4:@STRENGTH)</b>
       The OpenSSL cipherlist for "MEDIUM" or higher grade ciphers. This defines the meaning of the "medium"
       setting in smtpd_tls_mandatory_ciphers,  smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers  and  lmtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers.
       This is the default cipherlist for mandatory TLS encryption in the TLS client (with anonymous ciphers
       disabled when verifying server certificates). You are strongly encouraged to not change this setting.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>tls_null_cipherlist</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>eNULL:!aNULL)</b>
       The  OpenSSL cipherlist for "NULL" grade ciphers that provide authentication without encryption. This
       defines the meaning of the "null" setting in smtpd_mandatory_tls_ciphers,  smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers
       and lmtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers.  You are strongly encouraged to not change this setting.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

<b>tls_random_bytes</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>32)</b>
       The  number  of  bytes  that  <a href="../man8/tlsmgr.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/tlsmgr"><b>tlsmgr</b>(8)</a>  reads from $tls_random_source when (re)seeding the in-memory
       pseudo random number generator (PRNG) pool. The default of 32 bytes (256 bits)  is  good  enough  for
       128bit symmetric keys.  If using EGD or a device file, a maximum of 255 bytes is read.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>tls_random_exchange_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>${config_directory}/prng_exch)</b>
       Name  of  the  pseudo  random number generator (PRNG) state file that is maintained by <a href="../man8/tlsmgr.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/tlsmgr"><b>tlsmgr</b>(8)</a>. The
       file is created when it does not exist, and its length is fixed at 1024 bytes.

       Since this file is modified by Postfix, it should probably be kept in the /var file  system,  instead
       of under $config_directory.  The location should not be inside the chroot jail.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>tls_random_prng_update_period</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>3600s)</b>
       The time between attempts by <a href="../man8/tlsmgr.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/tlsmgr"><b>tlsmgr</b>(8)</a> to save the state of the pseudo random number generator (PRNG)
       to the file specified with $tls_random_exchange_name.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>tls_random_reseed_period</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>3600s)</b>
       The maximal time between attempts by <a href="../man8/tlsmgr.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/tlsmgr"><b>tlsmgr</b>(8)</a> to re-seed the in-memory pseudo random number  genera-
       tor  (PRNG)  pool  from  external sources.  The actual time between re-seeding attempts is calculated
       using the PRNG, and is between 0 and the time specified.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>tls_random_source</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b>
       The external entropy source for the in-memory <a href="../man8/tlsmgr.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/tlsmgr"><b>tlsmgr</b>(8)</a> pseudo random number generator  (PRNG)  pool.
       Be  sure  to specify a non-blocking source.  If this source is not a regular file, the entropy source
       type must be prepended:  egd:/path/to/egd_socket for a source with EGD compatible  socket  interface,
       or dev:/path/to/device for a device file.

       Note: on OpenBSD systems specify /dev/arandom when /dev/urandom gives timeout errors.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>trace_service_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>trace)</b>
       The  name  of  the trace service. This service is implemented by the <a href="../man8/bounce.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/bounce"><b>bounce</b>(8)</a> daemon and maintains a
       record of mail deliveries and produces a mail delivery report when verbose delivery is requested with
       "<b>sendmail</b> <b>-v</b>".

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>transport_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Optional  lookup tables with mappings from recipient address to (message delivery transport, next-hop
       destination).  See <a href="transport.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/transport"><b>transport</b>(5)</a> for details.

       Specify zero or more "type:table" lookup tables.  If you use  this  feature  with  local  files,  run
       "<b>postmap</b> <b>/etc/postfix/transport</b>" after making a change.

       For  safety  reasons,  as of Postfix 2.3 this feature does not allow $number substitutions in regular
       expression maps.

       Examples:

       transport_maps = dbm:/etc/postfix/transport
       transport_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/transport

<b>transport_retry_time</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>60s)</b>
       The time between attempts by the Postfix queue manager to contact a malfunctioning  message  delivery
       transport.

       Time  units:  s  (seconds),  m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit is s
       (seconds).

<b>trigger_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>10s)</b>
       The time limit for sending a trigger to a Postfix daemon (for example, the <a href="../man8/pickup.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/pickup"><b>pickup</b>(8)</a> or <a href="../man8/qmgr.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/qmgr"><b>qmgr</b>(8)</a>  dae-
       mon).  This time limit prevents programs from getting stuck when the mail system is under heavy load.

       Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default  time  unit  is  s
       (seconds).

<b>undisclosed_recipients_header</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>To:</b> <b>undisclosed-recipients:;)</b>
       Message  header that the Postfix <a href="../man8/cleanup.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/cleanup"><b>cleanup</b>(8)</a> server inserts when a message contains no To: or Cc: mes-
       sage header.

<b>unknown_address_reject_code</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>450)</b>
       The numerical Postfix SMTP server response code when a sender or recipient address is rejected by the
       reject_unknown_sender_domain  or reject_unknown_recipient_domain restriction.  The response is always
       450 in case of a temporary DNS error.

       Do not change this unless you have a complete understanding of RFC 821.

<b>unknown_client_reject_code</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>450)</b>
       The numerical Postfix SMTP server response code when a client without valid address &lt;=&gt; name  mapping
       is  rejected  by  the reject_unknown_client_hostname restriction. The SMTP server always replies with
       450 when the mapping failed due to a temporary error condition.

       Do not change this unless you have a complete understanding of RFC 821.

<b>unknown_hostname_reject_code</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>450)</b>
       The numerical Postfix SMTP server response code when the hostname specified with  the  HELO  or  EHLO
       command is rejected by the reject_unknown_helo_hostname restriction.

       Do not change this unless you have a complete understanding of RFC 821.

<b>unknown_local_recipient_reject_code</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>550)</b>
       The numerical Postfix SMTP server response code when a recipient address is local, and $local_recipi-
       ent_maps specifies a list of lookup tables that does not match the recipient.  A recipient address is
       local when its domain matches $mydestination, $proxy_interfaces or $inet_interfaces.

       The  default  setting  is 550 (reject mail) but it is safer to initially use 450 (try again later) so
       you have time to find out if your local_recipient_maps settings are OK.

       Example:

       unknown_local_recipient_reject_code = 450

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

<b>unknown_relay_recipient_reject_code</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>550)</b>
       The numerical Postfix SMTP server reply code when a recipient  address  matches  $relay_domains,  and
       relay_recipient_maps specifies a list of lookup tables that does not match the recipient address.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

<b>unknown_virtual_alias_reject_code</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>550)</b>
       The  SMTP  server  reply  code  when  a  recipient  address matches $virtual_alias_domains, and $vir-
       tual_alias_maps specifies a list of lookup tables that does not match the recipient address.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

<b>unknown_virtual_mailbox_reject_code</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>550)</b>
       The SMTP server reply code when a  recipient  address  matches  $virtual_mailbox_domains,  and  $vir-
       tual_mailbox_maps specifies a list of lookup tables that does not match the recipient address.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

<b>unverified_recipient_reject_code</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>450)</b>
       The numerical Postfix SMTP server response when a recipient address is rejected by the reject_unveri-
       fied_recipient restriction.

       Unlike elsewhere in Postfix, you can specify 250 in order to accept the address anyway.

       Do not change this unless you have a complete understanding of RFC 821.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>unverified_sender_reject_code</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>450)</b>
       The numerical Postfix SMTP server  response  code  when  a  recipient  address  is  rejected  by  the
       reject_unverified_sender restriction.

       Unlike elsewhere in Postfix, you can specify 250 in order to accept the address anyway.

       Do not change this unless you have a complete understanding of RFC 821.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>verp_delimiter_filter</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>-=+)</b>
       The  characters  Postfix accepts as VERP delimiter characters on the Postfix <a href="../man1/sendmail.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/sendmail"><b>sendmail</b>(1)</a> command line
       and in SMTP commands.

       This feature is available in Postfix 1.1 and later.

<b>virtual_alias_domains</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$virtual_alias_maps)</b>
       Postfix is final destination for the specified list of virtual alias domains, that  is,  domains  for
       which  all addresses are aliased to addresses in other local or remote domains. The SMTP server vali-
       dates recipient addresses with $virtual_alias_maps and rejects non-existent recipients. See also  the
       virtual alias domain class in the ADDRESS_CLASS_README file

       This  feature  is  available in Postfix 2.0 and later. The default value is backwards compatible with
       Postfix version 1.1.

       The default value is $virtual_alias_maps so that you can keep all  information  about  virtual  alias
       domains in one place.  If you have many users, it is better to separate information that changes more
       frequently (virtual address -&gt; local or remote address mapping) from information  that  changes  less
       frequently (the list of virtual domain names).

       Specify  a  list  of host or domain names, "/file/name" or "type:table" patterns, separated by commas
       and/or whitespace. A "/file/name" pattern is replaced by its contents; a "type:table" lookup table is
       matched  when  a  table  entry matches a lookup string (the lookup result is ignored).  Continue long
       lines by starting the next line with whitespace. Specify "!pattern" to exclude a host or domain  name
       from the list. The form "!/file/name" is supported only in Postfix version 2.4 and later.

       See also the VIRTUAL_README and ADDRESS_CLASS_README documents for further information.

       Example:

       virtual_alias_domains = virtual1.tld virtual2.tld

<b>virtual_alias_expansion_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1000)</b>
       The maximal number of addresses that virtual alias expansion produces from each original recipient.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>virtual_alias_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$virtual_maps)</b>
       Optional  lookup  tables  that  alias  specific  mail  addresses  or domains to other local or remote
       address.  The table format and lookups are documented in  <a href="virtual.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/virtual"><b>virtual</b>(5)</a>.  For  an  overview  of  Postfix
       address manipulations see the ADDRESS_REWRITING_README document.

       This  feature  is  available in Postfix 2.0 and later. The default value is backwards compatible with
       Postfix version 1.1.

       If you use this feature with indexed files, run "<b>postmap</b>  <b>/etc/postfix/virtual</b>"  after  changing  the
       file.

       Examples:

       virtual_alias_maps = dbm:/etc/postfix/virtual
       virtual_alias_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/virtual

<b>virtual_alias_recursion_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1000)</b>
       The  maximal nesting depth of virtual alias expansion.  Currently the recursion limit is applied only
       to the left branch of the expansion graph, so the depth of the tree can in the worst case  reach  the
       sum of the expansion and recursion limits.  This may change in the future.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>virtual_destination_concurrency_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$default_destination_concurrency_limit)</b>
       The  maximal  number  of parallel deliveries to the same destination via the virtual message delivery
       transport. This limit is enforced by the queue manager. The message delivery transport  name  is  the
       first field in the entry in the master.cf file.

<b>virtual_destination_recipient_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$default_destination_recipient_limit)</b>
       The  maximal number of recipients per delivery via the virtual message delivery transport. This limit
       is enforced by the queue manager. The message delivery transport name is the first field in the entry
       in the master.cf file.

       Setting  this  parameter to a value of 1 changes the meaning of virtual_destination_concurrency_limit
       from concurrency per domain into concurrency per recipient.

<b>virtual_gid_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Lookup tables with the per-recipient group ID for <a href="../man8/virtual.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/virtual"><b>virtual</b>(8)</a> mailbox delivery.

       In a lookup table, specify a left-hand side of "@domain.tld" to  match  any  user  in  the  specified
       domain that does not have a specific "user@domain.tld" entry.

       When  a  recipient  address  has  an optional address extension (user+foo@domain.tld), the <a href="../man8/virtual.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/virtual"><b>virtual</b>(8)</a>
       delivery agent looks up the full address first, and when the lookup fails, it looks up the unextended
       address (user@domain.tld).

       Note 1: for security reasons, the <a href="../man8/virtual.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/virtual"><b>virtual</b>(8)</a> delivery agent disallows regular expression substitution
       of $1 etc. in regular expression lookup tables, because that would open a security hole.

       Note 2: for security reasons, the <a href="../man8/virtual.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/virtual"><b>virtual</b>(8)</a> delivery agent will silently ignore requests to use  the
       <a href="../man8/proxymap.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/proxymap"><b>proxymap</b>(8)</a>  server.  Instead  it  will open the table directly. Before Postfix version 2.2, the <a href="../man8/virtual.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/virtual"><b>vir</b></a>-
       <a href="../man8/virtual.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/virtual"><b>tual</b>(8)</a> delivery agent will terminate with a fatal error.

<b>virtual_mailbox_base</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       A prefix that the <a href="../man8/virtual.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/virtual"><b>virtual</b>(8)</a> delivery agent prepends to  all  pathname  results  from  $virtual_mail-
       box_maps table lookups.  This is a safety measure to ensure that an out of control map doesn't litter
       the file system with mailboxes.  While virtual_mailbox_base could be set to "/", this  setting  isn't
       recommended.

       Example:

       virtual_mailbox_base = /var/mail

<b>virtual_mailbox_domains</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$virtual_mailbox_maps)</b>
       Postfix  is  final  destination  for  the  specified list of domains; mail is delivered via the $vir-
       tual_transport mail delivery transport.  By default this is the Postfix  <a href="../man8/virtual.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/virtual"><b>virtual</b>(8)</a>  delivery  agent.
       The  SMTP  server  validates recipient addresses with $virtual_mailbox_maps and rejects mail for non-
       existent recipients.  See also the virtual mailbox domain class in the ADDRESS_CLASS_README file.

       This parameter expects the same syntax as the mydestination configuration parameter.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later. The default value is  backwards  compatible  with
       Postfix version 1.1.

<b>virtual_mailbox_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>51200000)</b>
       The maximal size in bytes of an individual mailbox or maildir file, or zero (no limit).

<b>virtual_mailbox_lock</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b>
       How to lock a UNIX-style <a href="../man8/virtual.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/virtual"><b>virtual</b>(8)</a> mailbox before attempting delivery.  For a list of available file
       locking methods, use the "<b>postconf</b> <b>-l</b>" command.

       This setting is ignored with <b>maildir</b> style delivery, because such deliveries are safe without  appli-
       cation-level locks.

       Note  1:  the  <b>dotlock</b>  method  requires that the recipient UID or GID has write access to the parent
       directory of the recipient's mailbox file.

       Note 2: the default setting of this parameter is system dependent.

<b>virtual_mailbox_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Optional lookup tables with all valid addresses in the domains that match $virtual_mailbox_domains.

       In a lookup table, specify a left-hand side of "@domain.tld" to  match  any  user  in  the  specified
       domain that does not have a specific "user@domain.tld" entry.

       The  <a href="../man8/virtual.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/virtual"><b>virtual</b>(8)</a>  delivery agent uses this table to look up the per-recipient mailbox or maildir path-
       name.  If the lookup result ends in a slash ("/"), maildir-style delivery is carried  out,  otherwise
       the  path is assumed to specify a UNIX-style mailbox file.  Note that $virtual_mailbox_base is uncon-
       ditionally prepended to this path.

       When a recipient address has an optional  address  extension  (user+foo@domain.tld),  the  <a href="../man8/virtual.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/virtual"><b>virtual</b>(8)</a>
       delivery agent looks up the full address first, and when the lookup fails, it looks up the unextended
       address (user@domain.tld).

       Note 1: for security reasons, the <a href="../man8/virtual.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/virtual"><b>virtual</b>(8)</a> delivery agent disallows regular expression substitution
       of $1 etc. in regular expression lookup tables, because that would open a security hole.

       Note  2: for security reasons, the <a href="../man8/virtual.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/virtual"><b>virtual</b>(8)</a> delivery agent will silently ignore requests to use the
       <a href="../man8/proxymap.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/proxymap"><b>proxymap</b>(8)</a> server. Instead it will open the table directly. Before Postfix  version  2.2,  the  <a href="../man8/virtual.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/virtual"><b>vir</b></a>-
       <a href="../man8/virtual.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/virtual"><b>tual</b>(8)</a> delivery agent will terminate with a fatal error.

<b>virtual_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Optional  lookup  tables with a) names of domains for which all addresses are aliased to addresses in
       other local or remote domains, and b) addresses that are aliased  to  addresses  in  other  local  or
       remote  domains.   Available  before Postfix version 2.0. With Postfix version 2.0 and later, this is
       replaced by separate controls: virtual_alias_domains and virtual_alias_maps.

<b>virtual_minimum_uid</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>100)</b>
       The minimum user ID value that  the  <a href="../man8/virtual.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/virtual"><b>virtual</b>(8)</a>  delivery  agent  accepts  as  a  result  from  $vir-
       tual_uid_maps table lookup.  Returned values less than this will be rejected, and the message will be
       deferred.

<b>virtual_transport</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>virtual)</b>
       The default mail delivery transport and next-hop destination for final  delivery  to  domains  listed
       with $virtual_mailbox_domains.  This information can be overruled with the <a href="transport.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/transport"><b>transport</b>(5)</a> table.

       Specify a string of the form <u>transport:nexthop</u>, where <u>transport</u> is the name of a mail delivery trans-
       port defined in master.cf.  The <u>:nexthop</u> part is optional.  For more  details  see  the  <a href="transport.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/transport"><b>transport</b>(5)</a>
       manual page.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

<b>virtual_uid_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Lookup tables with the per-recipient user ID that the <a href="../man8/virtual.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/virtual"><b>virtual</b>(8)</a> delivery agent uses while writing to
       the recipient's mailbox.

       In a lookup table, specify a left-hand side of "@domain.tld" to  match  any  user  in  the  specified
       domain that does not have a specific "user@domain.tld" entry.

       When  a  recipient  address  has  an optional address extension (user+foo@domain.tld), the <a href="../man8/virtual.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/virtual"><b>virtual</b>(8)</a>
       delivery agent looks up the full address first, and when the lookup fails, it looks up the unextended
       address (user@domain.tld).

       Note 1: for security reasons, the <a href="../man8/virtual.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/virtual"><b>virtual</b>(8)</a> delivery agent disallows regular expression substitution
       of $1 etc. in regular expression lookup tables, because that would open a security hole.
