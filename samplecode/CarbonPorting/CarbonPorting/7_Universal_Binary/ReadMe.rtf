Step 7 in your Carbonizing project finalizes the modernization process.  This version adds support for Universal Binary.  Support is dropped for Mac OS prior to 10.3 and the associated PEF code and pre-10.3 code has been stripped out.  The CodeWarrior project is also retired as CodeWarrior never supported Universal Binaries.  The window and "dialog" code is now very similar.  The window method is down to 303 (-230 from 6.0) lines and the "dialog" method is down to 234 (-119 from 6.0) lines.}
