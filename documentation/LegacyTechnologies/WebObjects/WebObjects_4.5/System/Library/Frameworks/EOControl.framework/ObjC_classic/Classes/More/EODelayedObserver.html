Regardlessof how many of these messages the receiver gets during the run loop,it receives a single  <a frame= "conv" href="../../Classes/EODelayedObserver.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/EODelayedObserver/subjectChanged">subjectChanged</a> message from the queue-atthe end of the run loop. In this method the delayed observer cancheck for changes and take whatever action is necessary. Subclassesshould record objects they're interested in, perhaps in an <b>init</b> method, andexamine them in <b>subjectChanged</b>. An EOAssociation.(EOInterface)for example, examines each of the EODisplayGroups (EOInterface)it's bound to in order to find out what has changed. Another kindof subclass might record each changed object for later examinationby overriding <b>objectWillChange:</b>, but itmust be sure to invoke <b>super</b>'s implementationwhen doing so.</p><p>The rest of EODelayedObserver's methods have meaningful,if static, default implementations. EODelayedObserverQueue sendschange notifications according to the priority of each enqueued observer.EODelayedObserver's implementation of the  <a frame= "conv" href="../../Classes/EODelayedObserver.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/EODelayedObserver/priority">priority</a> method returns  <a frame= "conv" href="../../Classes/EODelayedObserver.html#CEGCCAHF">EOObserverPriorityThird</a>. Your subclasscan override it to return a higher or lower priority, or to have asettable priority. The other method a subclass might override is  <a frame= "conv" href="../../Classes/EODelayedObserver.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/EODelayedObserver/observerQueue">observerQueue</a>, which returns a defaultEODelayedObserverQueue normally shared by all EODelayedObservers.Because sharing a single queue keeps all EODelayedObserver's synchronizedaccording to their priority, you should rarely override this method,doing so only if your subclass is involved in a completely independent system.</p><p>A final method,  <a frame= "conv" href="../../Classes/EODelayedObserver.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/EODelayedObserver/discardPendingNotification">discardPendingNotification</a>,need never be overridden by subclasses, but must be invoked fromtheir implementation of dealloc. This prevents observers from beingsent change notifications after they've been deallocated.</p><br><a href="../../EOControlTOC.html"><img src="../../../../../../../images/up.gif" border="0" alt="Table of Contents"></a> </BODY></HTML>
