These changes are detailedin a separate chapter,  <a href="WebObjectsAPI.html#BGFCFBFE">"WebObjects Framework API Changes" </a>. In addition. WebObjects applicationdevelopers will likely be interested in the new Event Logging feature;see  <a href="EOF.html#CBGCFGEE">"Event Logging" </a>.</p><br><a name = "CEHJCEFC"></a><h2>Executive Summary</h2><p>The changes to the WebObjects Framework for the 4.5 releaseof WebObjects can be summed up as follows:</p><ul><li>MonitorProxy has been replaced by <code>wotaskd</code>.</li><li>The web server adaptors by default now get their configurationinformation from <code>wotaskd</code> via httprequests, and no longer maintain a temporary configuration filein <code>/tmp</code>. The web server adaptor can beconfigured to retrieve its configuration information from a fileon the current or a different web server; see  <a href="#BBJCHBCF">"Accessing Configuration Information" </a> fordetails.</li><li>The web server adaptors are now capable of automatically determiningwhich WebObjects application servers are available and which applicationsare running on those servers.</li><li>The web server adaptor configuration file, if used, now usesan XML format (see the online document <i>Deploying WebObjectsApplications</i> for details).</li><li>A number of aspects of WebObjects adaptor operation are nowconfigurable at runtime.</li><li>Much of the common functionality between WORequest and WOResponsehas been abstracted into a new class, WOMessage, that representsmessages with either HTML or-if your WebObjects application iswritten in Java-XML content. WOMessages allow your WebObjectsapplications to communicate with other WebObjects applications aswell as with applications that "speak " XML. </li><li>Installed as a part of WebObjects is the <code>com.ibm.xml.dom</code> package(IBM's alphaWorks), which contains various XML parsers for Javawritten by IBM. The WebObjects Framework uses the DOM parser togenerate document and document fragment objects from XML data (orto manipulate and/or generate XML data from a document object).For more information on the alphaWorks parser, including complete documentation,point your web browser to <code>http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com</code> andsearch for "XML Parser for Java".</li><li>Components can now be made stateless. A single instance ofeach stateless component is shared between multiple sessions, reducingyour application's memory footprint.</li></ul><p>To support the above new functionality, there have been variousadditions to the WebObjects Framework API's. For a complete listof changes, see  <a href="WebObjectsAPI.html#BGFCFBFE">"WebObjects Framework API Changes"</a>.</p><br><a name = "CEHGJDJG"></a><h2>Monitor Changes</h2><p>Monitor and MonitorProxy have changed substantially in WebObjects4.5. In particular, MonitorProxy has been replaced with a new processnamed "<code>wotaskd</code>" that's responsible forall things related to deployment on a particular host. Many of theresponsibilities formerly assumed by the Monitor application arenow handled by <code>wotaskd</code> (eachhost involved in a WebObjects deployment now runs <code>wotaskd</code>).Monitor now simply changes settings in your deployment environment.</p><br><table border = "0" BGCOLOR="#E6E6E6"><tr><td rowspan = "1" colspan = "1" valign = "top" scope="row"><b>Note: </b>Intheory, you could run multiple <code>wotaskd</code>'son different ports on the same machine and have different web serverstalk to the same app servers but see different applications. Thishas not been tested, however.</td></tr></table><br><p>Monitor registration with <code>wotaskd</code> nolonger used DO (Distributed Objects).</p><p>Monitor has a number of minor UI enhancements throughout,including:</p><ul><li>the "File Transfer Wizard," which allowsMonitor users to move files and directories between hosts beingmonitored, and</li><li>the "Path Wizard," which should appear everywhere you'rerequired to enter a path in Monitor, allowing you to browse thefile system on a particular host.</li></ul><p>There are new settings that can be altered from within Monitorthat affect the WebObjects adaptors.</p><br><a name = "BCECEGIJ"></a><h2>Web Server Adaptor Changes</h2><p>The WebObjects 4.5 API-based web server adaptor is intendedto be used as a server plug-in where state information can be maintainedfrom request to request. CGI is supported, but beyond the fact thatit's easier to debug, the CGI adaptor provides no real benefitover the API-based adaptor.</p><p>Among the features which differentiate it from the 4.0 WebObjectsadaptor:</p><ul><li>Many aspects are configurable at runtime, including:</li><ul><li>Load balancing strategy</li><li>Application/adaptor communication transport</li><li>Socket timeouts</li><li>Application URL version (the adaptor supports WebObjects 3.5,4.0, and 4.5 application URLs)</li><li>Error redirect URLs</li></ul></li><li>It supports a new, additional scheduling technique: "Instanceload-based scheduling."</li><li>It uses an XML-based configuration file format (see the onlinedocument <i>Deploying WebObjects Applications</i> fordetails).</li><li>Configuration for multiple web servers is simpler and moreautomatic: configuration files are no longer required.</li><li>The web server adaptor by default automatically discoversWebObjects-enabled systems.</li><li>Performance has been improved.</li></ul><p>For information on installing the adaptor, see the installationfiles for CGI, Apache, Microsoft ISAPI, Netscape NSAPI or NetscapeWAI.</p><br><table border = "0" BGCOLOR="#E6E6E6"><tr><td rowspan = "1" colspan = "1" valign = "top" scope="row"><b>Note: </b>TheWebObjects 4.5 NSAPI adaptor won't work with Netscape Enterprise3.5 servers.  If you want to use the NSAPI adaptor, you'll needto upgrade to Netscape Enterprise 3.6, or recompile with 3.5.</td></tr></table><br><br><a name = "CEHCAHED"></a><h2>Configuring the Web ServerAdaptor</h2><p>The web server adaptors by default now get their configurationinformation from <code>wotaskd</code> via HTTPrequests, and no longer maintain a temporary configuration filein <code>/tmp</code>. This release also includes supportfor the automatic discovery of systems running WebObjects by webserver adaptors. This should remove the necessity to administerthe web servers, beyond the initial adaptor installation. This automaticdiscovery mechanism is the default; to disable it, you'll needto change the web server adaptor's configuration file as outlined in  <a href="#BBJCHBCF">"Accessing Configuration Information" </a>.</p><p>When the web server adaptor starts up, and at intervals determinedby the configuration refresh interval setting, the adaptor sendsout a multicast request in an effort to discover which WebObjectsapp servers are available. Each app server's <code>wotaskd</code> processreplies with its URL (<code>http://me.myself.com:1085</code>).The adaptor constructs a list of these URLs and then polls eachin turn to get the full site configuration information.</p><p>If the configuration refresh interval is 10 seconds, the discoverybroadcast happens every 100 seconds (the discovery broadcast occursa factor of 10 less frequently).</p><br><a name = "BBJCHBCF"></a><h3>Accessing ConfigurationInformation</h3><p>Web server adaptor configuration information can now be obtainedin a number of ways. In addition to the default "multicast"mode, the web server adaptor can be set to retrieve configurationinformation from one or more WebObjects application servers running <code>wotaskd</code>,or it can be set to obtain configuration information from a configurationfile, which can be located either on the local machine or on a machinerunning a different web server.</p><p>By default, the adaptor uses multicast to communicate withall machines on same subnet that are running <code>wotaskd</code>.From the responses, the adaptor builds up a list of WebObjects applicationservers, along with all of the information necessary to allow accessto all of the the WebObjects application instances running on thosemachines. Although this is the default mode of operation, you canexplicitly specify that the Web server adaptor obtain its configurationinformation this way using an entry similar to the following inyour <tt>apache.conf</tt> file:</p><blockquote><pre># Retrieve configuration information using multicastWebObjectsConfig webobjects://239.128.14.2:1085 10</pre></blockquote><br><br><table border = "0" BGCOLOR="#E6E6E6"><tr><td rowspan = "1" colspan = "1" valign = "top" scope="row"><b>Note: </b>Forsimplicity, only entries in <tt>apache.conf</tt> areshown. However, the corresponding entries can be made for all othersupported web servers (with ISAPI you either need to make an entryin the Windows NT registry as shown in  <a href="#BBJGHCCB">"Changing the Web Server Adaptor Multicast Address" </a>or you need to rebuild the adaptor). See theinstallation instructions for your particular web server-in <tt>$NEXT_ROOT/Developer/Examples/WebObjects/Source/Adaptors</tt>-formore information.</td></tr></table><br><p>In the above, as in all of the configuration file entriesshown in this section, the final value-10 in this instance-indicatesthe configuration refresh interval.</p><p>While the multicast mode requires no configuration, in a realdeployment scenario you may wish to limit which application serverscan be accessed from a given web server. For instance, you may havemultiple web servers that each need to access a different set of WebObjectsapplications. Or, you may want to prevent end-user access to WebObjects applicationsin development or being tested on the same subnet. To explicitlyspecify the set of WebObjects application servers that can be accessedfrom a given web server, use an entry similar to the following inyour <tt>apache.conf</tt> file:</p><blockquote><pre># Retrieve config file from wotaskd (multiple hosts can be listed)WebObjectsConfig http://hostA:1085,http://hostB:1085 10</pre></blockquote><br><p>Note that <code>wotaskd</code> must be runningon each WebObjects application server in order for the above towork.</p><p>You can also have the web server adaptor obtain its configurationinformation from a configuration file. Using a configuration fileallows you to further limit what a given web server can access:in the configuration file you can specify that the web server canaccess only specific applications (or even specific instances ofa WebObjects application) on individual WebObjects application servers.This configuration file now uses an XML format (previously it wasformatted as a property-list) which is fully described in the onlinedocument <i>Deploying WebObjects Applications</i>.Place an entry similar to <em>one</em> of the followingin your <code>apache.conf</code> file to have the webserver adaptor obtain its configuration information from a file:</p><blockquote><pre># Retrieve config information from a file (XML-formatted config file)WebObjectsConfig file:///tmp/WebObjects.xml 10</pre></blockquote><br><p>or:</p><blockquote><pre># Retrieve config information from a file (old plist-style config file)WebObjectsConfig file:///tmp/WebObjects.conf 10</pre></blockquote><br><p>or:</p><blockquote><pre>#Retrieve config information from a file on a different web serverWebObjectsConfig http://my.webserver.com/WebObjects.xml 10</pre></blockquote><br><br><a name = "BBJGHCCB"></a><h4>Changing the Web ServerAdaptor Multicast Address</h4><p>The adaptor sends discovery requests out on a particular multicast"channel" (which is a combination of the IP address and theport). The defaults are:</p><p>Default IP Address: <code>239.128.14.2</code></p><p>Default port: <code>1085</code></p><p>The default multicast address is within the "AdminstrativelyScoped Domain." That is, it's within the range of addressesintended for internal use inside organizations. </p><p>For Apache, place the following in your <code>apache.conf</code> (thefinal value-10 in this instance-indicates the configurationrefresh interval):</p><blockquote><pre>WebObjectsConfig webobjects://239.128.14.2:1085 10</pre></blockquote><br><p>For CGI, either recompile, or set the <code>WO_CONFIG_URL</code> environmentvariable as above. </p><br><table border = "0" BGCOLOR="#E6E6E6"><tr><td rowspan = "1" colspan = "1" valign = "top" scope="row"><b>Note: </b>WithApache, you'll need the <code>SetEnv</code> command,which comes with the "env" module. Note that Mac OS X Serverdoesn't switch this module on by default.</td></tr></table><br><p>For NSAPI, place something like the following in your <code>obj.conf</code>:</p><p><em>Standard:</em></p><blockquote><pre>Init fn="WebObjects_init" root="/opt/ns-home/docs"      config="http://localhost:1085"</pre></blockquote><br><p><em>Multicast:</em></p><blockquote><pre>Init fn="WebObjects_init" root="/opt/ns-home/docs"      config="webobjects://239.128.14.2:1085"</pre></blockquote><br><p>For ISAPI, add the following to the registry:</p><blockquote><pre>\\SOFTWARE\\Apple\\WebObjects\\Configuration\\CONF_URL      webobjects://239.128.14.2:1085</pre></blockquote><br><p>By default <code>wotaskd</code> listens for multicastdiscovery requests on IP address <code>239.128.14.2</code>.If you configure the web server adaptor to send such requests toa different IP address, you must also set the <code>WOConfigMulticastAddress</code> userdefault on machines running <code>wotaskd (</code>youmust to do this as root/administrator). One way to do this is tomodify the startup script to set this user default as follows:</p><blockquote><pre>defaults write wotaskd WOConfigMulticastAddress 239.128.14.2</pre></blockquote><br><p>If you don't change the multicast IP address, the above <code>defaultswrite</code> isn't necessary.</p><br><a name = "TP503513107"></a><h3>Disabling or ProtectingAdministrator Access</h3><p>In WebObjects 4.5, sending the URL <code>http://<em>someHost</em>/cgi-bin/WebObjects/xyzzy</code> resultsin the webserver adaptor displaying information about all availableapplication instances.  As a convenience to the developer, thisfunctionality is enabled by default. This has certain security implications,however. For deployment this behavior should either be turned off orprotected with a username and password.</p><br><table border = "0" BGCOLOR="#E6E6E6"><tr><td rowspan = "1" colspan = "1" valign = "top" scope="row"><b>Note: </b> When <code><code>xyzzy</code></code> output is passwordprotected, you access the application instance display by supplyinga URL of the form: <code>http://<em>someHost</em>/cgi-bin/WebObjects/xyzzy?<em>username</em>+<em>password</em></code></td></tr></table><br><p>You protect the <code>xyzzy</code> outputby specifying a username and password. To disable it altogether,simply specify a username of "disabled".  How you do this dependson which webserver you're using. The following sections detailhow you disable or protect this feature for a number of common webservers.</p><br><a name = "TP503513108"></a><h4>Apache with mod_WebObjects.so</h4><p>To completely disable <code>xyzzy</code> output,add the line</p><blockquote><pre>WebObjectsAdminUsername disabled</pre></blockquote><br><p>to the bottom of the <tt>apache.conf</tt> file.To provide username and password protection, add the following twolines at the bottom of the <tt>apache.conf</tt> file:</p><blockquote><pre>WebObjectsAdminUsername <em>someName</em>WebObjectsAdminPassword <em>somePassword</em></pre></blockquote><br><br><a name = "TP503513109"></a><h4>NSAPI Adaptors</h4><p>To completely disable <code>xyzzy</code> output,add the following to your <tt>obj.conf</tt> file:</p><blockquote><pre>Init fn=WebObjects_init root="C:/Netscape/Suitespot/docs"config="webobjects://239.128.14.2:1085" username="disabled"</pre></blockquote><br><p>To provide username and password protection, add somethinglike the following to your <tt>obj.conf</tt> file (providingyour own username and password as appropriate):</p><blockquote><pre>Init fn=WebObjects_init root="C:/Netscape/Suitespot/docs"config="webobjects://239.128.14.2:1085" username="joe" password="secret"</pre></blockquote><br><br><a name = "TP503513110"></a><h4>ISAPI Adaptor</h4><p>To completely disable <code>xyzzy</code> output,add the following registry entry:</p><blockquote><pre>\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Apple\\WebObjects\\Configuration\\WOUSERNAME    disabled</pre></blockquote><br><p>To provide username and password protection, add registryentries similar to the following (providing your own username andpassword as appropriate):</p><blockquote><pre>\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Apple\\WebObjects\\Configuration\\WOUSERNAME    joe\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Apple\\WebObjects\\Configuration\\WOPASSWORD    secret</pre></blockquote><br><br><a name = "TP503513111"></a><h4>WAI</h4><p>To completely disable <code>xyzzy</code> output,add the following to your <tt>obj.conf</tt> file:</p><blockquote><pre>Init fn="WebObjectsServiceInit" root="C:/Netscape/Suitespot/docs"  config="webobjects://239.128.14.2:1085" username="disabled"</pre></blockquote><br><p>To provide username and password protection, add somethingsimilar to the following to your <tt>obj.conf</tt> file(provide your own username and password as appropriate):</p><blockquote><pre>Init fn="WebObjectsServiceInit" root="C:/Netscape/Suitespot/docs"  config="webobjects://239.128.14.2:1085" username="joe" password="secret"</pre></blockquote><br><br><a name = "TP503513112"></a><h4>CGI</h4><p>There are two options for disabling or protecting <code>xyzzy</code> outputwhen using CGI.  First, you can uncomment the relevant code (shownbelow) in <tt>main.c</tt> and then recompile the CGI adaptor.</p><blockquote><pre>/* * SECURITY ALERT * * To disable xyzzy, uncomment the next line.  * st_addStatic(options, WOUSERNAME, "disabled"); * * To specify an xyzzy username and password, uncomment the next two lines. * st_addStatic(options, WOUSERNAME, "joe"); * st_addStatic(options, WOPASSWORD, "secret"); * */</pre></blockquote><br><p>Alternatively, if the webserver is configured to pass environmentvariables, the CGI adaptor will read them.  For example, configureApache to load the module <tt>mod_env.so</tt> by addingor uncommenting the lines in <tt>apache.conf</tt>.</p><blockquote><pre>LoadModule env_module         /System/Library/Apache/Modules/mod_env.soAddModule mod_env.c</pre></blockquote><br><p>You will also need to add the following System directive in <tt>apache.conf</tt>:</p><blockquote><pre>PassEnv WO_XYZZY_USERNAME WO_XYZZY_PASSWORD</pre></blockquote><br><p>To completely disable <code>xyzzy</code> output,you must then create an environment variable <code>WO_XYZZY_USERNAME</code> andset its value to "disabled".</p><p>To provide username and password protection, create two environmentvariables, <code>WO_XYZZY_USERNAME</code> and <code>WO_XYZZY_PASSWORD</code>,and set them to, for example, "joe" and "secret" respectively.</p><br><a name = "CBGBIECE"></a><h2><!--Licensing Changes-->Licensing Mechanism</h2><p>The dynamic licensing mechanism in WebObjects 4.5 has the same goals as in previous releases, but a different implementation.<!--From a legal standpoint, the WebObjects 4.5 licensing schemeis not intended to be any different from 4.0.--> However, WebObjects4.5 changes both the registration mechanism for instances and theway the configuration is picked up by the webserver adaptors.Whenthe license is correctly enforced, these changes mean certain usagethat was possible (though not strictly conforming to the license)with WebObjects 4.0 is no longer possible with 4.5.</p><p>Unregistered instances appear with an instance ID of -1. Thisis all that is allowed with the restricted license. If an app seesa URL with a positive instance ID and the license is restricted,it will generate a "more than one instance detected" error message.This error simply means that there's an instance out there usinga positive instance ID when only -1 is allowed. In this instance,it does <em>not</em> literally mean there is more thanone instance running.</p><p>Apps now register via a UDP heartbeat with <code>wotaskd</code>.This fixes a large number of problems with the way the old monitoringscheme worked, but, if <code>wotaskd</code> knows aboutit, any app that registers with the correct name on a given portwill be given the instance ID assigned for that app name and portcombination. This can mean that your app gets a "deployment"instance ID when your license does not actually allow that. Thisbehavior is different from 4.0, since in 4.0 you either built the <tt>.conf</tt> fileyourself (and thus could do what you liked), or you allowed theadaptor to pick up the <tt>.conf</tt> file from <tt>/tmp</tt>,in which all instance IDs were set to -1. You can avoid this problemin WebObjects 4.5 by either picking a different port or removingthe instance from the configuration on that host using Monitor.</p><p>WebObjects 4.5 by default performs instance discovery viamulticast. On a large subnet with many machines running WebObjects,instance discovery could produce a lot of replies. WebObjects 4.5filters out non-deployment instances that aren't running on the samemachine as the adaptor, so the only ones you wind up seeing arethose you should be able to talk to, and the possibility of name/portcollision in the adaptor is reduced. This filtering basically meansyou can't talk to an app instance that isn't "deployed"if the webserver and adaptor are running on a different machine.To make this work in WebObjects 4.0 you had to create your own configurationfile (by copying the configuration file in <tt>/tmp</tt> onthe other machine) and use -1 for the instance IDs. In Webobjects4.5, you should be able to get this old WebObjects 4.0 behaviorby using a file URL to specify the adaptor configuration file. See  <a href="#BBJCHBCF">"Accessing Configuration Information" </a> for more information on specifying anadaptor configuration file.</p><br><a name = "CEHIJGGG"></a><h2>Miscellaneous Changes</h2><p>In addition to the numerous major changes listed elsewherein this document, a number of smaller changes are important to note:</p><ul><li>Configuration files have moved from<tt> $(NEXT_ROOT)/Library/WebObjects/Configuration</tt> to<tt> $(NEXT_ROOT)/Local/Library/WebObjects/Configuration</tt>.As with all end-user configurations, <tt>/Local</tt> isreserved for files which you change.</li><li>The <code>WOMonitorHost</code> user default (andcommand-line argument) has been deprecated. WOF always tries toregister with the service named <code>wotaskd</code> on <code>localhost</code>.</li><li>This release supports a <code>WORequiresWOF40Compatibility</code> userdefault that re-enables certain behaviors of the 4.0 release. Ifyou're having problems with an application you've ported fromWebObjects 4.0, set the <code>WORequiresWOF40Compatibility</code> userdefault to "YES".</li><li>The WORadioButtonList dynamic element has been deprecated.Use WORadioButtonMatrix (defined in the WebObjectsExtensions Framework)instead.</li></ul><br><a name = "CEHCFBJJ"></a><h2>Supplemental Documentation</h2><p>The following documentation supplements that found in the <i>WebObjectsDeveloper's Guide</i>.</p><br><a name = "CEHFFAJC"></a><h3>Direct-Connect Mode</h3><p>For deployment, a web server should be running to receiveHTTP requests and to forward them through the WebObjects adaptor.To simplify the development process, though, WebObjects applicationsare capable of receiving HTTP requests directly. This is the default;invoke WOApplication's <code>setDirectConnectEnabled</code> methodto disable direct-connect mode.</p><p>This feature has several advantages:</p><ul><li>You can debug applications on a machine thatdoesn't have a web server present.</li><li>You don't have to install project directories under theweb server's document root in order to test them.</li><li>Running without an HTTP server uses less memory on your developmentmachine.</li><li>The WebObjects example applications don't need to be installedunder the web server's document root (they are installed under <code>Developer/Examples/WebObjects</code>).</li></ul><p>The <code>WOPort</code> command-line option(also settable from Monitor) allows you to specify the number ofthe port where the application should listen for requests when operating withouta web server. By default, <code>WOPort</code> is-1, which assigns an arbitrary high port number to the application.Thus, you aren't required to specify a port number when in direct-connectmode. However, it's generally a good idea to assign a specificport number.</p><p>Note that if you do want to use a web server to test WebObjectsexamples, you can still do so. Before you do, perform a "makeinstall" (be sure to set <code>INSTALLDIR_WEBSERVER</code> inthe makefile preamble) to install the example's web server resources(such as image files and Java client-side classes) in the web server'sdocument root, just as you do when installing a WebObjects application.If you put your application in a directory other than "WebObjects"under your document root, set the <code>WOApplicationBaseURL</code> optionto the <code>.woa</code> directory'spath relative to the document root (<code>WOApplicationBaseURL</code> isset to <code>/WebObjects</code> bydefault). If you don't perform these steps, the web server won'tbe able to find web server resources; when you run the application,you'll see broken images, and client-side classes won't be loaded.</p><p>See the following section for more on developing with andwithout a web server.</p><br><a name = "TP503513113"></a><h3>Rapid Turnaround Mode</h3><p>WebObjects is largely an interpreted environment. The HTMLtemplates, declarations files, and WebScript files each representinterpreted languages. One of the main benefits of an interpretedenvironment is that you needn't recompile every time you makea change to the project. The ability to test your changes withoutrebuilding the project is called "rapid turnaround" and, whenusing rapid turnaround capability, you're said to be in "rapidturnaround mode."</p><p>WebObjects supports rapid turnaround of <code>.html</code>, <code>.wod</code>,and <code>.wos</code> files withinapplication projects, framework projects, and subprojects of eitherapplication or framework projects.</p><p>To support rapid turnaround, WebObjects must be able to locatethe resources of your application and its associated frameworkswithin your system's projects rather than the built products (the <code>.woa</code> or <code>.framework</code> wrappers).To tell WebObjects where to look for your system's projects youmust define the <code>NSProjectSearchPath</code> userdefault. Set this default to an array of paths where your projectsmay be found. (Relative paths are taken relative to the executableof your project.) The order of the entries in the array definesthe order in which projects will be located. The default <code>NSProjectSearchPath</code> is <code>("../..")</code>, whichcauses WebObjects to look for any other applicable projects in thedirectory where your application's project resides. For example,if your application's executable resides within:</p><blockquote><pre>c:\web\docroot\WebObjects\Projects\MyProject\MyProject.woa</pre></blockquote><br><p>then from the executable's directory, <code>"../.."</code> wouldpoint to:</p><blockquote><pre>c:\web\docroot\WebObjects\Projects</pre></blockquote><br><p>If you've set your project's "Build In" directoryto something other than the default, <code>"../.."</code> isn'tlikely to be appropriate; you should set your <code>NSProjectSearchPath</code> topoint to the directories where you keep your projects while youwork on them.</p><p>When your application is starting up, pay close attentionto those log messages which indicate that a given project is foundand will be used instead of the built product. Many problems canbe solved by understanding how to interpret this output. If no suchlog message is seen for a given project, it won't be possibleto use rapid turnaround for that project. </p><p>Pay close attention when you have several projects with thesame name in the same directory. This often happens when you haveseveral copies of the same project as backups in your project directory.For example, you might have:</p><blockquote><pre>c:\web\docroot\WebObjects\Projects\MyAppc:\web\docroot\WebObjects\Projects\Copy of MyAppc:\web\docroot\WebObjects\Projects\MyAppOld</pre></blockquote><br><p>Even though the folders containing the projects have differentnames, the <code>PB.project </code>files withinthem might be identical. WebObjects uses the <code>PROJECTNAME</code> attributeinside your project's <code>PB.project</code> fileto determine the name of the project, not the name of the directory forthe project. If this happens with in a WebObjects application, WebObjectschecks the path of the project in question against the path to theexecutable (after resolving symbolic links). and chooses the projectwhose path matches the initial portion of the executable's path(thus, in the above example it would choose <code>MyApp</code>).If multiple projects with the same <code>PROJECTNAME</code> attributereside within a single directory in a framework project, WebObjects choosesthe one who's <code>PROJECTNAME</code> matchesthe prefix of the framework's project directory. </p><br><a name = "TP503513114"></a><h4>Rapid Turnaround andDirect-Connect Mode</h4><p>Direct-connect mode allows you to test your application withoutinvolving a web server. This means that you don't have to installyour web server resources under the document root of your web server.The result is that rapid turnaround is even more convenient when indirect-connect mode because you needn't rebuild to install webserver resources changes to the document root. See  <a href="#CEHFFAJC">"Direct-Connect Mode" </a> formore information on Direct-Connect Mode.</p><br><a name = "TP503513115"></a><h4>Testing With a WebServer</h4><p>When you're working in direct-connect mode, few issues arisewith respect to rapid turnaround. If your application has featureswhich require a web server even for testing, however, there area couple of things to know to make rapid turnaround work for you. Specifically,since you are relying on the web server to locate files within <code>WebServerResources</code>,you must follow these guidelines:</p><ul><li>Your projects must reside somewhere below yourweb server's document root.</li><li><code>NSProjectSearchPath</code> shouldpoint to all projects of interest.</li><li>For application projects, the <code>WOApplicationBaseURL</code> userdefault should specify the directory containing the applicationproject. For example, if your application's project folder is:<blockquote><pre>c:\web\docroot\WebObjects\MyApp</pre></blockquote><br>	thenthe <code>WOApplicationBaseURL</code> user defaultmust be "<code>/WebObjects</code>".</li><br><br><li>For framework projects, the <code>WOFrameworksBaseURL</code> userdefault should specify the directory containing all framework projectsused by the application. For example, if your application uses <code>MyFramework.framework</code> andthat project resides in:<blockquote><pre>c:\web\docroot\WebObjects\Frameworks\MyFramework</pre></blockquote><br>	thenthe <code>WOFrameworksBaseURL</code> user defaultmust be "<code>/WebObjects/Frameworks</code>".</li></ul><p>Conveniently, the two examples above use the default locationsfor <code>WOApplicationBaseURL</code> and <code>WOFrameworksBaseURL</code>;if your projects reside in these default locations, you need only set <code>NSProjectSearchPath</code>.</p><p>Also, while it is possible to point <code>WOApplicationBaseURL</code> and <code>WOFrameworksBaseURL</code> toother locations, it is not suggested that <code>WOFrameworksBaseURL</code> bemoved since all WebObjects applications use <code>WOExtensions.framework</code>,which resides in the default location. If you set <code>WOFrameworksBaseURL</code> topoint elsewhere, one side effect will  be that the images in the "RaisedException" panel will not render.</p><br><a href="NewInWebObjects.html"><img src="../../../../../images/up.gif" border="0" width="36" height="16"></A></A></a></BODY></HTML>
