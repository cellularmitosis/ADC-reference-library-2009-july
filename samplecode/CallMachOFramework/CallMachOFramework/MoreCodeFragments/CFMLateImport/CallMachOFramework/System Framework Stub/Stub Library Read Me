Stub Library Read MeThis folder contains a dummy stub library that you use to satisfy the linker when using the CFMLateImport approach for calling Mach-O frameworks from CFM. The current stub library, SystemFrameworkLib, exports just a single symbol (gethostname). You can expand this list by editing the export file (SystemFrameworkStub.exp) and rebuilding the stub library using the MPW MakeStub command.    MakeStub SystemFrameworkStub.exp -o SystemFrameworkLibYou can download MPW from the Apple developer web site.    <http://developer.apple.com/tools/mpw-tools/>You can also build stub libraries with CodeWarrior Pro 6, but those libraries have certain quality problems that I find disturbing. I have reported those problems to Metrowerks.  Until they are fixed I will stick with MPW, however your mileage might vary.To build a stub library for all of the symbols in a framework, you need a list of those symbols. You can generate this list using the Mac OS X nm command line tool.  Type man nm on the command line for details.Share and Enjoy.Worldwide Developer Technical Support16 Nov 2000
