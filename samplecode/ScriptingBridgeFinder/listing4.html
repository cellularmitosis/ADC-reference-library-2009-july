Introduction

This file details the steps involved in putting together a project that uses
Scripting Bridge to send Apple events to the Finder application for finding
and launching applications.  



1. Start with a new Objective-C application.

This targets the Finder application and was built using the 'Cocoa Application'
Xcode template.  The techniques we are demonstrating in this sample can be used
in any Cocoa Application. 




2. Add a Scripting Bridge build rule to the project.

The first thing to do is to set up Xcode to automatically generate the
Scripting Bridge source for the application you would like to target.  The
following steps describe how you can do that:

(a) Turn down the &quot;Targets&quot; tab in the &quot;Groups &amp; Files&quot; list on the left hand
side and select the main target.  In this sample,  select the
&quot;ScriptingBridgeFinder&quot; target.  

(b) With the &quot;ScriptingBridgeFinder&quot; target selected, open the information
panel (by clicking on the Info icon, or by control- or right-clicking on the
target name and selecting &quot;Get Info&quot; from the pop-up menu).

(c) In the info window, click on the Rules tab and then click on the + button
at the bottom to add a new rule.

(d) Set up the new rule as follows:

    Process 'Source files with names matching:'   *.app
   
    using: 'Custom Script'
   
    set the script field to:
   
    sdef &quot;$INPUT_FILE_PATH&quot; | sdp -fh -o &quot;$DERIVED_FILES_DIR&quot; --basename
&quot;$INPUT_FILE_BASE&quot; --bundleid `defaults read &quot;$INPUT_FILE_PATH/Contents/Info&quot;
CFBundleIdentifier`

    click on the &quot;+&quot; icon below the 'with output files:' field, and then set the
field to contain:
    
    $(DERIVED_FILES_DIR)/$(INPUT_FILE_BASE).h

    NOTE: if you're typing this rule in by hand, note that it should all be one
one line, and it must be typed exactly as shown above.  If you have difficulty
entering the above command, then copy and paste the command from the readme into
the rule.

(e) All done.  You can close the info window.  Xcode is now set up to
automatically generate Scripting Bridge source for any applications you add to
your project.

NOTE: this rule uses the sdef and sdp command line tools.  To learn more about
these tools, use the following commands in the Terminal window:
   man sdp
   man sdef




3. Select a target application.

To do this, drag and drop the application you would like to target into the
project files group inside of the &quot;Groups &amp; Files&quot; list in the project window.  


You can drop the application among the source files you are using for your
application.  Because of the build rule we added in step 2, Xcode will treat the
Finder application as if it were one of the source files during the build.  

You should uncheck the 'Copy items into destination group's folder (if needed)'
option so the application is not copied into your project directory.  In this
sample we have selected 'Absolute Path' as the reference type so we can easily
move the project around from machine to machine without invalidating the
reference (so long as the Finder application is present in the
System/Library/CoreServices folder,  Xcode will be able to find it).

In this case, we are adding the Finder to our project.  The Finder application
is located in the /System/Library/CoreServices folder.




4. Add the target application to the Compile Sources.

After you have added the target application to your project, you must also add
it to the main target's Compile Sources.  You can do that by adding the
application to the 'Compile Sources' build phase under the main target.  In the
&quot;Groups &amp; Files&quot; list, open the &quot;Targets&quot; and the &quot;ScriptingBridgeFinder&quot; target
 and the Compile Sources build phase items by clicking on the arrows to the left
of them.  Then, drag the Finder.app from the project files group into the
Compile Sources.




5. Add the Scripting Bridge framework to your project.

Turn down the &quot;Frameworks&quot; group in the Groups &amp; Files area, and then
control-click (or right click) on the &quot;Linked Frameworks&quot; sub-group.  Select
&quot;Add &gt; Existing Frameworks...&quot; from the pop-up menu.  Then, add the
&quot;ScriptingBridge.framework&quot;
(/System/Library/Frameworks/ScriptingBridge.framework) to the project.  




6. Add a minimum system version Info.plist key.

Since the ScriptingBridge.framework is necessary for this application to run
and that framework is not present on previous system versions, you should add
the following key/value pair to the Info.plist file for the application.  If
someone tries to run this application on a system earlier than Mac OS X 10.5,
then they will receive a notice from launch services letting them know that the
application is meant to be run on a later version of Mac OS X.

    &lt;key&gt;LSMinimumSystemVersion&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;10.5&lt;/string&gt;

You can edit the Info.plist file by either clicking on its icon in the
resources section, or by clicking on the ScriptingBridgeFinder target, clicking
on the Info icon, selecting the Properties tab, and then clicking on &quot;Open
Info.plist as File&quot;.




7. Make sure the Target SDK is set to Mac OS X 10.5

You won't have to change this setting for this project, but if you are adding
Scripting Bridge to another project that you started an earlier version of the
Mac OS than Mac OS X 10.5, then you will need to update the Target SDK for the
project.  In the Groups &amp; Files view, select the ScriptingBridgeFinder project
icon at the top of the list and then open the information window.  Under the
General tab, change the Cross-Develop Using Target SDK: setting to Mac OS X
10.5.




8. Build your project.

If you have followed the steps above, Xcode will generate the Scripting Bridge
source for your project.  They will be put inside of your build folder in a
place where the linker and compiler can find them.  

The build rule that we installed will create a .h file with the same name as
the application.  For example, if you added Finder to our project, then the
build rule will create Finder.h.  The files will be created inside of the build
directory in the DerivedSources directory where the compiler can find them.

For the Debug build, the Finder.h file will be located in this sub folder of
the build directory:
/build/ScriptingBridgeFinder.build/Debug/ScriptingBridgeFinder.build/DerivedSources/Finder.h

For the Release build, the Finder.h file will be located in this sub folder of
the build directory:
/build/ScriptingBridgeFinder.build/Release/ScriptingBridgeFinder.build/DerivedSources/Finder.h

A convenient way for you to open and inspect these files is to use the 'Open
Quickly' command in the file menu.  For most purposes, the .h file will contain
most of the interesting information so to view that file you open the 'Finder.h'
file.  

In some cases, depending on what frameworks are in your project, the 'Open
Quickly' command may open the system's 'Finder.h' file that includes constants
and definitions used by the file system and the Finder application.  If that
happens for you, then you will need to navigate into the build folder to find
the correct header file.




9. Add in the Finder's Scripting Bridge header.

In the file Controller.h, add '#import &quot;Finder.h&quot;' near the top of the file
below '#import &lt;Cocoa/Cocoa.h&gt;'.  This will include all of the Scripting Bridge
definitions for the Finder.

When you're done, the imports section should look like this:

    #import &lt;Cocoa/Cocoa.h&gt;
    #import &quot;Finder.h&quot;

In your own application, of course, you would import the Finder.h file in the
file where you intend to use the definitions it contains.  In this sample, we
are using the Scripting Bridge interface inside of three methods and for a
property in our Controller class so that is why we are importing it into
Controller.h.




10. Roadmap - check out what the Scripting Bridge Finder sample is doing.

So, we've set up our sample and installed the basic parts.  Let's take a moment
to look at the bigger picture so we can see where we're going and how Scripting
Bridge fits into this sample.

In this sample we're displaying a list of applications in a window and if the
user double clicks on one of them (or selects one and clicks on the Launch
button), then we ask the Finder to launch it.  So, what are the different parts
of that picture, how are we accomplishing that, and how does Scripting Bridge
fit into that picture?  The following points should help explain those
questions.

(a) We're storing all of the information about the applications we find in the
Application's folder in a table of records (implemented as an NSArray containing
instances of NSDictionary).  For every application we find, we store the
'display name' of the application and a reference to the Scripting Bridge object
for the application in a NSDictionary in the main NSArray.

(b) In the awakeFromNib method, we designate our Controller object as the data
source and delegate for the list in the window.  That means that when the list
is being drawn on the screen, it will ask our controller object for the data to
display in the list.  In our Controller object we have implemented the methods
numberOfRowsInTableView: and tableView:objectValueForTableColumn:row: for this
purpose.  Inside of those methods, we simply return values stored in our table
of records.

(c) There are some other methods associated with the list view for the purpose
of receiving double clicks.  For more information about those, see the comments
in the Controller.m file.

(d) Repopulating the data stored inside of the table of records is where
Scripting Bridge comes in.  You'll notice that at the end of the awakeFromNib
method we have designated the updateApplicationsTable method to receive
NSApplicationDidBecomeActiveNotification notifications.  This means that our
updateApplicationsTable method will be called whenever ScriptingBridgeFinder is
switched into the forground in front of other applications.

And that's a great time to update the list of applications.  If our application
was in the background it may very well be the case that the user made some
changes or added some new programs.  By refreshing our list every time we're
switched in, we can be reasonbly sure that our list is up to date with what is
actually there.

Inside of the updateApplicationsTable method we call Scripting Bridge to scan
through the Application's folder (two levels deep) to scrounge for applications.
 Any applications that we find, we add into the table of records that we are
displaying in the list in the window.  And, then we tell the list to re-draw
itself.

(e) The second place where we put Scripting Bridge to work is inside of the
launchSelected: method.  We have set up this method so that it will be called
whenever the Launch button is clicked in the window or when the user double
clicks on an item in the list of applications in the window.

In the launchSelected: method we get the scripting bridge object for the
application selected in the list view out of the table of records and then we
use Scripting Bridge to ask the Finder to launch the application for us.


In the following steps discuss adding in the Scripting Bridge parts that fit
into this roadmap into the sample, and we'll provide some additional explanation
along the way.



11. Allocate an instance of the Finder Scripting Bridge object.

In this application the Finder SBApplication object is used in a number of
routines so rather than allocating the object whenever it is needed it is
allocated once at startup time and a reference to it is stored in a property of
the Controller class.

        /* allocate our scripting bridge object */
    self.finder = [SBApplication
            applicationWithBundleIdentifier:@&quot;com.apple.finder&quot;];

Note that the SBApplication object is being created using the
-applicationWithBundleIdentifier: method.  This method will dynamically load and
build the Scripting Bridge classes for the Finder from the Finder application.



12. Start populating the list of applications.

The first thing we're going to want to do is start building the list of
applications we can launch.  One of the simplest ways to do that, of course, is
to ask the Finder to find the applications in the Applications folder for you. 
So, that's what we're doing here.  Interesting points about in this section are:

(a) We're using the construct '[[[[finder startupDisk] folders]
objectWithName:@&quot;Applications&quot;] exists]' to determine if a Applications folder
exists.  The formulation '[[ &lt;collection&gt;  objectWithName: &lt;name&gt; ] exists]' is
a pattern you'll use again and again in Scripting Bridge code when testing for
the existence of named elements.

(b) There's really no searching to do.  If we want the applications, we can ask
the Finder for a list of them all by calling the applicationFiles method on the
Application's folder object.  

(c) We call the 'displayedName' access on the individual application objects to
find out what name is being displayed in the Finder interface.  This value will
be set correctly according to the user's view settings for the file. 

(d) We're calling the NSArray method sortUsingFunction:context: to sort the
list of applications.   This is a good example of using standard Cocoa
functionality together with Scripting Bridge to accomplish tasks that are
difficult to do in AppleScript alone.

The following code in the -updateApplicationsTable method in the file
Controller.m performs the operations described above.  Note we have left out the
part that does a second level search for applications.  We'll talk about that in
the next step. 

    

        /* if the applications folder exists... */
    if ( [[[[finder startupDisk] folders] objectWithName:@&quot;Applications&quot;]
exists]) {
        
            /* first, retrieve all of the applications in the main applications
folder.  */
        SBElementArray* topLevelApps = [[[[finder startupDisk] folders]
objectWithName:@&quot;Applications&quot;] applicationFiles];
        for ( FinderApplicationFile* nthApplication in topLevelApps ) {

                    /* add each application to our list of applications */
            [applications addObject:
                [[NSDictionary alloc] initWithObjectsAndKeys:
                    nthApplication, @&quot;sb-object&quot;, /* the scripting bridge
object */
                    [nthApplication displayedName], @&quot;name&quot;, /* name - used for
display and sorting */
                    nil]];

        }
        
        
            /* step 13 code here -- second level search for applications */
            
        
            /* sort the list of applications by name */
        [applications sortUsingFunction:AppCompare context:nil];
        
            /* tell the table view that the data has changed */
        [applicationsTable reloadData];
        
    }






13.  The second level search for applications.

Searching the top level of the application's directory really doesn't buy us
much.  After all, we could simply open the Application's folder in Finder and
there they all are.  It would be more interesting find all those ones that are
hidden away inside of folders in the Applications folder.  Displaying those in
our list would be much more interesting because it would save us the trouble of
poking around in sub folders looking for applications.

So, in this step we're going to add in an extra level of search to go through
all of the folders inside of the Applications folder to find applications stored
in there.  

Now, you might think, why not make it entirely recursive and go through
everything in the Application's folder?  Well, the reason why we've chosen the
two level route here is because it's not too common to have apps buried down
more than two levels deep.  And, perhaps more importantly, it is very common for
larger applications to include immense directory hierarchies among their
resources for their help files, and other supporting data.  Searching through
all of that would take a long time, and the odds of finding more apps there are
pretty slim.  So, there's the reasoning behind our two level approach.  Now, on
to implementing the rest of it...  

In this step we're inserting some code into the code we added in the last step.
 We're adding it into the code we added previously because we would like the
additional applications we find in this step sorted into the list we started
building in the last step.

Here, we ask the Finder for a list of all of the folders inside of the
Applications folder and then we iterate through them adding all of the
applications inside of them to our list of applications.


Adding in our second level search, we replace the comment mentioned in the last
section, '/* step 12 code here */', with the following code:


            /* second, search every folder inside of the applications folder for
            applications and add all of the applications we find into our list. */
            
            /* get all of the folders inside of the Application's folder on the startup
disk */
        SBElementArray* appFolders =[[[[finder startupDisk] folders]
objectWithName:@&quot;Applications&quot;] folders];
        for ( FinderFolder* nthFolder in appFolders ) {
        
                /* get all of the applications in the ith folder */
            SBElementArray* secondLevelApps = [nthFolder applicationFiles];
            for ( FinderApplicationFile* nthSecondLevelApp in secondLevelApps ) {
                    
                    /* add each of those applications to our list of applications */
                [applications addObject:
                    [[NSDictionary alloc] initWithObjectsAndKeys:
                        nthSecondLevelApp, @&quot;sb-object&quot;, /* the scripting bridge object */
                        [nthSecondLevelApp displayedName], @&quot;name&quot;, /* name - used for display
and sorting */
                        nil]];
                
            }
        }



14. The launching code

So far we have talked about the code to populate the list of applications
displayed in the window.  Now that we have that information in place, we can go
ahead and add in code for launching them.

At the point where this code is executed, we have already determined that there
is a selection in the list and we know the index of the selection (stored in the
integer variable theRow).  Here, we use that index to retrieve the scripting
bridge object from our table of records and then we ask the Finder to launch the
application.

It's worth mentioning here that though we're asking the Finder to launch the
application through the Scripting Bridge, you may have noticed that the way
we're doing it appears at though we're asking the application object to use the
Finder to launch itself.  Namely, we're calling the openUsing:withProperties:
method on the on the selected application rather than calling an open method on
the FinderApplication instance.  Here, it's worth pointing out that this is all
perfectly normal and the arrangement of methods here is purely a matter of how
the Finder's scripting dictionary has been set up.  


Here is the relevant code from the launchSelected: method near the bottom of
the file Controller.m with the following code:


            /* retrieve the selected application from our list
            of applications. */
        FinderApplicationFile* selectedApplication =
            (FinderApplicationFile*) [(NSDictionary*)
                [applications objectAtIndex: theRow]
objectForKey:@&quot;sb-object&quot;];
            
            /* ask the finder to open the application.  */
        [selectedApplication openUsing:finder withProperties:nil];





15. Where to next?

Documentation for Scripting Bridge can be found in the Scripting Bridge Release
Note.  To find the Scripting Bridge Release Note, select 'Documentation' from
the Help Menu in Xcode, select &quot;Release Notes&quot; from the &quot;Jump To:&quot; menu in the
top right of the document window, click on the &quot;View the complete Release Notes
List.&quot; link near the top left of the window and scroll down to the Scripting
Bridge Release Note.

There are man pages available for the Scripting Bridge command line tools.  To
access those pages, enter the following commands into the Terminal window:

   man sdp
   man sdef

There are two other Scripting Bridge samples available including
ScriptingBridgeiCal and ScriptingBridgeiTunes showing how to use Scripting
Bridge together with the Apps named in their titles.
