Introduction

This file details the steps involved in putting together a project that uses
Scripting Bridge to send Apple events to the Finder application for the purposes
of setting and getting comments assigned to files and folders.  



1. Start with a new Cocoa application.

In this sample we're going to target the Finder application so we'll call our
sample 'SBSetFinderComment'.  The techniques we are demonstrating in this sample
can be used in any Cocoa Application.  We used a simple one window Cocoa
application for this sample to keep it simple.  




2. Add a Scripting Bridge build rule to the project.

The first thing to do is to set up Xcode to automatically generate the
Scripting Bridge source for the application you would like to target.  The
following steps describe how you can do that:

(a) Turn down the &quot;Targets&quot; tab in the &quot;Groups &amp; Files&quot; list on the left hand
side and select the main target.  In this sample,  select the
&quot;SBSetFinderComment&quot; target.  

(b) With the &quot;SBSetFinderComment&quot; target selected, open the information panel
(by clicking on the Info icon, or by control- or right-clicking on the target
name and selecting &quot;Get Info&quot; from the pop-up menu).

(c) In the info window, click on the Rules tab and then click on the + button
at the bottom to add a new rule.

(d) Set up the new rule as follows:

  Process 'Source files with names matching:'   *.app
   
  using: 'Custom Script'
   
  set the script field to:
   
  sdef &quot;$INPUT_FILE_PATH&quot; | sdp -fh -o &quot;$DERIVED_FILES_DIR&quot; --basename
&quot;$INPUT_FILE_BASE&quot; --bundleid `defaults read &quot;$INPUT_FILE_PATH/Contents/Info&quot;
CFBundleIdentifier`

  click on the &quot;+&quot; icon below the 'with output files:' field, and then set the
field to contain:
  
  $(DERIVED_FILES_DIR)/$(INPUT_FILE_BASE).h

  NOTE: if you're typing this rule in by hand, note that it should all be one
one line, and it must be typed exactly as shown above.  If you have difficulty
entering the above command, then copy and paste the command from the readme into
the rule.

(e) All done.  You can close the info window.  Xcode is now set up to
automatically generate Scripting Bridge source for any applications you add to
your project.

NOTE: this rule uses the sdef and sdp command line tools.  To learn more about
these tools, use the following commands in the Terminal window:
   man sdp
   man sdef




3. Select a target application.

To do this, drag and drop the application you would like to target into the
project files group inside of the &quot;Groups &amp; Files&quot; list in the project window.  

You can drop the application among the source files you are using for your
application.  Because of the build rule we added in step 2, Xcode will treat the
Finder application as if it were one of the source files during the build.  

You should uncheck the 'Copy items into destination group's folder (if needed)'
option so the application is not copied into your project directory.  In this
sample we have selected 'Absolute Path' as the reference type so we can easily
move the project around from machine to machine without invalidating the
reference (so long as the Finder application is present in the
System/Library/CoreServices folder,  Xcode will be able to find it).

In this case, we are adding the Finder to our project.  The Finder application
is located in the /System/Library/CoreServices folder.




4. Add the target application to the Compile Sources.

After you have added the target application to your project, you must also add
it to the main target's Compile Sources.  You can do that by adding the
application to the 'Compile Sources' build phase under the main target.  In the
&quot;Groups &amp; Files&quot; list, open the &quot;Targets&quot; and the &quot;SBSetFinderComment&quot; target 
and the Compile Sources build phase items by clicking on the arrows to the left
of them.  Then, drag the Finder.app from the project files group into the
Compile Sources.




5. Add the Scripting Bridge framework to your project.

Turn down the &quot;Frameworks&quot; group in the Groups &amp; Files area, and then
control-click (or right click) on the &quot;Linked Frameworks&quot; sub-group.  Select
&quot;Add &gt; Existing Frameworks...&quot; from the pop-up menu.  Then, add the
&quot;ScriptingBridge.framework&quot;
(/System/Library/Frameworks/ScriptingBridge.framework) to the project.  




6. Add a minimum system version Info.plist key.

Since the ScriptingBridge.framework is necessary for this application to run
and that framework is not present on previous system versions, you should add
the following key/value pair to the Info.plist file for the application.  If
someone tries to run this application on a system earlier than Mac OS X 10.5,
then they will receive a notice from launch services letting them know that the
application is meant to be run on a later version of Mac OS X.

  &lt;key&gt;LSMinimumSystemVersion&lt;/key&gt;
  &lt;string&gt;10.5&lt;/string&gt;

You can edit the Info.plist file by either clicking on its icon in the
resources section, or by clicking on the SBSetFinderComment target, clicking on
the Info icon, selecting the Properties tab, and then clicking on &quot;Open
Info.plist as File&quot;.




7. Make sure the Target SDK is set to Mac OS X 10.5

You won't have to change this setting for this project, but if you are adding
Scripting Bridge to another project that you started an earlier version of the
Mac OS than Mac OS X 10.5, then you will need to update the Target SDK for the
project.  In the Groups &amp; Files view, select the SBSetFinderComment project icon
at the top of the list and then open the information window.  Under the General
tab, change the Cross-Develop Using Target SDK: setting to Mac OS X 10.5.




8. Build your project.

If you have followed the steps above, Xcode will generate the Scripting Bridge
source for your project.  They will be put inside of your build folder in a
place where the linker and compiler can find them.  

The build rule that we installed will create a .h and a .m file with the same
name as the application.  For example, if you added Finder to our project, then
the build rule will create Finder.h.  The files will be created inside of the
build directory in the DerivedSources directory where the compiler can find
them.

For the Debug build, the Finder.h file will be located in this sub folder of
the build directory:
/build/SBSetFinderComment.build/Debug/SBSetFinderComment.build/DerivedSources/Finder.h

For the Release build, the Finder.h file will be located in this sub folder of
the build directory:
/build/SBSetFinderComment.build/Release/SBSetFinderComment.build/DerivedSources/Finder.h

A convenient way for you to open and inspect these files is to use the 'Open
Quickly' command in the file menu.  For most purposes, the .h file will contain
most of the interesting information so to view that file you open the 'Finder.h'
file.  

In some cases, depending on what frameworks are in your project, the 'Open
Quickly' command may open the system's 'Finder.h' file that includes constants
and definitions used by the file system and the Finder application.  If that
happens for you, then you will need to navigate into the build folder to find
the correct header file.




9. Add in the Finder's Scripting Bridge header.

In the file Controller.m, add '#import &quot;Finder.h&quot;' near the top of the file
below '#import &quot;Controller.h&quot;'.  This will include all of the Scripting Bridge
definitions for the Finder.

When you're done, the imports section should look like this:

  #import &quot;Controller.h&quot;
  #import &quot;Finder.h&quot;

In your own application, of course, you would import the Finder.h file in the
file where you intend to call it from.  In this sample, we are using the
Scripting Bridge interface inside of three methods in our Controller class so
that is why we are importing it into Controller.m.




10. Roadmap - check out what the SBSetFinderComment sample is doing.

So, we've set up our sample and installed the basic parts.  Let's take a moment
to look at the bigger picture so we can see where we're going and how Scripting
Bridge fits into this sample.

In this sample we have have provided three methods that use Scripting Bridge to
perform some commonly implemented tasks: (a) retrieving a file's Finder comment,
(b) changing a file's Finder comment, and (c) revealing an item in the Finder.

We'll discuss each of these items in the sections below.




11. Retrieving a file's Finder Comment (aka, Spotlight Comment).

The method -finderCommentForFileURL: in the Controller class uses Scripting
Bridge to retrieve the Finder Comment for an item referred to by the file url
provided as a parameter.  As you can see, it's a very simple method:


- (NSString*) finderCommentForFileURL:(NSURL*) theFileURL {
    NSString* result;

    @try {
            /* retrieve the Finder application Scripting Bridge object. */
        FinderApplication* finder = [SBApplication
applicationWithBundleIdentifier:@&quot;com.apple.finder&quot;];
        
            /* retrieve a reference to our finder item asking for it by
location */
        FinderItem * theItem = [[finder items] objectAtLocation: theFileURL];
        
            /* set the result.  */
        result = theItem.comment;
    }
    @catch(NSException *e) {
        result = nil;
    }
    
        /* return the comment (or nil on error). */
    return result;
}

Interesting items to note here are:

(a) we use Objective-C exceptions for error handling.  If you need specialized
error handling, the SBApplication class allows you to set a delegate object that
implements a -eventDidFail:withError: delegate method.  The default simply
@throws an error and we interpret all errors as failures in this method.

(b) we use the +applicationWithBundleIdentifier: SBApplication class method to
create our Application object.  This will dynamically load the application
object based on the dictionary inside of the application itself rather than
building the application class from statically compiled information.

(c) the 'comment' property of the FinderItem is implemented as an Objective-C
2.0 property.  Most of the work involved with retrieving the comment including
the Apple events required to retrieve the information happens inside of the
property getter defined for this property.






12.  Changing a file's Finder Comment (aka, Spotlight Comment).

The method -changeFinderComment:forFileURL: in the Controller class uses
Scripting Bridge to set the Finder Comment for an item referred to by the file
url provided as a parameter.  As you can see, it is also a very simple method:


- (BOOL) changeFinderComment:(NSString*) comment forFileURL:(NSURL*) theFileURL
{
    BOOL result;

    @try {
            /* retrieve the Finder application Scripting Bridge object. */
        FinderApplication* finder = [SBApplication
applicationWithBundleIdentifier:@&quot;com.apple.finder&quot;];
                
            /* retrieve a reference to our finder item asking for it by
location */
        FinderItem * theItem = [[finder items] objectAtLocation: theFileURL];

            /* attempt to set the comment for the Finder item.  */
        theItem.comment = comment;
        
            /* successful result */
        result = YES;
    }
    @catch(NSException *e) {
        result = NO;
    }

        /* return YES on success */
    return result;
}


Interesting items to note here are:

(a) Again, we use Objective-C exceptions for error handling.  If you need
specialized error handling, the SBApplication class allows you to set a delegate
object that implements a -eventDidFail:withError: delegate method.  The default
simply @throws an error and we interpret all errors as failures in this method.

(b) we use the +applicationWithBundleIdentifier: SBApplication class method to
create our Application object.  This will dynamically load the application
object based on the dictionary inside of the application itself rather than
building the application class from statically compiled information.

(c) the 'comment' property of the FinderItem is implemented as an Objective-C
2.0 property.  Most of the work involved with changing the comment including the
Apple events required to set the comment to a new value inside of the property
setter defined for this property.









13.  Revealing an item in the Finder

The method -finderRevealFileURL: in the Controller class uses Scripting Bridge
to reveal the referenced item in one of the Finder's windows.  As you can see,
it is also a very simple method:


- (BOOL) finderRevealFileURL:(NSURL*) theFileURL {
    BOOL result;

    @try {
            /* retrieve the Finder application Scripting Bridge object. */
        FinderApplication* finder = [SBApplication
applicationWithBundleIdentifier:@&quot;com.apple.finder&quot;];
        
            /* retrieve a reference to our finder item asking for it by
location */
        FinderItem * theItem = [[finder items] objectAtLocation: theFileURL];
        
            /* display the item  */
        [theItem reveal];
        
            /* activate the Finder application  */
        [finder activate];

            /* successful result  */
        result = YES;
    }
    @catch(NSException *e) {
        result = NO;
    }
    
        /* return YES on success */
    return result;
}



Interesting items to note here are:

(a) Again, we use Objective-C exceptions for error handling.  If you need
specialized error handling, the SBApplication class allows you to set a delegate
object that implements a -eventDidFail:withError: delegate method.  The default
simply @throws an error and we interpret all errors as failures in this method.

(b) we use the +applicationWithBundleIdentifier: SBApplication class method to
create our Application object.  This will dynamically load the application
object based on the dictionary inside of the application itself rather than
building the application class from statically compiled information.

(c) We call the 'reveal' method defined on the FinderItem class to ask the
Finder to reveal the item in one of its windows.  This method call is where most
of the work involved in displaying the item occurs.

(d) To switch in the Finder so it is the frontmost application, we call the
FinderApplication's activate method.  You'll notice that this method is also
defined on the SBApplication class, so you can call it on any application to
bring it into the foreground.  Calling the activate method is equivalent to the
following AppleScript:

tell application &quot;Finder&quot;
    activate
end tell






14. Other details.

Much of the rest of the application code is there for housekeeping and managing
the GUI.  Interesting parts worth mentioning are:

(a) We limit the size of Finder Comments to 750 Unicode characters in length. 
Radar rdar://problem/4857955 states that Finder comments are limited to 750
Unicode characters.  This is the current recommendation at the time of this
writing.

(b) we implement a -applicationDidBecomeActive: NSApplication delegate method
to receive notifications whenever our application is switched into the
forground.  We take this opportunity to refresh the comment field in case the
comment was changed while our process was in the background.





15. Where to next?

Documentation for Scripting Bridge can be found in the Scripting Bridge Release
Note.  To find the Scripting Bridge Release Note, select 'Documentation' from
the Help Menu in Xcode, select &quot;Release Notes&quot; from the &quot;Jump To:&quot; menu in the
top right of the document window, click on the &quot;View the complete Release Notes
List.&quot; link near the top left of the window and scroll down to the Scripting
Bridge Release Note.

There are man pages available for the Scripting Bridge command line tools.  To
access those pages, enter the following commands into the Terminal window:

   man sdp
   man sdef

There are two other Scripting Bridge samples available including
ScriptingBridgeiCal and ScriptingBridgeFinder showing how to use Scripting
Bridge together with the Apps named in their titles.
