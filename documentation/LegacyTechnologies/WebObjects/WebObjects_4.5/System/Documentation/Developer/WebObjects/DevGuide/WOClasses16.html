In the <strong>dealloc</strong> method, the object releases any retained instance variables. In WebScript, this usually happens implicitly; you therefore usually don't need to implement the <strong>dealloc</strong> method in any objects you write. In Java, objects have automatic garbage collection, so this deallocation step is unnecessary. <p></a><a name="8949"><B>Note: </B> WOApplication provides two Java methods-<strong>garbageCollectionPeriod()</strong> and <strong>setGarbageCollectionPeriod()</strong>-that allow you to get and set the amount of time between garbage collections.<p></a><P> <a href="WOClassesTOC.html"><IMG SRC="ArrowUp.gif">Table of Contents</a> <a href="WOClasses17.html"><IMG SRC="ArrowRight.gif">Next Section</a><P></body></html>
