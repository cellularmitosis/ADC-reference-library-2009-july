In	the debugging version of the macros, they dump a string to the debugger before	dropping into the error handler.		To turn debugging off, set the macro qDebugging to 0 before including Common Stuff.		If an application wants to include special debugging code, the proper way to do this	is with something like:		#if qDebugging  		// do additional sanity checking here.	#endif		Note that this should only be additional sanity checking code and not eliminate all error	checking code.	*********************************************************************************/#define qDebugging 0#ifndef qDebugging	#define qDebugging 0#endif#if qDebugging	#define SIGNAL_ERROR(msg)		{DebugStr(msg); goto error;}#else	#define SIGNAL_ERROR(msg)		{goto error;}#endif#define FAIL_NIL(y,msg)			if (y == NULL) SIGNAL_ERROR(msg)#define FAIL_OSERR(y,msg)		if (y != noErr) SIGNAL_ERROR(msg)#define FAIL_FALSE(y,msg)		if (!y) SIGNAL_ERROR(msg)	/*********************************************************************************	QUICKDRAW		This includes a standard set of functions and color constants to use in apps	that use quickdraw.
