<h2> Deploying on Multiple Hosts</h2>
</a><a name="6009">
Creating a deployment environment sometimes involves more than one HTTP server and many WebObjects application instances running on each server. The Monitor application is designed to run on a single machine. Thus there can only be one copy of Monitor running at a time and managing the same set of hosts. To make several hosts available to Monitor, a service called <strong>MonitorProxy</strong> must be running. With a <strong>MonitorProxy</strong> running the Monitor application can remotely administer a host machine.<p>

A large WebObjects deployment could be depicted as in the following diagram:<p>

Machine 1 acts as the web server and load balancer between all the application servers running on Machines 2, 3, and 4. You should run Monitor on the same host as the web server and the WebObjects adaptor since Monitor is involved in modifying and updating the <strong>WebObjects.conf</strong> file. which the adaptor uses to find instances.<p>
