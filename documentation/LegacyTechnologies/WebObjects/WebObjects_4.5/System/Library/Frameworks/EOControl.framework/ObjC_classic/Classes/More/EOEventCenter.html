EOEventis an abstract class whose subclasses are responsible for definingthe events they track. For example, there are (private) subclasses forSybase adaptor events, editing context events, WOApplication events,and so on. To enable event logging in an application, simply openthe WOEventSetup page as described in  <a frame= "conv" href="#CBGCAACH">"WOEventSetup page" </a> and enablelogging for the event classes you want to see.</p><p>In addition to the framework support, the WOExtensions frameworkprovides components for using the feature. WOEventSetup is a pageyou use to configure event logging, and WOEventDisplay is a pagethe displays event information. Both pages can be accessed in anyWebObjects 4.5 application with a direct action.</p><br><a name = "CBGCAACH"><h2>WOEventSetup page</h2></a><p> The page used to set up the logging properties is accessedthrough a direct action named "WOEventSetup". So for example,you can access the WOEventSetup page for an application named "MyApp"with a URL such as the following:</p><blockquote><pre>http://myhost:aPort/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MyApp.woa/wa/WOEventSetup</pre></blockquote><br><p>On the WOEventSetup page, you can see all families of eventsthat are registered for the application. Since the event classesare registered dynamically as the program executes, it is a goodidea to "warm up" an application before accessing WOEventSetup.</p><p>The page lists the registered event classes, their subcategories,and a description of the kinds of events that can be logged. Forinstance, the EOEditingContext event class logs events for the <b>saveChanges</b> and <b>objectsWithFetchSpecification:</b> methods.Logging for each class can be enabled and disabled with the correspondingcheck box; it isn't possible to disable individual subcategoriesof an event class.</p><p>The logging mechanism is extremely fast and memory efficient.A standard 300MHz G3 can log more than 300,000 events per second,so event logging overhead is negligible compared to the time required togenerate dynamic web pages.</p><br><h2>User Defaults</h2><p>In addition to the configuration you can do on the WOEventSetuppage, the event logging system uses user defaults to additionallyconfigure event logging behavior. The user defaults are:</p><ul><li><b>EOEventLoggingEnabled</b>, a booleanvalue that specifies whether or not to log registered event classesby default.</li><li><b>EOEventLoggingLimit</b>, an integer value thatspecifies the number of events to log before suspending logging.</li></ul><br><a name = "CAHGDEGG"><h2>WOEventDisplay page</h2></a><p>The page that displays collected events, WOEventDisplay, isalso accessed through a direct action. For example, you can accessthe WOEventSetup page for an application named "MyApp" witha URL such as the following:</p><blockquote><pre>http://myhost:aPort/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MyApp.woa/wa/WOEventDisplay</pre></blockquote><br><p>On this page, you can view events in four different ways:</p><ul><li><em>Raw root events</em>. In thisview, all events at the root level (events without an encompassingevent) are displayed. WOEventDisplay shows each event individually,which means that it's possible for an event to appear multipletimes if the thread of execution crossed its point more than once.</li><li><em>Aggregated root events</em>. This view issimilar to the raw root event view, except that multiple identical eventsare aggregated, and their combined time is displayed. In addition,the "Calls" column shows how many times an event was executed(in other words, how many events contributed to the displayed aggregateevent).</li><li><em>Events grouped by page and component</em>.In this view, the first level of display shows only page names. Byexpanding a page, you get a list of components in that page. Expandinga component shows all the events within that component. This meansthat even events which were collected "deep" within a componentare shown immediately below the component name. All identical eventsare aggregated as in the aggregated root event view for easier reading.It's possible to traverse the component event hierarchy by expandingthe hyperlinks within a component.Note that since a page is also a component, a page with nodynamic subcomponents seems as if it's nested one level too deep.This is the correct behavior.</li><li><em>Events grouped by page only</em>. This displayis similar to the grouped by page and component view, except theevents do not have a by-component subgrouping.</li></ul><p>In any of these displays, if an event or event group has subevents,it can be expanded by clicking the hyperlink or triangle image.</p><p>Each view orders events by duration (in milliseconds) fromthe longest to the shortest. Aggregation induces rounding errors,which are a maximum of 1ms per event. In other words, an aggregateevent consisting of ten events has at most 1ms deviation from theactual run time; however, manually adding ten individual eventsas displayed in the table might have up to a 10ms deviation. Therefore,any displayed sum is always more accurate than adding up the durationsof individual events. Also note that the sub-events of an eventbranch doesn't necessarily add up to the duration of the branchevent-the branch event's duration might be larger. This becausethe parent event generally consists of more than just calling themethods causing the sub-events.</p><br><a name = "CAHJJFFF"><h2>Custom Event Logging</h2></a><p>To define and log custom events, you create an event class,you define the event's categories and subcategories, you registerthe event class with the WOEvent center, and you instrument theportions of code you want to log. This section describes these steps.</p><p>To create a custom event:</p><ol><li>Create a subclass of EOEvent or an appropriatesubclass. For example, to log events for a custom adaptor you've written,say MyAdaptor, create an EOEvent subclass named MyAdaptorEvent.Your subclass doesn't usually have to override any of the inheritedmethods, but you can customize the default behavior. For more information,see the  <a frame= "conv" href="../../Classes/EOEvent.html#CIAJIBIA">EOEvent</a> classspecification.</li><li>Create a description file for your event and add it to yourproject's Resources folder.An event's description file defines the event categoriesand subcategories used in the WOEventDisplay page. The file'scontents is a dictionary in plist format. For the MyAdaptorEvent class,the file's name is <tt>MyAdaptorEvent.description</tt>,and it might look like the following:<blockquote><pre>{    EOEventGroupName = "MyAdaptor Event";    connect = "Connect";    openChannel = "Open Channel";    evaluateExpression = "Evaluate Expression";    fetchRow = "Fetch Row";    commitTransaction = "Commit Transaction";}</pre></blockquote><br>For more information, see the  <a frame= "conv" href="../../Classes/EOEvent.html#//apple_ref/occ/clm/EOEvent/eventTypeDescriptions">eventTypeDescriptions</a> methoddescription in the  <a frame= "conv" href="../../Classes/EOEvent.html#CIAJIBIA">EOEvent</a> class specification.</li><li>Register the event class with the EOEventCenter.Typically you register an event class in the <b>initialize</b> methodof the class whose code you're instrumenting-MyAdaptor in thisexample.<blockquote><pre>static Class MyAdaptorEventLoggingClass = Nil;static NSString *connectEvent = @"connect";static NSString *openChannelEvent = @"openChannel";static NSString *evaluateExpressionEvent = @"evaluateExpression";static NSString *fetchRowEvent = @"fetchRow";static NSString *commitTransactionEvent = @"commitTransaction";+ (void)initialize {    [EOEventCenter registerEventClass:[MyAdaptorEvent class]            classPointer:&MyAdaptorEventLoggingClass];}</pre></blockquote><br>As in this example, you might want to define string constantsfor the keys in your event's description dictionary.</li><li>Instrument the methods.In any method you want to instrument, add the following code,substituting the appropriate event key. This code instruments the"connect" event of MyAdaptorEvent.<blockquote><pre>MyAdaptorEvent *event = nil;// Setup and start loggingif (MyAdaptorEventLoggingClass) {    event = EONewEventOfClass(MyAdaptorEventLoggingClass, connectEvent);    EOMarkStartOfEvent(event, nil);}// Code to be timed goes here.// Finish logging.if(event) {    EOMarkEndOfEvent(event);</pre></blockquote><br>The second argument to <b>EONewEventOfClass</b> isan event key corresponding with an entry in the <tt>.description</tt> file.The corresponding value is used in the Title column of the WOEventDisplaypage. If the argument isn't a key in the description dictionary, <b>EONewEventOfClass</b> usesthe argument instead.For more information on the methods used in this example,see the appropriate method descriptions in the  <a frame= "conv" href="../../Classes/EOEventCenter.html#CAHBICFD">EOEventCenter</a> class specification.</li></ol><br><a href="../../EOControlTOC.html"><img src="../../../../../../../images/up.gif" border="0" alt="Table of Contents"></a> </BODY></HTML>
