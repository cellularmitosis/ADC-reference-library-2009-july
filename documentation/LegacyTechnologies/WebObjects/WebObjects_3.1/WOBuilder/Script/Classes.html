<H1><CENTER><A NAME="REF35484">Classes</A></CENTER></H1>                                                                            
 <P>A class specifies the type of a variable. There are three types of classes in WebObjects:                                                                                 
<UL>
<P><LI><i>Base Classes</i>. The base classes are Object, Number, and String. They represent a single value. That is, a variable of the Number class represents a single       
 number, and a variable of the String class represent a single string.                  
<P><LI><i>Composite Classes</i>. The composite classes are Array and Dictionary. Composite classes represent a group of related values. For example, a Dictionary class       
 named Guest might represent all information about one guest, and an Array of           
 Guest might represent a list of all guests.                                            
<P>Most of the time when you create a new class in WebObjects Builder, you are            
 creating a Dictionary class. When you define a Dictionary class, you must specify its attributes.                                                                    
<P><LI><i>Enterprise Object Classes</i>. Enterprise object classes are used in applications      
 that access a database.                                                                
</UL>
<P>Object, Number, String, and Array are all part of the Foundation Framework. For        
 example, if you click the array checkbox when creating a variable, you are creating    
 an instance of NSMutableArray (mutable meaning you can add or delete values). If       
 you're unfamiliar with the Foundation Framework, see the <i>Foundation Framework Reference</i>.                                                                                 
 <P>When you create a dictionary, you're also creating an instance of a Foundation         
 class, namely NSMutableDictionary. The attributes you define for the class are keys    
 to the dictionary.                                                                     
 <P>Enterprise object classes are created when you add a display group to your application. See "<A HREF="CreateWODisplayGroup.html#REF63311">Creating a WODisplayGroup</A>."
