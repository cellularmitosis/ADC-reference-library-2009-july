SUDO(8)                                     MAINTENANCE COMMANDS                                     SUDO(8)



<b>NAME</b>
       sudo - execute a command as another user

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>sudo</b> <b>-K</b> | <b>-L</b> | <b>-V</b> | <b>-h</b> | <b>-k</b> | <b>-l</b> | <b>-v</b>

       <b>sudo</b> [<b>-HPSb</b>] [<b>-a</b> <u>auth</u><b>_</b><u>type</u>] [<b>-c</b> <u>class</u>|<u>-</u>] [<b>-p</b> <u>prompt</u>] [<b>-u</b> <u>username</u>|<u>#uid</u>]
       {<b>-e</b> file [...] | <b>-i</b> | <b>-s</b> | <u>command</u>}

       <b>sudoedit</b> [<b>-S</b>] [<b>-a</b> <u>auth</u><b>_</b><u>type</u>] [<b>-p</b> <u>prompt</u>] [<b>-u</b> <u>username</u>|<u>#uid</u>] file [...]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       <b>sudo</b> allows a permitted user to execute a <u>command</u> as the superuser or another user, as specified in
       the <u>sudoers</u> file.  The real and effective uid and gid are set to match those of the target user as
       specified in the passwd file and the group vector is initialized based on the group file (unless the
       <b>-P</b> option was specified).  If the invoking user is root or if the target user is the same as the
       invoking user, no password is required.  Otherwise, <b>sudo</b> requires that users authenticate themselves
       with a password by default (NOTE: in the default configuration this is the user's password, not the
       root password).  Once a user has been authenticated, a timestamp is updated and the user may then use
       sudo without a password for a short period of time (5 minutes unless overridden in <u>sudoers</u>).

       When invoked as <b>sudoedit</b>, the <b>-e</b> option (described below), is implied.

       <b>sudo</b> determines who is an authorized user by consulting the file <u>/private/etc/sudoers</u>.  By giving
       <b>sudo</b> the <b>-v</b> flag a user can update the time stamp without running a <u>command.</u> The password prompt
       itself will also time out if the user's password is not entered within 0 minutes (unless overridden
       via <u>sudoers</u>).

       If a user who is not listed in the <u>sudoers</u> file tries to run a command via <b>sudo</b>, mail is sent to the
       proper authorities, as defined at configure time or in the <u>sudoers</u> file (defaults to root).  Note
       that the mail will not be sent if an unauthorized user tries to run sudo with the <b>-l</b> or <b>-v</b> flags.
       This allows users to determine for themselves whether or not they are allowed to use <b>sudo</b>.

       If <b>sudo</b> is run by root and the SUDO_USER environment variable is set, <b>sudo</b> will use this value to
       determine who the actual user is.  This can be used by a user to log commands through sudo even when
       a root shell has been invoked.  It also allows the <b>-e</b> flag to remain useful even when being run via a
       sudo-run script or program.  Note however, that the sudoers lookup is still done for root, not the
       user specified by SUDO_USER.

       <b>sudo</b> can log both successful and unsuccessful attempts (as well as errors) to <a href="../man3/syslog.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/syslog"><u>syslog</u>(3)</a>, a log file,
       or both.  By default <b>sudo</b> will log via <a href="../man3/syslog.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/syslog"><u>syslog</u>(3)</a> but this is changeable at configure time or via the
       <u>sudoers</u> file.

<b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>sudo</b> accepts the following command line options:

       -H  The <b>-H</b> (<u>HOME</u>) option sets the HOME environment variable to the homedir of the target user (root
           by default) as specified in <a href="../man5/passwd.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/passwd">passwd(5)</a>.  By default, <b>sudo</b> does not modify HOME (see <u>set</u><b>_</b><u>home</u> and
           <u>always</u><b>_</b><u>set</u><b>_</b><u>home</u> in <a href="../man5/sudoers.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/sudoers">sudoers(5)</a>).

       -K  The <b>-K</b> (sure <u>kill</u>) option is like <b>-k</b> except that it removes the user's timestamp entirely.  Like
           <b>-k</b>, this option does not require a password.

       -L  The <b>-L</b> (<u>list</u> defaults) option will list out the parameters that may be set in a <u>Defaults</u> line
           along with a short description for each.  This option is useful in conjunction with <a href="../man1/grep.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/grep"><u>grep</u>(1)</a>.

       -P  The <b>-P</b> (<u>preserve</u> <u>group</u> <u>vector</u>) option causes <b>sudo</b> to preserve the invoking user's group vector
           unaltered.  By default, <b>sudo</b> will initialize the group vector to the list of groups the target
           user is in.  The real and effective group IDs, however, are still set to match the target user.

       -S  The <b>-S</b> (<u>stdin</u>) option causes <b>sudo</b> to read the password from the standard input instead of the
           terminal device.

       -V  The <b>-V</b> (<u>version</u>) option causes <b>sudo</b> to print the version number and exit.  If the invoking user
           is already root the <b>-V</b> option will print out a list of the defaults <b>sudo</b> was compiled with as
           well as the machine's local network addresses.

       -a  The <b>-a</b> (<u>authentication</u> <u>type</u>) option causes <b>sudo</b> to use the specified authentication type when
           validating the user, as allowed by /etc/login.conf.  The system administrator may specify a list
           of sudo-specific authentication methods by adding an "auth-sudo" entry in /etc/login.conf.  This
           option is only available on systems that support BSD authentication where <b>sudo</b> has been config-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ured&nbsp;configured</font>
           ured with the --with-bsdauth option.

       -b  The <b>-b</b> (<u>background</u>) option tells <b>sudo</b> to run the given command in the background.  Note that if
           you use the <b>-b</b> option you cannot use shell job control to manipulate the process.

       -c  The <b>-c</b> (<u>class</u>) option causes <b>sudo</b> to run the specified command with resources limited by the
           specified login class.  The <u>class</u> argument can be either a class name as defined in
           /etc/login.conf, or a single '-' character.  Specifying a <u>class</u> of - indicates that the command
           should be run restricted by the default login capabilities for the user the command is run as.
           If the <u>class</u> argument specifies an existing user class, the command must be run as root, or the
           <b>sudo</b> command must be run from a shell that is already root.  This option is only available on
           systems with BSD login classes where <b>sudo</b> has been configured with the --with-logincap option.

       -e  The <b>-e</b> (<u>edit</u>) option indicates that, instead of running a command, the user wishes to edit one or
           more files.  In lieu of a command, the string "sudoedit" is used when consulting the <u>sudoers</u>
           file.  If the user is authorized by <u>sudoers</u> the following steps are taken:

           1.      Temporary copies are made of the files to be edited with the owner set to the invoking
                   user.

           2.      The editor specified by the VISUAL or EDITOR environment variables is run to edit the
                   temporary files.  If neither VISUAL nor EDITOR are set, the program listed in the <u>editor</u>
                   <u>sudoers</u> variable is used.

           3.      If they have been modified, the temporary files are copied back to their original loca-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;location</font>
                   tion and the temporary versions are removed.

           If the specified file does not exist, it will be created.  Note that unlike most commands run by
           <b>sudo</b>, the editor is run with the invoking user's environment unmodified.  If, for some reason,
           <b>sudo</b> is unable to update a file with its edited version, the user will receive a warning and the
           edited copy will remain in a temporary file.

       -h  The <b>-h</b> (<u>help</u>) option causes <b>sudo</b> to print a usage message and exit.

       -i  The <b>-i</b> (<u>simulate</u> <u>initial</u> <u>login</u>) option runs the shell specified in the <a href="../man5/passwd.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/passwd">passwd(5)</a> entry of the
           user that the command is being run as.  The command name argument given to the shell begins with
           a - to tell the shell to run as a login shell.  <b>sudo</b> attempts to change to that user's home
           directory before running the shell.  It also initializes the environment, leaving <u>TERM</u> unchanged,
           setting <u>HOME</u>, <u>SHELL</u>, <u>USER</u>, <u>LOGNAME</u>, and <u>PATH</u>, and unsetting all other environment variables.
           Note that because the shell to use is determined before the <u>sudoers</u> file is parsed, a
           <u>runas</u><b>_</b><u>default</u> setting in <u>sudoers</u> will specify the user to run the shell as but will not affect
           which shell is actually run.

       -k  The <b>-k</b> (<u>kill</u>) option to <b>sudo</b> invalidates the user's timestamp by setting the time on it to the
           epoch.  The next time <b>sudo</b> is run a password will be required.  This option does not require a
           password and was added to allow a user to revoke <b>sudo</b> permissions from a .logout file.

       -l  The <b>-l</b> (<u>list</u>) option will list out the allowed (and forbidden) commands for the user on the cur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rent&nbsp;current</font>
           rent host.

       -p  The <b>-p</b> (<u>prompt</u>) option allows you to override the default password prompt and use a custom one.
           The following percent (`%') escapes are supported:

           %u      expanded to the invoking user's login name

           %U      expanded to the login name of the user the command will be run as (defaults to root)

           %h      expanded to the local hostname without the domain name

           %H      expanded to the local hostname including the domain name (on if the machine's hostname is
                   fully qualified or the <u>fqdn</u> sudoers option is set)

           %%      two consecutive % characters are collapsed into a single % character

       -s  The <b>-s</b> (<u>shell</u>) option runs the shell specified by the <u>SHELL</u> environment variable if it is set or
           the shell as specified in <a href="../man5/passwd.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/passwd">passwd(5)</a>.

       -u  The <b>-u</b> (<u>user</u>) option causes <b>sudo</b> to run the specified command as a user other than <u>root</u>.  To
           specify a <u>uid</u> instead of a <u>username</u>, use <u>#uid</u>.  Note that if the <u>targetpw</u> Defaults option is set
           (see <a href="../man5/sudoers.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/sudoers">sudoers(5)</a>) it is not possible to run commands with a uid not listed in the password data-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">base.&nbsp;database.</font>
           base.

       -v  If given the <b>-v</b> (<u>validate</u>) option, <b>sudo</b> will update the user's timestamp, prompting for the
           user's password if necessary.  This extends the <b>sudo</b> timeout for another 5 minutes (or whatever
           the timeout is set to in <u>sudoers</u>) but does not run a command.

       --  The <b>--</b> flag indicates that <b>sudo</b> should stop processing command line arguments.  It is most useful
           in conjunction with the <b>-s</b> flag.

<b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b>
       Upon successful execution of a program, the return value from <b>sudo</b> will simply be the return value of
       the program that was executed.

       Otherwise, <b>sudo</b> quits with an exit value of 1 if there is a configuration/permission problem or if
       <b>sudo</b> cannot execute the given command.  In the latter case the error string is printed to stderr.  If
       <b>sudo</b> cannot <a href="../man2/stat.2.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/2/stat"><u>stat</u>(2)</a> one or more entries in the user's PATH an error is printed on stderr.  (If the
       directory does not exist or if it is not really a directory, the entry is ignored and no error is
       printed.)  This should not happen under normal circumstances.  The most common reason for <a href="../man2/stat.2.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/2/stat"><u>stat</u>(2)</a> to
       return "permission denied" is if you are running an automounter and one of the directories in your
       PATH is on a machine that is currently unreachable.

<b>SECURITY</b> <b>NOTES</b>
       <b>sudo</b> tries to be safe when executing external commands.  Variables that control how dynamic loading
       and binding is done can be used to subvert the program that <b>sudo</b> runs.  To combat this the LD_*,
       _RLD_*, SHLIB_PATH (HP-UX only), and LIBPATH (AIX only) environment variables are removed from the
       environment passed on to all commands executed.  <b>sudo</b> will also remove the IFS, CDPATH, ENV,
       BASH_ENV, KRB_CONF, KRBCONFDIR, KRBTKFILE, KRB5_CONFIG, LOCALDOMAIN, RES_OPTIONS, HOSTALIASES,
       NLSPATH, PATH_LOCALE, TERMINFO, TERMINFO_DIRS and TERMPATH variables as they too can pose a threat.
       If the TERMCAP variable is set and is a pathname, it too is ignored.  Additionally, if the LC_* or
       LANGUAGE variables contain the / or % characters, they are ignored.  Environment variables with a
       value beginning with () are also removed as they could be interpreted as <b>bash</b> functions.  If <b>sudo</b> has
       been compiled with SecurID support, the VAR_ACE, USR_ACE and DLC_ACE variables are cleared as well.
       The list of environment variables that <b>sudo</b> clears is contained in the output of sudo -V when run as
       root.

       To prevent command spoofing, <b>sudo</b> checks "." and "" (both denoting current directory) last when
       searching for a command in the user's PATH (if one or both are in the PATH).  Note, however, that the
       actual PATH environment variable is <u>not</u> modified and is passed unchanged to the program that <b>sudo</b>
       executes.

       For security reasons, if your OS supports shared libraries and does not disable user-defined library
       search paths for setuid programs (most do), you should either use a linker option that disables this
       behavior or link <b>sudo</b> statically.

       <b>sudo</b> will check the ownership of its timestamp directory (<u>/var/db/sudo</u> by default) and ignore the
       directory's contents if it is not owned by root and only writable by root.  On systems that allow
       non-root users to give away files via <a href="../man2/chown.2.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/2/chown"><u>chown</u>(2)</a>, if the timestamp directory is located in a directory
       writable by anyone (e.g.: <u>/tmp</u>), it is possible for a user to create the timestamp directory before
       <b>sudo</b> is run.  However, because <b>sudo</b> checks the ownership and mode of the directory and its contents,
       the only damage that can be done is to "hide" files by putting them in the timestamp dir.  This is
       unlikely to happen since once the timestamp dir is owned by root and inaccessible by any other user
       the user placing files there would be unable to get them back out.  To get around this issue you can
       use a directory that is not world-writable for the timestamps (<u>/var/adm/sudo</u> for instance) or create
       <u>/var/db/sudo</u> with the appropriate owner (root) and permissions (0700) in the system startup files.

       <b>sudo</b> will not honor timestamps set far in the future.  Timestamps with a date greater than cur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rent_time&nbsp;current_time</font>
       rent_time + 2 * TIMEOUT will be ignored and sudo will log and complain.  This is done to keep a user
       from creating his/her own timestamp with a bogus date on systems that allow users to give away files.

       Please note that <b>sudo</b> will only log the command it explicitly runs.  If a user runs a command such as
       sudo su or sudo sh, subsequent commands run from that shell will <u>not</u> be logged, nor will <b>sudo</b>'s
       access control affect them.  The same is true for commands that offer shell escapes (including most
       editors).  Because of this, care must be taken when giving users access to commands via <b>sudo</b> to ver-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ify&nbsp;verify</font>
       ify that the command does not inadvertently give the user an effective root shell.

<b>ENVIRONMENT</b>
       <b>sudo</b> utilizes the following environment variables:

        EDITOR                 Default editor to use in -e (sudoedit) mode if
                               VISUAL is not set

        HOME                   In -s or -H mode (or if sudo was configured with
                               the --enable-shell-sets-home option), set to
                               homedir of the target user

        PATH                   Set to a sane value if sudo was configured with
                               the --with-secure-path option

        SHELL                  Used to determine shell to run with -s option

        SUDO_PROMPT            Used as the default password prompt

        SUDO_COMMAND           Set to the command run by sudo

        SUDO_USER              Set to the login of the user who invoked sudo

        SUDO_UID               Set to the uid of the user who invoked sudo

        SUDO_GID               Set to the gid of the user who invoked sudo

        SUDO_PS1               If set, PS1 will be set to its value

        USER                   Set to the target user (root unless the -u option
                               is specified)

        VISUAL                 Default editor to use in -e (sudoedit) mode

<b>FILES</b>
        /private/etc/sudoers           List of who can run what
        /var/db/sudo              Directory containing timestamps

<b>EXAMPLES</b>
       Note: the following examples assume suitable <a href="../man5/sudoers.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/sudoers">sudoers(5)</a> entries.

       To get a file listing of an unreadable directory:

        $ sudo ls /usr/local/protected

       To list the home directory of user yazza on a machine where the file system holding ~yazza is not
       exported as root:

        $ sudo -u yazza ls ~yazza

       To edit the <u>index.html</u> file as user www:

        $ sudo -u www vi ~www/htdocs/index.html

       To shutdown a machine:

        $ sudo shutdown -r +15 "quick reboot"

       To make a usage listing of the directories in the /home partition.  Note that this runs the commands
       in a sub-shell to make the cd and file redirection work.

<b>AUTHORS</b>
       Many people have worked on <b>sudo</b> over the years; this version consists of code written primarily by:

               Todd Miller
               Chris Jepeway

       See the HISTORY file in the <b>sudo</b> distribution or visit <a href="http://www.sudo.ws/sudo/history.html">http://www.sudo.ws/sudo/history.html</a> for a
       short history of <b>sudo</b>.

<b>CAVEATS</b>
       There is no easy way to prevent a user from gaining a root shell if that user is allowed to run arbi-
       trary commands via <b>sudo</b>.  Also, many programs (such as editors) allow the user to run commands via
       shell escapes, thus avoiding <b>sudo</b>'s checks.  However, on most systems it is possible to prevent shell
       escapes with <b>sudo</b>'s <u>noexec</u> functionality.  See the <a href="../man5/sudoers.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/sudoers">sudoers(5)</a> manual for details.

       It is not meaningful to run the cd command directly via sudo, e.g.

        $ sudo cd /usr/local/protected

       since when whe command exits the parent process (your shell) will still be the same.  Please see the
       EXAMPLES section for more information.

       If users have sudo ALL there is nothing to prevent them from creating their own program that gives
       them a root shell regardless of any '!' elements in the user specification.

       Running shell scripts via <b>sudo</b> can expose the same kernel bugs that make setuid shell scripts unsafe
       on some operating systems (if your OS has a /dev/fd/ directory, setuid shell scripts are generally
       safe).
