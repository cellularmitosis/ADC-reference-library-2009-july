(Since the various controllers share much of the samebehavior, the rest of this Note uses the term <CITE>scroller</CITE>for movie controllers and horizontal and vertical scroll bars).</P><P>Developers often will want to add a custom scroller to theirtitle. Adding a custom scroller to an AMT 1.2 title is documented inAppendix A of the <CITE>Apple Media Tool Programming EnvironmentUser's Guide </CITE> .</P><P>For AMT 2.0 (and greater) titles, the instructions to add ascroller as described in Appendix A of the <CITE>Apple Media ToolProgramming Environment User's Guide </CITE> have changed (though allthe information describing scroller graphic images and scroller partsis still valid). For example, the 'KVSD', 'KHSD' and 'KHCD' resourcesare no longer created for each scroller. Because of the changes madeto AMT 2.0, there are new ways to add a scroller.
