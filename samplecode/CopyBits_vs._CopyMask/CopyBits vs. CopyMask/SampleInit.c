/*	File:		SampleInit.c	Contains:	Sample is an example application that demonstrates how to				initialize the commonly used toolbox managers, operate 				successfully under MultiFinder, handle desk accessories, 				and create, grow, and zoom windows.					It does not by any means demonstrate all the techniques 				you need for a large application. In particular, Sample 				does not cover exception handling, multiple windows/documents, 				sophisticated memory management, printing, or undo. All of 				these are vital parts of a normal full-sized application.					This application is an example of the form of a Macintosh 				application; it is NOT a template. It is NOT intended to be 				used as a foundation for the next world-class, best-selling, 				600K application. A stick figure drawing of the human body may 				be a good example of the form for a painting, but that does not 				mean it should be used as the basis for the next Mona Lisa.					We recommend that you review this program or TESample before 				beginning a new application.				SetPort strategy:   				Toolbox routines do not change the current port. In spite of this, in this  				program we use a strategy of calling SetPort whenever we want to draw or   				make calls which depend on the current port. This makes us less vulnerable   				to bugs in other software which might alter the current port (such as the   				bug (feature?) in many desk accessories which change the port on OpenDeskAcc).   				Hopefully, this also makes the routines from this program more self-contained,   				since they don't depend on the current port setting.	Written by: 		Copyright:	Copyright © 1989-1999 by Apple Computer, Inc., All Rights Reserved.				You may incorporate this Apple sample source code into your program(s) without				restriction.

This way, we can force the storage to be	in the lowest memory available in the heap.
