7/2003Updated for Project BuilderRead Me About...Direct Pixel Accessdate 08/2000This snippet shows one example of how to directly	change the pixel values stored in a pixel image.	The original pixel image is obtained from a 'icl8'	resource.  Only the first 20 columns of the first	20 rows of the 'icl8' image are used.Building the Code (Code Warrior)This project was built and tested on CodeWarrior 2.1 using CarbonLib 1.1a3.  Since this is a Carbon app, the "Carbon Support" folder of the CarbonSDK should be in the same folder as the CodeWarrior IDE.  If this is not the case, the CarbonLib library will have to be re-added to the project.  In addition, the CarbonLib extension needs to be in the extension folder.  The CarbonSDK (which contains the library and the extension) can be found on Apple's website:  http://developer.apple.com/sdk/Restrictions (Code Warrior)Nearly every sample requires more memory than the 384KB CodeWarrior sets as the default heap size.  If for some reason the memory has been reset to the default (either through converting the project or whatever) the memory should be reset to 1000 - 2000KB (depending on the application).  This can be achieved by going to the projects settings (Edit Menu->C-PPC Settings... under CodeWarrior 2.1) and selecting the "PPC Target" under the "Target" tab.Other Code NotesThis sample used to be a "non-Carbon" sample, but has been carbonized for demonstration purposes.  The "old" code has been left in (commented out) in order to compare and contrast the Carbon versus non-Carbon APIs.Known BugsNo known bugs.Possible Future EnhancementsNone at present.Other Sources of ReferenceAdditional sample code can be found at:http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/in addition, the Carbon API can be found at:http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/carbon/carbon.htmlVersion HistorySee source for version history.AuthorJM - Apple Developer Technical Support - dts@apple.com
