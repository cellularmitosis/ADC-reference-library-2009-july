OTDumpPortRegistry1.0b1This very simple sample dumps a text version of the OT port registry to stdout.  The compiled executable also makes a handy debugging tool.Implementation NotesThe code is very simply: it calls OTGetIndexedPort repeatedly and then prints the contents of each OTPortRecord in turn.  The ‘value add’ is:• it shows how to interpret each field of the OTPortRecord• the final output is useful for debugging things that register portsThe code was written with CodeWarrior 9 and tested on multiple machines running a variety of versions of Open Transport.CaveatsOne of the routines that the sample calls, OTGetUserPortNameFromPortRef, has no Mixed Mode glue.  Thus you have to run the 68K version on a 68K Mac and the PPC version on a PPC Mac, otherwise the sample just quits halfway through.Credits and Version HistoryIf you find any problems with this sample, mail <DevSupport@applelink.apple.com> with “Attn: Quinn” as the first line of your mail and I’ll try to fix them up.Version 1.0b1 is the first released version.Share and EnjoyQuinn “The Eskimo!”Apple Developer Technical SupportNetworking, Communications, Hardware27 Jan 1997
