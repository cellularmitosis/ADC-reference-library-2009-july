Mysolutions are either messy or dangerous: (1) Fiddle with the dialog's itemlist, (2) Try to find out which DITL the dialog used and read the count fromthe DITL resource, or (3) Repeatedly call GetDItem until garbage is returned.:-(</p><p>___</p><p>It's possible to use the CountDITL function with system software version 6.0.4or later if the Macintosh Communications Toolbox is installed, because it'sincluded as a part of the Toolbox. It's also possible, as you've found, to usethe first two bytes of the DITL resource to get the number of items in the itemlist (see <i>Inside Macintosh</i> Volume I, page 427). If the handle to yourDITL resource is defined as ditlHandl, for example, you can get at the numberof items as follows:</p><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=550><TR>	<td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><pre>short    **ditlHandl;ditlHandl = (short **)ditlRez;itemcount = (**ditlHandl) + 1;</pre>	</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><a name="Section2"></a><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><h2>Installer 3.2 and Macintosh Communications Toolbox</h2><p>Date Written:  8/29/91</p><p>Last reviewed:  9/24/91</p><p>How do we make the Macintosh Communications Toolbox (CTB) installation scriptwork with Installer 3.2 for users running System 6.x?</p><p>___</p><p>The current installer script for the CTB is not compatible with Installer 3.2,nor will it be in the near future. Installer 3.2 was designed to be compatiblewith System 7.0. Because the CTB is included with System 7.0, and Systems 6.0.5and 6.0.7 come with the installation disk necessary to install the CTB, there'sno need to update the script. There isn't really any Apple-approved way to makethe script Installer 3.2-compatible.</p><p>Your users who are still using System 6.0.7 (or earlier) need to install theCTB separately from your product. They should have the installation disksnecessary to install the CTB on their system. For System 6.0.5, they'll need touse the Installer and Install script on the Communications 1 disk to installthe CTB managers and other resources onto their hard disks. Users runningSystem 6.0.7 should use the Installer and Install script on the NetworkProducts Installer disk, which is part of the System 6.0.7 set users receivewith their Macintosh systems. The Network Products Installer disk does notcontain the CTB managers and other resources, but it prompts the user to insertthe Communications 1 disk during the installation procedure.</p><p>The Basic Connectivity Set and Communications 1 disks should be shipped withyour CTB-aware product. Contact Apple's Software Licensing group (<A HREF = "mailto:sw.license@apple.com">sw.license@apple.com</A>) for a licensing agreement to ship the disks. This will also help ensure that the users are using the version of the tool(s) that is most compatible with your product.</p><p>Remember to use Gestalt to make sure that you have the Communications ToolBoxavailable, and check to make sure that the tools you need are available as well.For specific information on using Gestalt, please refer to <i>InsideMacintosh</i> Volume VI and the Macintosh Technical Note <U><A HREF = "../ov/ov_16.html">"_Gestalt and_SysEnvirons-A Never Ending Story."</A></U></p><a name="Section3"></a><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><h2>Macintosh Communications ToolBox documentation</h2><p>Date Written:  8/26/91</p><p>Last reviewed:  9/17/91</p><p>Can you point me to documentation on the Macintosh Communications Toolbox?</p><p>___</p><p><i><a href="../../documentation/macos8/NetworkCommSvcs/CommToolboxUtilities/commtoolbox.html">Inside the Macintosh Communications Toolbox</A></i>is a nice, comprehensive manual, detailing how to writeprograms that use the Communications Toolbox.</p><a name="Section4"></a><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><h2>Macintosh CTB CRMSerialRecord documentation correction</h2><p>Date Written:  8/29/91</p><p>Last reviewed:  6/14/93</p><p>Are CRMSerialRecord's inputDriverName and outputDriverName fields of typeStringHandle or are they Pascal string pointers?</p><p>___</p><p>As shown on page 183 of <i>Inside the Macintosh Communications Toolbox,</i> theCRMSerialRecord data structure contains two fields, inputDriverName andoutputDriverName, declared as type StringHandle.

The CTB and Tools do a somewhat imperfect job of looking in thecorrect resource map for string components used in CMGetConfig; theapplication-defined 'STR ' IDs override the correct Tool defined IDs. CMChoosehas a similar problem with 'CNTL' resource conflicts.</p><p>This problem is not confined to SIOW; it can happen for any application. In thecase of SIOW, it is particularly frustrating since SIOW is a precompiledlibrary and you can't simply change resource IDs to ones that don't conflict.Also, you cannot be certain that you won't ever conflict in this manner for anyarbitrary Tool and application.</p><p>There is a workaround to this situation which should be used for allapplications, not just SIOW-based apps. The CTB makes sure that resource mapsfor Tools are searched after the system resource map--that is, instead of theresource chain looking like this:</p> <P>ROM (resource lookup progresses from the bottom up)</p>  <p>System</p>  <p>Application</p>   <p>Document</p>   <p>Tool</p><p>it looks like this:</p>  <p>ROM</p>  <p>Tool</p>  <p>System</p>  <p>Application</p>  <p>Document.</p><p>The workaround is to save the current resource file reference, set the currentresource file to the System file, and return to the proper resource file aftercompleting CMGetConfig or CMChoose.

What effect do multiple INIT calls have on CommunicationsTools operations and any existing connections? What do these calls do, and when(and how many times) is it safe to call them?</p><p>__</p><p>All these initialization calls deal with the process of loading the 'cmtb'resource into the system heap, putting entries into the Communications Toolbox(CTB) dispatch table with references to the current heap zone, and setting upvarious things having to do with resource management for the operation of theCTB. You can call them over and over again without damaging existinginformation.</p><p>With the perspective provided by that information, you can see that a synergyexists between operations of the CTB and the Resource Manager. The CTB needs tobe in the appropriate heap zone when a ConnHandle is generated or referencedfor it to operate as desired. If you're writing a background process thatmaintains its own persistent heap zone, you shouldn't have any difficultiesusing the CTB.</p><p>If you're writing an INIT, matters are more complex. You mustSetZone(SystemZone) while performing all CTB operations (includinginitialization, CMGetProcID, and CMNew) to be sure the heap zone will persistafter the INIT has completed. Possibly the reason for doing this at INIT timeis to create ConnHandles that will persist for CTB access at a later time. Itseems reasonable that ConnHandles thus created require a SetZone(SystemZone) byany routine that needs to access them for Read/Write/Status/Deleteoperations.</p><a name="Section13"></a><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><h2>Macintosh Communications ToolBox (CTB) initialization</h2><p>Date Written:  9/24/91</p><p>Last reviewed:  9/24/91</p><p>What happens if I accidently initialize the Macintosh Communications ToolBox(CTB) twice?

The installation procedure for CTB tools is different between System 6and System 7. Under System 6 the CTB tools are dragged from the Basic Connectivity Set disk to the Communications Folder in the System Folder on the hard disk. Under System 7 the CTB tools are dragged from the Basic Connectivity Set disk to the Extensions folder in the System Folder on the hard disk. Of course, because of the way System 7 works, CTB tools can simply be dragged to the System Folder and the Finder will automatically move them to the Extensions folder where they belong.</p><p>No installation of the CTB managers is required under System 7, since System 7includes the Communications Toolbox as part of the system. Users running System6.0.5 should use the Installer and Install script on the Communications 1 diskto install the CTB managers and other resources onto their hard disks. Usersrunning System 6.0.7 should use the Installer and Install script on the NetworkProducts Installer disk, which is part of the System 6.0.7 set users receivewith their Macintosh systems. The Network Products Installer disk does notcontain the CTB managers and other resources, but it prompts the user to insertthe Communications 1 disk during the installation procedure.</p><p>The Basic Connectivity Set and Communications 1 disks should be shipped withyour CTB-aware product. Contact Apple's Software Licensing group (AppleLinkSW.LICENSE) for a licensing agreement to ship the disks.</p><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P>         <a name="downloads"></a>         <H2>Downloadables</H2>                  <TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <td width=50 align=left>                  <P ALIGN=center>                                    <img src="images/acrobatsmall.gif" width=22 height=23 align=middle alt="Acrobat gif"></P>               </TD>               <td align="left">                  <P>Acrobat version of this Note (76K)</P>               </TD>               <td width=60 align=left>                  <P><A HREF="pdf/cm_505.pdf">Download</A></P>               </TD>            </TR>         </TABLE>         <BR>                  <P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><!-- end_content --><!-- begin_footer_information -->	<table width="680" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
