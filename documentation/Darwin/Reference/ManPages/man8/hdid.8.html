<b>NAME</b>
       hdid - HDI driver backing store service

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>hdid</b> [ <u>options</u> ] <u>image</u>

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       Historically,  <b>hdid</b>  has  been  the user-level process handling the loading and decompression of disk
       image data for the hard disk image (HDI) driver in the Mac OS X kernel.  With Mac OS X  version  10.2
       and later, certain read/write images and 10.2+-generated zlib-compressed (UDZO) images attach in-ker-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nel&nbsp;in-kernel</font>
       nel without a persistent user process.

       With Mac OS X version 10.3, <b>hdid</b> calls the DiskImages.framework and its helpers take care of any out-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">of-kernel&nbsp;outof-kernel</font>
       of-kernel  image  serving  duties.   As of Mac OS X 10.4, <b>hdid</b> calls through to <b>hdiutil</b> <b>attach</b>.  <b>hdid</b>
       exists primarily for backwards compatibility.  Generally, <b>hdiutil</b> <b>attach</b> should be  used  instead  of
       hdid.  This man page continues to document certain DiskImages features that are not tool-specific.

       The  DiskImages  framework  supports  a  variety  of flat-file and dual-fork image formats, including
       read/write, read-only, and read-only compressed formats (which it decompresses on the fly).  It auto-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">matically&nbsp;automatically</font>
       matically  decodes  AppleSingle  and  MacBinary  file  formats and is capable of mounting most images
       directly from <a href="http://">http://</a> URLs.

       <b>hdiutil</b> <b>detach</b> or <b>diskutil</b> <b>eject</b> should be used to detach (aka "eject") images attached to the system
       via <b>hdid</b>.

       Beware  that  an  image you have created and attached is considered an unknown removable device.  For
       HFS filesystems on such a device, being unknown to the system means that  the  on-disk  ownership  of
       files  and  directories  are  initially ignored.  On 10.2, the owner values were dynamically replaced
       with the owner of /dev/console and the group unknown (gid 99).  On 10.3, the group  remains  unknown,
       but  the  owner is whoever is currently accessing the file (joe sees that he owns files when he looks
       at the volume; mary sees that she owns files when she looks).  Owners can be enabled for a particular
       volume  permanently  (see  disktool/"get info" in the Finder) or temporarily (see EXAMPLES section of
       <a href="../man1/hdiutil.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/hdiutil"><b>hdiutil</b>(1)</a>).  Aside from whether owners are enabled, being removable means that disk arbitration will
       mount any volumes with special options such as nosuid.

       The error "no mountable filesystems" generally means that there is no filesystem in the image or that
       any filesystem is corrupt.  Unfortunately, read-only device images made from mounted  journaled  vol-
       umes  will  not  mount  because the journal can't be replayed.  It should be noted, however, that the
       error was common on older systems when remotely logged in to a machine with no one logged in on  con-
       sole.   Disk arbitration wouldn't mount removable media until the SystemUIServer process was running.
       On 10.2 systems, 'disktool -c `id -u`' would allow image-based volumes to mount in  such  situations.
       With  10.3, volumes automatically mount on non-managed systems regardless of whether anyone is logged
       in on console.  Image-based filesystems can also be manually mounted after attaching the  image  with
       <b>-nomount</b>.

       Please  see  the section below on setting up HTTP image servers if you plan to regularly mount images
       from web servers or are wondering why a particular image isn't mounting over HTTP.

<b>ARGUMENTS</b>
       <b>-help</b>  show available options

       <b>-shadow</b> [ <b>&lt;shadowfile&gt;</b> ]
              Use a shadow file in conjunction with the data in the image.  This  prevents  modification  of
              the  original  image  and  allows read-only images to be attached read/write.  When blocks are
              being read from the image, blocks present in the shadow  file  override  blocks  in  the  base
              image.   When  blocks are being written, the writes will be redirected to the shadow file.  If
              not specified, -shadow defaults to &lt;imagename&gt;.shadow.  If the shadow file does not exist,  it
              is created.

       <b>-readonly</b>
              Attach the image read only.  Has no effect on read-only images.

       <b>-readwrite</b>
              Attach the image read/write.  Has no effect on read-only (or compressed) images.  Used in some
              cases where a read/write image might default to being attached read-only.

       <b>-nomount</b>
              Suppress automatic mounting of any filesystems in the image.  This will result in /dev entries
              being created and (for non-kernel-attached images) a process in the background, but no volumes
              will be mounted.

       <b>-notremovable</b>
              Make the image appear to the system as a fixed disk.  A reboot will  be  required  to  cleanly
              detach  the  image,  though  filesystems can be unmounted and remounted.  This option requires
              root access, e.g. via <a href="sudo.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/sudo">sudo(8)</a>.

       <b>-encryption</b>  <b>[</b>  <b>&lt;crypto</b> <b>method&gt;</b>  <b>]</b>
              This option specifies a particular encrypted encoding.  The default  CEncryptedEncoding  auto-
              matically  recognizes  its images so this option should rarely be needed.  Be careful what you
              are asking for if the argument to <b>-encryption</b> comes directly before the image name on the com-
              mand line.

       <b>-stdinpass</b>
              causes  <b>hdid</b> to read a null-terminated passphrase from its standard input.  ^@ (control-@) can
              be typed to explicitly insert the terminator.  This option is designed for automation in which
              standard  input  would be attached to a file or pipe.  <b>-passphrase</b> <b>&lt;passphrase&gt;</b> This option is
              provided for automation purposes but is very insecure as the passphrase value will be  visible
              in the output of <a href="../man1/ps.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ps">ps(1)</a> (and thus to other users).  <b>-passphrase</b> has been deprecated.

       <b>-imagekey</b> <b>&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Specify  a  key/value pair for the disk image recognition and creation system.  See <a href="../man1/hdiutil.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/hdiutil">hdiutil(1)</a>
              for more information.

       <b>-drivekey</b> <b>&lt;keyname&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Specify a key/value pair for the IOHDIXHDDrive object created (shows up in the IOKit  registry
              of devices which is viewable with <a href="ioreg.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/ioreg">ioreg(8)</a>).

       <b>-section</b> <u>subspec</u>
              Attach   a  subset  of  the  disk  image.   <u>subspec</u>  is  any  of  &lt;offset&gt;,  &lt;first-last&gt;,  or
              &lt;start,count&gt;.  All sector numbers are zero-based and ranges are inclusive.

       <b>-kernel</b>
              hand the image directly to the IOHDIXController module in the kernel even if this image  would
              not normally be sent "in-kernel."  If the image cannot be attached, no attempt will be made to
              attach it with a user process.

       <b>-nokernel</b>
              attach the image with a persistent process instead of attaching in-kernel, even if the default
              for  this  type of image is to attach in-kernel.  Use <a href="../man1/hdiutil.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/hdiutil">hdiutil(1)</a>'s imageinfo verb to determine
              if an image will default to mounting in-kernel.

       <b>-plist</b> output a plist describing the image and system entities (dev entries, mount points, etc)  that
              were created as a result of attaching the given image.

       <b>-verbose</b>
              verbose output when attaching an image

       <b>-debug</b> diagnostic output when attaching an image

       <b>-quiet</b> Don't print out resulting /dev entries and filesystems.  Also do not print any errors.  <b>hdid</b>'s
              exit status will indicate whether the attach was successful.

<b>EXAMPLES</b>
              $ hdid funstuff.img

       Present funstuff.img as a device so that its filesystems can be mounted.

              $ hdid master.dmg -shadow

       Present master.dmg to the filesystems for potential mounting, redirecting all write operations to the
       shadow file master.dmg.shadow.

              $ hdid <a href="http://my.webserver.com/master.img">http://my.webserver.com/master.img</a> -shadow /tmp/mastershadowfile

       Present master.img to the filesystems for potential mounting, redirecting all write operations to the
       shadow file mastershadowfile in /tmp.  The shadow file can be on any mounted read/write filesystem --
       keep in mind the consequences of using a remote filesystems (NFS, AFP) for such shadow files.

              hdid -nomount ram://&lt;sectors&gt;

       will  attach  a  ram  disk that can be mounted and used after being formatted with a newfs utility or
       Disk Utility.app.  A sector is 512 bytes.

       A small shell script to create and mount a ram disk:

              #!/bin/sh

              NUMSECTORS=128000
              mydev=`hdid -nomount ram://$NUMSECTORS`
              newfs_hfs $mydev
              mkdir /tmp/mymount
              mount -t hfs $mydev /tmp/mymount

<b>OUTPUT</b>
       Unless <b>-plist</b> is specified, <b>hdid</b> returns one line of output per /dev entry created.  Each  line  con-
       tains  up to three tab-delimited columns.  The first column always contains the full path to the /dev
       entry created.  The second column will contain the partition type if the image contained a  partition
       map.  The third column will contain the mountpoint if the particular /dev entry was mounted.

       If  <b>hdid</b>  is  asked  to attach an image that is already attached, it will attempt to return the usual
       information for the attached image, as if it had just been attached.  However, if there are unmounted
       partitions on the attached image, they will not be remounted.

<b>Mounting</b> <b>Images</b> <b>via</b> <b>HTTP</b>
       In  addition  to  mounting images from local or remote mounted filesystems, one can also mount images
       from HTTP servers without downloading the entire image.  For flat images (UDIF images,  or  AppleSin-
       gle/MacBinary  encoded  NDIF image files) mounting an image is a matter of passing the <a href="http://">http://</a> URL to
       hdid:

              hdid <a href="http://server.company.com/Images/stuff.dmg">http://server.company.com/Images/stuff.dmg</a>

       It should be noted that some web servers (Apache in particular) do not  support  byte-range  requests
       beyond  2  (Apache 1.x) or 4 GB (Apache 2.x) and thus image files larger than those sizes will not be
       accessible over HTTP.  Read/write images may attach, but will not  be  fully  accessible.   Segmented
       images  do work correctly over HTTP (assuming they are named properly) and can be used to work around
       the file size limitation.

       Browsing images via HTTP is much more pleasant if  the  server  settings  are  modified  to  be  more
       friendly  to  highly-persistent  clients.   In  particular for Apache, MaxKeepAliveRequests should be
       increased significantly beyond 100 or set to 0 (unlimited) and KeepAliveTimeout should be boosted  to
       at  least  30 (seconds).  Increasing the number of simultaneous clients may also be desirable because
       of the increased delay before clients are forcibly disconnected.

       If the image to be served via HTTP is a dual fork NDIF image that is not  encoded  into  a  flat-file
       format  such  as  AppleSingle  and  the  HTTP  server  is running on Mac OS X, dual fork files may be
       detected and supported.  Such dual-fork files must be moved or copied using the Finder, or some other
       resource-fork-aware  tool.  Properly copied dual-fork files on a UFS volume have a ._filename file in
       addition to the filename you see in the Finder (i.e. stuff.img would also  have  ._stuff.img  in  the
       same directory).

       In  either  case,  one would specify the URL to the data fork, and DiskImages will determine if it is
       necessary to access the secondary file.

       Accessing dual fork images on HFS+ filesystems via HTTP is only supported if the HTTP server is on  a
       Mac  OS  X  system.   It  is possible that the web server's configuration could prevent access to the
       resource fork.  For example, Mac OS X 10.3 security updates have disabled access to the /..namedfork/
       paths  necessary  to access resource forks on HFS.  Thus it may be necessary to tweak web server set-
       tings to successfully serve dual-fork images.

       While it is not directly related to mounting via <!-- a -->hdid(1)<!-- /a -->, informing your web server that '.dmg'  (and
       others) are extensions associated with the MIME type <u>application/octet-stream</u> will allow web browsers
       to download the files rather than try to display them.  For apache, you add  the  extensions  to  the
       appropriate line in <u>/etc/httpd/mime.types</u>.
