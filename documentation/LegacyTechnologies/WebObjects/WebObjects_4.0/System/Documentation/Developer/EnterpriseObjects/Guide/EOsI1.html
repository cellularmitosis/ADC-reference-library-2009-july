<h1> Designing Your Schema</h1>
</a><a name="879">
If you're working with an existing database, its schema will dictate many of the decisions you make in designing your enterprise objects. If you're designing your database at the same time as your enterprise objects, however, you can let each design influence the other as they're developed and before you implement them. Be sure to keep both designs in mind as you work; decisions you make about the database design can affect your enterprise object design, and vice versa. This chapter doesn't address issues of database design itself, but the information presented here can help you to create a design that will work effectively with the Enterprise Objects Framework.<p>
