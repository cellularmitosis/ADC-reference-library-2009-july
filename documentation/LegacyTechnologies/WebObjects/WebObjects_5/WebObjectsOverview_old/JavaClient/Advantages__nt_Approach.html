<p><font face="Times">Java Client applications have much in common with traditional
desktop applications. They also have much in common with HTML-based
Web applications. Correspondingly, Java Client applications have
some of the best features from each:</font></p>
<ul><p><li><b>Client-side
processing</b>. Web applications do the majority of their
processing on the server, while Java Client moves much of an application's
processing to the client. This reduces the amount of client-server
communication considerably, making Java Client applications much
snappier than their Web counterparts.</li></p>
<p><li><b>Rich user interfaces</b>. Like a desktop
application, a Java Client application can draw upon user-interface
frameworks that provide endless possibilities for user interface widgets.
Additionally, a Java Client application can have multiple windows
open at once. HTML applications have a more rigid workflow, allowing
only one page of the user interface to be available at a time.</li></p>
<p><li><b>Portability</b>. Like any Web application,
a Java Client application is portable. A Web application can run
on any client browser that implements certain standards and protocols.
Because a Java Client application is written in Pure Java, it too
runs almost anywhere. The client need only have a compatible Java
virtual machine (VM), something that major operating systems include
as a standard feature.</li></p>
<p><li><b>Security</b>. Because sensitive data and
business logic are confined to the server in Web applications, they
are more secure than traditional client-server applications.</li></p></ul>
