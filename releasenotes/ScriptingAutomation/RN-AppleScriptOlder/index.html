				<h3>Special Notes</h3>
				<ul class="spaceabove">
					<li class="li">
						<p>Scripts that compare AppleScript version numbers using string comparisons will need to be changed in order to work correctly with the new AppleScript version number. A <code>considering numeric strings</code> statement must be added before the string comparison so that the string 1.10 will be greater than the string 1.9.3.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>Scripts that compare version numbers by coercing the version class to a real number and then doing numeric comparisons will need to be changed. The coercion from <code>version</code> to <code>real</code> has been changed to allow the second and third parts of the version number to be 0..15 instead of 0..9. As a result, the version 1.2.3 will now coerce to the real number 1.0203. Previously, it would coerce to the real number 1.23.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>Scripts that compare AppleScript version numbers, and which need to run on AppleScript 1.10 as well as earlier versions of AppleScript, should do numeric comparisons using the Gestalt version number. The Gestalt version number can be obtained using the <code>system attribute "ascv"</code> command.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>String concatenation now uses the richer of the two operands. If either operand is Unicode, the result will be Unicode.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>The <code>path to me</code> command now returns the correct result for compiled scripts, including those that are run using the <code>run script</code> command.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>Beginning in Mac OS X version 10.4, the <code>mount volume</code> command can no longer mount Mac OS 9 server volumes if the server is specified using the AppleTalk server name. The TCP server name or IP address must be used instead.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>Do not use <code>sudo(8)</code> with the <code>administrator privileges</code> parameter of the <code>do shell script</code> command. Due to a bug, if <code>sudo</code> thinks it needs a password, it will prompt for it on a non-existent terminal and wait forever for a response, causing the script to hang. This may break existing scripts.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>The <code>do shell script</code> command now runs the shell script as seteuid-root, not actually root. This creates certain differences; for instance, perl will refuse to accept <code>-e</code> options when seteuid-root.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>The error codes returned by the <code>do shell script</code> command have changed.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>If the <code>with icon</code> parameter to the <code>display dialog</code> command specifies an icon that doesn't exist, an error is now reported. Previously, the error was ignored.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>The return value from the <code>list disks</code> command is now a list of Unicode strings. Previously, it was a list of plain strings.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>Getting the <code>count</code> of the <code>paragraphs</code> or <code>text items</code> of an empty Unicode string now returns 1 instead of 0.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>Strings that contain only a plus or minus sign, can no longer be coerced to a number.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>The implicitly encoded text types, <code>typeText</code>, <code>typeCString</code>, and <code>typePString</code>, are all deprecated as of AppleScript 1.9.2, since they are incapable of representing international characters and may be reinterpreted in unpredictable ways. Additionally, <code>typeCString</code> and <code>typePString</code> do not support the full range of text coercions, and will be removed entirely in a future release. <code>typeStyledText</code> and <code>typeIntlText</code>, while they have explicit encodings, are not recommended, since they are incapable of representing Unicode-only characters like Hungarian, Arabic, or Thai. The recommended text type is <code>typeUnicodeText</code>.</p>

						<p>A new Open Scripting Architecture (OSA) API has been added that lets you get the scripting dictionary of an application as an sdef (see ASDebugging.h and <code>sdef(5)</code>). If the target application does not have a true sdef but does have an <code>'aete'</code> or Cocoa-generated dictionary, it will translate that, so the API will work on any scriptable application.

			<h2>Mac OS X v10.3 - AppleScript 1.9.2</h2>
			<p>AppleScript 1.9.2 is included with Mac OS X version 10.3 and requires Mac OS X version 10.3 or later. It contains many new features and enhancements, and corrects problems found with AppleScript 1.9.1 and earlier versions.</p>
			<p>AppleScript 1.9.2 can use scripts developed for any version of AppleScript from 1.1 through 1.9.1, any scripting addition created for AppleScript 1.5 or later for Mac OS X, and any scriptable application for Mac OS 7.1 or later.</p>
			<p>A script created with AppleScript 1.9.2 can be used by any version of AppleScript back to version 1.1, provided it does not use features of AppleScript, scripting additions, or scriptable applications that are unavailable in that version.</p>

				<h3>Special Notes</h3>
				<ul class="spaceabove">
					<li class="li">
						<p>The implicitly encoded text types, <code>typeText</code>, <code>typeCString</code>, and <code>typePString</code>, are all deprecated as of AppleScript 1.9.2, since they are incapable of representing international characters and may be reinterpreted in unpredictable ways. Additionally, <code>typeCString</code> and <code>typePString</code> do not support the full range of text coercions, and will be removed entirely in a future release. <code>typeStyledText</code> and <code>typeIntlText</code>, while they have explicit encodings, are not recommended, since they are incapable of representing Unicode-only characters like Hungarian, Arabic, or Thai. The recommended text type is <code>typeUnicodeText</code>.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>The <code>offset</code> command now ignores case by default and honors <code>considering</code> and <code>ignoring</code> statements with regards to <code>case</code> and <code>diacriticals</code>. See the offset section below for more information.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>Resource-fork script files can no longer be created using <code>store script</code>. See the store script section below for more information.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>The <code>path to me</code> command will return a path that ends with a colon when used within a script application that has been saved in the new bundled format.</p>

				<h3>Developer Notes</h3>
				<ul class="spaceabove">
					<li class="li">
						<p>Four new functions have been added to the Open Scripting Architecture (OSA) API in Mac OS X version 10.3. The new functions enable applications to load, execute, and store scripts using any of the old (data/resource fork based) or new (bundled) script formats. The new functions are <code>OSALoadFile()</code>, <code>OSALoadExecuteFile()</code>, <code>OSAStoreFile()</code>, and <code>OSADoScriptFile()</code>. For details, see the Open Scripting Architecture Reference.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>AppleScript now sends the subject parameter in some cases where it previously failed to. This allows applications to make the <code>at</code> parameter for <code>make new</code> optional. [3039070]</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>System terminology is now read into memory only when needed for compilation or decompilation. This reduces the memory cost for applications that simply run compiled scripts. [3142099]</p>

					<h4>AppleScript</h4>
					<ul class="spaceabove">
						<li class="li">
							<p>AppleScript 1.9.2 supports a new bundled format for compiled scripts and script applications (applets) that uses standard Mac OS X bundles. Compiled script bundles have the filename extension <code>.scptd</code>, while applet bundles have the filename extension <code>.app</code>. [3150267] [3150248]</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>Scripting additions can be embedded within bundled applets by placing them in a folder named <code>Scripting Additions</code> inside the bundles <code>Contents/Resources/</code> folder. Note that Script Editor does not look for embedded scripting additions when editing bundled applets. Any required scripting additions must be properly installed in the normal locations during script development so that Script Editor can find them. [3314117]</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>AppleScript applets now handle incoming events in a first-in, first-out manner. Prior to AppleScript 1.9.2, applets handled incoming events in a last-in, first-out manner. [2553648]</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>The Idle handler return value can now be a real number. [3199911]</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>Real numbers can now be coerced to integers even if they have a non-zero fractional part. Rounding is used to do the coercion. [2849518]</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>The <code>month</code> constants can now be coerced to numbers. [2396328]</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>The <code>date</code> class now has a <code>short date string</code> property. The format of the short date string is specified by the International preference pane. [2396328]</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>Two new types were added: <code>JPEG picture</code> and <code>GIF picture</code>. [3251772]</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>The <code>zone</code> class has been removed since EPPC over AppleTalk is not supported in Mac OS X. [2967694]</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>When a non-URL <code>machine</code> name is specified, it is now assumed to be a Rendezvous name instead of an AppleTalk name. [3113390]</p>

						<li class="li">
							<p>The <code>choose application</code> dialog box now remembers its size and position. [3141005]</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>A <code>choose color</code> command has been added which displays the standard color picker dialog box and returns the selected color as a list of the RGB values. The <code>default color</code> parameter specifies the initial color. By default, the initial color is black. [3160380]</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>The <code>choose file</code>, <code>choose file name</code>, and <code>choose folder</code> commands now have a <code>default location</code> parameter that specifies which directory should be displayed in the dialog box. [3143207]</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>The <code>choose file</code> and <code>choose folder</code> commands now have an <code>invisibles</code> parameter that specifies whether invisible files and folders should be displayed. The default is true for <code>choose file</code> and false for <code>choose folder</code>. [2690829]</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>The <code>choose file</code> and <code>choose folder</code> commands now have a <code>multiple selections allowed</code> parameter that specifies whether multiple items can be selected. The default is false. [3254466]</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>The <code>choose file</code> and <code>choose folder</code> commands now support Unicode and styled text prompts. [2836896] [3318664]</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>The <code>choose file</code> and <code>choose folder</code> dialog boxes no longer use a default prompt. The dialog box will only contain a prompt if one has been specified using the <code>with prompt</code> parameter. [2519050]</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>The <code>choose file name</code> dialog box now has a new title and default prompt. [2519050]</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>The <code>delay</code> command now accepts real numbers. [2812515]</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>The <code>display dialog</code> command now supports Unicode and can now display more than 255 characters. [3077453]</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>The <code>do shell script</code> command now has an <code>as</code> parameter that specifies the desired type of the result. The default is to return the result as UTF-8 if possible. If the <code>as</code> parameter is not specified and the result is not valid UTF-8, the result will be returned as <code>typeText</code>. [3080630] [3157877]</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>Two new properties were added to the <code>file information</code> class. The <code>kind</code> property returns the items kind string. The <code>bundle identifier</code> property returns the items bundle identifier, if the item is a package. [2884166] [3274781]</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>The <code>info for</code> command now returns the <code>short version</code> and <code>long version</code> for packages. [2913766]</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>The <code>load script</code> command now supports the new bundled format for compiled scripts and applets. [3177719]</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>The <code>offset</code> command now ignores case by default and honors <code>considering</code> and <code>ignoring</code> statements with regards to <code>case</code> and <code>diacriticals</code>. As a result of these changes, the offset command now behaves the same as other AppleScript string comparisons with regards to case and diacriticals. In AppleScript 1.9.1 and earlier, the offset command always considers case and does not honor considering and ignoring statements. Scripts that are expecting <code>offset</code> to always consider case will need to add a <code>considering case</code> statement to maintain the previous behavior. [1068386]</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>The <code>path to</code> command now has a <code>folder creation</code> parameter that specifies whether the folder should be created if it does'’t exist. The default is to create the folder if possible. If <code>without folder creation</code> is specified, an error will be returned if the folder doesn’t exist. [3315615]</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>The <code>path to</code> command now has the following new folder constants: applications folder, documents folder, favorites folder, home folder, library folder, movies folder, music folder, pictures folder, public folder, shared documents, shared documents folder, sites folder, utilities folder. [2650692]</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>The <code>path to</code> command now has a <code>Classic domain</code> constant that can be used with the <code>from</code> parameter. [2836501]</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>The <code>run script</code> command now supports the new bundled format for compiled scripts and applets. [3177719]</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>The <code>shutdown</code> folder constant has been renamed <code>shutdown folder</code> to prevent confusion with the <code>shut down</code> Finder command. [2748241]</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>The <code>store script</code> command can now store into any format script file including the new bundled format script files. In addition, <code>store script</code> can now create a new script file in bundled format (compiled script or applet) or data-fork format (compiled script only). When creating a new script file, the filename extension determines which format is created. Resource-fork script files can no longer be created using <code>store script</code> but existing ones can be updated. When storing a script into an existing file, the file must be a script file; previously, the file could contain anything and an <code>'scpt'</code> resource was simply added to the file. [3177719]</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>The <code>store script</code> dialog box is now resizable and moveable. [3148202]</p>

							<p>The <code>osacompile</code> tool now supports the new bundled format for compiled scripts and applets. If the <code>-o</code> option is specified and the file does not already exist, <code>osacompile</code> uses the filename extension to determine what type of file to create. If the filename ends with <code>.app</code>, a bundled applet will be created. If the filename ends with <code>.scpt</code>, a bundled compiled script will be created. Otherwise, the resulting script will be placed in the resource fork and/or data fork of the output file depending upon what other options are specified. [3150246]</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>The <code>osacompile</code> tool now has a <code>-s</code> (stay open) option. This option is only valid when a new bundled applet is being created. The option specifies that the applet should stay open after running. [3231791]</p>

						<p>Object references of the form &lt;class> &lt;string> have historically been sent to applications as by name object specifiers. In AppleScript 1.5 through 1.8.3, if the &lt;string> was <code>typeUnicodeText</code> the object specifier would be sent as <code>formAbsolutePosition</code>. In AppleScript 1.9 and later, object references using Unicode strings are always sent to applications using <code>formName</code>.

						<p>Developers can now define application scriptability using an XML description, rather than old-style <code>'aete'</code> resources or Cocoa <code>.scriptSuite</code> and <code>.scriptTerminology</code> plist files.

A new developer tool, <code>/Developer/Tools/sdp</code>, converts XML files with the <code>.sdef</code> extension into either <code>.r</code> files (for Carbon applications) or <code>.scriptSuite</code> and <code>.scriptTerminology</code> files (for Cocoa). In the future, AppleScript will read <code>.sdef</code> files directly, making this conversion unnecessary. See the man pages for <code>sdp</code> and <code>sdef</code> for more information. Some sample <code>.sdef</code> files are supplied in <code>/Developer/Examples/Scripting Definitions</code>. [2912639] [2913622]</p>

							<p>The Script menu menu extra that has been available for download from the AppleScript web page is now included with Mac OS X. To activate the Script menu, open the <code>AppleScript</code> folder (in the <code>Applications</code> folder of your startup disk) and double-click on the <code>ScriptMenu.menu</code> folder. The Script menu will appear on the right side of the menu bar in all applications.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>Like Script Runner in previous versions of Mac OS X, the Script menu lets you execute any script while using any application. It lists all files that are present in the <code>Scripts</code> folder of the <code>Library</code> folder of both your startup disk and your Home directory. Unlike Script Runner, the Script menu will execute both OSA scripts (saved by Script Editor) and UNIX scripts (shell scripts, perl scripts, etc.).</p>

					<h4>Folder Actions</h4>
					<ul class="spaceabove">
						<li class="li">
							<p>Folder Actions are now supported in Mac OS X. Folder Actions let you attach a script to a folder, and when that folder is opened or closed in the Finder or files are changed in it, a handler in that script will be executed.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>In Mac OS X, Folder Actions are handled by the System Events application, not a separate Folder Actions extension. A property in the System Events application turns Folder Actions on and off; when theyre on, System Events is added to your Login Items list and starts up when you log in. Folder Actions will not be performed if the System Events application quits.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>Actions are attached and removed from folders by sending commands to System Events. The same events that work with the Folder Actions extension on Mac OS 9 will work the same with the System Events application in Mac OS X; in addition, System Events supports an object model for managing actions on a folder. See the System Events dictionary for the complete set of Folder Actions events and classes.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>The action events that are sent to action scripts are the same as in Mac OS 9. Terminology for these events can be found in the Standard Additions scripting addition.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>There are some functional differences between Folder Actions in Mac OS X from the Mac OS 9 version. In Mac OS X, actions are assigned to folders on a per-user basis, so different users of the same machine can have different sets of actions. That means that actions attached to removable or shared disks will not take effect unless that action has been assigned on your specific user account. This is a security precaution. This also means that actions attached to folders in Mac OS 9 will not take effect in Mac OS X unless they’ve been specifically attached for a particular user account in X.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>Folder badging works differently in Mac OS X than in Mac OS 9. When an action is assigned to a folder, no badge appears in Mac OS X; folders that have had actions attached in Mac OS 9 will have the Folder Action badge, but wont execute their actions unless they’ve been assigned to that user.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>The contextual menu that assigns, removes, and edits Folder Actions in Mac OS 9 is not present in this version of Mac OS X. Example scripts to assign and remove Folder Actions are supplied in the <code>/Library/Scripts/Folder Actions</code> directory, and can be used directly from the Script menu.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>Because of changes in the Finder, many Folder Action scripts from Mac OS 9 do not work in Mac OS X. [2865598]</p>

The UNIX shell interprets certain characters specially (including single-quote, double-quote, dollar sign, slash, and backslash).

The property <code>quoted form</code> has been added to the <code>string</code> and <code>Unicode text</code> classes. The value of this property is the text enclosed in single quotes, with any single quotes in the string (such as apostrophes in filenames) handled by concatenation.

					<li class="li">
						<p>To provide better access to Mac OS Xs underlying UNIX functionality, AppleScript 1.8 adds a new Standard Additions command (<code>do shell script</code>), a new file property (<code>POSIX path</code>), and a new object (<code>POSIX file</code>).</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

						<h4>Standard Additions</h4>
				<ul class="spaceabove">
					<li class="li">
						<p>The new <code>do shell script</code> command and the scriptable Terminal allow AppleScript scripts to execute strings of text as UNIX shell scripts. Many interesting shell commands act on files, and require POSIX-style file paths as input parameters. To create POSIX-style file paths from AppleScript file objects, the property <code>POSIX path</code> has been added to the <code>file</code> and <code>alias</code> classes. All file types, including <code>file specification</code> and <code>file reference</code>, support this property. Its use is straightforward:</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>The <code>do shell script</code> command and the scriptable Terminal allow AppleScript to execute UNIX shell scripts and get the results as strings of text. Frequently these strings are the pathnames of files in the UNIX format, i.e. starting at root with directory names separated by forward slashes. To convert these POSIX paths into an AppleScript file object, you can use the new <code>POSIX file</code> object:</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<ul class="spaceabove">
					<li class="li">
						<p>The new <code>do shell script</code> command takes a string as its direct parameter and executes that string in a UNIX shell. The text can be anything from a single command with parameters to a long script. The results of the script execution (standard out) are returned as the result of the command; if there is an error (or no output), the error output (standard error) are returned as the error message and can be processed in an AppleScript <code>on error</code> handler. Note that the environment in which a shell script is executed is a separate process in the users process group, and does not have a terminal set up, so commands that require interaction (<code>vi</code>, <code>top</code>) will not function. There is no way at present to direct any information to standard in of a shell script. Note also that <code>do shell script</code> uses the <code>sh</code> shell, which is different than the default <code>tcsh</code> shell used in the Terminal. Command paths and environment variables are different in <code>sh</code>; youll need to adjust your shell scripts accordingly.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>The <code>system attribute</code> command has been extended to provide information on the users environment variables. These are set up at user login time and cannot be altered. If the direct parameter to system attribute is a four-character Gestalt code, it is executed as in Standard Additions 1.7; if not, it attempts to get an environment variable by that name, returning either the value of the variable or an empty string. (Note that <code>system attribute</code> now will not fail with an error; it simply returns an empty string.) If called with no parameters, <code>system attribute</code> returns a list of all currently-defined environment variables.</p>

						<p>The return value from the <code>OSAScriptError()</code> function historically returned an error range that was a record of two short integers, and therefore could not accurately report errors in scripts longer than 32K. AppleScript 1.7 returns a record of two <code>typeLongInteger</code> values. Existing code that gets these values as <code>typeLongInteger</code> will now work correctly; applications that asked for short integers will continue to get erroneous results on long scripts and should be revised to accommodate the new return value.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>To support a wider variety of sources of script text, the compiler in AppleScript 1.7 accepts all three prevalent styles of line endings: Macintosh style (carriage return, ASCII 13), UNIX style (linefeed, ASCII 10) and Windows style (CRLF, ASCII 13-ASCII 10). Decompiled source will continue to be Macintosh-style.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>Every event sent by AppleScript to an application or scripting addition now includes an <code>enumConsidsAndIgnores</code> (<code>'csig'</code>) attribute whose value is a <code>typeUInt32</code> bit field with bits set for every consideration or ignore currently in effect. Mask constants are defined in <code>ASRegistry.h</code>. This attribute obsoletes the older <code>enumConsiderations</code> attribute, which is difficult to interpret, incomplete, and is only sent with events that contain a <code>whose</code> clause.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>The <code>kAESave</code> and <code>kAEClose</code> Apple events have been defined in the Apple Event Registry to accept a <code>typeAlias</code> value in their <code>in</code> and <code>saving in</code> parameters. This is technically inaccurate as scripters may specify files that do not exist for these parameters, and <code>typeAlias</code> cannot represent a file that does not exist. The historical solution has been to supply a <code>typeFSS</code> value (or a <code>cFile</code> value which is coerced to a <code>typeFSS</code>) and create the file using the file specification. In Mac OS X, however, file specifications are not valid values in Apple events, as they cannot represent long or Unicode file names and are not necessarily valid across processes. For AppleScript 1.7 and later, applications should get these parameters as <code>typeFileURL</code> and use the sample code provided in Tech Note TN2022 to find or create the file it represents.</p>

						<p>Program Linking: Program Linking now works between Mac OS X machines as well as between Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X machines. When targeting applications running on a Mac OS X machine, you must use TCP/IP networking and addressing; AppleTalk is not supported. (In addition, AppleScript 1.7 now supports encoding the login name and password into the eppc URL.) For a Mac OS X machine to respond to Program Linking requests, Allow Remote Apple Events must be enabled in the Sharing panel of System Preferences.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>SOAP and XML-RPC Support: AppleScript can now use Internet applications as targets of <code>tell</code> blocks. The URL for the application reference must be a correct URL for a SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) or XML-RPC (eXtended Markup Language Remote Procedure Call) Web server. The syntax is:</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>An alternate syntax is:</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>but this form will be converted to the form above when the script is compiled.</p>

					<li class="li">
						<p>File Extensions: Like most other Mac OS X functions, AppleScript now supports file extensions (as well as the historical file types) on all the file kinds it deals with. The file types for AppleScript are:</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>Applets: Prior to AppleScript 1.4.3, script applications (applets) were stored in a universal format that worked on both 680x0-based and Power PC-based Macintosh models. Because that format was 680x0-based, it would not work on Mac OS X, so a Mac OS X applet format was introduced in AppleScript 1.4.3. With improvements in Mac OS X since that time, it is now possible to produce a script application that works on 680x0-based, Power PC-based Mac OS 9, and Mac OS X configurations. Script Editor 1.7 again offers only one choice for saving script applications. Older formats continue to work on the configurations they were saved for.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>Command Line Tools: The <code>osacompile</code> and <code>osascript</code> tools now have an include option (<code>-i</code>) that allows you to specify application terminology to be used when compiling the given scripts. This frees you from having to specify applications in <code>tell</code> blocks in the script itself. You can also use this to specify the static terminology for an application with dynamic terms, so you can prevent that application from being launched when you compile the script.</p>

						<li class="li">
							<p>In AppleScript 1.5 through 1.6, a scripts global variables could be lost under certain rare circumstances. If a script contains a <code>tell</code> block that targets a variable, and that variable specifies an application that does not exist, the <code>Where is application AppName?</code> dialog would be presented when the script is executed. After that point, further references to global variables in the handler that included the <code>tell</code> block would fail. This has been fixed.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>In AppleScript 1.5 and 1.6 for Mac OS X, scripting additions behaved fundamentally differently than in Mac OS 9: they were only installed in certain applications that were AppleScript-aware. If a scripting addition command (such as <code>display dialog</code>) was sent to an application that was not AppleScript-aware, the event would instead be executed in the application running the script (e.g. Script Editor); that means the dialog would come up in the Script Editor layer, not the <code>tell</code> target application. In AppleScript 1.7 for Mac OS X, the scripting additions mechanism has been redesigned to behave more like Mac OS 9, and scripting addition commands sent to applications will be executed in the process space and window layer of the target application.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>AppleScript 1.5 through 1.6 often launched applications unnecessarily in order to get their terminology, and often used the terminology of the script editing application (such as Script Debugger) instead of application terminology. This has been fixed.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>In AppleScript 1.5 through 1.6 for Mac OS X, the <code>version</code> property of AppleScript or an application would be displayed as raw data rather than a string (unless the version property was explicitly converted to a string). This has been fixed.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>In AppleScript 1.5 and 1.6 for Mac OS X, certain operations with <code>file</code> object specifiers (e.g. <code>file "Mac OS X:Applications:Terminal.app:" as alias</code>) would fail, when similar operations would succeed on AppleScript 1.3 through 1.6 for Mac OS 9. These operations now work in AppleScript 1.7 for Mac OS X. Note that, as always, while you can pass a <code>file</code> object specifier as a parameter to an event, or perform certain operations on it (like assignment and coercion), simply evaluating <code>file "pathname"</code> is itself an AppleScript error.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>AppleScript 1.5 and 1.6 for Mac OS X could not target Mac OS 9 control panels running in the Classic environment. This has been fixed. Note that the Classic environment only supports a small number of control panels from Mac OS 9 (such as the Launcher).</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>Accessing <code>paragraphs</code> of AppleScript strings did not work correctly in AppleScript 1.5 through 1.6 if the line endings were Windows-style (CRLF). The result would be only the first half of the text paragraphs, interspersed with an equal number of blank strings. This has been fixed.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>Occasionally with AppleScript 1.5 and 1.6, recompiling a script would get an end of file error reading an applications terminology. This has been fixed.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>In AppleScript 1.6, under certain circumstances calling a handler in an applet that has not been launched could cause a Cannot continue error. This has been fixed.</p>

							<p>In AppleScript 1.6, Unicode text values stored in script properties of a saved script could not be reloaded reliably. This has been fixed.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>In AppleScript 1.6, Unicode text received from certain applications that included a Unicode byte-order mark would behave incorrectly; the text would appear to begin with the Euro symbol, and some operations would fail.

						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>In somewhat rare circumstances, comparing two references to the same file for equality can fail even if both references refer to the same file. This is true in AppleScript 1.0 through 1.6 and has been fixed in AppleScript 1.7.</p>

							<p>All disks formatted as Enhanced Macintosh File System (HFS Plus) are able to store files with file names greater than 32 characters and stored as Unicode text. When older software accesses such files, those names are represented in an encoded form (with something like <code>#28AF</code> in the name). With AppleScript 1.6 and earlier, the results of many Standard Additions commands (like <code>path to</code>, <code>info for</code>, and <code>list folder</code>), as well as creation and display of <code>alias</code> objects, would require and return encoded names. In AppleScript 1.7, long and Unicode file names in aliases and for scripting additions are represented by styled or Unicode text. Encoded file names are no longer supported.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>In Mac OS X v10.0 through 10.0.4, the <code>choose file name</code> command in Standard Additions 1.6 would crash if given an empty string ("") as the default file name. This has been fixed. In addition, on Mac OS X the default file name can be a Unicode string.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>The <code>choose from list</code> command in Scripting Additions 1.4 through 1.6 allowed the scripter to create a situation where it would return an empty selection even if the scripter specifically disallowed that case. (This can be done by supplying a default item that does not appear in the list). In Scripting Additions 1.7 and later, the OK button will not be enabled in such cases.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>In versions of Standard Additions prior to 1.7, the <code>choose URL</code> commands <code>using editable URL</code> parameter was present in the Scripting Additions dictionary but was nonfunctional (URLs were always editable regardless of the setting of the parameter). It now behaves correctly: if set to false, the user can choose a URL only by browsing, not by editing the URL in the text box.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>In Mac OS X, the <code>info for</code> command now returns additional record items that provide information about the files extensions. The <code>displayed name</code> item returns the name of the item as the user sees it in the Finder or file dialogs, and the <code>name extension</code> item now returns the file extension (if any) that is on the indicated file (without the ., which is considered a separator, and not part of either the name or the extension). Both of these fields (along with the <code>name</code> field itself) are Unicode text values.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>Mac OS 9.1 and Mac OS X Public Beta introduced the concept of a package, that is, a file composed of a folder of several files and folders, which is treated as an integral file by the Finder and other applications. The <code>info for</code> command in AppleScript 1.6 and earlier treated such packaged data application files as folders, not files, and would not return file- or application-related information about them. In Standard Additions 1.7 and later, getting the information for any directory (including package folders) returns an additional record item <code>package folder</code> (if this Boolean value is true, then the directory is a package), and the files type and creator.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>In Standard Additions 1.6 and earlier, the <code>info for</code> scripting addition would fail if any piece of information in the requested file or directory was unavailable. On UFS (Mac OS X) disks and mounted NFS volumes, the file creation date is unavailable, and accessing it causes a -8850 error (in trying to convert it to Universal Time). Starting with Standard Additions 1.7, any missing piece of information in the <code>info for</code> result is provided as the value <code>missing value</code> without failure. In AppleScript 1.6 and earlier, magnitude comparisons (&lt;, ≤, >, ≥) against the missing value would signal a coercion error for most types; in 1.7 and later, these comparisons always return false without error. These two changes ensure that scripts that use <code>info for</code> against UFS and NFS volumes do not fail, though they may not get correct results because any comparison to the creation date is always false.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>In Standard Additions 1.6 on both Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X, the <code>info for</code> command would return an error -1401 for a nonexistent file, rather than the normal -35 returned in previous versions. In Standard Additions 1.7, trying to get the info for a nonexistent file (or a file in a nonexistent directory or inaccessible disk) will return the -35 error.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>From AppleScript 1.1, the <code>offset</code> command has not worked correctly when the direct parameter is styled text. It also has not worked correctly with the newly-introduced <code>Unicode text</code> type. It now produces correct results with both styled and Unicode text.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>Standard Additions 1.5 through 1.6 changed the way that the random number seed worked in the <code>random number</code> command. Older versions used the system clock as the seed value if no seed value (or a seed value of 0) was provided; Scripting Additions 1.5 and 1.6 always use a seed value of 0 in these cases. In Scripting Additions 1.7 the older behavior has been restored. In addition, the seed value is now taken from the 60Hz ticks counter rather than the system clock, because the increased speed of new machines makes it more likely that two consecutive <code>random number</code> calls may receive the same system clock time as their seed value.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>The <code>read</code> command in Scripting Additions 1.6 had specific problems with the <code>using delimiters</code> parameter. In previous versions, <code>read f as list using delimiters {tab}</code> would return a list, but in AppleScript 1.6, it returns a list of one-item lists. In AppleScript 1.7 and later it behaves as it did prior to version 1.6</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>The <code>read</code> command in Scripting Additions 1.6 had specific problems with the <code>before</code> and <code>until</code> parameters if used in conjunction with the <code>as</code> parameter. Instead of returning a value of a given type, it would return random data or an error. This has been fixed.</p>

This creates problems when the handler actually returns a list of the requested type -- AppleScript thinks the list needs to be coerced, and tends to either fail or do the wrong thing. The workaround has been to define a type list type and a coercion handler from that to a plain list that simply duplicates the descriptor. The Finders alias list type, for example, is implemented this way. There is now a better way: if you take an <code>as</code> parameter, and you do not want AppleScript to try to coerce your result, put a Boolean true value into the <code>keyAppHandledCoercion</code> parameter of the result. AppleScript will sense this parameter and leave the result unchanged.</p>

						<p>Mac OS X does not support scripting additions (OSAXen) built for Mac OS 9. Because only applications can safely link to CarbonLib on Mac OS 9, scripting additions on 9 must link to InterfaceLib, which is not supported on Mac OS X. Scripting additions for Mac OS X come in two flavors: CFM and Mach-O. For CFM, follow the directions in Tech Note TN1164 to build it as a shared library, but link to CarbonLib instead of InterfaceLib.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>Mach-O scripting additions are packaged as bundles. Using Project Builder, create a Bundle target, and make sure that it has either a <code>CFBundleSignature</code> of <code>'osax'</code> or a name ending with <code>.osax</code>. The code layout is essentially the same as a CFM scripting addition, but instead of using the CFM initialization and termination routines plus the <code>gAdditionReferenceCount</code> global, AppleScript looks for three entry points: <code>SAInitialize</code>, <code>SATerminate</code>, and <code>SAIsBusy</code>, with the following prototypes:</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p><code>additionBundle</code> is a reference to your own addition; you may retain it for future use or ignore it and rely on your own bundle identifier. <code>SAIsBusy</code> is equivalent to testing for <code>gAdditionReferenceCount</code> not equal to zero.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>It is possible to build a bundled scripting addition that contains both 9 and X versions, thus giving you a single file distribution, but you need to have AppleScript 1.6 and CarbonLib 1.3 installed on Mac OS 9.1 for it to work with Mac OS 9.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>An important difference from Mac OS 9 is that in Mac OS X, scripting additions are loaded separately into each application that connects to AppleScript. This means that (1) there may be multiple instances of your addition running on the system, so be careful about shared resource management; and (2) you cannot assume that any random application has access to your addition, so sending raw AppleEvents to an application will not necessarily work. (e.g., sending <code>syso/beep</code> to the Finder will return not handled.) AppleScript has a workaround built into it so that scripts will still work, but applications that use AppleEvents directly may have trouble.</p>

							<p>The <code>Unicode text</code> data type has been growing in functionality since AppleScript 1.3 and is now comparable in functionality with the <code>string</code> data type. Not only can Unicode text strings be received from and sent to applications, they display properly in the Results and Event Log windows of the Script Editor (and third-party editors); they can be accessed with the <code>character</code>, <code>word</code>, <code>paragraph</code>, and <code>text item</code> element classes and the <code>first</code>, <code>last</code>, <code>middle</code>, <code>some</code>, and <code>every</code> access forms; they can be operated on with the <code>&amp;</code> (concatenation) operator; and they can be compared with the <code>less than</code>, <code>greater than</code>, <code>less than or equal to</code>, <code>greater than or equal to</code>, <code>equals</code>, <code>contains</code>, <code>is contained by</code>, <code>begins with</code>, and <code>ends with</code> operators. For <code>text item</code> elements of a Unicode string, the <code>text item delimiters</code> can be either string or Unicode text values. When comparing Unicode strings, the <code>considering</code> and <code>ignoring</code> constructs are supported for <code>case</code>, <code>diacriticals</code> and <code>punctuation</code>.</p>

							<p>AppleScript 1.6 supports many changes in general system operation introduced in Mac OS X. It can use applications and scripting additions that are stored as bundles or packages for Mac OS X. It can load scripts and application terminologies from files that do not have traditional Mac OS resource forks. It accommodates the fact that many Mac OS X applications actually have a <code>.app</code> filename extension that is hidden from the user.</p>
