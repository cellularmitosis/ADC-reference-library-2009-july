It shows how to use off-screen bitmaps and pixel maps to produce flicker-free updating with a minimum of code restructuring.  OffSample attempts to reduce the amount of “knowledge” it has of the off-screen structure so as to minimize its dependence upon that unit.OffSample emphasizes using the Offscreen unit; it is not intended to be viewed as a complete application on which to base some larger effort.  Instead, its method of using off-screen bitmaps and pixel maps should be studied and adapted to other applications that desire features like flicker-free updating.Changes with version 1.01_________________________Updated to work with MPW 3.2 header files by changing "chunky" to "chunkyPix"and removing extra type declarations.
