README - QTMovieFromProcsQuickTime 3.0 provides functions that allow you to create a movieusing data supplied by one  or more application-defined procedures.In particular, you use the function MovieExportAddDataSource to adda track-generating procedure and you use the functionMovieExportFromProceduresToDataRef to do the actual movie exporting.In this example, we will create a QuickTime movie with a video trackand an audio track; we generate the video track by drawing aseries of individual frames, and we generate the audio track bygenerating 10 seconds of silence.Enjoy,QuickTime Team
