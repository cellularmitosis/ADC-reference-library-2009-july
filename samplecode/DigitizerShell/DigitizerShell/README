README - DigitizerShellDigitizerShell is a simple sequence grabber and vdig related test bed for testing vdig and digitizer functionality, QuickTime/Mac.  If you want to check out a more complete example of a video capture application, check out John Wang's My Capture App (develop # 19).Note that the MacFramework used in this shell is different from the MovieShell (still same origin) because we want to restrict to pure digitizing issues, so any code related to movie handling is not present in this shell.
