ColorPopUpMenusThis sample contains a program illustrating how to show swatches of color in a labels-like menu in your own application.  It also illustrates how to add a user adjustable color item to the menu that can be changed by way of the color picker interface.	Behind the scenes, the color swatches in the menu are implemented as color icon resources.  The only real tricky part here is finding the correct place to save the color in the color icon resource.  Of interest in this example:Routines are provided that allow you to get/set particular color table elements inside of a cicn resource.By John Montbriand.Copyright © 1999 by Apple Computer, Inc.All rights reserved worldwide.	Disclaimer:You may incorporate this sample code into your applications without restriction, though the sample code has been provided "AS IS" and the responsibility for its operation is 100% yours.
