<pre class="sourcecodebox">Read Me About CFLocalServer
===========================
1.2

CFLocalServer is a sample that shows how to use UNIX domain sockets to
communicate between client and server programs running on the same machine. 
This sample was written specifically to show how a daemon can manage
communication with multiple clients.  It supports RPC [1] communications (where
the client makes a request to server and blocks waiting for a reply) and
asynchronous notification (where the server sends messages to all clients).  It
wraps each UNIX domain socket in a CFSocket to demonstrate the integration of
UNIX domain sockets with a run-loop based program.

CFLocalServer should work on all versions of Mac OS X, but it has been
primarily tested on Mac OS X 10.4.x.

[1] Remote Procedure Call

About UNIX Domain Sockets
-------------------------
UNIX domain sockets are somewhat like TCP/IP sockets, except that the
communication is always local to the computer.  You access UNIX domain sockets
using the same BSD sockets API that you'd use for TCP/IP sockets.  The primary
difference is the address format.  For TCP/IP sockets, the address structure
(that which you pass to bind, connect, and so on) is (struct sockaddr_in),
which contains a IP address and port number.  For UNIX domain sockets, the
address structure is (struct sockaddr_un), which contains a path.

When the server binds to a UNIX domain socket, the system creates a file system
object that represents the socket.  For example, PPP's UNIX domain socket is
/var/run/pppconfd.  When you look at this with &quot;ls -l&quot;, you'll see the first
character of the listing is &quot;s&quot;, indicating that this object is a socket.

$ ls -l /var/run/pppconfd 
srwxrwxrwx  1 root  daemon  0  9 May 12:57 /var/run/pppconfd

Once the server is running, the client can connect to it by simply passing this
path to the connect call.  Once the connection is in place, communication
proceeds as it would for TCP/IP sockets.

To learn more about UNIX domain sockets, consult any standard UNIX reference. 
I particularly recommend &quot;UNIX Network Programming&quot; by Stevens.

Why UNIX Domain Sockets?
------------------------
Mac OS X has numerous inter-process communications (IPC) APIs.  When
implementing a daemon, the UNIX domain sockets API offers a number of
advantages over other IPC mechanisms.

o Compared to TCP/IP, it guarantees that only processes running on your local
machine can connect to your server.  You can also get this guarantee with
TCP/IP, but it requires extra work.

o Compared to Apple events, it works on all versions of Mac OS X (there are
problems using Apple events from a daemon prior to Mac OS X 10.2).  Also, it's
a connection-oriented API, so the server automatically learns about the death
of a client and it's easy for the server to asynchronously notify the client.

o Compared to Mach messages (and any high-level wrappers, like CFMessagePort),
it eliminates any Mach bootstrap port namespace concerns.  Also, when you use
Mach messages, you have to do extra work for the server to be notified when a
client dies unexpectedly.

o It can be easily integrated into any server architecture, including those
based on threads, a runloop (using CFSocket), a select loop, or kqueues.

o It is a well known POSIX API with numerous sources of good documentation.

o Source code based on UNIX domain sockets code is portable to other POSIX
platforms.

Packing List
------------
The sample contains the following items:

o Read Me About CFLocalServer.txt -- This document.
o CFLocalServer.xcodeproj -- An Xcode 2.1 project that builds the sample.
o CFLocalServer.xcode -- An Xcode 1.5 project that builds the sample.
o Server.c -- Source code for the server.
o Client.c -- Source code for the client.
o Protocol.h -- Definitions for the client/server communication protocol.
o Common.h -- Interface to the common utilities.
o Common.c -- Implementation of the common utilities.
o build -- A directory containing pre-built versions of the client and server.

Using the Sample
----------------
To try out CFLocalServer, first open a Terminal window, change into the &quot;build&quot;
directory, and then run the server.

server$ ./CFLocalServer
CFLocalServer: Starting up (pid: 2764).

The server will continue running until you tell it to quit by either typing ^C
or  sending it a &quot;quit&quot; command from one of the clients.

To start a client, open a new Terminal window, change into the build directory,
and then run the client as shown below.

client$ ./CFLocalClient nop
       nop

The client arguments represent commands to send to the server.  In this case
the &quot;nop&quot; command does nothing; it simply tests the RPC path between the client
and the server.  If you look at the server window you'll see that the server has
printed something like:

0x500da0: NOP
ClientGotSpace: Client 0x500da0 lifted write-side flow control.

The first line is a record of the &quot;nop&quot; command.  The second is a debugging
message which isn't particularly relevant to this example.

The client supports a number of other commands.  You can see a list by running
the client with no arguments.

client$ ./CFLocalClient 
usage: CFLocalClient command...
       commands: nop
                 whisper &lt;message&gt;
                 shout   &lt;message&gt;
                 listen  (must be last)
                 quit

The &quot;quit&quot; command tells the server to quit.  The &quot;whisper&quot; command tells the
server to print &lt;message&gt;.  The &quot;shout&quot; and &quot;listen&quot; commands are used to
demonstrate asynchronous server-to-client notification.  To see this in action,
open a third terminal window and run the &quot;listen&quot; command in that.

listener$ ./CFLocalClient listen
    listen Press ^C to quit.

This starts the client and tells it to listen for messages from the server. 
These messages are asynchronous; the server generates the message internally
and sends it to all listening clients.

To send an asynchronous notification message, execute the &quot;shout&quot; command on
the first client.

$ ./CFLocalClient shout 'Hello Cruel World!'
     shout &quot;Hello Cruel World!&quot;

On the server you'll see the following, indicating that the server got the
&quot;shout&quot; command:

0x501060: Shout   &quot;Hello Cruel World!&quot;

On the listening client you'll see the following:

listener$ ./CFLocalClient listen
    listen Press ^C to quit.
           heard &quot;Hello Cruel World!&quot;

You can run multiple listeners, and each will see this message.

If you want to examine the state of the server, you can send it a SIGINFO
signal.

client$ kill -INFO 2764

The server will then dump its current state, as shown in the example below.

CFLocalServer State
-------------------
Clients:
  Client 0x500da0:
    fSockFD            = 8
    fSockCF            = 0x500f80
    fRunLoopSource     = 0x500e90
    fBufferedData      = 0x500df0 (count: 0)
    fPendingSends      = 0x500e20 (count: 0)
    fPendingSendOffset = 0
    fListening         = true

Descriptors:
   0 file    '/dev/ttyp2'
   1 file    '/dev/ttyp2'
   2 file    '/dev/ttyp2'
   3 socket  SOCK_STREAM ? -&gt; ?
   4 socket  SOCK_STREAM ? -&gt; ?
   5 socket  SOCK_DGRAM  ? -&gt; ?
   6 socket  SOCK_DGRAM  ? -&gt; ?
   7 socket  SOCK_STREAM /var/tmp/com.apple.dts.CFLocalServer/Socket -&gt; ?
   8 socket  SOCK_STREAM /var/tmp/com.apple.dts.CFLocalServer/Socket -&gt; ?

Building the Sample
-------------------
The sample was built on Mac OS X 10.4.x using Xcode 2.1.  To build the project,
open the project and choose Build from the Build menu.  There is nothing
inherently 10.4-specific about this sample, and it should work all the way back
to Mac OS X 10.1.

How it Works
------------
The client and server communicate by exchanging messages, known as packets. 
All packets start with a header, with four fields:

o fMagic is always kPacketMagic, which allows me to quickly detect any
communications problems

o fType is the packet type; for example, a value of kPacketTypeNOP represents a
&quot;nop&quot; command

o fID is a sequence number designed to allow the client to match up requests
with replies; kPacketIDNone is used for non-RPC messages; any other value is
used for RPC requests; for RPC requests, the server always sends the reply with
an fID that matches the fID of the request; currently a client connection can
only be used for RPC or for asynchronous messages (not both), so this matching
of request and reply is not really needed

o fSize is the overall size of the packet, including the header

Data after the fSize field is packet-type specific.

The client is made up of two logically separate components: the connection
abstraction and the command line tool.  The command line tool is simply the UI
of the client; it parses arguments and prints results.  It doesn't know
anything about UNIX domain sockets.  It does all of its work via the connection
abstraction.

The connection abstraction is a set of routines that are called by the command
line tool to connect to the server (ConnectionOpen), send RPC requests
(ConnectionRPC), and so on.  The connection abstraction is basically a big
wrapper around a UNIX domain socket.  ConnectionOpen opens a connection to the
server by calling socket &lt;x-man-page://2/socket&gt;, to create the socket, and
connect &lt;x-man-page://2/connect&gt;, to connect it.  ConnectionRPC uses write
&lt;x-man-page://2/write&gt; to send the request and read &lt;x-man-page://2/read&gt; to
receive the response.

The most complex part of the client relates to listening.  This performs two
actions.  Firstly, it sends a &quot;listen&quot; command to the server, to tell the
server that this client has switched away from RPC mode and is now listening
for asynchronous messages.  Secondly, it calls the connection abstraction to
schedule this socket with the runloop (ConnectionRegisterListener) and then
runs the runloop.  When data arrives, the connection abstraction
(ConnectionGotData) is called by CFSocket, and it in turn calls the tool's
packet handler (GotPacket).

The server is also divided into two logical components.  The first is the
server framework, which is responsible for creating a listening socket,
scheduling that socket with the runloop, and running the runloop to accept new
connections.  When it gets a new connection (ListeningSocketAcceptCallback), it
calls the second layer, client state management, to create (ClientCreate) a new
client record (of type ClientState).  This client record tracks the state of
the client.  The client state management layer maintains a global set of client
records (gClients), one for each connected client.  Once a client has been
created, it can do a bunch of different things.

o If the client sends data to the server, CFSocket calls the client state
management's socket callback (ClientEvent) with the kCFSocketDataCallBack
event.  This calls ClientGotData, which attempts to receive a packet from the
client.  If the new data doesn't represent a full packet, the client state
management layer buffers the data (in fBufferedData) and waits for more data to
arrive.  If the new data does represent a whole packet (or completes a
previously buffered packet), the client state management layer processes that
packet.

o If the client sends the server any form of a bogus packet, the server
destroys the client record (ClientDestroy).

o If the server needs to send data to the client, it places the data in the
fPendingSends buffer and then calls the transmission routine
(ClientSendPending).  That either sends all of the data, or it fails with an
error.  If the error indicates write-side flow control (that is, the client has
stopped receiving data and the socket buffer is full, causing write to return
EAGAIN), the client state management layer tells CFSocket that it wants to be
notified when the flow control is lifted, and returns.  If it gets any other
error, it just destroys the client.

o If a flow controlled client starts receiving data again, CFSocket calls the
client state management's socket callback (ClientEvent) with the
kCFSocketWriteCallBack event.  This calls ClientGotSpace, which tries to send
any pending data to the client.

o If the amount of data waiting to be sent to the client exceeds a certain
threshold (100 messages, kClientMaximumPendingSends), the server assumes that
the client has gone permanently deaf and destroys the client.

o If a client goes away in an orderly fashion, it sends the server a &quot;goodbye&quot;
packet.  The server responds by destroying the client.

o If a client dies unexpectedly, CFSocket notifies the client state management
layer by telling it that no data is available from the client.  ClientGotData
detects this and destroys the client.

Caveats
-------
This is a sample of client/server communications using UNIX domain sockets
wrapped in CFSockets.  Client/server communication is a critical part of
writing a daemon, but it is not the only part.  To write a fully fledged
daemon, you must organise to launch the daemon (typically this is done using
launchd &lt;x-man-page://8/launchd&gt; on 10.4 and later, or from a startup item on
earlier systems) and you must implement proper logging (using ASL
&lt;x-man-page://3/asl&gt; on 10.4 and later, or syslog &lt;x-man-page://3/syslog&gt; on
earlier systems).

The sample does not support communication between 32- and 64-bit processes. 
This is primarily because CFSocket is not supported for 64-bit programs. 
However, even if that was addressed, you'd have to modify the sample to ensure
that the structures used in the communication were 64-bit invariant.  See the
comments in &quot;Protocol.h&quot; for more details.

As it's currently written, the sample is not endian neutral; the server and all
its clients must use the same endian flavour.  Thus, for example, on a Developer
Transition System, you can't run a native server and connect to it from a
PowerPC program being executed by Rosetta.  It would be easy to modify the
sample to support this (you just have to decide on a standard endianess, and
byte swap the multibyte fields of the structures defined in &quot;Protocol.h&quot;), but
I decided against doing this because a) mixed-endian code on the /same machine/
is pretty unusual, and b) it obscures the primary goal of the sample.

In the current architecture, each connection between the client and the server
is used either for RPC or for asynchronous notification, but never for both. 
If you want a client that does both, you need to open two connections.  This
design simplifies the RPC code (it doesn't have to worry about asynchronous
notification messages being mixed in with an RPC reply), but it is somewhat
wasteful of resources.

The current implementation is not tuned for performance.  For example, the
server's packet reception loop will often make unnecessary copies of the packet
data.  If you adapt this sample to a performance critical application, you will
have to profile the code and optimise its algorithms.

Credits and Version History
---------------------------
If you find any problems with this sample, mail &lt;dts@apple.com&gt; and I'll try to
fix them up.

1.0 (May 2005) was the first shipping version.

1.1 (Jun 2005) corrected a bug where the packet's fID field wasn't being
initialised in the RPC case.

1.2 (Jul 2005) updated to include an Xcode 2.1 project to produce universal
binaries; there were no code changes required for it to run correctly on the
Developer Transition Systems.

Share and Enjoy.
