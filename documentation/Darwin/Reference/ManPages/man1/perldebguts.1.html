PERLDEBGUTS(1)                        Perl Programmers Reference Guide                        PERLDEBGUTS(1)



<b>NAME</b>
       perldebguts - Guts of Perl debugging

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       This is not the <a href="perldebug.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/perldebug"><u>perldebug</u>(1)</a> manpage, which tells you how to use the debugger.  This manpage
       describes low-level details concerning the debugger's internals, which range from difficult to impos-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sible&nbsp;impossible</font>
       sible to understand for anyone who isn't incredibly intimate with Perl's guts.  Caveat lector.

<b>Debugger</b> <b>Internals</b>
       Perl has special debugging hooks at compile-time and run-time used to create debugging environments.
       These hooks are not to be confused with the <u>perl</u> <u>-Dxxx</u> command described in perlrun, which is usable
       only if a special Perl is built per the instructions in the <u>INSTALL</u> podpage in the Perl source tree.

       For example, whenever you call Perl's built-in "caller" function from the package "DB", the arguments
       that the corresponding stack frame was called with are copied to the @DB::args array.  These mecha-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nisms&nbsp;mechanisms</font>
       nisms are enabled by calling Perl with the <b>-d</b> switch.  Specifically, the following additional fea-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tures&nbsp;features</font>
       tures are enabled (cf. "$^P" in perlvar):

          Perl inserts the contents of $ENV{PERL5DB} (or "BEGIN {require 'perl5db.pl'}" if not present)
           before the first line of your program.

          Each array "@{"_&lt;$filename"}" holds the lines of $filename for a file compiled by Perl.  The same
           is also true for "eval"ed strings that contain subroutines, or which are currently being exe-
           cuted.  The $filename for "eval"ed strings looks like "(eval 34)".  Code assertions in regexes
           look like "(re_eval 19)".

           Values in this array are magical in numeric context: they compare equal to zero only if the line
           is not breakable.

          Each hash "%{"_&lt;$filename"}" contains breakpoints and actions keyed by line number.  Individual
           entries (as opposed to the whole hash) are settable.  Perl only cares about Boolean true here,
           although the values used by <u>perl5db.pl</u> have the form "$break_condition\0$action".

           The same holds for evaluated strings that contain subroutines, or which are currently being exe-
           cuted.  The $filename for "eval"ed strings looks like "(eval 34)" or  "(re_eval 19)".

          Each scalar "${"_&lt;$filename"}" contains "_&lt;$filename".  This is also the case for evaluated
           strings that contain subroutines, or which are currently being executed.  The $filename for
           "eval"ed strings looks like "(eval 34)" or "(re_eval 19)".

          After each "require"d file is compiled, but before it is executed, "DB::postponed(*{"_&lt;$file-
           name"})" is called if the subroutine "DB::postponed" exists.  Here, the $filename is the expanded
           name of the "require"d file, as found in the values of %INC.

          After each subroutine "subname" is compiled, the existence of $DB::postponed{subname} is checked.
           If this key exists, "DB::postponed(subname)" is called if the "DB::postponed" subroutine also
           exists.

          A hash %DB::sub is maintained, whose keys are subroutine names and whose values have the form
           "filename:startline-endline".  "filename" has the form "(eval 34)" for subroutines defined inside
           "eval"s, or "(re_eval 19)" for those within regex code assertions.

          When the execution of your program reaches a point that can hold a breakpoint, the "DB::DB()"
           subroutine is called if any of the variables $DB::trace, $DB::single, or $DB::signal is true.
           These variables are not "local"izable.  This feature is disabled when executing inside
           "DB::DB()", including functions called from it unless "$^D &amp; (1&lt;&lt;30)" is true.

          When execution of the program reaches a subroutine call, a call to &amp;DB::sub(<u>args</u>) is made
           instead, with $DB::sub holding the name of the called subroutine. (This doesn't happen if the
           subroutine was compiled in the "DB" package.)

       Note that if &amp;DB::sub needs external data for it to work, no subroutine call is possible without it.
       As an example, the standard debugger's &amp;DB::sub depends on the $DB::deep variable (it defines how
       many levels of recursion deep into the debugger you can go before a mandatory break).  If $DB::deep
       is not defined, subroutine calls are not possible, even though &amp;DB::sub exists.

       <b>Writing</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Own</b> <b>Debugger</b>

       <u>Environment</u> <u>Variables</u>

       The "PERL5DB" environment variable can be used to define a debugger.  For example, the minimal "work-
       ing" debugger (it actually doesn't do anything) consists of one line:

         sub DB::DB {}

       It can easily be defined like this:

         $ PERL5DB="sub DB::DB {}" perl -d your-script

       Another brief debugger, slightly more useful, can be created with only the line:

         sub DB::DB {print ++$i; scalar &lt;STDIN&gt;}

       This debugger prints a number which increments for each statement encountered and waits for you to
       hit a newline before continuing to the next statement.

       The following debugger is actually useful:

         {
           package DB;
           sub DB  {}
           sub sub {print ++$i, " $sub\n"; &amp;$sub}
         }

       It prints the sequence number of each subroutine call and the name of the called subroutine.  Note
       that &amp;DB::sub is being compiled into the package "DB" through the use of the "package" directive.

       When it starts, the debugger reads your rc file (<u>./.perldb</u> or <u>~/.perldb</u> under Unix), which can set
       important options.  (A subroutine (&amp;afterinit) can be defined here as well; it is executed after the
       debugger completes its own initialization.)

       After the rc file is read, the debugger reads the PERLDB_OPTS environment variable and uses it to set
       debugger options. The contents of this variable are treated as if they were the argument of an "o
       ..." debugger command (q.v. in "Options" in perldebug).

       <u>Debugger</u> <u>internal</u> <u>variables</u> <u>In</u> <u>addition</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>file</u> <u>and</u> <u>subroutine-related</u> <u>variables</u> <u>mentioned</u> <u>above,</u>
       <u>the</u> <u>debugger</u> <u>also</u> <u>maintains</u> <u>various</u> <u>magical</u> <u>internal</u> <u>variables.</u>

          @DB::dbline is an alias for "@{"::_&lt;current_file"}", which holds the lines of the currently-
           selected file (compiled by Perl), either explicitly chosen with the debugger's "f" command, or
           implicitly by flow of execution.

           Values in this array are magical in numeric context: they compare equal to zero only if the line
           is not breakable.

          %DB::dbline, is an alias for "%{"::_&lt;current_file"}", which contains breakpoints and actions
           keyed by line number in the currently-selected file, either explicitly chosen with the debugger's
           "f" command, or implicitly by flow of execution.

           As previously noted, individual entries (as opposed to the whole hash) are settable.  Perl only
           cares about Boolean true here, although the values used by <u>perl5db.pl</u> have the form "$break_con-
           dition\0$action".

       <u>Debugger</u> <u>customization</u> <u>functions</u>

       Some functions are provided to simplify customization.

          See "Options" in perldebug for description of options parsed by "DB::parse_options(string)"
           parses debugger options; see "Options" in pperldebug for a description of options recognized.

          "DB::dump_trace(skip[,count])" skips the specified number of frames and returns a list containing
           information about the calling frames (all of them, if "count" is missing).  Each entry is refer-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ence&nbsp;reference</font>
           ence to a hash with keys "context" (either ".", "$", or "@"), "sub" (subroutine name, or info
           about "eval"), "args" ("undef" or a reference to an array), "file", and "line".

          "DB::print_trace(FH, skip[, count[, short]])" prints formatted info about caller frames.  The
           last two functions may be convenient as arguments to "&lt;", "&lt;&lt;" commands.

       Note that any variables and functions that are not documented in this manpages (or in perldebug) are
       considered for internal use only, and as such are subject to change without notice.

<b>Frame</b> <b>Listing</b> <b>Output</b> <b>Examples</b>
       The "frame" option can be used to control the output of frame information.  For example, contrast
       this expression trace:

        $ perl -de 42
        Stack dump during die enabled outside of evals.

        Loading DB routines from perl5db.pl patch level 0.94
        Emacs support available.

        Enter h or `h h' for help.

        main::(-e:1):   0
          DB&lt;1&gt; sub foo { 14 }

          DB&lt;2&gt; sub bar { 3 }

          DB&lt;3&gt; t print foo() * bar()
        main::((eval 172):3):   print foo() + bar();
        main::foo((eval 168):2):
        main::bar((eval 170):2):
        42

       with this one, once the "o"ption "frame=2" has been set:

          DB&lt;4&gt; o f=2
                       frame = '2'
          DB&lt;5&gt; t print foo() * bar()
        3:      foo() * bar()
        entering main::foo
         2:     sub foo { 14 };
        exited main::foo
        entering main::bar
         2:     sub bar { 3 };
        exited main::bar
        42

       By way of demonstration, we present below a laborious listing resulting from setting your
       "PERLDB_OPTS" environment variable to the value "f=n N", and running <u>perl</u> <u>-d</u> <u>-V</u> from the command
       line.  Examples use various values of "n" are shown to give you a feel for the difference between
       settings.  Long those it may be, this is not a complete listing, but only excerpts.

       In all cases shown above, the line indentation shows the call tree.  If bit 2 of "frame" is set, a
       line is printed on exit from a subroutine as well.  If bit 4 is set, the arguments are printed along
       with the caller info.  If bit 8 is set, the arguments are printed even if they are tied or refer-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ences.&nbsp;references.</font>
       ences.  If bit 16 is set, the return value is printed, too.

       When a package is compiled, a line like this

           Package lib/Carp.pm.

       is printed with proper indentation.

<b>Debugging</b> <b>regular</b> <b>expressions</b>
       There are two ways to enable debugging output for regular expressions.

       If your perl is compiled with "-DDEBUGGING", you may use the <b>-Dr</b> flag on the command line.

       Otherwise, one can "use re 'debug'", which has effects at compile time and run time.  It is not lexi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cally&nbsp;lexically</font>
       cally scoped.

       <b>Compile-time</b> <b>output</b>

       The debugging output at compile time looks like this:

               stclass `ANYOF[bc]' minlen 7

       line (split into two lines above) contains optimizer information.  In the example shown, the opti-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mizer&nbsp;optimizer</font>
       mizer found that the match should contain a substring "de" at offset 1, plus substring "gh" at some
       offset between 3 and infinity.  Moreover, when checking for these substrings (to abandon impossible
       matches quickly), Perl will check for the substring "gh" before checking for the substring "de".  The
       optimizer may also use the knowledge that the match starts (at the "first" <u>id</u>) with a character
       class, and no string shorter than 7 characters can possibly match.

       The fields of interest which may appear in this line are

       "anchored" <u>STRING</u> "at" <u>POS</u>
       "floating" <u>STRING</u> "at" <u>POS1..POS2</u>
           See above.

       "matching floating/anchored"
           Which substring to check first.

       "minlen"
           The minimal length of the match.

       "stclass" <u>TYPE</u>
           Type of first matching node.

       "noscan"
           Don't scan for the found substrings.

       "isall"
           Means that the optimizer information is all that the regular expression contains, and thus one
           does not need to enter the regex engine at all.

       "GPOS"
           Set if the pattern contains "\G".

       "plus"
           Set if the pattern starts with a repeated char (as in "x+y").

       "implicit"
           Set if the pattern starts with ".*".

       "with eval"
           Set if the pattern contain eval-groups, such as "(?{ code })" and "(??{ code })".

       "anchored(TYPE)"
           If the pattern may match only at a handful of places, (with "TYPE" being "BOL", "MBOL", or
           "GPOS".  See the table below.

       If a substring is known to match at end-of-line only, it may be followed by "$", as in "floating
       `k'$".

       The optimizer-specific information is used to avoid entering (a slow) regex engine on strings that
       will not definitely match.  If the "isall" flag is set, a call to the regex engine may be avoided
       even when the optimizer found an appropriate place for the match.

       Following the optimizer information is a dump of the offset/length table, here split across several
       lines:

         Offsets: [45]
               1[4] 0[0] 0[0] 0[0] 0[0] 0[0] 0[0] 0[0] 0[0] 0[0] 0[0] 5[1]
               0[0] 12[1] 0[0] 6[1] 0[0] 7[1] 0[0] 9[1] 8[1] 0[0] 10[1] 0[0]
               11[1] 0[0] 12[0] 12[0] 13[1] 0[0] 14[4] 0[0] 0[0] 0[0] 0[0]

       The first line here indicates that the offset/length table contains 45 entries.  Each entry is a pair
       of integers, denoted by "offset[length]".  Entries are numbered starting with 1, so entry #1 here is
       "1[4]" and entry #12 is "5[1]".  "1[4]" indicates that the node labeled "1:" (the "1: ANYOF[bc]")
       begins at character position 1 in the pre-compiled form of the regex, and has a length of 4 charac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ters.&nbsp;characters.</font>
       ters.  "5[1]" in position 12 indicates that the node labeled "12:" (the "12: EXACT &lt;d&gt;") begins at
       character position 5 in the pre-compiled form of the regex, and has a length of 1 character.  "12[1]"
       in position 14 indicates that the node labeled "14:" (the "14: CURLYX[0] {1,32767}") begins at char-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">acter&nbsp;character</font>
       acter position 12 in the pre-compiled form of the regex, and has a length of 1 character---that is,
       it corresponds to the "+" symbol in the precompiled regex.

       "0[0]" items indicate that there is no corresponding node.

       <b>Run-time</b> <b>output</b>

       First of all, when doing a match, one may get no run-time output even if debugging is enabled.  This
       means that the regex engine was never entered and that all of the job was therefore done by the opti-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mizer.&nbsp;optimizer.</font>
       mizer.

       If the regex engine was entered, the output may look like this:

<b>Debugging</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>memory</b> <b>usage</b>
       Perl is a profligate wastrel when it comes to memory use.  There is a saying that to estimate memory
       usage of Perl, assume a reasonable algorithm for memory allocation, multiply that estimate by 10, and
       while you still may miss the mark, at least you won't be quite so astonished.  This is not absolutely
       true, but may provide a good grasp of what happens.

       Assume that an integer cannot take less than 20 bytes of memory, a float cannot take less than 24
       bytes, a string cannot take less than 32 bytes (all these examples assume 32-bit architectures, the
       result are quite a bit worse on 64-bit architectures).  If a variable is accessed in two of three
       different ways (which require an integer, a float, or a string), the memory footprint may increase
       yet another 20 bytes.  A sloppy <a href="../man3/malloc.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/malloc"><u>malloc</u>(3)</a> implementation can inflate these numbers dramatically.

       On the opposite end of the scale, a declaration like

         sub foo;

       may take up to 500 bytes of memory, depending on which release of Perl you're running.

       Anecdotal estimates of source-to-compiled code bloat suggest an eightfold increase.  This means that
       the compiled form of reasonable (normally commented, properly indented etc.) code will take about
       eight times more space in memory than the code took on disk.

       The <b>-DL</b> command-line switch is obsolete since circa Perl 5.6.0 (it was available only if Perl was
       built with "-DDEBUGGING").  The switch was used to track Perl's memory allocations and possible mem-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ory&nbsp;memory</font>
       ory leaks.  These days the use of malloc debugging tools like <u>Purify</u> or <u>valgrind</u> is suggested
       instead.

       One way to find out how much memory is being used by Perl data structures is to install the
       Devel::Size module from CPAN: it gives you the minimum number of bytes required to store a particular
       data structure.  Please be mindful of the difference between the <u>size()</u> and <u>total</u><b>_</b><u>size()</u>.

       If Perl has been compiled using Perl's malloc you can analyze Perl memory usage by setting the
       $ENV{PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS}.

       <b>Using</b> <b>$ENV{PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS}</b>

       If your perl is using Perl's <u>malloc()</u> and was compiled with the necessary switches (this is the
       default), then it will print memory usage statistics after compiling your code when
       "$ENV{PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS} &gt; 1", and before termination of the program when "$ENV{PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS} &gt;=
       1".  The report format is similar to the following example:

         $ PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS=2 perl -e "require Carp"
         Memory allocation statistics after compilation: (buckets 4(4)..8188(8192)
            14216 free:   130   117    28     7     9   0   2     2   1 0 0
                       437    61    36     0     5
            60924 used:   125   137   161    55     7   8   6    16   2 0 1
                        74   109   304    84    20
         Total sbrk(): 77824/21:119. Odd ends: pad+heads+chain+tail: 0+636+0+2048.
         Memory allocation statistics after execution:   (buckets 4(4)..8188(8192)
            30888 free:   245    78    85    13     6   2   1     3   2 0 1
                       315   162    39    42    11
           175816 used:   265   176  1112   111    26  22  11    27   2 1 1
                       196   178  1066   798    39
         Total sbrk(): 215040/47:145. Odd ends: pad+heads+chain+tail: 0+2192+0+6144.

       It is possible to ask for such a statistic at arbitrary points in your execution using the <u>mstat()</u>
       function out of the standard Devel::Peek module.

       Here is some explanation of that format:

       "buckets SMALLEST(APPROX)..GREATEST(APPROX)"
           Perl's <u>malloc()</u> uses bucketed allocations.  Every request is rounded up to the closest bucket
           size available, and a bucket is taken from the pool of buckets of that size.

           The line above describes the limits of buckets currently in use.  Each bucket has two sizes: mem-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ory&nbsp;memory</font>
           ory footprint and the maximal size of user data that can fit into this bucket.  Suppose in the
           above example that the smallest bucket were size 4.  The biggest bucket would have usable size
           8188, and the memory footprint would be 8192.

           In a Perl built for debugging, some buckets may have negative usable size.  This means that these
           buckets cannot (and will not) be used.  For larger buckets, the memory footprint may be one page
           greater than a power of 2.  If so, case the corresponding power of two is printed in the "APPROX"
           field above.

       Free/Used
           The 1 or 2 rows of numbers following that correspond to the number of buckets of each size
           between "SMALLEST" and "GREATEST".  In the first row, the sizes (memory footprints) of buckets
           are powers of two--or possibly one page greater.  In the second row, if present, the memory foot-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">prints&nbsp;footprints</font>
           prints of the buckets are between the memory footprints of two buckets "above".

           For example, suppose under the previous example, the memory footprints were

                free:    8     16    32    64    128  256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192
                      4     12    24    48    80

           With non-"DEBUGGING" perl, the buckets starting from 128 have a 4-byte overhead, and thus an
           8192-long bucket may take up to 8188-byte allocations.

       "Total sbrk(): SBRKed/SBRKs:CONTINUOUS"
           The first two fields give the total amount of memory perl <a href="../man2/sbrk.2.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/2/sbrk"><u>sbrk</u>(2)</a>ed (ess-broken? :-) and number
           of <a href="../man2/sbrk.2.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/2/sbrk"><u>sbrk</u>(2)</a>s used.  The third number is what perl thinks about continuity of returned chunks.  So
           long as this number is positive, <u>malloc()</u> will assume that it is probable that <a href="../man2/sbrk.2.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/2/sbrk"><u>sbrk</u>(2)</a> will pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">vide&nbsp;provide</font>
           vide continuous memory.

           Memory allocated by external libraries is not counted.

       "pad: 0"
           The amount of <a href="../man2/sbrk.2.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/2/sbrk"><u>sbrk</u>(2)</a>ed memory needed to keep buckets aligned.

       "heads: 2192"
           Although memory overhead of bigger buckets is kept inside the bucket, for smaller buckets, it is
           kept in separate areas.  This field gives the total size of these areas.

       "chain: 0"
           <u>malloc()</u> may want to subdivide a bigger bucket into smaller buckets.  If only a part of the
           deceased bucket is left unsubdivided, the rest is kept as an element of a linked list.  This
           field gives the total size of these chunks.

       "tail: 6144"
           To minimize the number of <a href="../man2/sbrk.2.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/2/sbrk"><u>sbrk</u>(2)</a>s, <u>malloc()</u> asks for more memory.  This field gives the size of
           the yet unused part, which is <a href="../man2/sbrk.2.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/2/sbrk"><u>sbrk</u>(2)</a>ed, but never touched.
