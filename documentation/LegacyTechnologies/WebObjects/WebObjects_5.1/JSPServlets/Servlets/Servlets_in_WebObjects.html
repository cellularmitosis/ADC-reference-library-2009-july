By deploying WebObjects applications as servlets runninginside servlet containers, you can take advantage of the featuresthat your servlet container offers. Alternatively, you can deployyour applications using an HTTP adaptor that runs as a plug-in inyour HTTP server. The adaptor forwards requests to your servletcontainer.</p><p>WebObjects applications can be deployed as servlets insidea servlet container such as Tomcat (version 3.2.3) or WebLogic.When an application runs as a servlet, instead of as a separateJava virtual machine (JVM) process, it runs inside the servlet container'sJVM, along with other applications. Note, however, that you canrun only one instance of an application inside a servlet container.To run multiple instances of an application, you have to use multipleservlet containers. In addition, WebObjects deployment tools suchas Monitor and wotaskd cannot be used with servlets.</p><p>To deploy an application as a servlet, you need to add theJavaWOJSPServlet framework to your project. When you build the project,Project Builder generates a WAR (Web application archive) file inaddition to the WOA (WebObjects application) bundle. The WAR filehas the appropriate classes and the <code>web.xml</code> filein the <code>WEB-INF</code> directorythat your servlet container needs to launch the servlet. All youneed to do in order to deploy the servlet is copy the WAR file tothe application deployment directory of your servlet container.</p><p>You may have to modify <code>web.xml.template</code>,specifically the <code>%WOClassPath%</code> marker,to ensure that the classpath to the application's WOA is correct.For WebLogic, the default Session class must be placed in a packagebecause it conflicts with an internal WebLogic class. In general,all your classes should be inside packages.</p><br><table border = "0" BGCOLOR="#E6E6E6"><tr><td scope="row"><b>Note: </b>TheWAR file is not a complete application.
