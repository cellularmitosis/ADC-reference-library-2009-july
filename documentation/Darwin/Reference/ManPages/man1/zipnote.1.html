<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       <u>zip</u> is a compression and file packaging utility for Unix, VMS, MSDOS, OS/2, Windows NT, Minix,  Atari
       and Macintosh, Amiga and Acorn RISC OS.

       It  is  analogous to a combination of the UNIX commands <a href="tar.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/tar"><u>tar</u>(1)</a> and <a href="compress.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/compress"><u>compress</u>(1)</a> and is compatible with
       PKZIP (Phil Katz's ZIP for MSDOS systems).

       A companion program <a href="unzip.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/unzip">(<u>unzip</u>(1L)</a>), unpacks <u>zip</u> archives.  The <u>zip</u> and <a href="unzip.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/unzip"><u>unzip</u>(1L)</a> programs can work  with
       archives  produced  by PKZIP, and PKZIP and PKUNZIP can work with archives produced by <u>zip</u>.  <u>zip</u> ver-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion&nbsp;version</font>
       sion 2.32 is compatible with PKZIP 2.04.  Note that PKUNZIP 1.10 cannot  extract  files  produced  by
       PKZIP  2.04  or  <u>zip</u>  2.32.  You must use PKUNZIP 2.04g or <u>unzip</u> 5.0p1 (or later versions) to extract
       them.

       For a brief help on <u>zip</u> and <u>unzip</u>, run each without specifying any parameters on the command line.

       The program is useful for packaging a set of files for distribution; for  archiving  files;  and  for
       saving disk space by temporarily compressing unused files or directories.

       The  <u>zip</u>  program puts one or more compressed files into a single <u>zip</u> archive, along with information
       about the files (name, path, date, time of last modification, protection, and  check  information  to
       verify file integrity).  An entire directory structure can be packed into a <u>zip</u> archive with a single
       command.  Compression ratios of 2:1 to 3:1 are common for text files.  <u>zip</u> has one compression method
       (deflation)  and  can  also store files without compression.  <u>zip</u> automatically chooses the better of
       the two for each file to be compressed.

       The basic command format is

              <b>zip</b> options archive inpattern inpattern ...

       where <b>archive</b> is a new or existing <u>zip</u> archive and <b>inpattern</b> is a directory or file  path  optionally
       including  wildcards.   When  given the name of an existing <u>zip</u> archive, <u>zip</u> will replace identically
       named entries in the <u>zip</u> archive or add entries for new names.  For example, if  <u>foo.zip</u>  exists  and
       contains  <u>foo/file1</u>  and <u>foo/file2</u>, and the directory <u>foo</u> contains the files <u>foo/file1</u> and <u>foo/file3</u>,
       then:

              zip -r foo.zip foo

       or more concisely

              zip -r foo foo

       will replace <u>foo/file1</u> in <u>foo.zip</u> and  add  <u>foo/file3</u>  to  <u>foo.zip</u>.   After  this,  <u>foo.zip</u>  contains
       <u>foo/file1</u>, <u>foo/file2</u>, and <u>foo/file3</u>, with <u>foo/file2</u> unchanged from before.

       If  the  file list is specified as <b>-@</b>, [Not on MacOS] <u>zip</u> takes the list of input files from standard
       input.  Under UNIX, this option can be used to powerful effect in conjunction with the  <a href="find.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/find"><u>find</u>(1)</a>  com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand.&nbsp;command.</font>
       mand.   For  example,  to archive all the C source files in the current directory and its subdirecto-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ries:&nbsp;subdirectories:</font>
       ries:

              find . -name "*.[ch]" -print | zip source -@

       (note that the pattern <b>"*.[ch]"</b> must be quoted to keep the shell from expanding it).  <u>zip</u>  will  also
       accept a single dash ("-") as the zip file name, in which case it will write the zip file to standard
       output, allowing the output to be piped to another program. For example:

              zip -r - . | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=16k

       would write the zip output directly to a tape with the specified block size for the purpose of  back-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;backing</font>
       ing up the current directory.

       <u>zip</u>  also  accepts  a single dash ("-") as the name of a file to be compressed, in which case it will
       read the file from standard input, allowing zip to take input from another program. For example:

              tar cf - . | zip backup -<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">would&nbsp;backupwould</font>

       would compress the output of the tar command for the purpose of backing  up  the  current  directory.
       This generally produces better compression than the previous example using the <b>-r</b> option, because <u>zip</u>
       can take advantage of redundancy between files. The backup can be restored using the command

              unzip -p backup | tar xf -<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">When&nbsp;xfWhen</font>

       When no zip file name is given and stdout is not a terminal, <u>zip</u> acts as a filter, compressing  stan-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dard&nbsp;standard</font>
       dard input to standard output.  For example,

              tar cf - . | zip | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=16k

       is equivalent to

              tar cf - . | zip - - | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=16k

       <u>zip</u> archives created in this manner can be extracted with the program <u>funzip</u> which is provided in the
       <u>unzip</u> package, or by <u>gunzip</u> which is provided in the <u>gzip</u> package. For example:

              dd if=/dev/nrst0  ibs=16k | funzip | tar xvf -<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">When&nbsp;xvfWhen</font>

       When changing an existing <u>zip</u> archive, <u>zip</u> will write a temporary file with  the  new  contents,  and
       only  replace  the  old  one  when the process of creating the new version has been completed without
       error.

       If the name of the <u>zip</u> archive does not contain an extension, the extension <u>.zip</u>  is  added.  If  the
       name already contains an extension other than <u>.zip</u> the existing extension is kept unchanged.

<b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-a</b>     [Systems using EBCDIC] Translate file to ASCII format.

       <b>-A</b>     Adjust self-extracting executable archive.  A self-extracting executable archive is created by
              prepending the SFX stub to an existing archive. The <b>-A</b> option tells <u>zip</u> to  adjust  the  entry
              offsets stored in the archive to take into account this "preamble" data.

       Note:  self-extracting archives for the Amiga are a special case.  At present, only the Amiga port of
       <u>zip</u> is capable of adjusting or updating these without corrupting them.  <b>-J</b> can be used to remove  the
       SFX stub if other updates need to be made.

       <b>-B</b>     [VM/CMS and MVS] force file to be read binary (default is text).

       <b>-Bn</b>    [TANDEM] set Edit/Enscribe formatting options with n defined as
              bit  0: Don't add delimiter (Edit/Enscribe)
              bit 1: Use LF rather than CR/LF as delimiter (Edit/Enscribe)
              bit  2: Space fill record to maximum record length (Enscribe)
              bit  3: Trim trailing space (Enscribe)
              bit 8: Force 30K (Expand) large read for unstructured files

       <b>-b</b> <b>path</b>
              Use the specified <u>path</u> for the temporary <u>zip</u> archive. For example:

                     zip -b /tmp stuff *

              will  put  the temporary <u>zip</u> archive in the directory <u>/tmp</u>, copying over <u>stuff.zip</u> to the cur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rent&nbsp;current</font>
              rent directory when done. This option is only useful when updating an  existing  archive,  and
              the  file  system  containing this old archive does not have enough space to hold both old and
              new archives at the same time.

       <b>-c</b>     Add one-line comments for each file.  File operations (adding, updating) are done  first,  and
              the user is then prompted for a one-line comment for each file.  Enter the comment followed by
              return, or just return for no comment.

       <b>-d</b>     Remove (delete) entries from a <u>zip</u> archive.  For example:

                     zip -d foo foo/tom/junk foo/harry/\* \*.o

              will remove the entry <u>foo/tom/junk</u>, all of the files that start with <u>foo/harry/</u>,  and  all  of
              the  files that end with <u>.o</u> (in any path).  Note that shell pathname expansion has been inhib-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ited&nbsp;inhibited</font>
              ited with backslashes, so that <u>zip</u> can see the asterisks, enabling <u>zip</u> to match  on  the  con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tents&nbsp;contents</font>
              tents  of  the <u>zip</u> archive instead of the contents of the current directory.  You can also use
              quotes to escape wildcards, as in

                     zip -d foo foo/tom/junk "foo/harry/*" "*.o"

              Under systems where the shell does not expand wildcards, such as MSDOS,  the  backslashes  are
              not needed.  The above would then be

                     zip -d foo foo/tom/junk foo/harry/* *.o

              Under  MSDOS,  <b>-d</b>  is  case sensitive when it matches names in the <u>zip</u> archive.  This requires
              that file names be entered in upper case if they were zipped by PKZIP on an MSDOS system.

       <b>-df</b>    [MacOS] Include only data-fork of files zipped into the archive.  Good for exporting files  to
              foreign operating-systems.  Resource-forks will be ignored at all.

       <b>-D</b>     Do  not  create  entries in the zip archive for directories.  Directory entries are created by
              default so that their attributes can be saved in the zip archive.   The  environment  variable
              ZIPOPT can be used to change the default options. For example under Unix with sh:

                     ZIPOPT="-D"; export ZIPOPT

              (The  variable  ZIPOPT  can  be  used  for any option except <b>-i</b> and <b>-x</b> and can include several
              options.) The option <b>-D</b> is a shorthand for <b>-x</b> "*/" but the latter cannot be set as default  in
              the ZIPOPT environment variable.

       <b>-e</b>     Encrypt  the  contents of the zip archive using a password which is entered on the terminal in
              response to a prompt (this will not be echoed; if standard error is not a tty, <u>zip</u>  will  exit
              with  an  error).   The password prompt is repeated to save the user from typing errors.  Note
              that this encrypts with standard pkzip encryption which is considered weak.

       <b>-E</b>     [OS/2] Use the .LONGNAME Extended Attribute (if found) as filename.

       <b>-f</b>     Replace (freshen) an existing entry in the <u>zip</u> archive only  if  it  has  been  modified  more
              recently  than the version already in the archive; unlike the update option (<b>-u</b>) this will not
              add files that are not already in the <u>zip</u> archive.  For example:

                     zip -f foo

              This command should be run from the same directory from which the  original  <u>zip</u>  command  was
              run, since paths stored in <u>zip</u> archives are always relative.

              Note  that  the timezone environment variable TZ should be set according to the local timezone
              in order for the <b>-f</b> , <b>-u</b> and <b>-o</b> options to work correctly.  The reasons behind this are  some-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">what&nbsp;somewhat</font>
              what  subtle but have to do with the differences between the Unix-format file times (always in
              GMT) and most of the other operating systems (always local time) and the necessity to  compare
              the  two.  A typical TZ value is ``MET-1MEST'' (Middle European time with automatic adjustment
              for ``summertime'' or Daylight Savings Time).

       <b>-F</b>     Fix the <u>zip</u> archive. This option can be used if some portions of the archive are  missing.  It
              is not guaranteed to work, so you MUST make a backup of the original archive first.

              When  doubled  as in <b>-FF</b> the compressed sizes given inside the damaged archive are not trusted
              and zip scans for special signatures to identify the limits between the archive  members.  The
              single  <b>-F</b> is more reliable if the archive is not too much damaged, for example if it has only
              been truncated, so try this option first.

              Neither option will recover archives that have been  incorrectly  transferred  in  ascii  mode
              instead  of  binary.  After the repair, the <b>-t</b> option of <u>unzip</u> may show that some files have a
              bad CRC. Such files cannot be recovered; you can remove them from the  archive  using  the  <b>-d</b>
              option of <u>zip</u>.

       <b>-g</b>     Grow  (append  to) the specified <u>zip</u> archive, instead of creating a new one. If this operation
              fails, <u>zip</u> attempts to restore the archive to its original state. If  the  restoration  fails,
              the archive might become corrupted. This option is ignored when there's no existing archive or
              when at least one archive member must be updated or deleted.

       <b>-h</b>     Display the <u>zip</u> help information (this also appears if <u>zip</u> is run with no arguments).

       <b>-i</b> <b>files</b>
              Include only the specified files, as in:

                     zip -r foo . -i \*.c

              which will include only the files that end in .c in the current directory and its  subdirecto-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ries.&nbsp;subdirectories.</font>
              ries. (Note for PKZIP users: the equivalent command is

                     pkzip -rP foo *.c

              PKZIP  does  not  allow  recursion  in directories other than the current one.)  The backslash
              avoids the shell filename substitution, so that the name matching is performed by <u>zip</u>  at  all
              directory  levels.   Not escaping wildcards on shells that do wildcard substitution before <u>zip</u>
              gets the command line may seem to work but files in subdirectories matching the  pattern  will
              never  be  checked and so not matched.  For shells, such as Win32 command prompts, that do not
              replace file patterns containing wildcards with the respective file names,  <u>zip</u>  will  do  the
              recursion and escaping the wildcards is not needed.

              Also possible:

                     zip -r foo  . -i@include.lst

              which  will  only include the files in the current directory and its subdirectories that match
              the patterns in the file include.lst, one file pattern per line.

       <b>-I</b>     [Acorn RISC OS] Don't scan through Image files.  When used, <u>zip</u> will not consider Image  files
              (eg.  DOS  partitions  or Spark archives when SparkFS is loaded) as directories but will store
              them as single files.

              For example, if you have SparkFS loaded, zipping a Spark archive will result in a zipfile con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">taining&nbsp;containing</font>
              taining a directory (and its content) while using the 'I' option will result in a zipfile con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">taining&nbsp;containing</font>
              taining a Spark archive. Obviously this second case will also be  obtained  (without  the  'I'
              option) if SparkFS isn't loaded.

       <b>-j</b>     Store  just  the  name  of  a saved file (junk the path), and do not store directory names. By
              default, <u>zip</u> will store the full path (relative to the current path).

       <b>-jj</b>    [MacOS] record Fullpath (+ Volname). The complete path including volume  will  be  stored.  By
              default the relative path will be stored.

       <b>-J</b>     Strip any prepended data (e.g. a SFX stub) from the archive.

       <b>-k</b>     Attempt  to  convert  the  names and paths to conform to MSDOS, store only the MSDOS attribute
              (just the user write attribute from UNIX), and mark the entry as made under MSDOS (even though
              it was not); for compatibility with PKUNZIP under MSDOS which cannot handle certain names such
              as those with two dots.

       <b>-l</b>     Translate the Unix end-of-line character LF into the  MSDOS  convention  CR  LF.  This  option
              should  not  be  used  on  binary  files.   This option can be used on Unix if the zip file is
              intended for PKUNZIP under MSDOS. If the input files already contain CR LF, this  option  adds
              an  extra  CR.  This ensures that <u>unzip</u> <u>-a</u> on Unix will get back an exact copy of the original
              file, to undo the effect of <u>zip</u> <u>-l</u>.  See the note on binary detection for <b>-ll</b> below.

       <b>-ll</b>    Translate the MSDOS end-of-line CR LF into Unix LF.  This option should not be used on  binary
              files  and  a  warning  will  be  issued when a file is converted that later is detected to be
              binary.  This option can be used on MSDOS if the zip file is intended for unzip under Unix.

              In Zip 2.31 and later, binary detection has been changed from a simple  percentage  of  binary
              characters  being  considered  binary to a more selective method that should consider files in
              many character sets, including <u>UTF-8</u>, that only include text characters in that character  set
              to be text.  This allows <u>unzip</u> <u>-a</u> to convert these files.

       <b>-L</b>     Display the <u>zip</u> license.

       <b>-m</b>     Move  the  specified  files  into  the <u>zip</u> archive; actually, this deletes the target directo-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ries/files&nbsp;directories/files</font>
              ries/files after making the specified <u>zip</u> archive. If a directory becomes empty after  removal
              of  the  files, the directory is also removed. No deletions are done until <u>zip</u> has created the
              archive without error.  This is useful for conserving disk space, but is potentially dangerous
              so  it is recommended to use it in combination with <b>-T</b> to test the archive before removing all
              input files.

       <b>-MM</b>    All input patterns must match at least one file and all input files found  must  be  readable.
              Normally  when an input pattern does not match a file the "name not matched" warning is issued
              and when an input file has been found but later is missing or not readable a  missing  or  not
              readable  warning  is issued.  In either case <u>zip</u> continues creating the archive, with missing
              or unreadable new files being skipped and files already in the  archive  remaining  unchanged.
              After  the  archive is created, if any files were not readable <u>zip</u> returns the OPEN error code
              (18 on most systems) instead of the normal success return (0 on most systems).  With <b>-MM</b>  set,
              <u>zip</u>  exits as soon as an input pattern is not matched (whenever the "name not matched" warning
              would be issued) or when an input file is not readable.  In either case <u>zip</u> exits with an OPEN
              error and no archive is created.

              This  option is useful when a known list of files is to be zipped so any missing or unreadable
              files will result in an error.  It is less useful when used with wildcards, but <u>zip</u> will still
              exit  with  an  error  if any input pattern doesn't match at least one file and if any matched
              files are unreadable.  If you want to create the archive anyway and only need to know if files
              were skipped, don't use <b>-MM</b> and just check the return code.

       <b>-n</b> <b>suffixes</b>
              Do  not attempt to compress files named with the given <b>suffixes</b>.  Such files are simply stored
              (0% compression) in the output zip file, so that <u>zip</u> doesn't waste its time trying to compress
              them.  The suffixes are separated by either colons or semicolons.  For example:

                     zip -rn .Z:.zip:.tiff:.gif:.snd  foo foo

              will  copy  everything  from  <u>foo</u> into <u>foo.zip</u>, but will store any files that end in <u>.Z</u>, <u>.zip</u>,
              <u>.tiff</u>, <u>.gif</u>, or <u>.snd</u> without trying to compress them (image and sound files often  have  their
              own specialized compression methods).  By default, <u>zip</u> does not compress files with extensions
              in the list <u>.Z:.zip:.zoo:.arc:.lzh:.arj.</u>  Such files are stored directly  in  the  output  ar-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">chive.&nbsp;archive.</font>
              chive.  The environment variable ZIPOPT can be used to change the default options. For example
              under Unix with csh:

                     setenv ZIPOPT "-n .gif:.zip"

              To attempt compression on all files, use:

                     zip -n : foo

              The maximum compression option <b>-9</b> also attempts compression on all files regardless of  exten-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion.&nbsp;extension.</font>
              sion.

              On Acorn RISC OS systems the suffixes are actually filetypes (3 hex digit format). By default,
              zip does not compress files with filetypes in the list DDC:D96:68E (i.e. Archives,  CFS  files
              and PackDir files).

       <b>-N</b>     [Amiga,  MacOS]  Save  Amiga  or  MacOS filenotes as zipfile comments. They can be restored by
              using the <b>-N</b> option of unzip. If <b>-c</b> is used also, you are prompted for comments only for those
              files that do not have filenotes.

       <b>-o</b>     Set  the  "last  modified" time of the <u>zip</u> archive to the latest (oldest) "last modified" time
              found among the entries in the <u>zip</u> archive.  This can be used without any other operations, if
              desired.  For example:

                     zip -o foo

              will change the last modified time of <u>foo.zip</u> to the latest time of the entries in <u>foo.zip</u>.

       <b>-P</b> <u>password</u>
              use  <u>password</u> to encrypt zipfile entries (if any).  <b>THIS</b> <b>IS</b> <b>INSECURE!</b>  Many multi-user operat-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;operating</font>
              ing systems provide ways for any user to see the current command line of any other user;  even
              on  stand-alone  systems there is always the threat of over-the-shoulder peeking.  Storing the
              plaintext password as part of a command line in an automated script is even  worse.   Whenever
              possible,  use the non-echoing, interactive prompt to enter passwords.  (And where security is
              truly important, use strong encryption such as Pretty Good Privacy instead of  the  relatively
              weak encryption provided by standard zipfile utilities.)

       <b>-q</b>     Quiet  mode;  eliminate  informational messages and comment prompts.  (Useful, for example, in
              shell scripts and background tasks).

       <b>-Qn</b>    [QDOS] store information about the file in the file header with n defined as
              bit  0: Don't add headers for any file
              bit  1: Add headers for all files
              bit  2: Don't wait for interactive key press on exit

       <b>-r</b>     Travel the directory structure recursively; for example:

                     zip -r foo.zip foo

              or a bit more concisely

                     zip -r foo foo

              In this case, all the files and directories in <u>foo</u> are saved in a <u>zip</u> archive  named  <u>foo.zip</u>,
              including  files  with  names  starting with ".", since the recursion does not use the shell's
              file-name substitution mechanism.  If you wish to include only a specific subset of the  files
              in  directory <u>foo</u> and its subdirectories, use the <b>-i</b> option to specify the pattern of files to
              be included.  You should not use <b>-r</b> with the name ".*", since that matches  ".."   which  will
              attempt to zip up the parent directory (probably not what was intended).

       <b>-R</b>     Travel the directory structure recursively starting at the current directory; for example:

                     zip -R foo '*.c'

              In  this  case,  all  the files matching *.c in the tree starting at the current directory are
              stored into a <u>zip</u> archive named <u>foo.zip</u>.  Note for PKZIP users: the equivalent command is

                     pkzip -rP foo *.c

       <b>-S</b>     [MSDOS, OS/2, WIN32 and ATARI] Include system and hidden files.
              [MacOS] Includes finder invisible files, which are ignored otherwise.

       <b>-t</b> <b>mmddyyyy</b>
              Do not operate on files modified prior to the specified date, where <u>mm</u> is the month (0-12), <u>dd</u>
              is  the day of the month (1-31), and <u>yyyy</u> is the year.  The <u>ISO</u> <u>8601</u> date format <u>yyyy-mm-dd</u> is
              also accepted.  For example:

                     zip -rt 12071991 infamy foo

                     zip -rt 1991-12-07 infamy foo

              will add all the files in <u>foo</u> and its subdirectories that were last modified  on  or  after  7
              December 1991, to the <u>zip</u> archive <u>infamy.zip</u>.

       <b>-tt</b> <b>mmddyyyy</b>
              Do not operate on files modified after or at the specified date, where <u>mm</u> is the month (0-12),
              <u>dd</u> is the day of the month (1-31), and <u>yyyy</u> is the year.  The <u>ISO</u> <u>8601</u> date format  <u>yyyy-mm-dd</u>
              is also accepted.  For example:

                     zip -rtt 11301995 infamy foo

                     zip -rtt 1995-11-30 infamy foo

              will  add all the files in <u>foo</u> and its subdirectories that were last modified before 30 Novem-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ber&nbsp;November</font>
              ber 1995, to the <u>zip</u> archive <u>infamy.zip</u>.

       <b>-T</b>     Test the integrity of the new zip file. If the check fails, the old zip file is unchanged  and
              (with the <b>-m</b> option) no input files are removed.

       <b>-u</b>     Replace  (update)  an  existing  entry  in  the  <u>zip</u> archive only if it has been modified more
              recently than the version already in the <u>zip</u> archive.  For example:

                     zip -u stuff *

              will add any new files in the current directory, and update any files which have been modified
              since  the <u>zip</u> archive <u>stuff.zip</u> was last created/modified (note that <u>zip</u> will not try to pack
              <u>stuff.zip</u> into itself when you do this).

              Note that the <b>-u</b> option with no arguments acts like the <b>-f</b> (freshen) option.

       <b>-v</b>     Verbose mode or print diagnostic version info.

              Normally, when applied to real operations, this option enables the display of a progress indi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cator&nbsp;indicator</font>
              cator  during  compression  and requests verbose diagnostic info about zipfile structure oddi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ties.&nbsp;oddities.</font>
              ties.

              When <b>-v</b> is the only command line argument, and either stdin or stdout is not redirected  to  a
              file, a diagnostic screen is printed. In addition to the help screen header with program name,
              version, and release date, some pointers to the  Info-ZIP  home  and  distribution  sites  are
              given.  Then, it shows information about the target environment (compiler type and version, OS
              version, compilation date and the enabled optional features used to create the <u>zip</u> executable.

       <b>-V</b>     [VMS]  Save  VMS file attributes and use portable form.  <u>zip</u> archives created with this option
              are truncated at EOF but still may not be usable on other systems depending on the file  types
              being zipped.

       <b>-VV</b>    [VMS] Save VMS file attributes.  <u>zip</u> archives created with this option include the entire file
              and should be able to recreate most VMS files on VMS systems but these archives will generally
              not be usable on other systems.

       <b>-w</b>     [VMS]  Append  the  version  number  of  the files to the name, including multiple versions of
              files.  (default: use only the most recent version of a specified file).

       <b>-x</b> <b>files</b>
              Explicitly exclude the specified files, as in:

                     zip -r foo foo -x \*.o

              which will include the contents of <u>foo</u> in <u>foo.zip</u> while excluding all the files  that  end  in
              <u>.o</u>.   The  backslash avoids the shell filename substitution, so that the name matching is per-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">formed&nbsp;performed</font>
              formed by <u>zip</u> at all directory levels.  If you do not escape wildcards in patterns it may seem
              to work but files in subdirectories will not be checked for matches.

              Also possible:

                     zip -r foo foo -x@exclude.lst

              which will include the contents of <u>foo</u> in <u>foo.zip</u> while excluding all the files that match the
              patterns in the file exclude.lst (each file pattern on a separate line).

       <b>-X</b>     Do not save extra file attributes (Extended Attributes on OS/2,  uid/gid  and  file  times  on
              Unix).

       <b>-y</b>     Store  symbolic  links as such in the <u>zip</u> archive, instead of compressing and storing the file
              referred to by the link (UNIX only).

       <b>-z</b>     Prompt for a multi-line comment for the entire <u>zip</u> archive.  The comment is ended  by  a  line
              containing  just  a  period,  or  an end of file condition (^D on UNIX, ^Z on MSDOS, OS/2, and
              VMS).  The comment can be taken from a file:

                     zip -z foo &lt; foowhat

       <b>-#</b>     Regulate the speed of compression using the specified digit <u>#</u>, where <b>-0</b> indicates no  compres-
              sion  (store all files), <b>-1</b> indicates the fastest compression method (less compression) and <b>-9</b>
              indicates the slowest compression method (optimal compression, ignores the suffix  list).  The
              default compression level is <b>-6.</b>

       <b>-!</b>     [WIN32] Use priviliges (if granted) to obtain all aspects of WinNT security.

       <b>-@</b>     Take the list of input files from standard input. Only one filename per line.

       <b>-$</b>     [MSDOS,  OS/2, WIN32] Include the volume label for the drive holding the first file to be com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pressed.&nbsp;compressed.</font>
              pressed.  If you want to include only the volume label or to force a specific drive,  use  the
              drive name as first file name, as in:

                     zip -$ foo a: c:bar


<b>EXAMPLES</b>
       The simplest example:

              zip stuff *

       creates  the  archive  <u>stuff.zip</u>  (assuming  it does not exist) and puts all the files in the current
       directory in it, in compressed form (the <u>.zip</u> suffix is added automatically, unless that archive name
       given contains a dot already; this allows the explicit specification of other suffixes).

       Because of the way the shell does filename substitution, files starting with "." are not included; to
       include these as well:

              zip stuff .* *

       Even this will not include any subdirectories from the current directory.

       To zip up an entire directory, the command:

              zip -r foo foo

       creates the archive <u>foo.zip</u>, containing all the files and directories in the directory  <u>foo</u>  that  is
       contained within the current directory.

       You  may  want  to make a <u>zip</u> archive that contains the files in <u>foo</u>, without recording the directory
       name, <u>foo</u>.  You can use the <b>-j</b> option to leave off the paths, as in:

              zip -j foo foo/*

       If you are short on disk space, you might not have enough room to hold both  the  original  directory
       and  the  corresponding  compressed  <u>zip</u>  archive.  In this case, you can create the archive in steps
       using the <b>-m</b> option.  If <u>foo</u> contains the subdirectories <u>tom</u>, <u>dick</u>, and <u>harry</u>, you can:

              zip -rm foo foo/tom
              zip -rm foo foo/dick
              zip -rm foo foo/harry

       where the first command creates <u>foo.zip</u>, and the next two add to it.  At the completion of  each  <u>zip</u>
       command, the last created archive is deleted, making room for the next <u>zip</u> command to function.

<b>PATTERN</b> <b>MATCHING</b>
       This  section  applies  only  to  UNIX, though the ?, *, and [] special characters are implemented on
       other systems including MSDOS and Win32.  Watch this space for details on MSDOS and VMS operation.

       The UNIX shells <a href="sh.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/sh">(<u>sh</u>(1)</a> and <a href="csh.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/csh"><u>csh</u>(1)</a>) do filename substitution on command arguments.  The special  char-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">acters&nbsp;characters</font>
       acters are:

       <b>?</b>      match any single character

       <b>*</b>      match any number of characters (including none)

       <b>[]</b>     match any character in the range indicated within the brackets (example: [a-f], [0-9]).

       When  these  characters are encountered (without being escaped with a backslash or quotes), the shell
       will look for files relative to the current path that match the pattern,  and  replace  the  argument
       with a list of the names that matched.

       The  <u>zip</u>  program can do the same matching on names that are in the <u>zip</u> archive being modified or, in
       the case of the <b>-x</b> (exclude) or <b>-i</b> (include) options, on the list of files  to  be  operated  on,  by
       using  backslashes  or  quotes  to tell the shell not to do the name expansion.  In general, when <u>zip</u>
       encounters a name in the list of files to do, it first looks for the name in the file system.  If  it
       finds  it, it then adds it to the list of files to do.  If it does not find it, it looks for the name
       in the <u>zip</u> archive being modified (if it exists), using the  pattern  matching  characters  described
       above,  if  present.   For  each  match,  it will add that name to the list of files to be processed,
       unless this name matches one given with the <b>-x</b> option, or does not match any name given with  the  <b>-i</b>
       option.

       The  pattern  matching  includes the path, and so patterns like \*.o match names that end in ".o", no
       matter what the path prefix is.  Note that the backslash must precede every special  character  (i.e.
       ?*[]), or the entire argument must be enclosed in double quotes ("").

       In  general,  use backslash to make <u>zip</u> do the pattern matching with the <b>-f</b> (freshen) and <b>-d</b> (delete)
       options, and sometimes after the <b>-x</b> (exclude) option when used with an  appropriate  operation  (add,
       <b>-u</b>, <b>-f</b>, or <b>-d</b>).

       VMS interprets standard Unix (or PC) return values as other, scarier-looking things, so  <u>zip</u>  instead
       maps  them  into VMS-style status codes.  The current mapping is as follows:   1 (success) for normal
       exit,
        and (0x7fff000? + 16*normal_zip_exit_status) for all errors, where the `?' is 0  (warning)  for  <u>zip</u>
       value  12, 2 (error) for the <u>zip</u> values 3, 6, 7, 9, 13, 16, 18, and 4 (fatal error) for the remaining
       ones.

<b>BUGS</b>
       <u>zip</u> 2.32 is not compatible with PKUNZIP 1.10. Use <u>zip</u> 1.1 to produce <u>zip</u> files which can be extracted
       by PKUNZIP 1.10.

       <u>zip</u>  files  produced  by  <u>zip</u>  2.32  must  not  be  <u>updated</u> by <u>zip</u> 1.1 or PKZIP 1.10, if they contain
       encrypted members or if they have been produced in a pipe or on a non-seekable device. The  old  ver-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sions&nbsp;versions</font>
       sions  of  <u>zip</u>  or PKZIP would create an archive with an incorrect format.  The old versions can list
       the contents of the zip file but cannot extract it anyway (because of the new compression algorithm).
       If  you do not use encryption and use regular disk files, you do not have to care about this problem.

       Under VMS, not all of the odd file formats are treated properly.  Only stream-LF format <u>zip</u> files are
       expected  to  work with <u>zip</u>.  Others can be converted using Rahul Dhesi's BILF program.  This version
       of <u>zip</u> handles some of the conversion internally.  When using Kermit to transfer zip files  from  Vax
       to MSDOS, type "set file type block" on the Vax.  When transferring from MSDOS to Vax, type "set file
       type fixed" on the Vax.  In both cases, type "set file type binary" on MSDOS.

       Under VMS, zip hangs for file specification that uses DECnet syntax <u>foo::*.*.</u>

       On OS/2, <u>zip</u> cannot match some names, such as those including an exclamation mark  or  a  hash  sign.
       This  is  a  bug  in OS/2 itself: the 32-bit DosFindFirst/Next don't find such names.  Other programs
       such as GNU tar are also affected by this bug.

       Under OS/2, the amount of Extended Attributes displayed by DIR  is  (for  compatibility)  the  amount
       returned by the 16-bit version of DosQueryPathInfo(). Otherwise OS/2 1.3 and 2.0 would report differ-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ent&nbsp;different</font>
       ent EA sizes when DIRing a file.  However, the structure layout  returned  by  the  32-bit  DosQuery-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">PathInfo()&nbsp;DosQueryPathInfo()</font>
       PathInfo()  is a bit different, it uses extra padding bytes and link pointers (it's a linked list) to
       have all fields on 4-byte boundaries for portability to future  RISC  OS/2  versions.  Therefore  the
       value  reported  by  <u>zip</u>  (which  uses this 32-bit-mode size) differs from that reported by DIR.  <u>zip</u>
       stores the 32-bit format for portability, even the 16-bit MS-C-compiled version running on OS/2  1.3,
       so even this one shows the 32-bit-mode size.

       Development  of <u>zip</u> 3.0 and <u>unzip</u> 6.0 are underway.  See those source distributions for many new fea-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tures&nbsp;features</font>
       tures and the latest bug fixes.

       Thanks  to  R.  P.  Byrne for his <u>Shrink.Pas</u> program, which inspired this project, and from which the
       shrink algorithm was stolen; to Phil Katz for placing in the public domain the <u>zip</u> file format,  com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pression&nbsp;compression</font>
       pression  format, and .ZIP filename extension, and for accepting minor changes to the file format; to
       Steve Burg for clarifications on the deflate format; to Haruhiko Okumura and Leonid Broukhis for pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">viding&nbsp;providing</font>
       viding some useful ideas for the compression algorithm; to Keith Petersen, Rich Wales, Hunter Goatley
       and Mark Adler for providing a mailing list and <u>ftp</u> site for the Info-ZIP  group  to  use;  and  most
       importantly,  to  the  Info-ZIP  group itself (listed in the file <u>infozip.who</u>) without whose tireless
       testing and bug-fixing efforts a portable <u>zip</u> would not have been possible.  Finally we should  thank
       (blame)  the  first  Info-ZIP moderator, David Kirschbaum, for getting us into this mess in the first
       place.  The manual page was rewritten for UNIX by R. P. C. Rodgers.
