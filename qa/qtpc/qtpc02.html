We need to compress for timedirection. Is there a way to remove the noise?<br><br><font size="+4">A</font>  The temporal quality should be set to normal (512 or less) for the initial compression value. Sequences with minimal to moderate motion should obtain adequate compression at the 'normal' setting. Sequences with large amounts ofmotion probably need to have the compression settings adjusted to a settingbelow normal. If the compression ratio is not adequate at the normal level, itshould be set somewhere between low and normal and adjusted up or down untilthe desired bandwidth result is obtained.<p>As the temporal quality is decreased, the bandwidth of the sequence willdecrease also. However, decreasing the temporal quality increases the number ofartifacts (blocks and/or streaks) in the image.</p><p>In your case, adding temporal compression is apparently increasing the noiselevel. The noise you're experiencing is probably the result of pixel levelvalues that change rapidly over time, causing a 'living' background of variouspixels that are constantly changing values. This could be due to tape quality,but if you are converting from a pure digital resource to QuickTime, tapequality issues are eliminated.</p><p>Make sure that the contrast levels are calibrated, so that black is black, andwhite is white. The more pixels you have with the same contrast level, the moreCinePak will adjust the values to similar or near-similar pixel values, whichcould cause additional noise.</p><p>Noise can also be generated by the background of the video image. For example,a constantly changing background, such as trees or grass moving in the wind,can cause noise due to the constantly changing pixels in the background. TheCinePak codec tries to adjust these constantly changing values to somethingnear average, causing pixel flashes.</p><p>Adding key frames to reduce the temporal values between the key frames shouldresult in better quality images. As you increase the size of the movie, youalso increase the bandwidth needed to load the movie.</p><p>You can use a combination of these techniques to deal with the noise, but asyou can probably tell, this is a tuning process, so the results you get willvary with the original images, making it difficult to predict your results inall cases.</p><!-- begin_date --><H4 ALIGN=center>[May 01 1995]</H4><!-- end_date --></td></tr></table></CENTER><!-- begin_footer_information -->	<table width="680" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
