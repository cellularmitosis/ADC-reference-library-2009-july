<H1>Appendix B - <A NAME=MARKER-9-72></A> Result Codes</H1>
 This appendix lists the result codes that Open Transport (preferred-C) functions return, as shown in <A HREF=#MARKER-9-1>Table B-1</A>. For information about XTI result codes, refer to the X/Open Transport Interface specification.<A NAME=MARKER-2-73></A> <P><BR>

<TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING=3>
<TH>Result code<TH>Value&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<TH>Meaning<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-2></A><CODE>kOTNoError</CODE><TD>0<TD>The function completed execution without error.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-3></A><CODE>kOTBadAddressErr</CODE><TD>-3150<TD>The specified protocol address was in an incorrect format or contained illegal information. For TCP/IP this means that the address does not exist in the specified domain.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-4></A><CODE>kOTBadOptionErr</CODE><TD>-3151<TD>The specified protocol options were in an incorrect format or contained illegal information.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-5></A><CODE>kOTAccessErr</CODE><TD>-3152<TD>You do not have permission to negotiate the specified address or options.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-6></A><CODE>kOTBadReferenceErr</CODE><TD>-3153<TD>The specified provider reference does not refer to a valid provider.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-7></A><CODE>kOTNoAddressErr</CODE><TD>-3154<TD>You failed to supply an address, or the endpoint could not allocate an address. <TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-8></A><CODE>kOTOutStateErr</CODE><TD>-3155<TD>The endpoint was not in an appropriate state when you called this function. <TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-9></A><CODE>kOTBadSequenceErr</CODE><TD>-3156<TD>You specified an invalid sequence number or a <CODE>NULL</CODE> pointer for the <CODE>call</CODE> parameter when rejecting a connection request.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-10></A><CODE>kOTLookErr</CODE><TD>-3158<TD>An asynchronous event has occurred. If the event has occurred for an endpoint, you can use the <CODE>OTLook</CODE> function to find out what event it was; your notifier function will also get an asynchronous event. If the event has occurred for a provider other than an endpoint, the notifier function installed for that provider must handle the asynchronous event.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-11></A><CODE>kOTBadDataErr</CODE><TD>-3159<TD>The amount of data you specified was not within the bounds allowed by the endpoint.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-12></A><CODE>kOTBufferOverflowErr</CODE><TD>-3160<TD>The buffer you allocated to store information when this function returns is not sufficiently large to store the incoming data. <TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-13></A><CODE>kOTFlowErr</CODE><TD>-3161<TD>The endpoint is in asynchronous mode, but the flow-control mechanism prevents the endpoint from accepting or sending any data at this time.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-14></A><CODE>kOTNoDataErr</CODE><TD>-3162<TD>For an endpoint or mapper, this result is returned when you try to read data but the endpoint is in asynchronous, or is in nonblocking mode, and no data is currently available. <P>For a mapper, this result is returned by the <CODE>OTLookupName</CODE> function when no names are found.&nbsp;<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-15></A><CODE>kOTNoDisconnectErr</CODE><TD>-3163<TD>No disconnection indication is available.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-16></A><CODE>kOTNoUDErrErr</CODE><TD>-3164<TD>No unit data error indication currently exists on this endpoint.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-17></A><CODE>kOTBadFlagErr</CODE><TD>-3165<TD>You specified an invalid flag value.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-18></A><CODE>kOTNoReleaseErr</CODE><TD>-3166<TD>No orderly release indication currently exists on this endpoint.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-19></A><CODE>kOTNotSupportedErr</CODE><TD>-3167<TD>This action is not supported by this endpoint.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-20></A><CODE>kOTStateChangeErr</CODE><TD>-3168<TD>The endpoint is undergoing a transient state change. This error is returned when you call a function while an endpoint is in the process of changing states. You should wait for an event indicating the endpoint has finished changing state and call the function again. (Note that the equivalent XTI state-change error code, <CODE>TSTATECHNG</CODE>, is not described in the 1992 X/Open XTI specification.) The provider also returns this error if you attempt to call an "incompatible" function while another operation is still ongoing; for example if you call the function <CODE>OTSndUData</CODE> while a call to the <CODE>OTOptionManagement</CODE> function is still outstanding.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-21></A><CODE>kOTStructureTypeErr</CODE><TD>-3169<TD>You specified an unsupported structure type for the <CODE>structType</CODE> parameter of the <CODE>OTAlloc</CODE> or <CODE>OTFree</CODE> function. This error is also returned when the <CODE>structType</CODE> structure you specify is inconsistent with the endpoint type.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-22></A><CODE>kOTBadNameErr</CODE><TD>-3170<TD>You specified an invalid endpoint name. This error is returned by the TCP/IP domain name resolver (DNR) if you specify a bad host name.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-23></A><CODE>kOTBadQLenErr</CODE><TD>-3171<TD>You are using this endpoint to listen for connection requests, but when you bound the endpoint, you specified 0 for the <CODE>qlen</CODE> field. If you want to use an endpoint to listen for connection requests, the value of the <CODE>qlen</CODE> field must be greater than 0. <TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-24></A><CODE>kOTAddressBusyErr</CODE><TD>-3172<TD>As a return value for a call to the <CODE>OTBind</CODE> function, this error code indicates one of the following conditions: 1) no dynamic addresses are available for protocols or configuration methods that allow dynamic addressing, 2) you are attempting to bind two connectionless endpoints to the same address, or 3) you are attempting to bind two connection-oriented endpoints to the same address and with a <CODE>qlen</CODE> field greater than 0.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-25></A><CODE>kOTIndOutErr</CODE><TD>-3173<TD>There are outstanding connection indications on the endpoint, and you are accepting a connection on this endpoint. When accepting a connection on an endpoint that is listening for connection requests, you must have responded to all outstanding requests either by rejecting them with the <CODE>OTSndDisconnect</CODE> function or by accepting them with the <CODE>OTAccept</CODE> function.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-26></A><CODE>kOTProviderMismatchErr</CODE><TD>-3174<TD>The endpoint that is to accept the connection is not the same kind of endpoint as the endpoint listening for the connection. The listening and accepting endpoints must be the same kind.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-27></A><CODE>kOTResQLenErr</CODE><TD>-3175<TD>When this endpoint was bound, the <CODE>qlen</CODE> field was set to a value greater than 0. But to accept a connection on an alternate endpoint that is bound to the same address, such as this one, the endpoint must be bound with a <CODE>qlen</CODE> parameter equal to 0.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-28></A><CODE>kOTResAddressErr</CODE><TD>-3176<TD>The address to which this endpoint is bound differs from that of the endpoint that received the connection request; thus, this endpoint cannot accept this connection request.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-29></A><CODE>kOTQFullErr</CODE><TD>-3177<TD>The maximum number of outstanding indications, as specified by the value of the <CODE>qlen</CODE> field you used when you bound the endpoint, has been reached for the endpoint.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-30></A><CODE>kOTProtocolErr</CODE><TD>-3178<TD>An unspecified protocol error occurred. This is usually fatal. Normal recovery is to close the provider.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-31></A><CODE>kOTBadSyncErr</CODE><TD>-3179<TD>You attempted a synchronous call at hardware or deferred task level, or you made an Open Transport call at hardware interrupt time. Note that Open Transport cannot always detect this condition, so you cannot rely on getting this error. If undetected, your system could crash. <TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-32></A><CODE>kOTCanceledErr</CODE><TD>-3180<TD>A provider function never finished executing because the provider was closed or because the function was synchronous and synchronous functions were cancelled.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-33></A><CODE>kOTNotFoundErr</CODE><A NAME=MARKER-15-34></A><CODE>kENOENTErr</CODE><TD>-3201<TD>Requested information does not exist.<P>This error literally means no such file or directory. In XTI (and Open Transport), a function returns this result when you try to open an endpoint or mapper that does not exist in the system, or to operate on any other entity that was not found.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-35></A><CODE>kENIOErr</CODE><TD>-3204<TD>An I/O error occurred.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-36></A><CODE>kENXIOErr</CODE><TD>-3205<TD>No such device or address. <TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-37></A><CODE>kEBADFErr</CODE><TD>-3208<TD>The provider reference or stream reference supplied to the function was not valid.<TR>
<TD><CODE><A NAME=MARKER-15-38></A><CODE>kEAGAINErr</CODE><TD>-3210<TD>A provider is in non-blocking mode and cannot perform this operation now; Open Transport would have to block to complete the request. Try again later.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-39></A><CODE>kENOMEMErr</CODE><A NAME=MARKER-15-40></A><CODE>kOTOutOfMemoryErr</CODE><TD>-3211<TD>Open Transport cannot allocate enough memory to meet your request.<P>Open Transport has run out of internal memory. This might happen, for example, if you are doing a lot of asynchronous sends and not acknowledging sends, which means that Open Transport has to copy the data being sent into its own internal buffers.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-41></A><CODE>kEBUSYErr</CODE><TD>-3215<TD>The device you are trying to access is busy and could not complete your request.<TR>
<TD><CODE><A NAME=MARKER-15-43></A><A NAME=MARKER-15-43></A><CODE>kOTDuplicateFoundErr</CODE><TD>-3216<TD>You are attempting to register a port or other entity that already exists.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-44></A><CODE>kEINVALErr</CODE><TD>-3221<TD>You attempted an invalid operation, or you passed an invalid parameter.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-46></A><CODE>kEDEADLKErr</CODE><TD>-3234<TD>In order to complete the requested operation, the endpoint provider would have to block, and the endpoint is in nonblocking mode.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-47></A><CODE>kEADDRINUSEErr</CODE><TD>-3247<TD>The address is in use and is not available for the current function.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-48></A><CODE>kEADDRNOTAVAILErr</CODE><TD>-3248<TD>The address is not available or the requested address is not appropriate for the current function because the function requires a multicast address.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-49></A><CODE>kENETDOWNErr</CODE><TD>-3249<TD>TCP/IP error. The path to a network number is currently unavailable.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-50></A><CODE>kENETUNREACHErr</CODE><TD>-3250<TD>TCP/IP error. The path to a network number does not exist.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-51></A><CODE>kENETRESETErr</CODE><TD>-3251<TD>Unknown.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-52></A><CODE>kECONNABORTEDErr</CODE><TD>-3252<TD>Unknown.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-53></A><CODE>kECONNRESETErr</CODE><TD>-3253<TD>The connection was reset, possibly due to a problem with security and authentication. <TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-54></A><CODE>kENOBUFSErr</CODE><TD>-3254<TD>The operation failed because no buffer space was available.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-55></A><CODE>kEISCONNErr</CODE><TD>-3255<TD>Reserved.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-56></A><CODE>kENOTCONNErr</CODE><TD>-3256<TD>Reserved.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-57></A><CODE>kESHUTDOWNErr</CODE><TD>-3257<TD>An operation was aborted because the machine is shutting down. This error code is also used by sockets.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-58></A><CODE>kETOOMANYREFSErr</CODE><TD>-3258<TD>Unused error code.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-59></A><CODE>kETIMEDOUTErr</CODE><TD>-3259<TD>The requested operation timed out.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-60></A><CODE>kECONNREFUSEDErr</CODE><TD>-3260<TD>TCP/IP error code. The port is unreachable (as opposed to the host being unreachable).<P>The positive version of this error code (<CODE>kECONNREFUSED</CODE>) is returned by Open Transport as a reason code in a disconnect message, indicating that the other side refused the connection.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-61></A><CODE>kEHOSTDOWNErr</CODE><TD>-3263<TD>TCP/IP error. A host address is currently unavailable.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-62></A><CODE>kEHOSTUNREACHErr</CODE><TD>-3264<TD>TCP/IP error. A host address cannot be reached.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-63></A><CODE>kEPROTOErr</CODE><TD>-3269<TD>A catastrophic error has occurred which probably renders the underlying stream unusable. This error is the same as the <CODE>kTPROTOErr</CODE>, but is used where an XTI error code is not appropriate.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-64></A><CODE>kETIMEErr</CODE><TD>-3270<TD>An <CODE>Ioctl</CODE>command has timed out instead of completing normally.<TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-65></A><CODE>kENOSRErr</CODE><TD>-3271<TD>Open Transport cannot allocate enough system resources (usually stream messages) to meet your request. <A NAME=MARKER-2-66></A><TR>
<TD><A NAME=MARKER-15-67></A><CODE>kOTClientNotInittedErr</CODE><TD>-3279<TD>The client has not called the <CODE>InitOpenTransport</CODE> function or the <CODE>InitOpenTransportUtilities</CODE> function.<TR>
<TD><CODE>kOTPortHasDiedErr</CODE><TD>-3280<TD>Your notifier is sent the event <CODE>kOTProviderIsClosed</CODE> and returns this result code if a port that your provider is using is disabled because it was unregistered.<TR>
