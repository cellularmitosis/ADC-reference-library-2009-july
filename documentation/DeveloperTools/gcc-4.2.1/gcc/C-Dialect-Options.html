<h3 class="section">3.4 Options Controlling C Dialect</h3>

<p><a name="index-dialect-options-96"></a><a name="index-language-dialect-options-97"></a><a name="index-options_002c-dialect-98"></a>
The following options control the dialect of C (or languages derived
from C, such as C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++) that the compiler
accepts:

     
<a name="index-ANSI-support-99"></a>
<a name="index-ISO-support-100"></a>
<dl><dt><code>-ansi</code><dd><a name="index-ansi-101"></a>In C mode, support all ISO C90 programs.  In C++ mode,
remove GNU extensions that conflict with ISO C++.

     <p>This turns off certain features of GCC that are incompatible with ISO
C90 (when compiling C code), or of standard C++ (when compiling C++ code),
such as the <code>asm</code> and <code>typeof</code> keywords, and
predefined macros such as <code>unix</code> and <code>vax</code> that identify the
type of system you are using.  It also enables the undesirable and
rarely used ISO trigraph feature.  For the C compiler,
it disables recognition of C++ style `<samp><span class="samp">//</span></samp>' comments as well as
the <code>inline</code> keyword.

     <p>The alternate keywords <code>__asm__</code>, <code>__extension__</code>,
<code>__inline__</code> and <code>__typeof__</code> continue to work despite
<samp><span class="option">-ansi</span></samp>.  You would not want to use them in an ISO C program, of
course, but it is useful to put them in header files that might be included
in compilations done with <samp><span class="option">-ansi</span></samp>.  Alternate predefined macros
such as <code>__unix__</code> and <code>__vax__</code> are also available, with or
without <samp><span class="option">-ansi</span></samp>.

     <p>The <samp><span class="option">-ansi</span></samp> option does not cause non-ISO programs to be
rejected gratuitously.  For that, <samp><span class="option">-pedantic</span></samp> is required in
addition to <samp><span class="option">-ansi</span></samp>.  See <a href="Warning-Options.html#Warning-Options">Warning Options</a>.

     <p>The macro <code>__STRICT_ANSI__</code> is predefined when the <samp><span class="option">-ansi</span></samp>
option is used.  Some header files may notice this macro and refrain
from declaring certain functions or defining certain macros that the
ISO standard doesn't call for; this is to avoid interfering with any
programs that might use these names for other things.

     <p>Functions which would normally be built in but do not have semantics
defined by ISO C (such as <code>alloca</code> and <code>ffs</code>) are not built-in
functions with <samp><span class="option">-ansi</span></samp> is used.  See <a href="Other-Builtins.html#Other-Builtins">Other built-in functions provided by GCC</a>, for details of the functions
affected.

     <br><dt><code>-std=</code><dd><a name="index-std-102"></a>Determine the language standard.  This option is currently only
supported when compiling C or C++.  A value for this option must be
provided; possible values are

          <dl>
<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">c89</span></samp>'<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">iso9899:1990</span></samp>'<dd>ISO C90 (same as <samp><span class="option">-ansi</span></samp>).

          <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">iso9899:199409</span></samp>'<dd>ISO C90 as modified in amendment 1.

          <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">c99</span></samp>'<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">c9x</span></samp>'<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">iso9899:1999</span></samp>'<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">iso9899:199x</span></samp>'<dd>ISO C99.  Note that this standard is not yet fully supported; see
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.2/c99status.html">http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.2/c99status.html</a><!-- /@w --> for more information.  The
names `<samp><span class="samp">c9x</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">iso9899:199x</span></samp>' are deprecated.

          <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">gnu89</span></samp>'<dd>Default, ISO C90 plus GNU extensions (including some C99 features).

          <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">gnu99</span></samp>'<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">gnu9x</span></samp>'<dd>ISO C99 plus GNU extensions.  When ISO C99 is fully implemented in GCC,
this will become the default.  The name `<samp><span class="samp">gnu9x</span></samp>' is deprecated.

          <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">c++98</span></samp>'<dd>The 1998 ISO C++ standard plus amendments.

          <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">gnu++98</span></samp>'<dd>The same as <samp><span class="option">-std=c++98</span></samp> plus GNU extensions.  This is the
default for C++ code. 
</dl>

     <p>Even when this option is not specified, you can still use some of the
features of newer standards in so far as they do not conflict with
previous C standards.  For example, you may use <code>__restrict__</code> even
when <samp><span class="option">-std=c99</span></samp> is not specified.

     <p>The <samp><span class="option">-std</span></samp> options specifying some version of ISO C have the same
effects as <samp><span class="option">-ansi</span></samp>, except that features that were not in ISO C90
but are in the specified version (for example, `<samp><span class="samp">//</span></samp>' comments and
the <code>inline</code> keyword in ISO C99) are not disabled.

     <p>See <a href="Standards.html#Standards">Language Standards Supported by GCC</a>, for details of
these standard versions.

     <br><dt><code>-fgnu89-inline</code><dd><a name="index-fgnu89_002dinline-103"></a>The option <samp><span class="option">-fgnu89-inline</span></samp> tells GCC to use the traditional
GNU semantics for <code>inline</code> functions when in C99 mode. 
See <a href="Inline.html#Inline">An Inline Function is As Fast As a Macro</a>.  Using this
option is roughly equivalent to adding the <code>gnu_inline</code> function
attribute to all inline functions (see <a href="Function-Attributes.html#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>).

     <p>This option is accepted by GCC versions 4.1.3 and up.  In GCC versions
/* APPLE LOCAL extern inline */
prior to 4.3 (4.2 for Apple's gcc), C99 inline semantics are not supported, and thus this
option is effectively assumed to be present regardless of whether or not
it is specified; the only effect of specifying it explicitly is to
disable warnings about using inline functions in C99 mode.  Likewise,
the option <samp><span class="option">-fno-gnu89-inline</span></samp> is not supported in versions of
/* APPLE LOCAL extern inline */
GCC before 4.3 (4.2 for Apple's gcc).  It is supported only in C99 or gnu99 mode, not in
C89 or gnu89 mode.

     <p>The preprocesor macros <code>__GNUC_GNU_INLINE__</code> and
<code>__GNUC_STDC_INLINE__</code> may be used to check which semantics are
in effect for <code>inline</code> functions.  See <a href="../cpp/Common-Predefined-Macros.html#Common-Predefined-Macros">Common Predefined Macros</a>.

     <br><dt><code>-aux-info </code><var>filename</var><dd><a name="index-aux_002dinfo-104"></a>Output to the given filename prototyped declarations for all functions
declared and/or defined in a translation unit, including those in header
files.  This option is silently ignored in any language other than C.

     <p>Besides declarations, the file indicates, in comments, the origin of
each declaration (source file and line), whether the declaration was
implicit, prototyped or unprototyped (`<samp><span class="samp">I</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">N</span></samp>' for new or
`<samp><span class="samp">O</span></samp>' for old, respectively, in the first character after the line
number and the colon), and whether it came from a declaration or a
definition (`<samp><span class="samp">C</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">F</span></samp>', respectively, in the following
character).  In the case of function definitions, a K&amp;R-style list of
arguments followed by their declarations is also provided, inside
comments, after the declaration.

     <!-- APPLE LOCAL begin AltiVec -->
<br><dt><code>-faltivec</code><dd>This flag is provided for compatibility with Metrowerks CodeWarrior and MrC
compilers as well as previous Apple versions of GCC.  It causes the
<samp><span class="option">-mpim-altivec</span></samp> option to be turned on. 
<!-- APPLE LOCAL end AltiVec -->

     <!-- APPLE LOCAL begin CW asm blocks -->
<br><dt><code>-fasm-blocks</code><dd>Enable the use of blocks and entire functions of assembly code within
a C or C++ file.  The syntax follows that used in CodeWarrior. (APPLE
ONLY)
<!-- APPLE LOCAL end CW asm blocks -->

     <br><dt><code>-fno-asm</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dasm-105"></a>Do not recognize <code>asm</code>, <code>inline</code> or <code>typeof</code> as a
keyword, so that code can use these words as identifiers.  You can use
the keywords <code>__asm__</code>, <code>__inline__</code> and <code>__typeof__</code>
instead.  <samp><span class="option">-ansi</span></samp> implies <samp><span class="option">-fno-asm</span></samp>.

     <p>In C++, this switch only affects the <code>typeof</code> keyword, since
<code>asm</code> and <code>inline</code> are standard keywords.  You may want to
use the <samp><span class="option">-fno-gnu-keywords</span></samp> flag instead, which has the same
effect.  In C99 mode (<samp><span class="option">-std=c99</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-std=gnu99</span></samp>), this
switch only affects the <code>asm</code> and <code>typeof</code> keywords, since
<code>inline</code> is a standard keyword in ISO C99.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-builtin</code><dt><code>-fno-builtin-</code><var>function</var><dd><a name="index-fno_002dbuiltin-106"></a><a name="index-built_002din-functions-107"></a>Don't recognize built-in functions that do not begin with
`<samp><span class="samp">__builtin_</span></samp>' as prefix.  See <a href="Other-Builtins.html#Other-Builtins">Other built-in functions provided by GCC</a>, for details of the functions affected,
including those which are not built-in functions when <samp><span class="option">-ansi</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="option">-std</span></samp> options for strict ISO C conformance are used because they
do not have an ISO standard meaning.

     <p>GCC normally generates special code to handle certain built-in functions
more efficiently; for instance, calls to <code>alloca</code> may become single
instructions that adjust the stack directly, and calls to <code>memcpy</code>
may become inline copy loops.  The resulting code is often both smaller
and faster, but since the function calls no longer appear as such, you
cannot set a breakpoint on those calls, nor can you change the behavior
of the functions by linking with a different library.  In addition,
when a function is recognized as a built-in function, GCC may use
information about that function to warn about problems with calls to
that function, or to generate more efficient code, even if the
resulting code still contains calls to that function.  For example,
warnings are given with <samp><span class="option">-Wformat</span></samp> for bad calls to
<code>printf</code>, when <code>printf</code> is built in, and <code>strlen</code> is
known not to modify global memory.

     <p>With the <samp><span class="option">-fno-builtin-</span><var>function</var></samp> option
only the built-in function <var>function</var> is
disabled.  <var>function</var> must not begin with `<samp><span class="samp">__builtin_</span></samp>'.  If a
function is named this is not built-in in this version of GCC, this
option is ignored.  There is no corresponding
<samp><span class="option">-fbuiltin-</span><var>function</var></samp> option; if you wish to enable
built-in functions selectively when using <samp><span class="option">-fno-builtin</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="option">-ffreestanding</span></samp>, you may define macros such as:

     <pre class="smallexample">          #define abs(n)          __builtin_abs ((n))
          #define strcpy(d, s)    __builtin_strcpy ((d), (s))
     </pre>
     <br><dt><code>-fhosted</code><dd><a name="index-fhosted-108"></a><a name="index-hosted-environment-109"></a>
Assert that compilation takes place in a hosted environment.  This implies
<samp><span class="option">-fbuiltin</span></samp>.  A hosted environment is one in which the
entire standard library is available, and in which <code>main</code> has a return
type of <code>int</code>.  Examples are nearly everything except a kernel. 
This is equivalent to <samp><span class="option">-fno-freestanding</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-ffreestanding</code><dd><a name="index-ffreestanding-110"></a><a name="index-hosted-environment-111"></a>
Assert that compilation takes place in a freestanding environment.  This
implies <samp><span class="option">-fno-builtin</span></samp>.  A freestanding environment
is one in which the standard library may not exist, and program startup may
not necessarily be at <code>main</code>.  The most obvious example is an OS kernel. 
This is equivalent to <samp><span class="option">-fno-hosted</span></samp>.

     <p>See <a href="Standards.html#Standards">Language Standards Supported by GCC</a>, for details of
freestanding and hosted environments.

     <br><dt><code>-fopenmp</code><dd><a name="index-fopenmp-112"></a><a name="index-openmp-parallel-113"></a>Enable handling of OpenMP directives <code>#pragma omp</code> in C/C++ and
<code>!$omp</code> in Fortran.  When <samp><span class="option">-fopenmp</span></samp> is specified, the
compiler generates parallel code according to the OpenMP Application
Program Interface v2.5 <a href="http://www.openmp.org/">http://www.openmp.org/</a><!-- /@w -->.

     <br><dt><code>-fms-extensions</code><dd><a name="index-fms_002dextensions-114"></a>Accept some non-standard constructs used in Microsoft header files.

     <p>Some cases of unnamed fields in structures and unions are only
accepted with this option.  See <a href="Unnamed-Fields.html#Unnamed-Fields">Unnamed struct/union fields within structs/unions</a>, for details.

     <br><dt><code>-trigraphs</code><dd><a name="index-trigraphs-115"></a>Support ISO C trigraphs.  The <samp><span class="option">-ansi</span></samp> option (and <samp><span class="option">-std</span></samp>
options for strict ISO C conformance) implies <samp><span class="option">-trigraphs</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-no-integrated-cpp</code><dd><a name="index-no_002dintegrated_002dcpp-116"></a>Performs a compilation in two passes: preprocessing and compiling.  This
option allows a user supplied "cc1", "cc1plus", or "cc1obj" via the
<samp><span class="option">-B</span></samp> option.  The user supplied compilation step can then add in
an additional preprocessing step after normal preprocessing but before
compiling.  The default is to use the integrated cpp (internal cpp)

     <p>The semantics of this option will change if "cc1", "cc1plus", and
"cc1obj" are merged.

     <p><a name="index-traditional-C-language-117"></a><a name="index-C-language_002c-traditional-118"></a><br><dt><code>-traditional</code><dt><code>-traditional-cpp</code><dd><a name="index-traditional_002dcpp-119"></a><a name="index-traditional-120"></a>Formerly, these options caused GCC to attempt to emulate a pre-standard
C compiler.  They are now only supported with the <samp><span class="option">-E</span></samp> switch. 
The preprocessor continues to support a pre-standard mode.  See the GNU
CPP manual for details.

     <br><dt><code>-fcond-mismatch</code><dd><a name="index-fcond_002dmismatch-121"></a>Allow conditional expressions with mismatched types in the second and
third arguments.  The value of such an expression is void.  This option
is not supported for C++.

     <!-- APPLE LOCAL begin nested functions 4357979 -->
<br><dt><code>-fno-nested-functions</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dnested_002dfunctions-122"></a>Disable nested functions.  This option is not supported for C++ or
Objective-C++.  On Darwin, nested functions are disabled by default. 
<!-- APPLE LOCAL end nested functions 4357979 -->

     <!-- APPLE LOCAL begin pch distcc -mrs -->
<br><dt><code>-fpch-preprocess</code><dd><a name="index-fpch_002dpreprocess-123"></a>Enable PCH processing even when <samp><span class="option">-E</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-save-temps</span></samp> is used. 
<!-- APPLE LOCAL end pch distcc -mrs -->

     <!-- APPLE LOCAL begin non lvalue assign -->
<br><dt><code>-fnon-lvalue-assign</code><dd><a name="index-fnon_002dlvalue_002dassign-124"></a>C and C++ forbid the use of casts and conditional expressions as lvalues, e.g.:

     <pre class="smallexample">          float *p, q, r;
          ((int *)p)++;
          (cond ? q : r) = 3.0;
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">As a transitional measure, the Apple version of GCC 4.0 allows casts and
conditional expressions to be used as lvalues in certain situations.  This
is accomplished via the <samp><span class="option">-fnon-lvalue-assign</span></samp> switch, which is on
by default.  Whenever an lvalue cast or an lvalue conditional expression is
encountered, the compiler will issue a deprecation warning and then rewrite
the expression as follows:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (type)expr                ---becomes---&gt;      *(type *)&amp;expr
          cond ? expr1 : expr2      ---becomes---&gt;      *(cond ? &amp;expr1 : &amp;expr2)
     </pre>
     <p>To disallow lvalue casts and lvalue conditional expressions altogether,
specify <samp><span class="option">-fno-non-lvalue-assign</span></samp>; lvalue casts and lvalue conditional
expressions will be disallowed in future versions of Apple's GCC. 
<!-- APPLE LOCAL end non lvalue assign -->

     <br><dt><code>-funsigned-char</code><dd><a name="index-funsigned_002dchar-125"></a>Let the type <code>char</code> be unsigned, like <code>unsigned char</code>.

     <p>Each kind of machine has a default for what <code>char</code> should
be.  It is either like <code>unsigned char</code> by default or like
<code>signed char</code> by default.

     <p>Ideally, a portable program should always use <code>signed char</code> or
<code>unsigned char</code> when it depends on the signedness of an object. 
But many programs have been written to use plain <code>char</code> and
expect it to be signed, or expect it to be unsigned, depending on the
machines they were written for.  This option, and its inverse, let you
make such a program work with the opposite default.

     <p>The type <code>char</code> is always a distinct type from each of
<code>signed char</code> or <code>unsigned char</code>, even though its behavior
is always just like one of those two.

     <br><dt><code>-fsigned-char</code><dd><a name="index-fsigned_002dchar-126"></a>Let the type <code>char</code> be signed, like <code>signed char</code>.

     <p>Note that this is equivalent to <samp><span class="option">-fno-unsigned-char</span></samp>, which is
the negative form of <samp><span class="option">-funsigned-char</span></samp>.  Likewise, the option
<samp><span class="option">-fno-signed-char</span></samp> is equivalent to <samp><span class="option">-funsigned-char</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fsigned-bitfields</code><dt><code>-funsigned-bitfields</code><dt><code>-fno-signed-bitfields</code><dt><code>-fno-unsigned-bitfields</code><dd><a name="index-fsigned_002dbitfields-127"></a><a name="index-funsigned_002dbitfields-128"></a><a name="index-fno_002dsigned_002dbitfields-129"></a><a name="index-fno_002dunsigned_002dbitfields-130"></a>These options control whether a bit-field is signed or unsigned, when the
declaration does not use either <code>signed</code> or <code>unsigned</code>.  By
default, such a bit-field is signed, because this is consistent: the
basic integer types such as <code>int</code> are signed types.

     <!-- APPLE LOCAL begin constant cfstrings -->
<br><dt><code>-fconstant-cfstrings</code><dd><a name="index-fconstant_002dcfstrings-131"></a>Enable the automatic creation of a CoreFoundation-type constant string
whenever a special builtin <code>__builtin__CFStringMakeConstantString</code>
is called on a literal string.  (APPLE ONLY)
<!-- APPLE LOCAL end constant cfstrings -->

     <!-- APPLE LOCAL begin radar 3506309 -->
<br><dt><code>-Wnonportable-cfstrings</code><dd><a name="index-Wnonportable_002dcfstrings-132"></a>Warn if constant CFString objects contain non-portable characters
(default behavior)
<!-- APPLE LOCAL end radar 3506309 -->

     <!-- APPLE LOCAL begin fwritable strings. -->
<br><dt><code>-fwritable-strings</code><dd><a name="index-fwritable_002dstrings-133"></a>Store string constants in the writable data segment and don't uniquize
them.  This is for compatibility with old programs which assume they can
write into string constants.

     <p>Writing into string constants is a very bad idea; &ldquo;constants&rdquo; should
be constant.

     <p>This option is deprecated. 
<!-- APPLE LOCAL end fwritable strings. -->
