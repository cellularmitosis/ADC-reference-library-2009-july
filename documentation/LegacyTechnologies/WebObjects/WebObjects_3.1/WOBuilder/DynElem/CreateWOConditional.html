<P>A <U><A HREF="../../Reference/DynamicElements/WOConditional.html">WOConditional</A></U> displays its contents only if a particular condition is true. WOConditional's main attribute is <B>condition</B>. If <B>condition</B> is 1 (true), the WOConditional's contents are displayed. If <B>condition</B> is 0, the contents aren't displayed. <B>condition</B> can be bound to a variable or to method that returns the 1 or 0 value. The values <B>self</B> or <B>nil</B> also work in place of 1 or 0. 
<P>A WOConditional is like an if-then statement in a structured programming language. It tests to see if its condition is true, and if so, it displays its contents. If the condition is false, it displays nothing. 
<P>Many times, you want an "else" clause as well; that is, "if the condition is true, display this text; if not, display this other text." In such cases, you can make use of another WOConditional attribute: <B>negate</B>. If <B>negate</B> is 1, it means that the condition is negated after it is evaluated. Thus, if <B>negate</B> is 1 and <B>condition</B> returns 1, the contents are <I>not</I> displayed. To create an if-then-else style of conditional contents, do the following:


<OL>
<P><LI>Drag two WOConditionals onto the page.
<BR>
<P><LI>Select the first conditional and double-click a variable in the object browser. 
<BR>
<P><LI>Select the second conditional and double-click the same variable. 
<BR>
<P><LI>In the bindings inspector for the second WOConditional, select the <B>negate</B> attribute, type 1 in the text field in the bindings inspector, and click Connect.
<BR></OL>


<P>The example below is from a component named ReadWriteString. This component lets you set whether a displayed string is editable using the variable <B>editable</B>. If <B>editable</B> is 1, the component displays the WOTextField contained in the second conditional. The WOString from the first conditional is not displayed because the first conditional negates the value in <B>editable</B>. If <B>editable</B> is 0, the WOString is displayed but not the WOTextField.
