This sample demonstrates how to create a QuickTime movie with a video effect as a transition
from one picture to another. This project differs from the QTShowEffect sample code it is based 
on in that it allows the user to create the effect "by hand" e.g. without the aid of the standard 
QuickTime effects parameter dialog box. Instead, the program itself builds the correct effects 
parameter description atoms.

Here's a quick rundown of how the program works:

- First, a QuickTime movie with two video tracks is created - these two tracks will be used as 
sources for a explode video effect

- The effect description and sample description structures for the explode effect are created
	   
- An effects track and media are created and added to our movie for the explode effect

- The input map for the effect is created, and references for the two video tracks are added to 
this input map
		
To build the effects movie, simply build and launch the application. At the prompt, specify a location for the movie. The resulting movie, when played with any QuickTime capable player (such as QuickTime Player), will show the source track "B" growing from a single point and expanding out until it entirely covers source track "A".

QTEffects can be built for both the MacOS and Windows.

For Windows builds using Microsoft Visual C++, the project file automatically calls the QuickTime RezWack utility to embed the necessary Macintosh-style resources from the input file ApplicationResources into the application file QTEffects.exe. The ApplicationResources file must reside in the root directory of the project itself (note also the project file expects the RezWack tool to be in the QTDevWin directory as described in the SampleCodeREADME file in the QuickTime SDK).


Enjoy
