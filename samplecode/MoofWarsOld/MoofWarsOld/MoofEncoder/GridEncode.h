/*	File:		GridEncode.h	Contains:	This is just a very simple encoder that shows how to build GRID and TILE				resources.  The TILE resource is a set of 32x32x1 byte tiles.  This encoder				takes a picture and dices it into 32x32 tiles, which it writes out to output				file.  It then builds a standard grid, repeating the original picture as a 				pattern across the grid.		 			Eventually, it would be nice to make a program that lets someone graphically	 			edit the available list of tiles and the actual GRID resource, much like any 	 			number of map editors out for various games.		Written by: Timothy Carroll		Copyright:	Copyright © 1996-1999 by Apple Computer, Inc., All Rights Reserved.				You may incorporate this Apple sample source code into your program(s) without				restriction.
