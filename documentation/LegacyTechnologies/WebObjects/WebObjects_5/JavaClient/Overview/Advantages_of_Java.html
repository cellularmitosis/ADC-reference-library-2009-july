The two types have complementary strengthsand weaknesses.</font></p><br><table border = "1"><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande"><b><tr><td scope="row">Characteristic</td><td>Desktop Application</td><td>Web Application</td></tr></b></font><tr><td scope="row">Interactive</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td scope="row">Flexible controls</td><td>Yes </td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td scope="row">Rich user-interface paradigm</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td scope="row">Portable</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td scope="row">Easy to administer</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td scope="row">Accessible</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td scope="row">Secure</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td></tr></table><br><p><font face="Times">Desktop applications can typically draw upon user-interfaceframeworks that provide a varied and flexible set of controls, modaldialogs, and multiple windows. On the other hand, HTML has a limitedand static set of controls; most of them are forms, active images, andhyperlinks. </font></p><p><font face="Times">A Web application is, by definition, portable since it canrun on any client browser that implements certain standards andprotocols, regardless of the underlying system; desktop applicationsare usually limited to the platforms they were built for. Web applicationsalso have high marks for accessibility because they are designedto make it easy for users to get data on networks. Finally, becausesensitive data and business logic is confined to the server in Webapplications, they tend to be more secure.</font></p><p><font face="Times">Java scores high on each of these characteristics becauseit can have a strong presence on each side of the client-serverdivide.The principal advantage of Java is that it runs almost anywhere.The client need only have a compatible Java virtual machine (VM),something that most operating systems and browsers now include asa standard feature. Java applications can be designed to run onthe server or the client. Sun's AWT and "Java 2 platform, StandardEdition" (J2SE) packages provide a rich source of flexible, interactive controlsfor developers.</font></p><p><font face="Times">Thus the promise of Java is the best of both worlds. So whatare some distributed multi-tier Java-based architectures populartoday?</font></p><p><font face="Times">Client JDBC applications use a fat-client architecture. Customcode invokes JDBC on the client, which in turn goes through a driverto communicate with a JDBC proxy on the server; this proxy makesthe necessary client-library calls on the server. The shortcomings ofthis type of architecture are typical of all fat-client architectures.Security is a problem because the bytecodes on the client are easilydecompiled, leaving both sensitive data and business rules at risk.The server has to be open to allow all client operations withoutbeing able to control what the client is doing. In addition, suchan architecture doesn't scale; it is expensive to move data overthe channel to the client.</font></p><p><font face="Times">A JDBC three-tier application (with CORBA as the transport)is a big improvement over a client JDBC application. In this architecturethe client can be thin since all that is required on the clientside is the JFC, nonsensitive custom code (usually for managingthe user interface), and CORBA stubs for communicating with theserver. Sensitive business logic as well as logic related to databaseconnection are stored on the server. In addition, the server handlesall data-intensive computations.</font></p><p><font face="Times">The JDBC three-tier architecture has its own weaknesses. Firstit results in too much network traffic. Because this architectureuses proxy business objects on the client as handles to the realobjects on the server, each client request for an attribute is forwardedto the server, causing a separate round trip and precipitating amessage storm. Second, JDBC Three-tier requires developers to writemuch of the code themselves, from code for database access and datapackaging to code for user-interface synchronization and change tracking.Finally, JDBC three-tier does not provide much of the functionalityassociated with application servers, such as application monitoringand load balancing, nor does it provide HTML integration.</font></p><br>    <br><a href="Overview_of_Java_Client.html" target="_right"><img src="../Images/previous.gif" border="0" alt="Previous"></a><a href="Java_Client_Architecture.html" target="_right"><img src="../Images/next.gif" border="0" alt="Next"></a>&nbsp;<p><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="1">&#169; 2001 Apple Computer, Inc.</font></p><!-- start of footer --><!--#include virtual="/includes/framesetfooter" --><!-- end of footer --></body></html>
