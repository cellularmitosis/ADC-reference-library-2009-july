  <h3>Creating a 
  Subclass of EODelayedObserver</h3><P> EODelayedObserver implements the basic 
  objectWillChange method to simply enqueue the receiver on an 
  EODelayedObserverQueue. Regardless of how many of these messages the 
  receiver gets during the run loop, it receives a single subjectChanged 
  message from the queue at the end of the run loop. In this method the 
  delayed observer can check for changes and take whatever action is 
  necessary. Subclasses should record objects they're interested in and 
  examine them in subjectChanged . An EOAssociation.(EOInterface) for example
  , examines each of the EODisplayGroups (EOInterface) it's bound to in 
  order to find out what has changed. Another kind of subclass might record 
  each changed object for later examination by overriding objectWillChange , 
  but it must be sure to invoke super 's implementation when doing so. 
  <P>
  The rest of EODelayedObserver's methods have meaningful, if static, 
  default implementations. EODelayedObserverQueue sends change notifications 
  according to the priority of each enqueued observer. EODelayedObserver's 
  implementation of the priority method returns ObserverPriorityThird. The
  subclass can override it to return a higher or lower priority, or to have 
  a settable priority. The other method a subclass might override is 
  observerQueue , which returns a default EODelayedObserverQueue normally 
  shared by all EODelayedObservers. Because sharing a single queue keeps all 
  EODelayedObserver's synchronized according to their priority, you should 
  rarely override this method, doing so only if the subclass is involved 
  in a completely independent system. 
  <P>
  A final method, discardPendingNotification , need never be overridden by 
  subclasses, but must be invoked when a delayed observer is done observing 
  changes. This prevents observers from being sent change notifications 
  after they've been finalized. 
  <P>

  <h1><B>Tracking Enterprise Objects Changes</b></h1><P>
  EOControl provides four classes and an interface that form an efficient, 
  specialized mechanism for tracking changes to enterprise objects and for 
  managing the notification of those changes to interested observers. 
  EOObserverCenter is the central manager of change notification. It records 
  observers and the objects they observe, and it distributes notifications 
  when the observable objects change. Observers implement the EOObserving 
  interface, which defines one method, objectWillChange . Observable objects 
  (generally enterprise objects) invoke their willChange method before altering
  their state, which causes all observers to receive an objectWillChange message.
  <P>
  The other three classes add to the basic observation mechanism. 
  EODelayedObserverQueue alters the basic, synchronous change notification 
  mechanism by offering different priority levels, which allows observers to 
  specify the order in which they're notified of changes. EODelayedObserver 
  is an abstract superclass for objects that observe other objects (such as 
  the EOInterface layer's EOAssociation classes). Finally, EOObserverProxy 
  is a subclass of EODelayedObserver that forwards change messages to a target 
  object, allowing objects that don't inherit from EODelayedObserver to take 
  advantage of this mechanism. 
  <P>
  The major observer in Enterprise Objects Framework is EOEditingContext, 
  which implements its objectWillChange method to record a snapshot for the 
  object about to change, register undo operations in an NSUndoManager, and 
  record the changes needed to update objects in its EOObjectStore. Because 
  some of these actions such as examining the object's new state can only be 
  performed after the object has changed, an EOEditingContext sets up a 
  delayed message to itself, which it gets at the end of the run loop. 
  Observers that only need to examine an object after it has changed can 
  use the delayed observer mechanism, described in the EODelayedObserver 
  and EODelayedObserverQueue class specifications. 
  <P>
  EODelayedObserver is primarily used to implement the interface layer's 
  associations and wouldn't ordinarily be used outside the scope of a Java 
  Client or Application Kit application (not in a command line tool or 
  WebObjects application, for example).
