    This snippet is a sample GetNextEvent filter which uses the JGNEFilter mechanism     described in Tech Note #85 "GetNextEvent: Blinking Apple Menu".    The init, written in MPW assembler, installs a filter which SysBeeps whenever a     key is pressed with the shift key held down.    The jGNE mechanism is the only valid place where the event record can be examined     after a GetNextEvent call, since tail patching GetNextEvent breaks several aspects     of the system.    -steve falkenburg 10/9/91
