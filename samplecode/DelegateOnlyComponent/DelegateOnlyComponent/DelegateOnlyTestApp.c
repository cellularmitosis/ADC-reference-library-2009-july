/*	File:		DelegateOnlyTestApp.c		Description: Some very basic code to test the Delegate Only Image Codec. Opens a .jpg image,				 creats a '2vuy' offscreen and draws the image into the offscreen using Graphics Importers.				 Once we have the source in the correct pixel format, we use a decompression sequence to draw				 to the window. By changing the image description we force the ICM to call our Delegate Only Codec				 which in turn just delegates everything to the apple '2vuy' codec.	Author:		QuickTime DTS	Copyright: 	© Copyright 2003 Apple Computer, Inc.
