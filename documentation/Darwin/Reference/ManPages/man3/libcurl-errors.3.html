<b>NAME</b>
       libcurl-errors - error codes in libcurl

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       This man page includes most, if not all, available error codes in libcurl.  Why they occur and possi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">bly&nbsp;possibly</font>
       bly what you can do to fix the problem.

<b>CURLcode</b>
       Almost all "easy" interface functions return a  CURLcode  error  code.  No  matter  what,  using  the
       <a href="curl_easy_setopt.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/curl_easy_setopt"><u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>easy</u><b>_</b><u>setopt(3)</u></a><u></u>  option  <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>ERRORBUFFER</u>  is a good idea as it will give you a human readable
       error string that may offer more details about the  error  cause  than  just  the  error  code  does.
       <a href="curl_easy_strerror.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/curl_easy_strerror"><u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>easy</u><b>_</b><u>strerror(3)</u></a><u></u> can be called to get an error string from a given CURLcode number.

       CURLcode is one of the following:

       CURLE_OK (0)
              All fine. Proceed as usual.

       CURLE_UNSUPPORTED_PROTOCOL (1)
              The  URL you passed to libcurl used a protocol that this libcurl does not support. The support
              might be a compile-time option that you didn't use, it can be a misspelled protocol string  or
              just a protocol libcurl has no code for.

       CURLE_FAILED_INIT (2)
              Very early initialization code failed. This is likely to be an internal error or problem.

       CURLE_URL_MALFORMAT (3)
              The URL was not properly formatted.

       CURLE_URL_MALFORMAT_USER (4)
              This is never returned by current libcurl.

       CURLE_COULDNT_RESOLVE_PROXY (5)
              Couldn't resolve proxy. The given proxy host could not be resolved.

       CURLE_COULDNT_RESOLVE_HOST (6)
              Couldn't resolve host. The given remote host was not resolved.

       CURLE_COULDNT_CONNECT (7)
              Failed to connect() to host or proxy.

       CURLE_FTP_WEIRD_SERVER_REPLY (8)
              After  connecting  to  an  FTP server, libcurl expects to get a certain reply back. This error
              code implies that it got a strange or bad reply. The given remote server is probably not an OK
              FTP server.

       CURLE_FTP_ACCESS_DENIED (9)
              We  were  denied access when trying to login to an FTP server or when trying to change working
              directory to the one given in the URL.

       CURLE_FTP_USER_PASSWORD_INCORRECT (10)
              This is never returned by current libcurl.

       CURLE_FTP_WEIRD_PASS_REPLY (11)
              After having sent the FTP password to the server, libcurl expects a proper reply.  This  error
              code indicates that an unexpected code was returned.

       CURLE_FTP_WEIRD_USER_REPLY (12)
              After having sent user name to the FTP server, libcurl expects a proper reply. This error code
              indicates that an unexpected code was returned.

       CURLE_FTP_WEIRD_PASV_REPLY (13)
              libcurl failed to get a sensible result back from the server as a response to either a PASV or
              a EPSV command. The server is flawed.

       CURLE_FTP_WEIRD_227_FORMAT (14)
              FTP  servers return a 227-line as a response to a PASV command. If libcurl fails to parse that
              line, this return code is passed back.

       CURLE_FTP_CANT_GET_HOST (15)
              An internal failure to lookup the host used for the new connection.

       CURLE_FTP_CANT_RECONNECT (16)
              A bad return code on either PASV or EPSV was sent by the FTP server, preventing  libcurl  from
              being able to continue.

       CURLE_FTP_COULDNT_SET_BINARY (17)
              Received an error when trying to set the transfer mode to binary.

       CURLE_PARTIAL_FILE (18)
              A  file  transfer  was  shorter  or  larger  than expected. This happens when the server first
              reports an expected transfer size, and then delivers data that doesn't  match  the  previously
              given size.

       CURLE_FTP_COULDNT_RETR_FILE (19)
              This was either a weird reply to a 'RETR' command or a zero byte transfer complete.

       CURLE_FTP_WRITE_ERROR (20)
              After a completed file transfer, the FTP server did not respond a proper


       CURLE_FTP_QUOTE_ERROR (21)
              When  sending  custom  "QUOTE"  commands to the remote server, one of the commands returned an
              error code that was 400 or higher.

       CURLE_HTTP_RETURNED_ERROR (22)
              This is returned if CURLOPT_FAILONERROR is set TRUE and the HTTP server returns an error  code
              that is &gt;= 400.

       CURLE_WRITE_ERROR (23)
              An  error  occurred  when  writing  received data to a local file, or an error was returned to
              libcurl from a write callback.

       CURLE_MALFORMAT_USER (24)
              This is never returned by current libcurl.

       CURLE_UPLOAD_FAILED (25)
              Failed starting the upload. For FTP, the server typcially denied the STOR command.  The  error
              buffer usually contains the server's explanation to this.  (This error code was formerly known
              as CURLE_FTP_COULDNT_STOR_FILE.)

       CURLE_READ_ERROR (26)
              There was a problem reading a local file or an error returned by the read callback.

       CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY (27)
              Out of memory. A memory allocation request failed. This is serious badness and things are  se-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">verely&nbsp;severely</font>
              verely screwed up if this ever occur.

       CURLE_OPERATION_TIMEOUTED (28)
              Operation timeout. The specified time-out period was reached according to the conditions.

       CURLE_FTP_COULDNT_SET_ASCII (29)
              libcurl failed to set ASCII transfer type (TYPE A).

       CURLE_FTP_PORT_FAILED (30)
              The  FTP  PORT  command  returned  error. This mostly happen when you haven't specified a good
              enough address for libcurl to use. See <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>FTPPORT</u>.

       CURLE_FTP_COULDNT_USE_REST (31)
              The FTP REST command returned error. This should never happen if the server is sane.

       CURLE_FTP_COULDNT_GET_SIZE (32)
              The FTP SIZE command returned error. SIZE is not a kosher FTP command, it is an extension  and
              not all servers support it. This is not a surprising error.

       CURLE_HTTP_RANGE_ERROR (33)
              The HTTP server does not support or accept range requests.

       CURLE_HTTP_POST_ERROR (34)
              This is an odd error that mainly occurs due to internal confusion.

       CURLE_SSL_CONNECT_ERROR (35)
              A  problem  occurred  somewhere in the SSL/TLS handshake. You really want the error buffer and
              read the message there as it pinpoints the problem slightly more. Could be certificates  (file
              formats, paths, permissions), passwords, and others.

       CURLE_FTP_BAD_DOWNLOAD_RESUME (36)
              Attempting FTP resume beyond file size.

       CURLE_FILE_COULDNT_READ_FILE (37)
              A  file given with FILE:// couldn't be opened. Most likely because the file path doesn't iden-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tify&nbsp;identify</font>
              tify an existing file. Did you check file permissions?

       CURLE_LDAP_CANNOT_BIND (38)
              LDAP cannot bind. LDAP bind operation failed.

       CURLE_LDAP_SEARCH_FAILED (39)
              LDAP search failed.

       CURLE_LIBRARY_NOT_FOUND (40)
              Library not found. The LDAP library was not found.

       CURLE_FUNCTION_NOT_FOUND (41)
              Function not found. A required LDAP function was not found.

       CURLE_ABORTED_BY_CALLBACK (42)
              Aborted by callback. A callback returned "abort" to libcurl.

       CURLE_BAD_FUNCTION_ARGUMENT (43)
              Internal error. A function was called with a bad parameter.

       CURLE_BAD_CALLING_ORDER (44)
              This is never returned by current libcurl.

       CURLE_HTTP_PORT_FAILED (45)
              Interface error. A specified outgoing interface could not be used. Set which interface to  use
              for outgoing connections' source IP address with CURLOPT_INTERFACE.

       CURLE_BAD_PASSWORD_ENTERED (46)
              This is never returned by current libcurl.

       CURLE_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS (47)
              Too  many redirects. When following redirects, libcurl hit the maximum amount.  Set your limit
              with CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS.

       CURLE_UNKNOWN_TELNET_OPTION (48)
              An option set with CURLOPT_TELNETOPTIONS was not recognized/known. Refer  to  the  appropriate
              documentation.

       CURLE_TELNET_OPTION_SYNTAX (49)
              A telnet option string was Illegally formatted.

       CURLE_OBSOLETE (50)
              This is not an error. This used to be another error code in an old libcurl version and is cur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rently&nbsp;currently</font>
              rently unused.

       CURLE_SSL_PEER_CERTIFICATE (51)
              The remote server's SSL certificate was deemed not OK.

       CURLE_GOT_NOTHING (52)

       CURLE_SSL_ENGINE_NOTFOUND (53)
              The specified crypto engine wasn't found.

       CURLE_SSL_ENGINE_SETFAILED (54)
              Failed setting the selected SSL crypto engine as default!

       CURLE_SEND_ERROR (55)
              Failed sending network data.

       CURLE_RECV_ERROR (56)
              Failure with receiving network data.

<b>CURLMcode</b>
       This is the generic return code used by functions in  the  libcurl  multi  interface.  Also  consider
       <a href="curl_multi_strerror.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/curl_multi_strerror"><u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>multi</u><b>_</b><u>strerror(3)</u></a><u></u>.

       CURLM_CALL_MULTI_PERFORM (-1)
              This  is  not  really  an  error. It means you should call <a href="curl_multi_perform.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/curl_multi_perform"><u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>multi</u><b>_</b><u>perform(3)</u></a><u></u> again without
              doing select() or similar in between.

       CURLM_OK (0)
              Things are fine.

       CURLM_BAD_HANDLE (1)
              The passed-in handle is not a valid CURLM handle.

       CURLM_BAD_EASY_HANDLE (2)
              An easy handle was not good/valid. It could mean that it isn't an easy handle at all, or  pos-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sibly&nbsp;possibly</font>
              sibly that the handle already is in used by this or another multi handle.

       CURLM_OUT_OF_MEMORY (3)
              You are doomed.

       CURLM_INTERNAL_ERROR (4)
              This can only be returned if libcurl bugs. Please report it to us!

       CURLM_BAD_SOCKET (5)
              The passed-in socket is not a valid one that libcurl already knows about.  (Added in 7.15.4)

<b>CURLSHcode</b>
       The "share" interface will return a CURLSHcode to indicate when an error has occurred.  Also consider
       <a href="curl_share_strerror.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/curl_share_strerror"><u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>share</u><b>_</b><u>strerror(3)</u></a><u></u>.

       CURLSHE_OK (0)
              All fine. Proceed as usual.

       CURLSHE_BAD_OPTION (1)
              An invalid option was passed to the function.

       CURLSHE_IN_USE (2)
              The share object is currently in use.

       CURLSHE_INVALID (3)
              An invalid share object was passed to the function.
