MORE_FRAMEWORK_INCLUDES	#include <Files.h>#endif/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////#ifdef __cplusplusextern "C" {#endif/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Overview// --------// This module implements a very low-level logging mechanism that is safe // to call from /all/ contexts, including MP tasks and interrupts.  It was // originally written to help develop OTMP (another part of MoreIsBetter) but // it is generally useful.//// The core design is stolen directly from "InterruptSafeDebug", another // MoreIsBetterModule.  The main change is that this module logs into // memory rather than directly to the screen.  I should unify these two // modules eventually, but at the moment I'm concentrating on shipping // OTMP.//// The log data goes into a log buffer pointed to by gMPLogBuffer.// After a crash you can find this buffer in MacsBug and then look // through the buffer for a '•' character to find the last item logged.// When you start up the module it defines a MacsBug macro, MPLog, to do // this for you.//// For InterfaceLib-based code you can call this library when paging is // unsafe, as long as your guarantee that the library's code and global // data is held.  This is typically the case for device driver code.  // For Carbon code, paging must be safe when you call this module. // Paging is always safe on Mac OS X, and is typically safe in application-// level code on traditional Mac OS.  See Technote 1094 "Virtual Memory // Application Compatibility" for a list of situations when paging is // unsafe on traditional Mac OS./////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Core Logging Routinesextern pascal OSStatus InitMPLog(ByteCount logBufferSize);	// Initialises the MP-safe log to contain a log of logBufferSize 	// bytes.  The buffer is allocated in the current zone using NewPtrClear.	// logBufferSize must be a power of 2.extern pascal void TermMPLog(void);	// Shuts down the MP-safe log.  Do not call this routine while 	// there are MP threads running that are logging data.	extern pascal void MPLogText(const UInt8 *text, ByteCount len);	// Log's the text described by text and len to the buffer.extern pascal OSStatus MPLogWriteToFile(const FSSpec *fss);	// Writes the MP log to the file pointed to by fss, 	// overwriting any data that was there previously.  This 	// routine is not coordinated with the logging, so if 	// there is ongoing logging happening while the write is 	// in progress you will get weird results./////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Log Points// The followed routines let you easily define log points throughout // your code.  They are conditionalised with the MORE_DEBUG macro so // the log points go away when you compile a non-debug version.  They // are runtime conditionalised by a mask, so you can selectively enable // logging from a particular part of your code at runtime.  The "module"// parameter to each MPLog routine is a bit number in this mask.  If the // bit is set, the log entry is created.//// IMPORTANT: The default value for the log mask is 0, so you'll have to // set it yourself if you expect to see anything in the log.//// Log points are identified by a tag, ie an OSType that you can easily // recognise.  I use an OSType rather than a string because it's fast // and simple.  This module encourages you to use tags of the form '>Foo'// for routine entry points and '<Foo' for routine exit points.  MPLogTagReturn // takes an entry point tag and returns the equivalent return tag.//// Log points can take up to four parameters.  These parameters are // written to the log as hex.#define MPLogTagReturn(tag) ( ((tag) & 0x00FFFFFF) | ('<' << 24) )#if MORE_DEBUG	extern pascal void   MPLogSetMask(UInt32 logMask);		// Sets the log mask.  Only log points whose bit is set in this 		// mask will actually appear in the log.			extern pascal UInt32 MPLogGetMask(void);		// Returns the mask last set with MPLogSetMask.		extern pascal void MPLog(UInt32 module, OSType tag);	extern pascal void MPLog1(UInt32 module, OSType tag, const void *p1);	extern pascal void MPLog2(UInt32 module, OSType tag, const void *p1, const void *p2);	extern pascal void MPLog3(UInt32 module, OSType tag, const void *p1, const void *p2, const void *p3);	extern pascal void MPLog4(UInt32 module, OSType tag, const void *p1, const void *p2, const void *p3, const void *p4);		// If the bit whose number is "module" is set in the log mask, 		// create a log entry recording "tag" and "pX".		// Safe to call from all execution environments.		// You must initialise the log buffer, using InitMPLog, 		// before calling this routine.#else	// Macros so that non-debug code will compile.		#define MPLogSetMask(logMask)	#define MPLogGetMask()			0	#define MPLog(module, tag)	#define MPLog1(module, tag, p1)	#define MPLog2(module, tag, p1, p2)	#define MPLog3(module, tag, p1, p2, p3)	#define MPLog4(module, tag, p1, p2, p3, p4)#endif/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Utility printf Routinesextern void MPLogPrintf(const char *format, ...);	// Like printf, but result goes to the MP log.	// Safe to call from all execution environments.	// You must initialise the log buffer, using InitMPLog, 	// before calling this routine.	// 	// The fully expanded string must be 256 characters or less.#if 0// This routine is fatally broken and I'm not entirely sure // why.  Something about the MPRemoteCall is causing the MP // task to wedge.  I believe this is a bug in Mac OS 9.1 // [2607064] because it works just fine on Mac OS 9.0.4 and // pre-release versions of Mac OS 9.2.  Until I figure this // out I'm just not going use this routine.extern void MPLogPrintfSlow(const char *format, ...);	// MP-safe version of printf.  Result goes to console.	// The routine is slow because it does an MPRemoteCall to 	// do the printing, which means the MP task waits until 	// the application is scheduled and can run the called 	// routine before it unblocks.	//	// You cannot call this routine from an interrupt. You can only	// call it from system task code or from an MP task.	//	// You don't need to call InitMPLog before calling this routine.	//	// Doesn't strictly belong in this module, but it was a convenient 	// place to put it.#endif#ifdef __cplusplus}#endif
