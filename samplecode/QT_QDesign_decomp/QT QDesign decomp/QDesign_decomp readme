/*QDesign decompression information:This sample is designed to show you how to create the required QuickTime atom and sendit to the QDesign decompression codecs so that you can decompress QDesign compressedAIFF files using the Sound Manager's SoundConvert routines and the QuickTime QDesigncodecs.This sample also shows a tecnique of playing a sound that doesn't rely on doing anywork, other than setting a flag, at interrupt time.  Use this tecnique if you want tobe a friendly application, but not if you can't stand to have sound dropouts.The interesting bits are in PlaySound and SoundCallBackFcn.*/
