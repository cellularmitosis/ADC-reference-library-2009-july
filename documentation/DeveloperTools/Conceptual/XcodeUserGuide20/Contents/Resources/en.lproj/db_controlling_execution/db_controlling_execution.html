of Your Code</h1><p>The purpose of the debugger is to help you
identify and resolve problems in your code by analyzing the internal
operation of your program. Using the debugger, you can halt the execution
of your program when you encounter a problem and inspect the program
in its current state. The debugger can stop your program when certain
events occur or when a particular line of code is reached. It also
lets you execute individual machine instructions or lines of code,
pausing after each to examine the contents of your program.</p>
<p>This chapter shows you the various facilities that the Xcode
debugger provides for pausing and then resuming execution of your
program. It describes how to use breakpoints to stop at a particular
line of code or at a function or method call, as well as how to
stop when your program throws an exception. It also describes how
to step through code, to view changes effected in your program one
line or machine instruction at a time. </p>

<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH241-BABECGJE" title="Breakpoints"></a><h2>Breakpoints</h2>
<p>Breakpoints let you pause the execution of your program in
the debugger whenever certain events occur in your code. You can
set a breakpoint to stop your program when:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Execution
reaches a specific line of code. When you set a breakpoint for a
particular line number in a source code file, the debugger stops
your program just before it executes any of the code on that line.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>A particular function or method is called. You can specify
the name of a function or method to set a breakpoint at the entry
to that function or method; this is referred to as a symbolic breakpoint. </p></li></ul>
<p>In Xcode, you can set and view breakpoints for a project from
the code editor or from the Breakpoints window. Xcode stores all
your breakpoints when you close your project and restores them when
you open it again. Breakpoints are stored per-project.</p>
<p>GDB also supports special kinds of breakpoints that let you
halt execution of your program when a particular event, such as
the loading of a certain library, occurs; or when the value of an
expression changes. To set breakpoints of this nature&#8212;called catchpoints
and watchpoints&#8212;you must use the command line interface, described
in <span class="content_text"><a href="../db_set_up_debug/db_set_up_debug.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH239-BABIEDGI">“The Console Window.”</a></span></p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH241-DontLinkElementID_111" title="The Breakpoints Window"></a><h3>The Breakpoints Window</h3>
<p>The Breakpoints window lets you view and modify all of the
breakpoints set in the current project. This includes function and
method breakpoints, as well as breakpoints associated with a particular
line of code in a source file. To open the Breakpoints window, click
the Breakpoints button in the toolbar of the debugger window or
choose Debug &gt; Breakpoints. <span class="content_text">Figure 33-1</span> shows the Breakpoints
window:</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH241-CJHDAHFD" title="Figure 33-1The Breakpoints window"></a><p><strong>Figure 33-1&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The Breakpoints window</p>
<img src = "../Art/breakpointwindow.gif" alt = "" width="362" height="414"></div><br/>
<p>Breakpoints on a function or method are assigned to the Symbolic
Breakpoints group. File line breakpoints are grouped by the file
in which they appear; Xcode displays the line number at which each
breakpoint is set and the surrounding context of the line. The checkbox
next to each breakpoint indicates whether that breakpoint is enabled. When
a breakpoint is enabled, the debugger stops when it encounters the
specified line or function. </p>
<p>You can delete, disable, or reenable any existing breakpoint
in your project in the Breakpoints window. You can also create new
symbolic breakpoints. However, you can only add a new breakpoint
to a specific line of code from the editor. </p>
<p>To view the source code for a breakpoint, double-click the
breakpoint in the Breakpoints window. This opens the source file
in which the breakpoint is set or the function is defined in a separate
editor window.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH241-BABJEDAF" title="Adding Breakpoints"></a><h3>Adding Breakpoints</h3>
<p>Xcode&#8217;s debugger lets you add a breakpoint to a specific
line of code or to a function or method. You can set a breakpoint
on a line of code directly in the editor. To set a symbolic breakpoint,
use the Breakpoints window. </p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH241-DontLinkElementID_112" title="Setting a Breakpoint at a Line of Code"></a><h4>Setting
a Breakpoint at a Line of Code</h4>
<p>To add a file line breakpoint, click the margin beside the
line of code in the code editor or place the insertion point in
the line and choose Debug &gt; Add Breakpoint at Current Line (or
type Command-\). Xcode adds a breakpoint at the current line and
displays it in the gutter of the editor. Breakpoints appear as a
dark arrow in the gutter, pointing to the specified line of code,
similar to the following: </p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH241-DontLinkElementID_283" title="Figure 33-2A breakpoint in a gutter"></a><p><strong>Figure 33-2&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>A
breakpoint in a gutter</p><img src = "../Art/breakpointingutter.gif" alt = "" width="661" height="369"></div><br/>
<p>You can easily move a breakpoint associated with a specific
line of code to another line by dragging the breakpoint arrow to
the new line within the code editor.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve set a breakpoint at a particular line, you can
see that breakpoint in the Breakpoints window as well, as described
in the previous section. However, you cannot set a new file line
breakpoint from the Breakpoints window.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH241-DontLinkElementID_113" title="Setting a Breakpoint on a Function or Method"></a><h4>Setting
a Breakpoint on a Function or Method</h4>
<p>To set a breakpoint at a function or method, use the Breakpoints
window. You can open the breakpoints window by clicking the Breakpoint
button or choosing Debug &gt; Breakpoints. To add a new breakpoint,
click the New Symbolic Breakpoint button. Xcode adds an item to
the Symbolic Breakpoints group; type the name of the function or
method at which to set the breakpoint in this field. For example,
to stop whenever something in your code calls <code><!--a-->malloc<!--/a--></code>,
enter <code><!--a-->malloc<!--/a--></code>. </p>
<p>When you set a breakpoint on an Objective-C method, you must
include the brackets and a plus or minus sign. For example, to stop
whenever a Cocoa exception is raised, enter <code>-[NSException
raise].</code></p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH241-DontLinkElementID_114" title="Deleting Breakpoints"></a><h3>Deleting Breakpoints</h3>
<p>If you no longer need a breakpoint, you can delete it from
the project using the Breakpoints window or, if the breakpoint is
set on a specific line of code, from within the code editor. To
remove any breakpoint in your project&#8212;symbolic or line number&#8212;open
the Breakpoints window, select the breakpoint you want to delete,
and choose Edit &gt; Delete or press the Delete key.</p>
<p>To remove a breakpoint that is set on a line of code, you
can also do either of the following in the editor:</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Click the
breakpoint marker&#8212;the arrow symbol&#8212;in the gutter of the editor.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Place the insertion point in the line and choose Debug &gt;
Remove Breakpoint at Current Line.</p></li></ul>
<p>Xcode removes the breakpoint marker from the breakpoint gutter
and deletes the breakpoint from the Breakpoints window.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH241-DontLinkElementID_115" title="Disabling and Reenabling Breakpoints"></a><h3>Disabling and Reenabling Breakpoints</h3>
<p>In the course of debugging a program, you may find that you
don&#8217;t currently want the debugger to use a particular breakpoint
that you have set, but you don&#8217;t want to delete it entirely, either,
in case you want to use it again at a later time. Instead of deleting
the breakpoint from your project, you can simply disable it. This
renders the breakpoint inactive, but retains all of the information
for that breakpoint, so you can enable it again later. A disabled
breakpoint appears in the breakpoint list and is saved in the project,
but Xcode doesn&#8217;t stop at it. The breakpoint remains disabled
until you enable it again.</p>
<p>You can disable or reenable any breakpoint in your project&#8212;whether
a symbolic breakpoint or a line number breakpoint&#8212;from the Breakpoints
window. To disable or reenable a breakpoint, open the Breakpoints
window and click the checkbox beside the breakpoint you want to
modify. A breakpoint is enabled when this checkbox is selected.</p>
<p>You can also disable or reenable file line breakpoints from
the code editor by Control-clicking the breakpoint in the gutter
and choosing Disable Breakpoint or Enable Breakpoint from the contextual
menu. Alternatively, Command-clicking the breakpoint arrow in the
gutter toggles the state of the breakpoint between enabled and disabled. A disabled
breakpoint on a line of code appears as a light grey arrow in the
breakpoint gutter of the code editor.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH241-DontLinkElementID_116" title="Stopping on C++ Exceptions"></a><h2>Stopping on C++ Exceptions</h2>
<p>If you are debugging C++ code, you can specify that the Xcode debugger
stop on <code>catch</code> and <code>throw</code>.
You can enable this feature using the following two menu items in
the Debug menu:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Stop on C++
throw. Enable this option to halt execution when an exception is
thrown.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Stop on C++ catch. Enable this option to halt execution when
an exception is caught.</p></li></ul>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH241-CJHECCEH" title="Stopping on Core Services Debugging Functions"></a><h2>Stopping on Core Services Debugging Functions</h2>
<p>The Core Services framework includes routines, such as <code>Debugger</code> and <code>DebugStr</code>,
that break into the debugger with a message. If your code contains
calls to these functions, you can tell Xcode&#8217;s debugger to stop
when it encounters these functions. </p>
<p>You can enable this feature for an individual executable,
as described in <span class="content_text"><a href="../db_set_up_debug/db_set_up_debug.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH239-CJBICGJI">“Configuring Your Executable for Debugging,”</a></span>
or for all executables in the current project using the Debug menu.
To enable stopping on calls to <code>Debugger</code> and <code>DebugStr</code> from
the Debug menu, choose Debug &gt; Stop on Debugger()/DebugStr().
If this feature is already enabled, choosing the menu item a second
time disables it.</p>
<p>Xcode sets the USERBREAK environment variable to 1, which
causes these functions to send a SIGINT signal to the current process,
breaking into the debugger.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH241-BABDBIGI" title="Stepping Through Code"></a><h2>Stepping Through Code</h2>
<p>Once execution of your program has been suspended in the debugger&#8212;for
example, after hitting a breakpoint&#8212;you have a number of options
for resuming execution. You can simply resume execution of your
program from its current location, continuing until the program
exits or the debugger encounters another breakpoint, or you can
step through your program&#8217;s code. When you step through code,
you tell the debugger to execute just one more code line or machine
instruction and pause the program once more. This lets you examine
changes in your program in detail and pinpoint problems. </p>
<p>The Xcode debugger provides toolbar buttons and menu items
to let you control the execution of your code. The following example
uses the CalendarView sample application to illustrate how to step
through code in the debugger using some of these commands. In <span class="content_text">Figure 33-3</span> the
execution of the CalendarView program is halted at a breakpoint
set in the <code>CalendarViewHandler</code> function.</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH241-CJHCECIF" title="Figure 33-3Execution of a program stopped at a breakpoint"></a><p><strong>Figure 33-3&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Execution of a program stopped at
a breakpoint</p><img src = "../Art/stopatbreakpoint.gif" alt = "" width="688" height="472"></div><br/>
<p>The line of code at which execution is paused&#8212;the line at
which the breakpoint is set&#8212;is highlighted in the editor. The
red arrow next to the code line, the PC indicator, shows the position
of the program counter. You can see the chain of function calls
from which the <code>CalendarViewHandler</code> function
was invoked in the Thread view, located in the top left of the debugger
window. The arguments and local variables of the function or method
selected in the thread list are visible in the Variable view, to
the right of the thread list in the debugger window. To go to the
next line of code, staying within the current function, press Step
Over.</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH241-DontLinkElementID_284" title="Figure 33-4Stepping over a line of code"></a><p><strong>Figure 33-4&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Stepping
over a line of code</p><img src = "../Art/stepover.gif" alt = "" width="689" height="475"></div><br/>
<p>The PC indicator has advanced to the next line of code, where
it is again paused. The next line of code has a function call. To
go to the next line of code, stepping into the function if possible,
press Step Into.</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH241-DontLinkElementID_285" title="Figure 33-5Stepping into a function"></a><p><strong>Figure 33-5&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Stepping
into a function</p><img src = "../Art/stepinto.gif" alt = "" width="688" height="472"></div><br/>
<p>The PC indicator is now paused at a line in the <code>CalendarViewConstruct</code> function,
which was called from the line of code in the <code>CalendarViewHandler</code> function
that you stepped into. The local variables and arguments for <code>CalendarViewConstruct</code> are
shown in the variable display and the call chain now lists this
function above the <code>CalendarViewHandler</code> function.
To go to the end of the current function and back to the statement
of the <code>CalendarViewHandler</code> function
from which it was called, press Step Out.</p>
<p>You can also use the Step Into Instruction and Step Over Instruction
commands to step through individual machine instructions. See <span class="content_text"><a href="../db_view_info/db_view_info.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH242-BABCAEGG">“Viewing Disassembled Code and Processor Registers”</a></span> for
more information.</p>
<p>All of the commands in this section also have equivalent menu
items in Xcode&#8217;s Debug menu. You can change the location at which
execution will start when you continue the program or resume stepping
through code by dragging the PC indicator to the appropriate line
of code.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH241-DontLinkElementID_117" title="Stopping and Starting Your Program in the Debugger"></a><h2>Stopping and Starting Your
Program in the Debugger</h2>
<p>In addition to the commands demonstrated in the previous section,
you can further control the execution of your program in the debugger
using the following commands:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>To force-quit
your application and restart it, press Restart. </p></li>
<li class="li"><p>To pause your program while it&#8217;s running, press Pause.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>To continue it again, press Continue.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>To force the application to quit immediately, press Terminate.</p></li></ul>
<p>Xcode provides buttons in the Debugger window toolbar, as
well as menu items in the Debug menu, for each of these commands.</p>
