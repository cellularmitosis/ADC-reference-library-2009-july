If your applicationneeds these features, you should use one of these approaches. TheHTML user interface used by the WebObjects HTML-based and Directto Web approaches offers much more limited possibilities.</font></p><p><font face="Times">When you need fast response times from your user interface(if you're displaying and updating real time data, for example),you should use the Java Client or Direct to Java Client approaches.The user's computer manages the highly interactive user interface.</font></p><p><font face="Times">The drawback of the Java Client approaches is you need tobe sure the client code is on the user's computer when the userruns your application. You can either install it on the user's computerin advance like a standalone application, which can be inconvenient,or download it as an applet, which can take a long time.</font></p><a name = "TPXREF106"></a><h3><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande">SpecificLayout and Flow Requirements</font></h3><p><font face="Times">If you plan to create an HTML application with specific pagedesign and flow requirements, you should use the WebObjects HTMLapproach. The alternative, Direct to Web, creates applications witha predefined structure that limits the user interface's flexibility.Direct to Web is highly customizable, but you need to have a strong understandingof WebObjects before you can effectively customize the flow of aDirect to Web application.</font></p><p><font face="Times">Your decision is similar if your application needs the richand fast user interface the Java Client approaches offer. If theuser interface has specific layout and flow requirements, you shoulduse the Java Client approach over the Direct to Java Client approach.</font></p><p><font face="Times">Keep in mind that the Direct to Java Client approach-includingthe user interface it generates-is designed expressly for viewingand editing databases, especially large ones. If your applicationrequires this capability, you will probably find Direct to JavaClient's user interface extremely well-suited for the task.</font></p>    <br><a href="Internet_an__Deployment.html" target="_right"><img src="../Images/previous.gif" border="0" alt="Previous"></a><a href="Rapid_Devel_siderations.html" target="_right"><img src="../Images/next.gif" border="0" alt="Next"></a>&nbsp;<p><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="1">&#169; 2001 Apple Computer, Inc.</font></p><!-- start of footer --><!--#include virtual="/includes/framesetfooter" --><!-- end of footer --></body></html>
