The adapter can recharge the internal batteryin less than six hours while the computer is running or in threeand a half hours while the computer is shut down or in sleep mode. </font></li><li>A power cable for use on airliners is also available. Thevoltage provided by the airliner is not high enough to charge thecomputer's battery, so the power cable includes a special senseresistor. When the computer detects this sense resistor, its powermanager does not attempt to charge the battery.
