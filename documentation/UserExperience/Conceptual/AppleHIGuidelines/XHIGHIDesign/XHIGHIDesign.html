<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-TPXREF130" title="Human Interface Design Principles"></a><h2>Human Interface Design Principles</h2><p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_408"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_409"></a>This section presents some key principles critical to the design of elegant, efficient, intuitive, and Aqua-compliant user interfaces. Sometimes overlooked by developers, these principles are as relevant today as when Apple first published them decades ago. In fact, they drive the design of the Mac OS X user interface. </p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-BABFCAJF" title="Metaphors"></a><h3>Metaphors</h3><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_410"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_411"></a><p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_412"></a>Take advantage of people’s knowledge of the world by using metaphors to convey concepts and features of your application. Metaphors are the building blocks in the user’s mental model of a task. Use metaphors that represent concrete, familiar ideas, and make the metaphors obvious, so that users can apply a set of expectations to the computer environment. For example, Mac OS X uses the metaphor of file folders for storing documents; people can organize their hard disks in a way that is analogous to the way they organize file cabinets. Other metaphor examples include iTunes playlists and iPhoto albums, which represent real-world music playlists and photo albums. A Dashboard widget can also be a metaphor for the task it performs because it instantly conveys its purpose to the user. (For Dashboard widget design guidelines, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGUsingTechnologies/XHIGUsingTechnologies.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-BAJHABJE">“Dashboard.”</a></span>)</p><p>Metaphors should suggest a use for a particular element, but that use doesn’t have to limit the implementation of the metaphor. It is important to strike a balance between the metaphor’s suggested use and the computer’s ability to support and extend the metaphor. For example, the number of items a user puts in the Trash is not limited to the number of items a physical wastebasket could hold.<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_413"></a></p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-CJBDDFAJ" title="Reflect the User&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Mental Model"></a><h3>Reflect the User’s Mental Model</h3><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_414"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_415"></a><p>The user already has a mental model that describes the task your software is enabling. This model arises from a combination of real-world experiences, experience with other software, and with computers in general. For example, users have real-world experience writing and mailing letters and most users have used email applications to write and send email. Based on this, a user has a conceptual model of this task that includes certain expectations, such as the ability to create a new letter, select a recipient, and send the letter. An email application that ignores the user’s mental model and does not meet at least some of the user’s expectations would be difficult and even unpleasant to use. This is because such an application imposes an unfamiliar conceptual model on its users instead of building on the knowledge and experiences those users already have.</p><p>Before you design your application’s user interface, try to discover your users’ mental model of the task your application helps them perform. Be aware of the model’s inherent metaphors, which represent conceptual components of the task. In the letter-writing example, the metaphors include letters, mail boxes, and envelopes. In the mental model of a task related to photography, the metaphors include photographs, cameras, and albums. Strive to reflect the user’s expectations of task components, organization, and workflow in your window layout, menu and toolbar organization, and use of panels. </p><p>A good example of how reflecting the appropriate mental model results in a clean, intuitive user interface is the iTunes application. Apple designed iTunes to reflect the mental models people associate with playing music and managing their music collections. In an uncluttered window, iTunes displays individual songs, playlists, and playback and search controls in a song-centric arrangement. The largest pane displays a list of songs, clearly sortable by categories such as title, artist, and album. The smaller pane displays the playlists and collections, which control the list of songs currently displayed, just as the disk and folder icons in the Finder sidebar control the display of files, folders, and applications. The prominent playback controls look like similar controls on radios, CD players, and the iPod. The search field is identical to the search field in Finder, Mail, and countless other Aqua-compliant applications. Because the iTunes user interface reflects a well-defined mental model, instead of forcing users to adopt unfamiliar concepts, even novice users find iTunes intuitive and easy to use.</p><p>The mental model your users have should infuse the design of your application’s user interface. It should inform the layout of your application’s windows, the selection and organization of icons and controls in the toolbars, and the functionality of panels. In addition, you should support the user’s mental model by striving to incorporate the following characteristics:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p><strong>Familiarity</strong><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_416"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_417"></a>. The user’s mental model is based primarily on experience. When possible, enhance user interface components to reflect the model’s symbology and display labels that use the model’s terminology. Then, where appropriate, use familiar Mac OS X user interface components to offer standard functionality, such as searching and navigating hierarchical sets of data.</p><p>As described above, the iTunes application displays playback controls that use well-known symbols users associate with play, pause, and rewind. Then, to offer searching and help, for example, iTunes uses standard Aqua user interface components. A Mac OS X user automatically knows how to use such standard user interface elements, regardless of the application in which they appear.</p></li><li class="li"><p><strong>Simplicity</strong><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_418"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_419"></a>. A mental model of a task is typically streamlined and focused on the fundamental components of the task. Although there may be myriad optional details associated with a given task, the basic components should not have to compete with the details for the user’s attention.</p><p>In the iTunes application, for example, the basic task components of playing songs, selecting playlists, and searching are prominently featured. However, these are supplemented by easily accessible menu items and controls that perform additional tasks, such as ejecting a disk, shuffling a playlist, and displaying song artwork.</p></li><li class="li"><p><strong>Availability</strong><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_420"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_421"></a>. A corollary of simplicity is availability. An uncluttered user interface is essential, but the availability of certain key features and settings the user needs is equally so. Avoid hiding such components too deeply in submenus or making them accessible only from a contextual menu. </p><p>The iCal application, for example, has commands for subscribing to a new calendar and for publishing a calendar in the Calendar menu. These tasks are easily accessible, but are not so frequently performed that they warrant dedicated controls on the application’s main window.</p></li><li class="li"><p><strong>Discoverability</strong><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_422"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_423"></a>. Encourage your users to discover functionality by providing cues about how to use user interface elements. If an element is clickable, for example, it must appear that way, or a user may never try clicking it. Be sure to use Aqua controls properly and avoid making controls invisible to inexperienced users.</p><p>Aqua buttons, for example, appear three-dimensional, enhancing their resemblance to buttons users see on physical devices. Well-designed toolbar icons make the commands they portray recognizable to users. This familiarity gives users the confidence to explore the functionality of a new application.<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_424"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_425"></a></p><p>Don’t discourage discovery by making actions difficult to reverse or recover from. For more information on this, see <span class="content_text"><a href="XHIGHIDesign.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-TPXREF107">“Forgiveness.”</a></span></p></li></ul><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-TPXREF102" title="Explicit and Implied Actions"></a><h3>Explicit and Implied Actions</h3><p>Each Mac OS X operation involves the manipulation<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_426"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_427"></a> of an object using an action. In the first step of this manipulation, the user sees the desired object onscreen. In the second step, the user selects or designates that object. In the final step, the user performs an action, either using a menu command or by direct manipulation of the object with the mouse or other device. This leads to two paradigms for manipulating objects: explicit and implied actions.</p><p>Explicit actions clearly state the result of manipulating an object. For example, menus list the commands that can be performed on the currently selected object. The name of the menu command clearly indicates what the action is and the current state of the command (dimmed or enabled) indicates whether that action is valid in the current context. Explicit actions do not require the user to memorize the commands that can be performed on a given object. </p><p>Implied actions convey the result of an action through visual cues or context. A drag-and-drop operation is a common example of an implied action. Dragging one object onto another object constitutes a relationship between the objects and an action to be performed by the drag operation. For example, dragging a file icon to the Trash implies the imminent removal of the underlying file from the file system. For implied actions to be apparent, the user must be able to recognize the objects involved, the manipulation to be performed, and the consequences of the action. </p><p>Keep these two paradigms in mind as you design your user interface. Examine the user’s mental model of your application’s task to help you determine when each type of action is appropriate. For example, Automator supports implied actions when the user drags actions into the workflow pane, creating relationships between them. Automator conveys these relationships by displaying connection points between actions, warning of potentially undesirable consequences, and suggesting types of input and output. When it requires the user to provide specific information, however, Automator supports explicit actions with the display of checkboxes and editable text fields.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-TPXREF101" title="Direct Manipulation"></a><h3>Direct Manipulation</h3><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_428"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_429"></a><p>Direct manipulation is an example of an implied action that allows users to feel that they are controlling the objects represented by the computer. According to this principle, an onscreen object should remain visible while a user performs an action on it, and the impact of the action should be immediately visible. For example, with a drag-and-drop operation (the most common example of direct manipulation) users can move a file by dragging its icon from one location to another, or drag selected text directly into another document. Other examples of direct manipulation are the resizing of a graphic object in a drawing application and the positioning of an object or camera view in a three-dimensional scene.</p><p>Support direct manipulation when users are likely to expect it. Avoid forcing users to use controls to manipulate data. For example, an application that manages a virtual library might allow the user to drag a book icon onto a patron’s name to check it out. Such direct manipulation supports the user’s mental model of the task and is much more natural than opening a window, selecting a book title, selecting a patron name, and clicking a Check Out button. (For more information on the concept of a mental model, see <span class="content_text"><a href="XHIGHIDesign.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-CJBDDFAJ">“Reflect the User’s Mental Model.”</a></span>)</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-TPXREF105" title="User Control"></a><h3>User Control</h3><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_430"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_431"></a><p>Allow the user, not the computer, to initiate and control actions. Some applications attempt to assist the user by offering only those alternatives deemed good for the user or by protecting the user from having to make detailed decisions. Because this approach puts the computer, not the user, in control, it is best confined to parts of the user interface aimed at novice users. Provide the level of user control that is appropriate for your audience (see <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGDesignProcess/XHIGDesignProcess.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002718-BAJHCHDB">“Know Your Audience”</a></span> for more information on ways to determine the audience for your application). For some suggestions on how to provide the appropriate level of detail in your user interface, see <span class="content_text"><a href="XHIGHIDesign.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-CJBHHAJE">“Managing Complexity in Your Software.”</a></span></p><p>The key is to provide users with the capabilities they need while helping them avoid dangerous, irreversible actions. For example, in situations where the user might destroy data accidentally, you should always provide a warning, but allow the user to proceed if they choose. </p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-TPXREF106" title="Feedback and Communication"></a><h3>Feedback and Communication</h3><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_432"></a><p>Feedback and communication encompass far more than merely displaying alerts when something goes wrong. Instead, it involves keeping users informed about what’s happening by providing appropriate feedback<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_433"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_434"></a> and enabling communication with your application.</p><p>When a user initiates an action, always provide an indication that your application has received the user’s input and is operating on it. Users want to know that a command is being carried out. If a command can’t be carried out, they want to know why it can’t and what can be done instead. When used sparingly, animation is one of the best ways to show a user that a requested action is being carried out. For example, when a user clicks an icon in the Dock, the icon bounces to let the user know that the application is in the process of opening. </p><p>Often, you can use animation to make clear the relationships between objects and the consequences of actions. Mac OS X uses animation to subtly but clearly communicate with the user in many different ways, a few of which are listed here:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>When a user minimizes a window, it doesn’t just disappear. Instead, it smoothly slips into the Dock, clearly telling the user where to find it again.</p></li><li class="li"><p>To communicate the relationship between a sheet and a window, the sheet unfurls from the window’s title bar.</p></li><li class="li"><p>To emphasize the relationship between a drawer and a window, the drawer slides out from beneath the window, displaying shadowing that makes it look like a desk drawer.</p></li></ul><p>You should consider using subtle animation effects such as these to enhance feedback in your user interface.</p><p>For potentially lengthy operations, use a progress indicator<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_435"></a> to provide useful information about how long the operation will take. Users don’t need to know precisely how many seconds an operation will take, but an estimate is helpful. For example, Mac OS X uses statements such as “about a minute remains” to indicate an approximate time frame. It can also be helpful to communicate the total number of steps needed to complete a task—for example, you might include text that says “Copying 30 of 850 files.”</p><div class="notebox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-SW1" title="Note"></a><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;A good reason to provide feedback during lengthy operations is that if your application fails to respond to events for 2 seconds, the system automatically displays a busy cursor for your application. Users who see this cursor without any other feedback might think that your application is frozen and quit it using the Force Quit window. </p></div><p>Provide direct, simple feedback that people can understand. For example, error messages should spell out exactly what situation caused the error (“There’s not enough space on that disk to save the document”) and possible actions the user can take to rectify it (“Try saving the document in another location”). For more information on how to compose useful alert messages, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGWindows/XHIGWindows.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-TPXREF23">“Writing Good Alert Messages.”</a></span></p><p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_436"></a>If your application consists of a foreground process that displays a user interface and a background process that performs some or all of the application’s main tasks, take special care to conduct all communication with the user through the user interface of the foreground process. In particular, a background process should never display a dialog or window in which the user is required to change settings or supply information. If a background process must communicate with the user, it should start or bring forward the foreground application. This is important because the user may not know (or remember) that a background process is running and receiving communication from it would be confusing.</p><p>For example, consider a backup application consisting of a foreground process that displays a user interface and a background process that performs the scheduled backups. The user starts the application, sets the backup frequency and provides the data and backup locations, and quits the application, secure in the knowledge that backups will proceed as scheduled. If, at some time in the future, the backup disk becomes full, the background process must tell the user immediately; otherwise, the user may lose data. To do this, the background process should start the application and cause its Dock icon to bounce. Drawing the user’s attention to a familiar application, instead of displaying an alert from an invisible process, prepares the user to receive the information and take appropriate action.</p><div class="notebox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-SW2" title="Note"></a><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_437"></a>A background-only application (also called a faceless background application) is not associated with a user-visible application. When communication with a user is essential, a background-only application can display an alert describing the situation, but the alert should direct the user to open some other application (such as System Preferences) to handle the problem. For some information on background-only applications, see <em><a href="../../../../MacOSX/Conceptual/BPRuntimeConfig/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000170i" target="_top">Runtime Configuration Guidelines</a></em> and the sample Carbon application <em><a href="../../../../../samplecode/Folder_Watching/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS10000667" target="_top">Folder Watching</a></em>.</p></div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-TPXREF103" title="Consistency"></a><h3>Consistency</h3><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_438"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_439"></a><p>Consistency in the interface allows users to transfer their knowledge and skills from one application to another. Use the standard elements of the Aqua interface to ensure consistency within your application and to benefit from consistency across applications. Ask yourself the following questions when thinking about consistency in your product:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p><strong>Is it consistent with Mac OS X standards?</strong> For example, does the application use the reserved and recommended keyboard equivalents (see <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGKeyboardShortcuts/XHIGKeyboardShortcuts.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002725-CHDIGFBH">“Keyboard Shortcuts Quick Reference”</a></span>) for their correct purposes? Is it Aqua-compliant? Does it use the solutions to standard tasks Mac OS X provides? (For more information on these solutions, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGUsingTechnologies/XHIGUsingTechnologies.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-TP6">“Using Mac OS X Technologies.”</a></span>)</p></li><li class="li"><p><strong>Is it consistent within itself?</strong> Does it use consistent terminology for labels and features? Do icons mean the same thing every time they are used? Are concepts presented in similar ways across all modules? Are similar controls and other user interface elements located in similar places in windows and dialogs?</p></li><li class="li"><p><strong>Is it consistent with earlier versions of the product?</strong> Have the terms and meanings remained the same between releases? Are the fundamental concepts essentially unchanged?</p></li><li class="li"><p><strong>Is it consistent with people’s expectations?</strong> Does it meet the needs of the user without extraneous features? Does it conform to the user’s mental model? (For more information on this concept, see <span class="content_text"><a href="XHIGHIDesign.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-CJBDDFAJ">“Reflect the User’s Mental Model.”</a></span>)</p></li></ul><p>Meeting everyone’s expectations is the most difficult kind of consistency to achieve, especially if your product is likely to be used by an audience with a wide range of expertise. You can address this problem by carefully weighing the consistency issues in the context of your target audience and their needs. See <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGDesignProcess/XHIGDesignProcess.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002718-BAJHCHDB">“Know Your Audience”</a></span> for more information on how to define your audience.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-TPXREF104" title="WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get)"></a><h3>WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get)</h3><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_440"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_441"></a><p>In applications in which users can format data for printing, publish to the web, or write to film, DVD, or other formats, make sure there are no significant differences between what users see onscreen and what they receive in the final output. When the user makes changes to a document, display the results immediately; the user shouldn’t have to wait for the final output or make mental calculations about how the document will look later.

Avoid using modes that lock them into one operation and prevent them from working on anything else until that operation is completed.</p><p>Mac OS X supports enhanced modelessness with drawers and sheets. Drawers provide additional functionality while allowing continued access to the parent window. Sheets are modal dialogs attached to a parent window, replacing the use of application-modal dialogs.

Examples are holding down the mouse button to scroll text or holding down the Shift key to extend a text selection.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Alerts, in which the user must rectify an unusual situation before proceeding. Keep these to a minimum. </p></li><li class="li"><p>Installers and Assistants whose sole purpose is to guide users through important tasks.</p></li></ul><p>Other modes are acceptable if they do one of the following:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>They emulate a familiar real-life situation that is itself modal. For example, choosing different tools in a graphics application resembles the real-life choice of physical drawing tools.</p></li><li class="li"><p>They change only the attributes of something, not its behavior. The boldface and underline modes of text entry are examples.</p></li><li class="li"><p>They block most other normal operation of the system to emphasize the modality. An example is a dialog that makes all menu commands unavailable except Cut, Copy, and Paste.</p></li></ul><p>If an application uses modes, there must be a clear visual indicator of the current mode, and it should be very easy for users to get into and out of the mode. For example, in many graphics applications, the pointer can look like a pencil, a cross, a paintbrush, or an eraser, depending on the function (the mode) the user selects.

Be aware that your users might be more comfortable with another language or culture even if they live in your home country. It’s much easier to include worldwide compatibility from the beginning of your development process than to try to incorporate support for script systems after your product development is complete. For more information, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../../../../../referencelibrary/GettingStarted/GS_Internationalization/index.html" target="_top">Getting Started With Internationalization</a></span>.</p><p>Before you develop software for worldwide use, consider the issues discussed in the following sections.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-TPXREF120" title="Cultural Values"></a><h4>Cultural Values</h4><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_461"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_462"></a><p>Make sure that visible interface elements can be localized (that is, translated into other languages and otherwise adapted for use in other countries). Whenever you design a user interface, consider that various regions of the world may differ in their use of color, graphics, calendars, text, and the representation of time. Specific objects or symbols (such as electrical outlets and the currency symbol) may also have a different appearance, or not be understood, in other countries.</p><p>Graphics can enhance your application, but an image can also be offensive to certain audiences. Cultures assign varying values and characteristics to living creatures, plants, and inanimate objects. For example, in the United States the owl is a symbol of wisdom and knowledge, whereas in Central America the owl represents witchcraft and black magic. It’s a good idea to avoid the use of seasons, holidays, or calendar events in software that you expect to distribute worldwide. If you include images that represent holidays or seasons—such as Christmas trees, pumpkins, or snow—be sure they can be localized.</p><p>Different calendars are used to mark time around the world. The United States and most of Europe observe time according the Gregorian calendar. The traditional Arabic calendar, the Jewish calendar, and the Chinese calendar are lunar rather than solar. In many places, time is marked according to one calendar for business and government purposes, and another for religious events. Mac OS X allows users to select and customize the way such information is displayed in the Formats pane of International preferences. Most APIs take these locale preferences into account when getting or formatting dates, times, and number-based data, such as monetary values or measurements. In most cases, therefore, your application should not have to perform formatting or conversion tasks. See <em><a href="../../../../MacOSX/Conceptual/BPInternational/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000171i" target="_top">Internationalization Programming Topics</a></em> for more information on how to handle locale-sensitive data.</p><p>Also remember to support different address formats. Don’t assume all addresses are in the native format of your country. Address Book lets users store address data for users in multiple countries. If you support or display Address Book data, you must be prepared to handle different address formats and postal code information.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-TPXREF122" title="Language Differences"></a><h4>Language Differences</h4><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_463"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_464"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_465"></a><p>Translating text is a sophisticated, delicate task. Avoid using colloquial phrases or nonstandard usage and syntax. Carefully choose words for menu commands, dialogs, and help text. Text in U.S. English can grow up to 50 percent longer when translated to other languages. </p><p>Use complete sentences in string resources whenever possible. <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_466"></a>Grammar problems may arise when you concatenate multiple strings to create sentences; the word order may become completely different in another language, rendering the message nonsensical when translated. For example, word order in German sometimes places the verb at the end of a sentence.

Mac OS X supports <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_469"></a>Unicode, a single character set for most writing systems in the world.

When you think about designing for the wide range of abilities in your target audience, think about increasing productivity for the entire audience; be careful not to overcompensate for the disabilities of certain members. Don’t let accommodations for a particular disability create a burden for people who do not have that disability.</p><p>Mac OS X has many built-in features designed to accommodate people with special needs.

Although there may be situations in which you do not need to accommodate all these features, you should fully understand your user audience before making any design decisions that override these features. For example, it might be extremely difficult to create a visual design tool that works in grayscale, but you should still try to make the other parts of the program accessible whenever possible. </p><p>To learn more about the Mac OS X accessibility architecture and how to support accessibility in your application (a process called access enabling), see <em><a href="../../../../Accessibility/Conceptual/AccessibilityMacOSX/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001078" target="_top">Accessibility Overview</a></em>.

VoiceOver allows users to navigate the user interface of the system and any accessible application and provides an audible description of the user’s workspace and all the activities occurring on the computer. You should test your application using VoiceOver to make sure it’s fully accessible. For more information on accessibility in Mac OS X, see <em><a href="../../../../Accessibility/Conceptual/AccessibilityMacOSX/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001078" target="_top">Accessibility Overview</a></em>.</p><p>Keep in mind that some people have color-vision deficiencies. Although the judicious use of color can enhance your application’s user interface, don’t create interfaces that rely solely on color coding to convey important information. Color coding should always be redundant to other types of cues, such as text, position, or highlighting. Allowing users to select from a variety of colors to convey information enables them to choose colors appropriate for their needs.<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_484"></a></p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-TPXREF127" title="Hearing Disabilities"></a><h4>Hearing Disabilities</h4><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_485"></a><p>People with a hearing disability cannot hear auditory output at normal volume levels or cannot hear it at all. Software should never rely solely on sound to provide information; if cues are given with sound, they should be available visually as well. Since Mac OS X allows users to specify a visual cue in addition to the standard audible cue for the system alert, be sure to use the standard system alert when you need to get the user’s attention. </p><p>To indicate activity, hardware should have visible lights in addition to the sound generated by the mechanisms. Hardware that specifically produces sound should facilitate external amplification. For example, including a jack for external speakers or headphones allows people to amplify sound to an appropriate level.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-TPXREF128" title="Physical Disabilities"></a><h4>Physical Disabilities</h4><p>People who have a <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_486"></a>physical disability sometimes require additional access methods. For example, individuals may be without the use of a hand or an arm because of congenital anomalies, spinal cord injuries, repetitive stress injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome, or progressive diseases. People in this group often have difficulty with computer input devices—such as the mouse or keyboard—and with removable storage media.</p><p>Some people have difficulty pressing more than one key at a time (required for many keyboard shortcuts, for example). With <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_487"></a>Sticky Keys, which can be turned on in the Keyboard pane of Universal Access preferences, users can press keys sequentially instead of simultaneously. </p><p>Users who have difficulty with fine motor movements may be unable to use a conventional mouse or may require modifications to keyboard behavior. In Keyboard preferences, users can choose how long they must press a key before it repeats; they may also specify a delay between when a key is pressed and when it is registered. In addition, Mac OS X provides ways for users to perform actions using the keyboard instead of the mouse. When full keyboard access mode is on, users can navigate to and select interface items using the keyboard. <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_488"></a>Mouse Keys, which can be turned on in the Mouse pane of Universal Access preferences, enables users to control the mouse with the numeric keypad to perform tasks such as dragging and resizing windows.</p><p>Make sure your application does not override any keyboard navigation settings.

When an assistive technology is enabled, keyboard shortcuts used by that technology take precedence over the ones defined in your program. </p><p>If you design hardware, be sure not to impose physical barriers that would impede someone with limited or no use of the hands or arms.

Don’t copy other platforms’ user interface elements or behaviors in Mac OS X, because they may confuse users who aren’t familiar with them.</p><p>If you need to extend the interface of Mac OS X, the best place to begin is with the already defined visual and behavioral language. Think about what the appearance communicates to people (the look) and how they expect the element to behave (the feel).</p><p>Visual cues, such as the arrow on a pop-up menu, help people recognize familiar elements. People learn to associate certain behaviors with specific elements based on their appearance. For example, people recognize push buttons by their rounded shape and look for a label that identifies the action the button causes. This particular appearance distinguishes a push button from other types of elements. When people click a button, they expect it to be highlighted to indicate that the action took effect, and they expect the action to take effect immediately. People may also expect that clicking a button will have additional behaviors related to it, such as dismissing a dialog or changing the content area of the active document. </p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-TPXREF112" title="Don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t Assign New Behaviors to Existing Objects"></a><h3>Don’t Assign New Behaviors to Existing Objects</h3><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_492"></a><p>When you use existing interface building blocks, use them in the standard way. Make sure you do not change the behavior of standard elements. When you need a new behavior, design a new element for it. If elements behave differently in different situations, the interface becomes unpredictable and therefore harder to figure out. This can adversely affect the user’s confidence in your application.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-TPXREF113" title="Create a New Interface Element Cautiously"></a><h3>Create a New Interface Element Cautiously</h3><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-DontLinkElementID_493"></a><p>Be very cautious about creating new interface elements because you may introduce unnecessary complexity. You will have to work extremely hard to make sure that any newly introduced elements fit in with those provided by Cocoa and Carbon. Additionally, as the Aqua user interface continues to evolve, your custom elements will require updating to adapt to changes in Aqua. </p><p>Before implementing a new interface element,<em> make sure</em> that you can’t use existing elements or a combination of them to achieve the desired result. Usability testing is essential for determining whether a new element works.</p>
