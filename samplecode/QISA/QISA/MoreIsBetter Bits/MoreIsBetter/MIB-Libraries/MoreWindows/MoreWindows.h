IIRC PCG added them for reasons I don't fully understand.  He may have meant #pragma internal.  Regardless, there presence was causing lots of MIB symbols to be CFM exported, which is wrong.  MIB is not meant to ship as a shared library.Revision 1.11  2002/11/09 00:15:38  eskimo1When using framework includes, explicitly include the frameworks we need.Revision 1.10  2001/11/07 15:56:08  eskimo1Tidy up headers, add CVS logs, update copyright.         <9>     21/9/01    Quinn   Get rid of wacky Finder label.         <8>     21/9/01    Quinn   Changes for CWPro7 Mach-O build.         <7>     20/9/01    Quinn   Upgrade to CWPro7.         <6>    22/12/00    Quinn   Added a bunch of new APIs.         <5>     20/3/00    Quinn   Added GetWindowList for non-Carbon clients.         <4>     1/25/99    PCG     TARGET_CARBON         <3>    11/11/98    PCG     fix headers         <2>    11/11/98    PCG     fix header         <1>    11/10/98    PCG     first big re-org at behest of Quinn	Old Change History (most recent first):         <4>    10/11/98    Quinn   Convert "MorePrefix.h" to "MoreSetup.h".         <3>      9/9/98    PCG     re-work import and export pragmas         <2>     7/24/98    PCG	    coddle linker (C++, CFM-68K)         <1>     6/16/98    PCG     initial checkin*/#pragma once#include "MoreSetup.h"#if MORE_FRAMEWORK_INCLUDES	#include <Carbon/Carbon.h>#else	#include <MacWindows.h>#endif#ifdef __cplusplus	extern "C" {#endifpascal OSStatus		MoveWindowToAlertPosition	(WindowRef);pascal OSErr		MoreNewWindow				(	const Rect *			boundsRect,													ConstStr255Param 		title,													short 					theProc,													Boolean 				goAwayFlag,													long 					refCon,													WindowRef				*window				);#if !TARGET_API_MAC_CARBON	extern pascal WindowRef GetWindowList(void);#endifextern pascal Boolean WindowHasEmbeddingHierarchy(WindowPtr window);	// Returns true if the window has a control embedding hierarchy.extern pascal OSStatus MoreGetWindowRegion(WindowRef window, WindowRegionCode inRegionCode, RgnHandle ioWinRgn);	// A version of MoreGetWindowRegion that supports an inRegionCode 	// of kWindowStructureRgn or kWindowContentRgn on all platforms, 	// not just 8.5 and higher.extern pascal RgnHandle MoreGetWindowContentRegion  (WindowRef window);extern pascal RgnHandle MoreGetWindowStructureRegion(WindowRef window);extern pascal RgnHandle MoreGetWindowVisibleRegion  (WindowRef window);	// These routines all return a region handle for one of the windows 	// well known regions.
