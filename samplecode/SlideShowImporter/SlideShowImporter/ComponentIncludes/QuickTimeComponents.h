    Helper Macros
    
        These macros allow you to easily add entities and attributes to the parser
        in an error free manner when the identifiers are defined in a particular manner.
        For these to work, you must define the identifiers as follows:
        
        For entities, they must be defined as element_elementName, as in:
        
            enum
            {
                element_xml =   1,      //  "xml"
                element_head,           //  "head"
                element_body            //  "body"
            };
            
        If the element name has characters that are illegal in an identifier,
        some of the macros support that, but the identifier must not contain
        the illegal characters:
        
            enum
            {
                element_rootlayout      //  "root-layout"
            }
            
        For attribute names, similar rules apply except that they must be defined
        as attr_attributeName, as in:
            
            enum
            {
                attr_src    =   1,      //  "src"
