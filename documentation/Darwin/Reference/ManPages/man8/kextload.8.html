KEXTLOAD(8)               BSD System Manager's Manual              KEXTLOAD(8)

<b>NAME</b>
     <b>kextload</b> -- loads, validates, and generates symbols for a kernel extension (kext)

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
     <b>kextload</b> [<b>-h</b>] [ <b>-v</b> [0-6] | <b>-q</b> ] [<b>-t</b>] [<b>-i</b> | <b>-I</b>] [<b>-x</b>] [<b>-z</b>] [<b>-e</b>] [<b>-c</b>] [<b>-D</b>] [<b>-k</b> <u>kernel</u><b>_</b><u>file</u>] [<b>-d</b> <u>extension</u>]
              ...  [<b>-r</b> <u>directory</u>] ...  [ <b>-l</b> | <b>-m</b> | <b>-n</b> | <b>-A</b> | <b>-a</b> <u>kext</u><b>_</b><u>id@address</u> ] ...  [<b>-s</b> <u>directory</u>]
              [<b>-p</b> <u>personality</u>] ...  [<b>-b</b> <u>bundle</u><b>_</b><u>id</u>] ...  [<b>--</b>] [<u>extension</u>] ...

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
     The <b>kextload</b> program is used to explicitly load kernel extensions (kexts), validate them to see that
     they can be loaded by other mechanisms, such as <a href="kextd.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/kextd">kextd(8)</a>, and to generate symbol files for debugging
     the kext in a running kernel.  In order to load a kext into the kernel <b>kextload</b> must be invoked as the
     superuser; for all other uses it can be invoked by any user.

     <b>kextload</b> is a formal interface for kext loading in the Darwin OS and in Mac OS X.  Software and
     installers can rely on its presence and invoke it in order to load kexts.

     <b>kextload</b> has many options, but most of them are rarely necessary.  See the EXAMPLES section for tips on
     common uses.  The arguments and options available are these:

     <u>extension</u>
              The pathname of a kext bundle to load or otherwise use.  Kexts can also be specified by
              CFBundleIdentifier with the <b>-b</b> option.

     <b>-a</b> <u>kext</u><b>_</b><u>id@address</u>
              Treat the kext whose CFBundleIdenfier is <u>kext</u><b>_</b><u>id</u> as being loaded at <u>address</u> when generating
              symbol files and not loading.  When generating symbols only, all dependencies must have known
              addresses.  Use this option repeatedly for every nonkernel dependency.  This option implies
              the use of the <b>-n</b> option. See also <b>-A</b> and <b>-n</b>.

     <b>-A</b>       When generating symbol files and not loading, look up all dependency kext addresses within the
              running kernel.  This option implies the use of the <b>-n</b> option. See also <b>-a</b> and <b>-n</b>.

     <b>-b</b> <u>bundle</u><b>_</b><u>id</u>
              Look up the kext whose CFBundleIdentifier is <u>bundle</u><b>_</b><u>id</u> within the set of known kexts and load
              it.  See the <b>-d</b>, <b>-e</b>, and <b>-r</b> options for more information.

     <b>-c</b>       Ignore any repository cache files and scan all kext bundles to gather information.  If this
              option is not given, <b>kextload</b> will attempt to use cache files and to create them if they are
              out of date or don't exist.

     <b>-d</b> <u>extension</u>
              Add <u>extension</u> to the set of known kexts for resolving dependencies.  This is useful for adding
              a single kext from a directory while excluding the others.  See the <b>-e</b> and <b>-r</b> options for more
              information.

     <b>-D</b>       Don't check the kernel for already loaded kexts when resolving dependencies.  This behavior is
              now the default and so this option is deprecated and redundant.  Note that this can result in
              load failures if a different version of a dependency is already loaded.  This option is rele-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">vant&nbsp;relevant</font>
              vant only when loading a kext into the kernel.  The <b>-A</b> option overrides this option as it must
              check the kernel for which kexts are loaded.

     <b>-e</b>       Don't use the contents of /System/Library/Extensions as the default repository of kexts.  If
              you use this option you will have to explicitly specify all dependencies of the kext being
              loaded or otherwise worked on using the <b>-d</b> and <b>-r</b> options.

     <b>-h</b>       Print a help message describing each option flag.

     <b>-i</b>       Interactive mode; pause at each stage of loading for user input to continue.  This allows for
              debugger setup when the kext needs to be debugged during its earliest stages of running.

     <b>-I</b>       (capital i) Interactive mode as <b>-i</b> for the specified kext and all of its dependencies.

     <b>-k</b> <u>kernel</u><b>_</b><u>file</u>
              Link against the given <u>kernel</u><b>_</b><u>file</u>.  Allowed only with the <b>-n</b> option to generate debug sym-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">bols.&nbsp;symbols.</font>
              bols.  By default <b>kextload</b> attempts to get link symbols from the running kernel,

     <u>/var/run/mach.sym</u>,
              and

     <u>/mach</u><b>_</b><u>kernel</u>,
              in that order (the UUIDs must match that of the running kernel for the disk-based files).

     <b>-l</b>       Load and start the kext only; don't send I/O Kit personalities to the kernel to begin match-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing.&nbsp;matching.</font>
              ing.  Matching may still occur if the personalities are present from an earlier load opera-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion.&nbsp;operation.</font>
              tion.  You may want to use <a href="kextunload.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/kextunload">kextunload(8)</a> before loading a kext with this option.

     <b>-L</b>       Same as <b>-r</b> (remains for backward compatibility).

     <b>-m</b>       Don't load the kext, but do send its personalities to the kernel to begin matching.  Use this
              option after you have loaded a driver with <b>-l</b> and after setting up the debugger.

     <b>-n</b>       Neither load the kext nor send personalities to the kernel.  This option is for use when gen-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">erating&nbsp;generating</font>
              erating debug symbols only with the <b>-s</b> option, or when validating kexts with the <b>-t</b> option.
              See also the <b>-a</b> and <b>-</b> A options.

     <b>-p</b> <u>personality</u>
              Send only the named personalities from the kext to the kernel. Repeat for each personality
              desired, or use the <b>-i</b> option to have <b>kextload</b> ask for each personality.

     <b>-q</b>       Quiet mode; print no informational or error messages.  This option excludes <b>-v</b>.  If <b>kextload</b>
              is run with <b>-q</b> in a way that might require user interaction, as with the <b>-i</b> and <b>-I</b> options,
              and some uses of <b>-n</b>, the program will silently exit with an error status.

     <b>-r</b> <u>directory</u>
              Use <u>directory</u> as a repository of kexts.  This adds to the set of known kexts for resolving
              dependencies or looking up by CFBundleIdentifier when using the <b>-b</b> option.  This is not recur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sive;&nbsp;recursive;</font>
              sive; only the directory's immediate contents are scanned.  See also the <b>-c</b>, <b>-d</b>, and <b>-e</b>
              options.

     <b>-s</b> <u>directory</u>
              Write all generated symbol files into <u>directory</u>.  The directory must already exist.  Symbol
              files are named after the CFBundleIdentifier of each kexts with a <u>.sym</u> suffix appended.

     <b>-t</b>       Perform all possible tests on the named <!-- a -->kext(s)<!-- /a --> and indicate whether the kext is loadable, or
              if not, what problems it has.  Note that tests are performed in three stages, validation,
              authentication, and dependency resolution; a failure at any stage can make tests in further
              stages impossible.  Thus, a kext with validation failures may have unreported authentication
              problems or missing dependencies.

     <b>-v</b> [1-6]
              Verbose mode; print information about the kext scanning and loading process. Higher levels of
              verbosity include all lower levels.  The levels of verbose output are these:

              0    suppresses informational messages (errors are still printed); see also <b>-q</b>

              1    prints basic kext scanning information

              2    prints basic load information

              3    prints detailed kext scanning information

              4    prints basic information on every kext encountered

              5    prints detailed information on every kext encountered

              6    prints detailed load information
              If <b>-v</b> is not specified only the essential information about the load operation is printed
              (such as whether the kext was already  loaded).

              A kext can also specify verbose printing for just itself using the OSBundleDebugLevel top-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">level&nbsp;toplevel</font>
              level info dictionary property.  Its values are 1 and 2, for basic and detailed information,
              respectively.

              This option excludes <b>-</b> q .

     <b>-x</b>       Run <b>kextload</b> in safe boot mode (indicating startup with the Shift key held down).  Kexts that
              don't specify a proper value for the OSBundleRequired info dictionary property, or those in
              which every personality contains a nonzero IOKitDebug property, will not load.  This option
              implies the use of the <b>-c</b> option.

     <b>-z</b>       Don't authenticate kexts.  This option is for convenience during development, and is allowed
              only for operations that don't actually load a kext into the kernel (such as when generating
              symbols).

     <b>-Z</b>       Don't try to resolve dependencies.  This option is allowed only when using the <b>-n</b> and <b>-t</b>
              options to test a kext for problems.  It is not allowed with the <b>-s</b> option as generating sym-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">bols&nbsp;symbols</font>
              bols requires dependencies to be resolved.

     <b>--</b>       End of all options. Only kext names follow.

<b>EXAMPLES</b>
     Here are the common uses and usage patterns for <b>kextload</b>.

   <b>Basic</b> <b>loading</b>
     To load a kext you must run <b>kextload</b> as the superuser and supply a kext bundle name; no options are
     required:

               kextload TabletDriver.kext

     Alternatively, you can use the <b>-b</b> option to specify a kext by its CFBundleIdentifier:

               kextload -b com.mycompany.driver.TabletDriver

     With no additional options <b>kextload</b> will look in /System/Library/Extensions for a kext with the given
     CFBundleIdentifier.  Adding repository directories with the <b>-r</b> option or individual kexts with the <b>-d</b>
     option expands the set of kexts that <b>kextload</b> looks among:

               kextload -r ${USER}/Library/Extensions TabletDriver.kext

     If you're modifying system startup to load a kext, be sure to check whether the system is starting up
     in safe boot mode (typically when the user presses the Shift key) and use the <b>-x</b> option to indicate
     this.  (The various rc files in /etc can simply use the $SafeBoot shell variable on the command line.
     It evaluates to an empty string during normal startup and "-x" during safe boot mode.)

   <b>Validating</b> <b>Kexts</b>
     The <b>-t</b> option causes <b>kextload</b> to perform all possible validation and authentication checks on the spec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ified&nbsp;specified</font>
     ified kexts and to attempt to resolve their dependencies.  If there are any problems with the specified
     kexts, <b>kextload</b> prints a list of the problems.

     The <b>-t</b> option is typically used with <b>-n</b> after a load failure to pinpoint a problem.  It can be used
     with any other set of options, however.

     If you want to validate a kext in isolation, as in a build environment where dependencies may not be
     available, you can use the <b>-e</b> and <b>-Z</b> options to omit the /System/Library/Extensions repository and to
     suppress dependency resolution, respectively:

               kextload -entZ PacketSniffer.kext

     Only validation and authentication checks will be performed.

   <b>Generating</b> <b>Debug</b> <b>Symbols</b> <b>When</b> <b>Loading</b>
     To generate a symbol file for use with gdb when loading a kext, use the <b>-s</b> option to specify a direc-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tory&nbsp;directory</font>
     tory where symbol files will be written for the kext being loaded and all its dependencies.

               kextload -s ~/ksyms PacketSniffer.kext

   <b>Generating</b> <b>Debug</b> <b>Symbols</b> <b>For</b> <b>an</b> <b>Already-Loaded</b> <b>Kext</b>
     If you want to generate symbols for a kext that's already loaded, whether on the same system or on
     another, use the <b>-s</b> option along with the <b>-n</b> option.  Since in this case addresses must be known for
     the kext and all its dependencies, though, you must specify these.  If you don't indicate them on the
     command line, <b>kextload</b> will ask you for the load address of each kext needed.  Use <a href="kextstat.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/kextstat">kextstat(8)</a> on the
     machine you're generating symbols for to get these addresses and enter them at each prompt.

               kextload -n -s ~/ksyms GrobbleEthernet.kext
               enter the hexadecimal load addresses for these modules:
               com.apple.iokit.IONetworkingFamily: 0x1001000
               ...

     Alternatively, if you know the CFBundleIdentifiers of all the kexts, you can use the <b>-a</b> option for each
     kext (you needn't specify <b>-n</b> when using the <b>-a</b> option):

               kextload -s ~/ksyms \
               -a com.apple.iokit.IONetworkingFamily@0x1001000 \
               -a com.apple.iokit.IOPCIFamily@0x1004000 \
               -a com.mycompany.driver.GrobbleEthernet@0x1007000 \
               GrobbleEthernet.kext

     Simplest of all, however, provided you can run <b>kextload</b> on the same machine as the loaded kext, is to
     use the <b>-A</b> option, which checks with the kernel for all loaded kexts and automatically gets their load
     addresses.

               kextload -s ~/ksyms -A GrobbleEthernet.kext

   <b>Explicitly</b> <b>Specifying</b> <b>Dependencies</b>
     Because <b>kextload</b> resolves dependencies automatically, it's possible that a kext other than the one you
     intend might get used as a dependency (such as when there are multiple versions, or if you're working
     on a new version of a kext that's already installed in /System/Library/Extensions).  By default, when
     loading a kext into the kernel <b>kextload</b> checks which versions of possible dependencies are already
     loaded in order to assure a successful load.  When not loading, however, it always chooses the most
     recent versions of any dependencies.

     If you want to have complete control over the set of extensions used to resolve dependencies, use the
     <b>-e</b>, <b>-d</b>, and <b>-r</b> options.  The <b>-e</b> option excludes the standard /System/Library/Extensions folder, leaving
     the set of candidate extensions for dependency resolution entirely up to you.  To specify candidate
     dependencies you use either <b>-d</b>, which names a single kext as a candidate, or <b>-r</b>, which adds an entire
     directory of extensions.

               kextload -n -s ~/ksyms -e \
               -d /System/Library/Extensions/System.kext \
               -r ~/TestKexts -d JoystickSupport.kext JoystickDriver.kext

     Note also that if you use <b>-e</b>, you must supply some version of the System.kext bundle in order to supply
     information about the kernel.  This should always match the kernel you're linking against, which is by
     default the installed kernel on the machine you're using <b>kextload</b> on; you can use the <b>-k</b> option to
     indicate a different kernel file.

   <b>Debug-Loading</b> <b>an</b> <b>I/O</b> <b>Kit</b> <b>Driver</b>
     If you need to debug an I/O Kit driver's early startup code, you must load the driver on the target
     machine without starting matching by using the <b>-l</b> option:

               kextload -l DiskController.kext

     Once you have done this, you can use the generated symbol file in your debug session to set breakpoints
     and then trigger matching by running <b>kextload</b> again on the target machine with the <b>-m</b> option:

               kextload -m DiskController.kext

     You may wish to use the <b>-p</b> option as well in order to send selected personalities to the kernel.
     Alternatively, you can use the <b>-i</b> option for the whole process, which causes <b>kextload</b> to pause just
     before loading any personalities and then to ask you for each personality whether that one should be
     sent to the kernel:

               kextload -i DiskController.kext

   <b>Debug-Loading</b> <b>a</b> <b>non-I/O</b> <b>Kit</b> <b>Kext</b>
     A non-I/O Kit kext doesn't have a personality-matching phase of loading; it just starts executing.  In
     order to debug a non-I/O Kit kext's startup code, you must use the <b>-i</b> or <b>-I</b> option, which pauses load-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;loading</font>
     ing at each significant stage so that you can set up your debugging session as needed before proceed-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing.&nbsp;proceeding.</font>
     ing.

<b>FILES</b>
     /System/Library/Extensions  The standard system repository of kernel extensions
     directoryname/Caches/*      Cache files for a given directory of kernel extensions
     /var/run/mach.sym           The symbol file for the running kernel, written by <a href="kextd.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/kextd">kextd(8)</a> at system
                                 startup.
     /mach_kernel                The default kernel file, used for linking as a last resort.

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
     <b>kextload</b> exits with a zero status upon success.  Upon failure, it prints an error message and continues
     processing any kexts if possible, then exits with a nonzero status.

     For a kext to be loadable, it must be valid, authentic, have all dependencies met (that is, all depen-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dencies&nbsp;dependencies</font>
     dencies must be found and loadable).  A valid kext has a well formed bundle, info dictionary, and exe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cutable.&nbsp;executable.</font>
     cutable.  An authentic kext's component files are owned by root:wheel, with permissions nonwritable by
     group and other.  If your kext fails to load, try using the <b>-t</b> option to print diagnostics related to
     validation and authentication.

     Also, of course, the executable must contain code for the host machine's architecture and link success-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fully.&nbsp;successfully.</font>
     fully.  However, since this is expensive to do, these checks are not made unless the kext is actually
     being linked.  You can confirm these aspects of loadability by attempting to generate symbol files
     using the <b>-s</b> option.

<b>BUGS</b>
     Upon encountering a kext with validation errors, <b>kextload</b> typically prints an error message about that
     kext, even if it isn't involved in the load request.
