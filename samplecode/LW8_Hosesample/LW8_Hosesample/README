This sample code demonstrates how a LaserWriter communication hose plug-in can be written. An Irda (Infrared) hose is used here as an example.This sample can be built with CodeWarrior Pro 4.  End product is a file named "HoseIrdaLib" which should be copied into :Extensions:Printing Plug-ins: folder to take effect.Communications Toolbox is used in this implementation to interface with IrDA. For a description of how to write a LaserWriter 8 Plug-in, please read "Writing Hoses for LaserWriter 8"  and "Printing Plug-ins Manager Specification" on Apple’s Developer Technote site http://developer.apple.com/technotes/.
