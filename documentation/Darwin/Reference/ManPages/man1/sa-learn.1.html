<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       Given a typical selection of your incoming mail classified as spam or ham (non-spam), this tool will
       feed each mail to SpamAssassin, allowing it to 'learn' what signs are likely to mean spam, and which
       are likely to mean ham.

       Simply run this command once for each of your mail folders, and it will ''learn'' from the mail
       therein.

       Note that csh-style <u>globbing</u> in the mail folder names is supported; in other words, listing a folder
       name as "*" will scan every folder that matches.  See "Mail::SpamAssassin::ArchiveIterator" for more
       details.

       SpamAssassin remembers which mail messages it has learnt already, and will not re-learn those
       messages again, unless you use the <b>--forget</b> option. Messages learnt as spam will have SpamAssassin
       markup removed, on the fly.

       If you make a mistake and scan a mail as ham when it is spam, or vice versa, simply rerun this
       command with the correct classification, and the mistake will be corrected.  SpamAssassin will
       automatically 'forget' the previous indications.

       Users of "spamd" who wish to perform training remotely, over a network, should investigate the "spamc
       -L" switch.

<b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>--ham</b>
           Learn the input <!-- a -->message(s)<!-- /a --> as ham.   If you have previously learnt any of the messages as spam,
           SpamAssassin will forget them first, then re-learn them as ham.  Alternatively, if you have
           previously learnt them as ham, it'll skip them this time around.  If the messages have already
           been filtered through SpamAssassin, the learner will ignore any modifications SpamAssassin may
           have made.

       <b>--spam</b>
           Learn the input <!-- a -->message(s)<!-- /a --> as spam.   If you have previously learnt any of the messages as ham,
           SpamAssassin will forget them first, then re-learn them as spam.  Alternatively, if you have
           previously learnt them as spam, it'll skip them this time around.  If the messages have already
           been filtered through SpamAssassin, the learner will ignore any modifications SpamAssassin may
           have made.

       <b>--folders</b>=<u>filename</u>, <b>-f</b> <u>filename</u>
           sa-learn will read in the list of folders from the specified file, one folder per line in the
           file.  If the folder is prefixed with "ham:type:" or "spam:type:", sa-learn will learn that
           folder appropriately, otherwise the folders will be assumed to be of the type specified by <b>--ham</b>
           or <b>--spam</b>.

           "type" above is optional, but is the same as the standard for ArchiveIterator: mbox, mbx, dir,
           file, or detect (the default if not specified).

       <b>--mbox</b>
           sa-learn will read in the <!-- a -->file(s)<!-- /a --> containing the emails to be learned, and will process them in
           mbox format (one or more emails per file).

       <b>--mbx</b>
           sa-learn will read in the <!-- a -->file(s)<!-- /a --> containing the emails to be learned, and will process them in
           mbx format (one or more emails per file).

       <b>--use-ignores</b>
           Don't learn the message if a from address matches configuration file item "bayes_ignore_from" or
           a to address matches "bayes_ignore_to".  The option might be used when learning from a large file
           of messages from which the hammy spam messages or spammy ham messages have not been removed.

       <b>--sync</b>
           Syncronize the journal and databases.  Upon successfully syncing the database with the entries in
           the journal, the journal file is removed.

       <b>--force-expire</b>
           Forces an expiry attempt, regardless of whether it may be necessary or not.  Note: This doesn't
           mean any tokens will actually expire.  Please see the EXPIRATION section below.

           Note: "--force-expire" also causes the journal data to be synchronized into the Bayes databases.

       <b>--forget</b>
           Forget a given message previously learnt.

       <b>--dbpath</b>
           Allows a commandline override of the <u>bayes</u><b>_</b><u>path</u> configuration option.

       <b>--dump</b> <u>option</u>
           Display the contents of the Bayes database.  Without an option or with the <u>all</u> option, all magic
           tokens and data tokens will be displayed.  <u>magic</u> will only display magic tokens, and <u>data</u> will
           only display the data tokens.

           Can also use the <b>--regexp</b> <u>RE</u> option to specify which tokens to display based on a regular
           expression.

       <b>--clear</b>
           Clear an existing Bayes database by removing all traces of the database.

           WARNING: This is destructive and should be used with care.

       <b>--backup</b>
           Performs a dump of the Bayes database in machine/human readable format.

           The dump will include token and seen data.  It is suitable for input back into the --restore
           command.

       <b>--restore</b>=<u>filename</u>
           Performs a restore of the Bayes database defined by <u>filename</u>.

           WARNING: This is a destructive operation, previous Bayes data will be wiped out.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print help message and exit.

       <b>-u</b> <u>username</u>, <b>--username</b>=<u>username</u>
           If specified this username will override the username taken from the runtime environment.  You
           can use this option to specify users in a virtual user configuration.

           NOTE: This option will not change to the given <u>username</u>, it will only attempt to act on behalf of
           that user.  Because of this you will need to have proper permissions to be able to change files
           owned by <u>username</u>.  In the case of SQL this generally is not a problem.

       <b>-C</b> <u>path</u>, <b>--configpath</b>=<u>path</u>, <b>--config-file</b>=<u>path</u>
           Use the specified path for locating the distributed configuration files.  Ignore the default
           directories (usually "/usr/share/spamassassin" or similar).

       <b>--siteconfigpath</b>=<u>path</u>
           Use the specified path for locating site-specific configuration files.  Ignore the default
           directories (usually "/etc/mail/spamassassin" or similar).

       <b>--cf='config</b> <b>line'</b>
           Add additional lines of configuration directly from the command-line, parsed after the
           configuration files are read.   Multiple <b>--cf</b> arguments can be used, and each will be considered
           a separate line of configuration.

       <b>-p</b> <u>prefs</u>, <b>--prefspath</b>=<u>prefs</u>, <b>--prefs-file</b>=<u>prefs</u>
           Read user score preferences from <u>prefs</u> (usually "$HOME/.spamassassin/user_prefs").

       <b>--progress</b>
           Prints a progress bar (to STDERR) showing the current progress.  In the case where no valid
           terminal is found this option will behave very much like the --showdots option.

       <b>-D</b> [<u>area,...</u>], <b>--debug</b> [<u>area,...</u>]
           Produce debugging output. If no areas are listed, all debugging information is printed.
           Diagnostic output can also be enabled for each area individually; <u>area</u> is the area of the code to
           instrument. For example, to produce diagnostic output on bayes, learn, and dns, use:

                   spamassassin -D bayes,learn,dns

           For more information about which areas (also known as channels) are available, please see the
           documentation at:

                   C&lt;<a href="http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/DebugChannels">http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/DebugChannels</a>

           Higher priority informational messages that are suitable for logging in normal circumstances are
           available with an area of "info".

       <b>--no-sync</b>
           Skip the slow synchronization step which normally takes place after changing database entries.
           If you plan to learn from many folders in a batch, or to learn many individual messages one-by-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">one,&nbsp;one-byone,</font>
           one, it is faster to use this switch and run "sa-learn --sync" once all the folders have been
           scanned.

           Clarification: The state of <u>--no-sync</u> overrides the <u>bayes</u><b>_</b><u>learn</u><b>_</b><u>to</u><b>_</b><u>journal</u> configuration option.
           If not specified, sa-learn will learn to the database directly.  If specified, sa-learn will
           learn to the journal file.

           Note: <u>--sync</u> and <u>--no-sync</u> can be specified on the same commandline, which is slightly confusing.
           In this case, the <u>--no-sync</u> option is ignored since there is no learn operation.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--local</b>
           Do not perform any network accesses while learning details about the mail messages.  This will
           speed up the learning process, but may result in a slightly lower accuracy.

           Note that this is currently ignored, as current versions of SpamAssassin will not perform network
           access while learning; but future versions may.

       <b>--import</b>
           If you previously used SpamAssassin's Bayesian learner without the "DB_File" module installed, it
           will have created files in other formats, such as "GDBM_File", "NDBM_File", or "SDBM_File".  This
           switch allows you to migrate that old data into the "DB_File" format.  It will overwrite any data
           currently in the "DB_File".

           Can also be used with the <b>--dbpath</b> <u>path</u> option to specify the location of the Bayes files to use.

<b>MIGRATION</b>
       There are now multiple backend storage modules available for storing user's bayesian data. As such
       you might want to migrate from one backend to another. Here is a simple procedure for migrating from
       one backend to another.

       Note that if you have individual user databases you will have to perform a similar procedure for each
       one of them.

       sa-learn --sync
           This will sync any outstanding journal entries

       sa-learn --backup &gt; backup.txt
           This will save all your Bayes data to a plain text file.

       sa-learn --clear
           This is optional, but good to do to clear out the old database.

       Repeat!
           At this point, if you have multiple databases, you should perform the procedure above for each of
           them. (i.e. each user's database needs to be backed up before continuing.)

       Switch backends
           Once you have backed up all databases you can update your configuration for the new database
           backend. This will involve at least the bayes_store_module config option and may involve some
           additional config options depending on what is required by the module. (For example, you may need
           to configure an SQL database.)

       sa-learn --restore backup.txt
           Again, you need to do this for every database.

       If you are migrating to SQL you can make use of the -u &lt;username&gt; option in sa-learn to populate each
       user's database. Otherwise, you must run sa-learn as the user who database you are restoring.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b> <b>TO</b> <b>BAYESIAN</b> <b>FILTERING</b>
       (Thanks to Michael Bell for this section!)

       For a more lengthy description of how this works, go to <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/">http://www.paulgraham.com/</a> and see "A Plan
       for Spam". It's reasonably readable, even if statistics make me break out in hives.

       The short semi-inaccurate version: Given training, a spam heuristics engine can take the most
       "spammy" and "hammy" words and apply probabilistic analysis. Furthermore, once given a basis for the
       analysis, the engine can continue to learn iteratively by applying both the non-Bayesian and Bayesian
       rulesets together to create evolving "intelligence".

       SpamAssassin 2.50 and later supports Bayesian spam analysis, in the form of the BAYES rules. This is
       a new feature, quite powerful, and is disabled until enough messages have been learnt.

       The pros of Bayesian spam analysis:

       Can greatly reduce false positives and false negatives.
           It learns from your mail, so it is tailored to your unique e-mail flow.

       Once it starts learning, it can continue to learn from SpamAssassin and improve over time.

       And the cons:

       A decent number of messages are required before results are useful for ham/spam determination.
       It's hard to explain why a message is or isn't marked as spam.
           i.e.: a straightforward rule, that matches, say, "VIAGRA" is easy to understand. If it generates
           a false positive or false negative, it is fairly easy to understand why.

           With Bayesian analysis, it's all probabilities - "because the past says it is likely as this
           falls into a probabilistic distribution common to past spam in your systems". Tell that to your
           users!  Tell that to the client when he asks "what can I do to change this". (By the way, the
           answer in this case is "use whitelisting".)

       It will take disk space and memory.
           The databases it maintains take quite a lot of resources to store and use.

<b>GETTING</b> <b>STARTED</b>
       Still interested? Ok, here's the guidelines for getting this working.

       First a high-level overview:

       Build a significant sample of both ham and spam.
           I suggest several thousand of each, placed in SPAM and HAM directories or mailboxes.  Yes, you
           MUST hand-sort this - otherwise the results won't be much better than SpamAssassin on its own.
           Verify the spamminess/haminess of EVERY message.  You're urged to avoid using a publicly
           available corpus (sample) - this must be taken from YOUR mail server, if it is to be
           statistically useful.  Otherwise, the results may be pretty skewed.

       Use this tool to teach SpamAssassin about these samples, like so:
                   sa-learn --spam /path/to/spam/folder
                   sa-learn --ham /path/to/ham/folder
                   ...

           Let SpamAssassin proceed, learning stuff. When it finds ham and spam it will add the "interesting
           tokens" to the database.

       If you need SpamAssassin to forget about specific messages, use the <b>--forget</b> option.
           This can be applied to either ham or spam that has run through the <b>sa-learn</b> processes. It's a bit
           of a hammer, really, lowering the weighting of the specific tokens in that message (only if that
           message has been processed before).

       Learning from single messages uses a command like this:
                   sa-learn --ham --no-sync mailmessage

           This is handy for binding to a key in your mail user agent.  It's very fast, as all the time-
           consuming stuff is deferred until you run with the "--sync" option.

       Autolearning is enabled by default
           If you don't have a corpus of mail saved to learn, you can let SpamAssassin automatically learn
           the mail that you receive.  If you are autolearning from scratch, the amount of mail you receive
           will determine how long until the BAYES_* rules are activated.

<b>EFFECTIVE</b> <b>TRAINING</b>
       Learning filters require training to be effective.  If you don't train them, they won't work.  In
       addition, you need to train them with new messages regularly to keep them up-to-date, or their data
       will become stale and impact accuracy.

       You need to train with both spam <u>and</u> ham mails.  One type of mail alone will not have any effect.

       Note that if your mail folders contain things like forwarded spam, discussions of spam-catching
       rules, etc., this will cause trouble.  You should avoid scanning those messages if possible.  (An
       easy way to do this is to move them aside, into a folder which is not scanned.)

       If the messages you are learning from have already been filtered through SpamAssassin, the learner
       will compensate for this.  In effect, it learns what each message would look like if you had run
       "spamassassin -d" over it in advance.

       Another thing to be aware of, is that typically you should aim to train with at least 1000 messages
       of spam, and 1000 ham messages, if possible.  More is better, but anything over about 5000 messages
       does not improve accuracy significantly in our tests.

       Be careful that you train from the same source -- for example, if you train on old spam, but new ham
       mail, then the classifier will think that a mail with an old date stamp is likely to be spam.

       It's also worth noting that training with a very small quantity of ham, will produce atrocious
       results.  You should aim to train with at least the same amount (or more if possible!) of ham data
       than spam.

       On an on-going basis, it is best to keep training the filter to make sure it has fresh data to work
       from.  There are various ways to do this:

       1. Supervised learning
           This means keeping a copy of all or most of your mail, separated into spam and ham piles, and
           periodically re-training using those.  It produces the best results, but requires more work from
           you, the user.

           (An easy way to do this, by the way, is to create a new folder for 'deleted' messages, and
           instead of deleting them from other folders, simply move them in there instead.  Then keep all
           spam in a separate folder and never delete it.  As long as you remember to move misclassified
           mails into the correct folder set, it is easy enough to keep up to date.)

       2. Unsupervised learning from Bayesian classification
           Another way to train is to chain the results of the Bayesian classifier back into the training,
           so it reinforces its own decisions.  This is only safe if you then retrain it based on any errors
           you discover.

           SpamAssassin does not support this method, due to experimental results which strongly indicate
           that it does not work well, and since Bayes is only one part of the resulting score presented to
           the user (while Bayes may have made the wrong decision about a mail, it may have been overridden
           by another system).

       3. Unsupervised learning from SpamAssassin rules
           Also called 'auto-learning' in SpamAssassin.  Based on statistical analysis of the SpamAssassin
           success rates, we can automatically train the Bayesian database with a certain degree of
           confidence that our training data is accurate.

           It should be supplemented with some supervised training in addition, if possible.

           This is the default, but can be turned off by setting the SpamAssassin configuration parameter
           "bayes_auto_learn" to 0.

       4. Mistake-based training
           This means training on a small number of mails, then only training on messages that SpamAssassin
           classifies incorrectly.  This works, but it takes longer to get it right than a full training
           session would.

<b>FILES</b>
       <b>sa-learn</b> and the other parts of SpamAssassin's Bayesian learner, use a set of persistent database
       files to store the learnt tokens, as follows.

       bayes_toks
           The database of tokens, containing the tokens learnt, their count of occurrences in ham and spam,
           and the timestamp when the token was last seen in a message.

           This database also contains some 'magic' tokens, as follows: the version number of the database,
           the number of ham and spam messages learnt, the number of tokens in the database, and timestamps
           of: the last journal sync, the last expiry run, the last expiry token reduction count, the last
           expiry timestamp delta, the oldest token timestamp in the database, and the newest token
           timestamp in the database.

           This is a database file, using "DB_File".  The database 'version number' is 0 for databases from
           2.5x, 1 for databases from certain 2.6x development releases, and 2 for all more recent
           databases.

       bayes_seen
           A map of Message-Id and some data from headers and body to what that message was learnt as. This
           is used so that SpamAssassin can avoid re-learning a message it has already seen, and so it can
           reverse the training if you later decide that message was learnt incorrectly.

           This is a database file, using "DB_File".

       bayes_journal
           While SpamAssassin is scanning mails, it needs to track which tokens it uses in its calculations.
           To avoid the contention of having each SpamAssassin process attempting to gain write access to
           the Bayes DB, the token timestamps are written to a 'journal' file which will later (either
           automatically or via "sa-learn --sync") be used to synchronize the Bayes DB.

           Also, through the use of "bayes_learn_to_journal", or when using the "--no-sync" option with sa-
           learn, the actual learning data will take be placed into the journal for later synchronization.
           This is typically useful for high-traffic sites to avoid the same contention as stated above.

<b>EXPIRATION</b>
       Since SpamAssassin can auto-learn messages, the Bayes database files could increase perpetually until
       they fill your disk.  To control this, SpamAssassin performs journal synchronization and bayes
       expiration periodically when certain criteria (listed below) are met.

       SpamAssassin can sync the journal and expire the DB tokens either manually or opportunistically.  A
       journal sync is due if <u>--sync</u> is passed to sa-learn (manual), or if the following is true
       (opportunistic):

       - bayes_journal_max_size does not equal 0 (means don't sync)
       - the journal file exists

       and either:

       - the journal file has a size greater than bayes_journal_max_size

       or

       - a journal sync has previously occurred, and at least 1 day has passed since that sync

       Expiry is due if <u>--force-expire</u> is passed to sa-learn (manual), or if all of the following are true
       (opportunistic):

       - the last expire was attempted at least 12hrs ago
       - bayes_auto_expire does not equal 0
       - the number of tokens in the DB is &gt; 100,000
       - the number of tokens in the DB is &gt; bayes_expiry_max_db_size
       - there is at least a 12 hr difference between the oldest and newest token atimes

       <b>EXPIRE</b> <b>LOGIC</b>

       If either the manual or opportunistic method causes an expire run to start, here is the logic that is
       used:

       - figure out how many tokens to keep.  take the larger of either bayes_expiry_max_db_size * 75% or
       100,000 tokens.  therefore, the goal reduction is number of tokens - number of tokens to keep.
       - if the reduction number is &lt; 1000 tokens, abort (not worth the effort).
       - if an expire has been done before, guesstimate the new atime delta based on the old atime delta.
       (new_atime_delta = old_atime_delta * old_reduction_count / goal)
       - if no expire has been done before, or the last expire looks "wierd", do an estimation pass.  The
       definition of "wierd" is:
           - last expire over 30 days ago
           - last atime delta was &lt; 12 hrs
           - last reduction count was &lt; 1000 tokens
           - estimated new atime delta is &lt; 12 hrs
           - the difference between the last reduction count and the goal reduction count is &gt; 50%

       <b>ESTIMATION</b> <b>PASS</b> <b>LOGIC</b>

       Go through each of the DB's tokens.  Starting at 12hrs, calculate whether or not the token would be
       expired (based on the difference between the token's atime and the db's newest token atime) and keep
       the count.  Work out from 12hrs exponentially by powers of 2.  ie: 12hrs * 1, 12hrs * 2, 12hrs * 4,
       12hrs * 8, and so on, up to 12hrs * 512 (6144hrs, or 256 days).

       The larger the delta, the smaller the number of tokens that will be expired.  Conversely, the number
       of tokens goes up as the delta gets smaller.  So starting at the largest atime delta, figure out
       which delta will expire the most tokens without going above the goal expiration count.  Use this to
       choose the atime delta to use, unless one of the following occurs:

       - the largest atime (smallest reduction count) would expire too many tokens.  this means the learned
       tokens are mostly old and there needs to be new tokens learned before an expire can occur.
       - all of the atime choices result in 0 tokens being removed. this means the tokens are all newer than
       12 hours and there needs to be new tokens learned before an expire can occur.
       - the number of tokens that would be removed is &lt; 1000.  the benefit isn't worth the effort.  more
       tokens need to be learned.

       If the expire run gets past this point, it will continue to the end.  A new DB is created since the
       majority of DB libraries don't shrink the DB file when tokens are removed.  So we do the "create new,
       migrate old to new, remove old, rename new" shuffle.

       <b>EXPIRY</b> <b>RELATED</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>SETTINGS</b>


       "bayes_auto_expire" is used to specify whether or not SpamAssassin ought to opportunistically attempt
       to expire the Bayes database. The default is 1 (yes).
       "bayes_expiry_max_db_size" specifies both the auto-expire token count point, as well as the resulting
       number of tokens after expiry as described above.  The default value is 150,000, which is roughly
       equivalent to a 6Mb database file if you're using DB_File.
       "bayes_journal_max_size" specifies how large the Bayes journal will grow before it is
       opportunistically synced.  The default value is 102400.
