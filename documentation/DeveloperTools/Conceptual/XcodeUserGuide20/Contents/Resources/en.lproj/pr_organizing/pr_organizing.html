<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH248-TPXREF147" title="Software Organization Tips"></a><h2>Software Organization Tips</h2>
<p>The following are some general guidelines for organizing your
software in Xcode. In subsequent sections, you&#8217;ll get more detailed
information to flesh out these tips.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Follow standard
software development practice to factor your software into logical units
of reasonable size, which you can implement as applications, shared
libraries, tools, plug-ins, and so on. In Xcode, each of these products
requires one target.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Put together projects and targets based on such factors as:</p><ul class="nested"><li class="nested li"><p>How do the products
interact?</p></li>
<li class="nested li"><p>How many individuals (or teams) will be working on each task?</p></li>
<li class="nested li"><p>Do the products use different source code management systems?</p></li>
<li class="nested li"><p>Must the products run on different versions of Mac OS X?</p></li></ul></li>
<li class="li"><p>For smaller development tasks, it generally makes sense to
keep targets for related products in a single project.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>For tasks that are reasonably separate, and especially if
they are to be implemented by separate teams, use multiple projects.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Use cross-project dependencies when targets in one project
need to depend on targets in other projects.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Use the information in <span class="content_text"><a href="../bs_building_product/bs_building_product.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000833-BAJCIICC">“Build Locations”</a></span> to ensure
that a target can access the build products of other targets when
needed.</p></li></ul>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH248-TPXREF161" title="Dividing Your Work Into Projects and Targets"></a><h2>Dividing Your Work Into Projects
and Targets</h2>
<p>To develop software with Xcode, you are going to need at least
one project, containing at least one target, and producing at least
one product. Those are the basic structures you use for all your
development.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there are no hard and fast rules for how you
divide your work. For simple products or products that are closely
tied together, you might use a single project with multiple targets.
For large development tasks with many products, and especially with separate
development teams, you&#8217;ll want to use multiple projects and targets,
perhaps connected with cross-project dependencies.</p>
<p>The following sections provide additional information and
tips on organizing your software.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH248-TPXREF163" title="Identifying the Scope"></a><h3>Identifying the Scope</h3>
<p>In organizing your software, many decisions depend on the
scope of the design goal and the number of products it requires.
For example, if you&#8217;re working alone on a simple application,
you can create a project for the desired application type (such
as a Cocoa or Carbon application) and get right to work. Here are
some of the decisions you might face:</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>If you decide
to move some code to an internal library, you might add a target
for the library.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>To take advantage of existing code in another project, you
might choose to develop the existing code as a shared library and
add a dependency so that the application project depends on the
shared library project and makes use of its output.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>You might choose not to use a source code management (SCM)
system, although even simple projects can sometimes benefit from
such use.</p></li></ul>
<p>Suppose, however, that you are working on a more complex software
design, one that will be implemented by several individuals or development
teams. Let&#8217;s say you are asked to create a new application for
&#8220;an easy-to-use recording studio.&#8221; You may already have components
of this application, such as a shared library for presenting music
tracks. As you refine the product specification, you identify other
common tasks that might belong in a shared library, tool, or companion
application. You determine that the main application should rely
on Apple technologies to provide certain features, such as burning CDs
or making the application scriptable.</p>
<p>Eventually, you have identified a set of products to build,
which gives you a good idea of the scope of the task. And that in
turn can help you determine how to organize it into Xcode projects
and targets.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH248-TPXREF164" title="Trade-offs of Putting Many Targets in One Project"></a><h3>Trade-offs of Putting Many
Targets in One Project</h3>
<p>You can help determine whether to put many or all of your
targets in one project by considering some of the trade-offs involved.
Here are some of the advantages of combining multiple targets in
one project:</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Indexing
works across all targets.</p><p>Indexing information is required
to access classes in the class browser, view symbols in the Project
Symbols smart group, and to take full advantage of code completion.
It is also necessary to use Command-double-click to jump to a definition
and to use symbolic counterparts.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>You can easily set up dependencies between targets in the
project.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Anyone using the project has access to all its files.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>If you have access to extra CPUs on your network, you can
use distributed builds to build a large project more rapidly.</p></li></ul>
<p>Here are some of the disadvantages of putting all your targets
in one project:</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>All of the
code is visible to any individuals or teams using the project, even
if they&#8217;re working on only one target or a small subset of the
overall project.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>The project size may become unwieldy; this can cause Xcode
to take a long time to perform operations such as indexing.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>All targets must use the same SCM system.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>All targets must build for the same Mac OS X system version (SDK).</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>All targets use the same build styles (for example, you can&#8217;t
have variations on a Deployment build style for different targets).</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>You can&#8217;t use the graphical debugger to debug two executables
in one project at the same time.</p></li></ul>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH248-TPXREF165" title="Trade-offs of Using Multiple Projects"></a><h3>Trade-offs of Using Multiple
Projects</h3>
<p>There are also trade-offs in breaking up a software development
task into multiple projects and targets. Here are some of the advantages
of using multiple projects:</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>You can use
the project as a unit for dividing work among different individuals
or teams. The separate projects allow you to segregate the code
(for example, to limit access to confidential information).</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Each individual project can be of a more manageable size,
and Xcode can perform indexing, building, and other operations more
quickly.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>If projects need to share outputs, they can build into a common
directory, as described in <span class="content_text"><a href="../bs_building_product/bs_building_product.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000833-BAJCIICC">“Build Locations.”</a></span></p></li>
<li class="li"><p>You can use cross-project dependencies to build other projects
needed by the current project.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Each project can use source code stored in a different SCM
system. However, if individuals have physical access to other projects,
it is still possible to look at SCM information from multiple projects
that use the same SCM system.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Each project can build for different Mac OS X systems (SDKs).</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Each project can define separate build styles.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>You can use the graphical debugger to debug two or more executables
at the same time, one in each project. This is useful when products
communicate directly or otherwise interact.</p></li></ul>
<p>Here are some of the disadvantages of having multiple projects
and targets:</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>You won&#8217;t
have cross-project indexing, and thus you will have access only
to symbols that are specifically exposed by other projects. This
means, for example, that you can&#8217;t automatically look up definitions
in other projects unless you have physical access to them (not just
to their end products).</p><p>Similarly, you will not be able to
take full advantage of other features that depend on indexing. That
includes using code completion, using Command-double-click to jump to
a definition, and using symbolic counterparts.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Management of many smaller projects is likely to incur additional
overhead. For example, to set up a target that depends on other
targets in multiple projects, you&#8217;ll first have to set up cross-project
references.</p><p>Similarly, use of multiple projects may require
additional communication between teams.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>For an individual working on multiple projects, it may become
unwieldy to switch between many open projects.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Individual projects are smaller, and are less likely to be
able to take advantage of distributed builds.</p></li></ul>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH248-BCIEAIAJ" title="Organizing Files"></a><h2>Organizing Files</h2>
<p>Decisions about how to partition projects and their targets
affect the organization of your entire software development effort.
However, it is also important that your work in a project is organized
and accessible to you. Particularly in larger projects, the number
of files can be daunting. To help organize files into manageable
chunks, Xcode lets you group them. </p>
<p>A <strong>group</strong> lets you collect related files
together. A source group lets you group an arbitrary set of file, folder, and
framework references in your project. A smart group, on the other hand,
lets you group together files fitting a particular pattern or rule. This
section shows you how to organize files using source and smart groups.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH248-BABBGCFJ" title="Organizing Files into Source Groups"></a><h3>Organizing Files into Source
Groups</h3>
<p>In the Groups &amp; Files list, source groups look like folders.
However, they don&#8217;t have to correspond to folders on the disk.
You can instead arrange files into groups that make sense to you
while working on them in Xcode. For example, in a project containing multiple
targets, your project could store all the nib files in one folder
and all of the implementation files in another folder on disk. But
in the Groups &amp; Files list, you could group the files according
to target; that is, the nib files and implementation files for target A
would be in one group, the nib files and implementation files for
target B would be in another group, and so on. A group doesn&#8217;t
affect how a target is built.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH248-BABBGCFE" title="Creating a New Source Group"></a><h4>Creating a New Source Group</h4>
<p>You can create a new source group in any of the following
ways:</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Create an
empty group. Choose File &gt; New Group and type the name.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Create a group from existing items. Select the items you wish
to group and choose File &gt; Group. You can also Control-click
the selected files and choose Group from the contextual menu.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Create a new group based on an existing directory structure. Choose
Project &gt; Add to Project, select the folder, and check &#8220;Recursively
create groups for added folders.&#8221; This is described further in <span class="content_text"><a href="../pr_add_files/pr_add_files.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH221-BCIDAGFI">“Adding Files and Folders.”</a></span></p></li></ul>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH248-TPXREF106" title="Adding Files to a Group"></a><h4>Adding Files to a Group</h4>
<p>You can add files to a group at any time by dragging the file
icons to the group&#8217;s folder in the Groups &amp; Files list. A
line appears to indicate where you are moving the files. Xcode automatically
expands groups as you drag items onto them.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH248-DontLinkElementID_214" title="Deleting Groups"></a><h4>Deleting
Groups</h4>
<p>When you remove a group from your project, you can choose
whether to remove the files in that group from the project or simply
ungroup the files.</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>To remove
a group and the project&#8217;s references to the files in that group,
select the group, and choose Edit &gt; Delete or press the Delete
key.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>To remove a group and keep the files it contains,press Shift
and choose File &gt; Ungroup or Control-click the group and choose
Ungroup from the contextual menu.</p></li></ul>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH248-CJBIDJID" title="Using Smart Groups to Organize Files"></a><h3>Using Smart Groups to Organize
Files</h3>
<p>Smart groups are also represented by folder icons in the Groups
&amp; Files list; however, they are colored purple to distinguish
them from source groups. As was mentioned earlier, smart groups
group files that adhere to a common pattern or rule. For example, you
could define a smart group to collect all implementation files ending
in <code>.m</code> or <code>.c</code>. When
you make a change to your project that alters the set of files matching
a smart group&#8217;s rule&#8212;for example, adding a new <code>.c</code> file&#8212;the
smart group automatically updates to reflect the change. You do
not need to add files to a smart group yourself. In fact, Xcode
does not allow you to drag files to a smart group.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH248-BABJHGCC" title="Creating a New Smart Group"></a><h4>Creating a New Smart Group</h4>
<p>To create a new smart group, choose File &gt; New Smart Group
and select one of the following options</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Simple Filter
Smart Group creates a smart group that collects files whose names contain
a specified string.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Simple Regular Expression Smart Group creates a smart group
that uses a regular expression to specify the pattern that file names
must follow.</p></li></ul>
<p>Xcode adds a new smart group of the selected type to your
project and brings up an Info window that allows you to configure the
group. Xcode provides templates for each type of smart group; it
uses these templates to configure new smart groups with a default
set of options. For example, the default Simple Filter Smart Group
collects all files with &quot;*.nib&quot; in their name. The default
Simple Regular Expression Smart Group collects all C, C++, Objective-C,
Objective-C++, Java, and AppleScript implementation files in your
project.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH248-CJBEBHAD" title="Configuring a Smart Group"></a><h4>Configuring a Smart Group</h4>
<p>To configure a smart group, select the group in the Groups
&amp; Files list and open an Info window. The Info window for a
smart group looks similar to the following figure:</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH248-DontLinkElementID_361" title="Figure 6-1Configuring a smart group"></a><p><strong>Figure 6-1&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Configuring
a smart group</p><img src = "../Art/inspectsmartgroup.gif" alt = "" width="368" height="499"></div><br/>
<p>Here is what the smart group Info window contains:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><p>The Name
field specifies the name of the new smart group. By default, this
is set to the type of the smart group, for example, &#8220;Simple Filter
Smart Group.&#8221; </p></li>
<li class="li"><p>The Image well displays the icon used for the smart group
in the project window. The default image for a smart group is the
purple folder icon, but you can also use a custom image to represent
your new smart group. To change the icon, click the Choose button and
navigate to the image file to use.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>The settings that define how the smart group decides to include
a file are those in the center of the smart group Info window. The
Start From menu specifies the directory from which the smart group
starts its search for matching files; by default, this is the project
folder. If the Recursively option is enabled, the smart group also
searches through subfolders of that folder.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>The Using Pattern field specifies the actual pattern that
files must match in order to be included in the smart group. As
mentioned, this pattern can be either a simple string that the smart
group filters on or it can be a regular expression, depending on
the value of the radio buttons beneath the field. For examples of
each of these, look at the smart group templates. The Simple Filter
Smart Group template uses the pattern <code>*.nib</code>.
Any files with &#8220;.nib&#8221; in their name are included in this smart
group. The Simple Regular Expression Smart Group, on the other hand,
uses the regular expression <code>\.(c|cpp|C|CPP|m|mm|java|sh|scpt)$</code> to
collect all implementation files ending in any one of these suffixes,
regardless of the case of the filename and extension.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>The Save For menu determines the scope for which this smart
group is defined.You can have this new smart group appear in all
of your projects, or you can specify that the smart group you have
created remains specific to the current project.</p></li></ol>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH248-DontLinkElementID_215" title="Viewing Groups and Files"></a><h3>Viewing Groups and Files</h3>
<p>As you learned in <span class="content_text"><a href="../pr_project_window/pr_project_window.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-BCIFDFFB">“The Project Window,”</a></span> you have
two ways to view the contents of your project. You can view the
groups and files in your project in outline view to see a hierarchical
representation of your project organization. You can also view the
groups and files in your project as a simple list, in the detail
view. The detail view presents a flat list of all the files contained
in the source group selected in the Groups &amp; Files list. For
example, if you select your project in the Groups &amp; Files list,
the detail view shows all of the files in the project. If you select
an individual file in the Groups &amp; Files list, only that file
is displayed in the detail view. To view the contents of a source
group in your project, select that group in the Groups &amp; Files
list. The following figure shows the project, selected in the Groups
&amp; Files list.</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH248-DontLinkElementID_362" title="Figure 6-2Viewing the contents of a group"></a><p><strong>Figure 6-2&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Viewing
the contents of a group</p><img src = "../Art/viewfiles.gif" alt = "" width="647" height="537"></div><br/>
<p>All of the files in the project are displayed in the detail
view. The detail view for any file shows the following information:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><p>The first
column, with an empty column heading, shows an icon indicating the
type of the file. For example, a nib file is marked by the Interface
Builder file icon. The icon for a C++ class file displays the characters
&#8220;C++&#8221;.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>The File Name column displays the names of the files.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>The column marked by the hammer icon displays the build status
of each file. If a file has been changed since the active target
was last built, this column displays a checkmark, indicating that
the file needs to be built. If the file is up to date, this column is
empty.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>The Code column displays the size of the compiled code generated
from the file.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>The column marked by the error icon displays the number of
errors in the file. If this column is empty, the file either contains
no errors or has not yet been built.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>The column marked by the warning icon displays the number
of warnings for the file. If this column is empty, the file either
has no warnings or has not yet been built.</p></li>

<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH248-DontLinkElementID_216" title="Saving Commonly Accessed Locations"></a><h2>Saving Commonly Accessed Locations</h2>
<p>In any project, there are locations that you find yourself
accessing again and again; files that you edit frequently, headers
that you browse, even smart groups that you find yourself using
often. Xcode lets you save locations that you access frequently
and provides ways for you to quickly jump to these locations. You
can bookmark project items. You can also use the Favorites bar to
store locations. This section describes how to take advantage of
bookmarks and the Favorites bar to provide quick access to project
contents.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH248-BABDJIBF" title="The Favorites Bar"></a><h3>The Favorites Bar</h3>
<p>The Favorites Bar in the project window lets you save commonly
accessed items and return to them quickly. By default, the Favorites
bar is hidden. To show the Favorites bar, choose View &gt; Show
Favorites Bar. To hide the Favorites bar, choose View &gt; Hide Favorites
Bar.</p>
<p>To add an item to the Favorites bar, simply drag it to the
Favorites bar in the project window. You can save any of the same
locations you can bookmark, including files, technical documentation,
URLs, and so forth. In addition, you can add smart groups and source
groups to the Favorites bar. The Groups &amp; Files list can get
quite long as you reveal the contents of more and more groups, scrolling
the items at the bottom of the list out of view; you can add groups&#8212;including
any of the built-in smart groups&#8212;to the Favorites bar to quickly
jump to that group in the Groups &amp; Files list. To reorder items
in the Favorites bar, drag them to the desired location; dragging
an item off of the Favorites bar deletes the item from the Favorites
bar. To rename an item in the Favorites bar, Option-click the item
and type the new name. This changes the name of the entry in the
Favorites bar; it does not affect the name of the actual item that
the entry represents.</p>
<p> To open a saved location, simply click or double-click it
in the Favorites bar. If the item saved in the Favorites bar is
a container, such as a group or folder, pressing the item (holding
the mouse button down) brings up a pop-up menu that shows the items
contents and lets you navigate to them. Each of the items in the
Favorites bar serves as a proxy for the actual item. Thus, Control-clicking
the item brings up a contextual menu that allows you to perform
operations appropriate for the selected item.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH248-BBCFHACH" title="Saving Commonly Accessed Locations as Bookmarks"></a><h3>Saving Commonly Accessed Locations
as Bookmarks</h3>
<p>Another way that Xcode lets you organize your project and
provide easy access to the information you need is with bookmarks.
If you have files or locations in your project that you access often,
you can bookmark those spots and return to those locations at any
time simply by opening the bookmark. </p>
<p>To create a bookmark, open the location you want to bookmark
and choose Find &gt; Add to Bookmarks. Xcode prompts you for the
name of the bookmark; you can enter a name to help you remember
which location the bookmark marks, or you can use the default name suggested
by Xcode. You can bookmark project files, technical documentation,
URLs, and so forth.</p>
<p>You can see the bookmarks in your project in several ways:</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Bookmarks
smart group. Select the Bookmarks group in the Groups &amp; Files
list to see the bookmarks in the detail view. The detail view shows
the name and file of all of the bookmarks in your project. If the
attached editor is open, selecting a bookmark opens that location
in the editor. Otherwise, you can double-click the bookmark to open
the bookmarked location in a separate editor window.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Bookmarks window. To open this window, double-click the Bookmarks
smart group or choose Window &gt; Tools &gt; Bookmarks. You can
see all bookmarks in your project in this window; double-click any
of these bookmarks to open the location.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>The bookmarks pop-up menu in the navigation bar of Xcode&#8217;s
editor. Choose any bookmarked location from this menu to open it
in the editor, as described in <span class="content_text"><a href="../ed_editor_window/ed_editor_window.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000831-BABEHCAG">“The Xcode Editor Interface.”</a></span></p></li></ul>

<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH248-BCIIEECC" title="Adding Comments to Project Items"></a><h2>Adding Comments to Project
Items</h2>
<p>To help you keep track of your project contents, you can write
comments and associate them with any of the items in your project.
Xcode remembers these comments across sessions. In this way, you
can document your project and its components, keep design notes,
or track improvements you still wish to make. This is especially
useful if you are working with large or complex projects that have
many different pieces, or if you are working with a team of developers
and have multiple people modifying the project.</p>
<p>For example, imagine a large project containing targets that
build a suite of applications, a framework used by each of those
applications, a command line tool for debugging, and a handful of
plug-ins for the applications. With such a large number of targets
it might be hard to keep track of exactly what each of the products
created by those targets does. To make it easier to remember what
each of them does, you could add a short description of the product
that it creates to the Comments field for that target. This also
aids others who may be working on the project with you; if they
can read the comments, they can quickly get up to speed with the
project and easily learn about changes made by other members of the
development team.</p>
<p>To add comments to a project item:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Select that
item in the Groups &amp; Files list or in the detail view and bring
up an Info or inspector window. </p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Click Comments to open the Comments pane, shown here.</p><div class="item_figure"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH248-DontLinkElementID_364" title="Figure 6-4The Comments pane"></a>
<p><strong>Figure 6-4&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The
Comments pane</p><img src = "../Art/commentspane.gif" alt = "" width="368" height="499"></div><p>This
pane contains a single text field into which you can type any information
you wish. To add comments, click in the Comments field and type.
You can also link to additional resources from the Comments pane;
hypertext links, email addresses and other URLs are clickable in
this field.</p></li></ul>
<p>You can add comments to any project item other than smart
groups, including projects, targets, files, and executables. You
can view comments you have added to project items in the detail
view and you can search the content of those comments using the Search
field. If the Comments column is not already visible, choose View
&gt; Detail View Columns &gt; Comments or Control-click anywhere
in the column heading and choose Comments from the contextual menu.</p>
