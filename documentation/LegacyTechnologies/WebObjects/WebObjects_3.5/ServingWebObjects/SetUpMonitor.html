<h1> Setting Up the Monitor Application</h1>
</a><a name="4686">
You can perform many essential administrative tasks using a WebObjects application named Monitor. Monitor helps you create a public configuration file, start and stop applications, perform load balancing, and set up applications for optimal performance. Before you can use Monitor, you need to perform some initial setup. After that, you can use it to easily administer your own WebObjects applications. <p>
</a><a name="4687">
<B>Note: </B> Previous versions of WebObjects distributed Monitor as an example application. To use Monitor, you had to recompile your applications using a special version of WOApplication. This WOApplication class is incompatible with the Monitor application distributed in WebObjects 3.5. If you want to be able to Monitor these existing applications, you'll have to recompile them on WebObjects 3.5. <p>
