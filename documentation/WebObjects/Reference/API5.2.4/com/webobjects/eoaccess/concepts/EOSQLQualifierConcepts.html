  <b>CREATING A SQL QUALIFIER FROM A FORMAT STRING</b>
  An EOSQLQualifier format may contain keys(attribute names), key paths
  (attributes referenced through a relationship, format characters
  (for example %@, %s, etc), and arbitrary text. The format is scanned by the
  EOSQLQualifier class and the keys, key paths, and format characters.
  The keys and key paths are substituted with the appropriate column
  names and the format characters are replaced by the argument
  indicated by the format characters. All SQL syntax is the
  responsibility of the coder. EOSQLQualifier does not attempt to
  understand the contents of the format string.<P>
  The following are examples of simple EOSQLQualifier format strings.
  In these examples, the keys "lastName" and "royalty" will be replaced
  with the appropriately aliased column names as will the key path
  "publisher.name".
  <pre>
      lastName = "smith"
      royalty > 2.5
      toPublisher.name = "Eco Publishing House"
  </pre>
  An EOSQLQualifier's format string recognizes the following
  format characters.<P>
  %s expects a (char   ) argument<br>
  %A expects an (NSString   ) argument, which should be a key or key path<br>
  %d expects an integer argument<br>
  %f expects a float or double argument<br>
  %@ expects an id argument -- valid objects are EOAttribute,<br>
          NSString, or anything that responds reasonably to:<br>
     valueForSQLExpression:(EOSQLExpression   )context<br>
  %% is a '%' passed through.<br>
  % followed by any other character is ignored<p>
  The following examples build qualifiers similar to the above examples but
  you should use format characters to build the values from a existing EO.
  In these examples, we assume that the EO has implemented the following
  accessor methods:<br>
  - (NSString   )lastName;<br>
  - (float)salary;<br>
 <pre>
      myQualifier = [[EOSQLQualifier alloc] initWithEntity:authorEntity
          qualifierFormat:"%A = '%@'", @"last_name", [anAuthur lastName]];
 
      myQualifier = [[EOSQLQualifier alloc] initWithEntity:authorEntity
          qualifierFormat:"%A > %f", @"royalty", [anAuthur salary]];
 </pre><p>
  Since it is the responsibility of the programmer to ensure that all formatting
  is correct in the resulting SQL statement, it is sometimes useful to use a
  particular adaptor for doing certain formatting tasks like quoting strings,
  formatting dates, etc.<p>
  The next example calls the method formatValue:forAttribute: on the adaptor
  specific subclass of EOSQLExpression to ensure that certain values are
  formatted correctly. In this case, since the attribute is a string type,
  the method will return a quoted copy of the string with any embedded quotes
  suitably escaped.<P>
  <pre>
      myQualifier = [[EOSQLQualifier alloc] initWithEntity:authorEntity
          qualifierFormat:"%A = %@", [attribute name],
     [[adaptor expressionClass] formatValue:[anAuthor lastName]
   forAttribute:attribute]];
  </pre><p>
  Finally, declare the EOSQLQualifier class.<p>
