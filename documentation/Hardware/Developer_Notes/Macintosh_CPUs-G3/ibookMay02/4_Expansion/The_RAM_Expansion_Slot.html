To get accessto the RAM expansion slot, the user must open up the computer byperforming the following operations. </p><blockquote><b>Important</b><p>The user should be reminded to observe the usual precautionsto avoid damage to the electronic components due to static electricity. </p></blockquote><ol><li>Shut downthe computer.</font></li><li>Unplug the AC adapter from the computer.</font></li><li>Remove the battery from the computer.</font></li><li>Unlock the keyboard by turning the slotted screw that is partof the Num Lock LED, which is between the F5 and F6 function keys.Turning the screw 180 locks or unlocks the keyboard. (The lockingscrew may already be in the unlocked position.) </font></li><li>Release the two latches located at the top of the keyboard.One latch is between the ESC key and the F1 key; the other is betweenthe F11 and F12 keys. You can release the latches by sliding themtoward the front of the computer. See  <a sector="mod" href="../3_Input-Output/iRemoving_the_Keyboard.html" target="_top">Figure 3-5</a>. </font></li><li>Pulling only on the latches (not on the keys), lift the keyboardup and turn it over, without disconnecting the keyboard's membranecable.</font></li><li>Remove the wireless LAN module, if present, by unlatchingthe formed wire holder on the module, then pulling the flex tabto remove the module. The antenna cable should remain attached tothe module. See  <a href="#BCIDCJGH">Figure 4-1</a></font></li><li>Using a Phillips head screwdriver, remove the two screws thatsecure the metal RAM shield plate. The screws are to the right ofthe wireless LAN module. See  <a href="#BCICDIHA">Figure 4-2</a>. </font></li><li>Slide the metal RAM shield plate toward the rear of the computer,then lift it up and out of the computer. </font></li><li>On the 14.1-inch model, you must remove the 128-MB SO-DIMMcurrently occupying the memory expansion slot before installinga larger module. </font></li></ol><br><a name = "BCIDCJGH"></a><p><b><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">Figure4-1 The AirPort Card and antenna cable </font></b></p> <img src = "../art/dsl12.gif" alt = "[image: ../art/dsl12.gif]"><br><a name = "BCICDIHA"></a><p><b><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">Figure4-2 The RAM shield plate</font></b></p> <img src = "../art/dsl13.gif" alt = "[image: ../art/dsl13.gif]"><p>Once the RAM expansion module has been installed in the slot,the user must close up the computer by performing these steps inreverse order.
