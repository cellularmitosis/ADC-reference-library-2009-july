<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-TPXREF48" title="Types of Windows"></a><h2>Types of Windows</h2><p>As a developer or a designer, you should be aware of four main types of windows. Although their behavior is generally the same, they have important differences.</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p><strong>Document windows</strong><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1344"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1345"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1346"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1347"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1348"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1349"></a> contain file-based user data. They present a view into the content that people create and store. If the document is larger than the window, the window shows a portion of the document’s contents and provides users with the ability to scroll to other areas. </p></li><li class="li"><p><strong>Application windows</strong> are the main windows of applications that are not document-based. These windows use the standard Aqua window look and features; if the application is running in versions of Mac OS X prior to v10.5 (Leopard), these windows can use the optional brushed metal look.</p></li><li class="li"><p><strong>Panels</strong> float above other windows and provide tools or controls that users can work with while documents are open. In some cases, panels can be transparent. In end-user documentation, panels should be called windows. Panels are discussed in more detail in <span class="content_text"><a href="XHIGWindows.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-TPXREF17">“Panels.”</a></span></p></li><li class="li"><p><strong>Dialogs and alerts</strong> require a response from the user. Dialogs and alerts are discussed in <span class="content_text"><a href="XHIGWindows.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-BACFBACB">“Dialogs.”</a></span></p></li></ul><p>Examples of all of these types of windows are shown in <span class="content_text">Figure 14-1</span>.</p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-CHDGJHEI" title="Figure 14-1Types of windows in Mac OS X"></a><p><strong>Figure 14-1&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Types of windows in Mac OS X</p><img src = "../art/wn_fivewindowtypes.jpg" alt = "" ></div><br/><p></p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-TPXREF10" title="Window Appearance"></a><h2>Window Appearance</h2><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1350"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1351"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1352"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1353"></a><p>A window consists of window-frame areas and a window body. The window-frame areas include the title bar, the toolbar, and the bottom bar (note that in Mac OS X v10.5 and later, the toolbar is not visually distinct from the title bar). The window body is the main content area that extends from the bottom edge of the title bar (or toolbar, if present) to the bottom edge of the window, not including the bottom bar, if one is present. The toolbar and the bottom bar are optional elements that not all windows have. <span class="content_text">Figure 14-2</span> shows examples of these areas in different windows.</p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-SW9" title="Figure 14-2Toolbars and bottom bars are optional window parts"></a><p><strong>Figure 14-2&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Toolbars and bottom bars are optional window parts</p><img src = "../art/wn_newwindowparts.jpg" alt = "" ></div><br/><p>In Mac OS X v10.5 and later, no window-frame surface is visible on the sides of windows; the window-body area, the toolbar, and the bottom bar stretch from the left edge to the right edge. Users can drag a window from any window-frame area, including a bottom bar.</p><p>All window-frame areas have a gray gradient surface. In the window body, content views (such as text or column views) display a white background by default; the surrounding window-body background is a shade of light gray.</p><div class="importantbox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_22" title="Important:"></a><p><strong>Important:</strong>&nbsp;In Mac OS X v10.5 and later, there are no brushed metal windows. Windows that were designed as brushed metal windows to run in earlier versions of Mac OS X should adopt the Leopard look in Mac OS X v10.5. For the most part this is automatic. You may need to adjust your layout so that no window-frame material is visible on the sides of the window and you should ensure that the controls you used in the toolbar are still appropriate. See <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGControls/XHIGControls.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000359-SW9">“Window-Frame Controls”</a></span> for more information on appropriate controls and <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGControls/XHIGControls.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000359-SW22">“Legacy Toolbar Controls”</a></span> for some transition advice.</p><p></p></div><p><span class="content_text">Figure 14-3</span> shows the Address Book application’s transition from brushed metal to the Leopard look. Notice the removal of all window-frame surface on the sides, the use of appropriate toolbar and bottom-bar controls, and the adoption of the “zero-width” splitters that are standard in Mac OS X v10.5 (for more information about this control, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGControls/XHIGControls.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000359-CHDDBIJE">“Split Views”</a></span>).</p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-SW25" title="Figure 14-3A brushed metal window designed for Tiger changes its look for Leopard"></a><p><strong>Figure 14-3&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>A brushed metal window designed for Tiger changes its look for Leopard</p><img src = "../art/wn_brushmetaltransition.jpg" alt = "" ></div><br/><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-SW8" title="Window Elements"></a><h2>Window Elements</h2><p>Every document and application window and panel should have, at a minimum:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>A title bar.

A bottom bar contains controls that directly affect the contents and organization of the window. Controls in a bottom bar are important, but less so than controls in a toolbar. <span class="content_text">Figure 14-5</span> shows the bottom bar in an iCal window.</p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-SW10" title="Figure 14-5A bottom bar in an application window"></a><p><strong>Figure 14-5&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>A bottom bar in an application window</p><img src = "../art/wn_bottombarinwindow.jpg" alt = "" ></div><br/><p>Another optional window element is the scope bar. A scope bar appears below an application’s toolbar and allows users to narrow down a search operation or to filter objects or other operations by identifying specific sets of characteristics. <span class="content_text">Figure 14-6</span> shows the scope bar in the Finder.</p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-SW11" title="Figure 14-6A scope bar in an application window"></a><p><strong>Figure 14-6&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>A scope bar in an application window</p><img src = "../art/wn_scopebarinwindow.jpg" alt = "" ></div><br/><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-TPXREF49" title="The Title Bar"></a><h3>The Title Bar</h3><p>All windows should have a title bar even if the window doesn’t have a title (which should be a very rare exception). In Mac OS X v10.5 and later, all windows display the title bar unified with the toolbar, if a toolbar is present. The following sections describe the components of the title bar.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-TPXREF50" title="The Window Title"></a><h4>The Window Title</h4><p>A document window should display the name of the document being viewed. Application windows display the application name. Panels display a descriptive title appropriate for that window. If the contents of the window can change, it might be appropriate to change the title to reflect the current context. For example, in the Keynote inspector panel, the title of the window changes to reflect which pane has been selected.</p><p>If you need to display more than one item in the title, separate the items with an em dash (—) with space on either side. For example, the main viewer window of Mail displays the currently selected message mailbox and the selected folder, if any. When a message is viewed in its own window, the message title is displayed.</p><p>Don’t display pathnames in window titles. When displaying document titles, use the display name and show the extension if the user has elected to show extensions. If you need to display a path in the body of a window you can use the path control, described in <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGControls/XHIGControls.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000359-SW2">“Path Controls.”</a></span></p><p>The only controls that belong in a title bar are the close, minimize, and zoom buttons. If a title bar is combined with a toolbar, the unified area can contain the toolbar control and the toolbar customization contextual menu (these controls are described in <span class="content_text"><a href="XHIGWindows.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-TPXREF51">“Title Bar Buttons”</a></span>). Do not place other controls in a title bar.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-TPXREF51" title="Title Bar Buttons"></a><h4>Title Bar Buttons</h4><p>Document and application windows always display active close and minimize buttons. (See <span class="content_text"><a href="XHIGWindows.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-TPXREF56">“Closing Windows”</a></span> and <span class="content_text"><a href="XHIGWindows.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-TPXREF25">“Minimizing and Expanding Windows”</a></span> for details on what the close and minimize buttons do.) Include the zoom button if the window can be adjusted in size. Information on how the zoom button works is in <span class="content_text"><a href="XHIGWindows.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-BACEDHFG">“Resizing and Zooming Windows.”</a></span></p><p>Panels always display an active close button but never an active minimize button.</p><p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1362"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1363"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1364"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1365"></a>If buttons are not active, they should at least all be present in an inactive state. The exception is in panels, where it is acceptable to display only one button, the close button. For more information on panels, including information on their title bar buttons, see <span class="content_text"><a href="XHIGWindows.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-TPXREF17">“Panels.”</a></span></p><p>Alerts and modal dialogs do not display any of these buttons.</p><p>The title bar should include a toolbar control if a toolbar is present in the window (see <span class="content_text"><a href="XHIGWindows.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-BABIFCFJ">“Toolbars”</a></span>). <span class="content_text">Figure 14-7</span> shows the appropriate configurations of title bar buttons for standard windows (and alerts and modal dialogs); <span class="content_text"><a href="XHIGWindows.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-TPXREF41">Figure 14-39</a></span> shows appropriate title bar button configurations for panels.</p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-SW34" title="Figure 14-7Title bar buttons for standard windows"></a><p><strong>Figure 14-7&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Title bar buttons for standard windows</p><img src = "../art/wn_windctrls.jpg" alt = "Title bar buttons for standard windows" ></div><br/><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-TPXREF52" title="Indicating Changes with the Close Button"></a><h4>Indicating Changes with the Close Button</h4><p>When a document has unsaved changes, the close button should display a dot, as shown in <span class="content_text">Figure 14-8</span>.</p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-TPXREF29" title="Figure 14-8The close button in its unsaved changes state"></a><p><strong>Figure 14-8&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The close button in its unsaved changes state</p><img src = "../art/wn_clsndtndirty.jpg" alt = "The close button in its unsaved changes state" ></div><br/><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-TPXREF53" title="The Proxy Icon"></a><h4>The Proxy Icon</h4><p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1366"></a>Document windows can include a <strong>proxy icon</strong> in the title bar after the content is saved for the first time. After pressing a proxy icon for a brief period, users can manipulate it as if they were manipulating the corresponding file-system object. For example, you can attach a document to an email message by dragging its proxy icon into the email message, as shown in <span class="content_text">Figure 14-9</span>.</p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-TPXREF43" title="Figure 14-9A proxy icon being dragged to another application "></a><p><strong>Figure 14-9&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>A proxy icon being dragged to another application </p><img src = "../art/wn_proxyiconinuse.jpg" alt = "A proxy icon being dragged to another application" ></div><br/><p>A proxy icon appears in its normal state as long as the state of the document and the file-system object are the same.

As shown in <span class="content_text">Figure 14-11</span>, the document path displays the document itself and all containing folders up to the volume that contains the user’s home directory. Because Mac OS X is a multiple-user environment, it’s especially important to show the complete path of a document to avoid confusion.<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1368"></a></p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-TPXREF37" title="Figure 14-11A document path pop-up menu, opened by Command-clicking the proxy icon"></a><p><strong>Figure 14-11&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>A document path pop-up menu, opened by Command-clicking the proxy icon</p><img src = "../art/wn_proxyiconmenu.jpg" alt = "A document path pop-up menu, opened by Command-clicking the proxy icon" ></div><br/><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-BABIFCFJ" title="Toolbars"></a><h3>Toolbars</h3><p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1369"></a>A <strong>toolbar</strong> is useful for giving users immediate access to the most frequently used features in an application. Any item in a toolbar should also be available as a menu command. An application-wide toolbar in its own window is also called a <strong>tool panel</strong> (or less frequently, a tool palette); for more information, see <span class="content_text"><a href="XHIGWindows.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-TPXREF17">“Panels.”</a></span> This section describes toolbars that are part of a window with other content.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-SW36" title="Toolbar Appearance and Behavior"></a><h4>Toolbar Appearance and Behavior</h4><p>In Mac OS X v10.5 and later, all windows that contain a toolbar display the unified toolbar–title bar appearance by default. This includes windows that were designed for earlier versions of Mac OS X, but are running in Mac OS X v10.5. For example, <span class="content_text">Figure 14-12</span> shows a Tiger version of Disk Utility running in Mac OS X v10.4 (on the left) and in Mac OS X v10.5 (on the right).</p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-SW12" title="Figure 14-12Many Tiger applications automatically receive the Leopard look when running in Mac OS X v10.5 and later"></a><p><strong>Figure 14-12&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Many Tiger applications automatically receive the Leopard look when running in Mac OS X v10.5 and later</p><img src = "../art/wn_tigerleoparddiskutil.jpg" alt = "" ></div><br/><p>Toolbars can contain a few types of controls and both standard and custom icons. Mac OS X v10.5 provides a small set of controls that are suitable for use in toolbars; standard Aqua controls do not belong in toolbars.

Although a preferences window can also contain a toolbar, some guidelines for designing such a toolbar differ from the ones in this section. For example, the items in a preferences toolbar should not be available as menu commands and preferences toolbars should not be customizable. See <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGUsingTechnologies/XHIGUsingTechnologies.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-TPXREF137">“Preferences”</a></span> to learn more about choosing items to include in a preferences window and <span class="content_text"><a href="XHIGWindows.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-TPXREF57">“Preferences Windows”</a></span> for more information on the look and behavior of preferences windows.</p></div><p>To help you decide what items to put in a toolbar, consider the user’s mental model of the task your application performs (to learn more about the mental model, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGHIDesign/XHIGHIDesign.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-CJBDDFAJ">“Reflect the User’s Mental Model”</a></span>). Keep in mind that a toolbar has limited space, so it’s important to include items most users need regularly and to avoid including items that are used very infrequently. Using the user’s mental model as a guide, examine the functionality of your application and identify the most useful features, commands, and objects. </p><p>Then, try to identify logical groupings or rankings of the commands and objects you’ve chosen. Place the items that should have the highest visibility in the left end of the toolbar. For example, one good design is to place more frequently used toolbar items to the left of less frequently used items. Another successful arrangement is to position toolbar items according to importance, significance, or place in an object hierarchy. In this design, the most important or significant items, or the ones closest to the root of the hierarchy, should have the highest visibility and are therefore towards the left end of the toolbar.</p><p>Often, you can define logical subsets of these features and objects, such as a subset of commands related to the manipulation of a document and a subset of commands related to the objects on a document page. When this is the case, you can then arrange the items in each subset according to importance or frequency of use, and then use the same criteria to position the subsets in the toolbar. <span class="content_text">Figure 14-16</span> shows three ways to arrange toolbar items.</p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-SW14" title="Figure 14-16Three options for arranging toolbar items"></a><p><strong>Figure 14-16&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Three options for arranging toolbar items</p><img src = "../art/wn_toolbarprioritization.jpg" alt = "" ></div><br/><p>For example, in the default Keynote toolbar, items are grouped by functionality. Then, Keynote positions the groups so that they range from items that handle slide decks and slides to items that provide inspection and selection of object attributes. Specifically, slide creation and management items are on the left, slide contents and object management items are in the middle, and object adjustment and selection are on the far right. <span class="content_text">Figure 14-17</span> shows about half of these groups.</p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-SW35" title="Figure 14-17Toolbar items arranged by functionality"></a><p><strong>Figure 14-17&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Toolbar items arranged by functionality</p><img src = "../art/wn_toolbarorganization.jpg" alt = "" ></div><br/><p>As you design the appearance of the toolbar items themselves, you have two options. First, if the features you’ve chosen lend themselves to iconic representation, you can create a recognizable image to stand for each one. Depending on the overall look of your application, decide whether you want to place the images in capsule-style toolbar controls or to use them as free-standing icon buttons. For example, both Pages and Mail use recognizable images to represent important commands, but Pages displays its images as icon buttons and Mail uses capsule-style toolbar buttons, as shown in <span class="content_text">Figure 14-18</span>. For more information about icon buttons, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGControls/XHIGControls.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000359-TPXREF189">“Icon Buttons”</a></span>; for more information about capsule-style toolbar buttons, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGControls/XHIGControls.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000359-SW8">“Capsule-Style Toolbar Controls.”</a></span></p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-SW15" title="Figure 14-18Two styles for toolbar items"></a><p><strong>Figure 14-18&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Two styles for toolbar items</p><img src = "../art/wn_toolbariconvscapsule.jpg" alt = "" ></div><br/><p>Second, it may be that you can use the system-provided images to clearly represent all or most of the commands you’ve identified for display in the toolbar (these images are described in detail in <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGIcons/XHIGIcons.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000967-SW15">“System-Provided Images”</a></span>). If this is the case, you can choose to place these images in either the rectangular-style or capsule-style toolbar controls. For example, Finder includes several toolbar controls that display system-provided images, as shown in <span class="content_text"><a href="XHIGWindows.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-SW13">Figure 14-13</a></span>.</p><div class="importantbox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_23" title="Important:"></a><p><strong>Important:</strong>&nbsp;If you choose to use system-provided images in your toolbar controls, be sure to avoid creating new meanings for them. For example, use the Action gear symbol in an Action menu only; don’t use it to stand for “build” or “advanced.”</p><p></p></div><p>The default set of toolbar items you provide should fit in the default window size, and the order in which they appear should reflect the user’s mental model in some way. However, users should be able to customize which items appear in the toolbar and in what order. Additionally, a toolbar should display items with text labels by default; users should be able to change the display to items only or text only. You can provide these options with a Customize Toolbar command in the View menu.</p><p>Make sure that every toolbar item you create has an associated menu command. However, you should not create a toolbar item for every menu command, because not all commands are important enough or used frequently enough to warrant inclusion in a toolbar.</p><p>Avoid putting an application-specific contextual menu in your toolbar. The only contextual menu that makes sense in a toolbar is the toolbar customization contextual menu. If you need to offer a set of commands that act upon an object the user selects, use an Action menu control (described in <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGControls/XHIGControls.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000359-SW3">“Action Menus”</a></span>).</p><p></p><p></p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-SW3" title="Scope Bars"></a><h3>Scope Bars</h3><p>A <strong>scope bar</strong> allows users to specify locations or rules in a search or to filter objects by specific criteria. In general, scope bars are not visible all the time, but appear when the user initiates a search or similar operation. <span class="content_text">Figure 14-19</span> shows the scope bar Safari displays when the user performs a find (because the Safari find operation does not allow the addition of scoping criteria, you can think of it as using an implied scope of “all”).</p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-SW16" title="Figure 14-19A scope bar supports find operations within a window"></a><p><strong>Figure 14-19&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>A scope bar supports find operations within a window</p><img src = "../art/wn_findwithscopebar.jpg" alt = "" ></div><br/><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-SW38" title="Scope Bar Appearance and Behavior"></a><h4>Scope Bar Appearance and Behavior</h4><p>A scope bar is a horizontal strip that can appear just below your application’s toolbar. It can be visible at all times, but is usually invisible until the user initiates an operation such as a search or find.</p><p>Although a scope bar may contain a search field control, it often contains only two types of controls, both of which are designed solely for use in a scope bar. The first control is the recessed-style scope button, which is used to display scoping locations and categories. The second is the round rectangle–style scope button, which is used to save or manipulate a scoping operation (for details on these controls, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGControls/XHIGControls.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000359-SW13">“Scope Buttons”</a></span>).</p><p>You can also display filter rows below a scope bar that allow users to specify additional rules that help refine the scoping operation. In addition to the round rectangle–style scope button (used for selecting or saving scoping criteria), a filter row can also contain text fields that accept user input. For example, when users search in the Finder, they can click the Add button to view a new row with supplementary rules they can use to refine their search. <span class="content_text">Figure 14-20</span> shows a Finder window with several filter rows displayed below the scope bar.</p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-SW17" title="Figure 14-20A scope bar can display filter rows for refining a search"></a><p><strong>Figure 14-20&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>A scope bar can display filter rows for refining a search</p><img src = "../art/wn_finderscopebarrows.jpg" alt = "" ></div><br/><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-SW39" title="Designing a Scope Bar"></a><h4>Designing a Scope Bar</h4><p>Scope bars are useful for integrating search or filtering in your application. You might choose to provide a scope bar (instead of a separate Find window, for example) if you want the user’s focus to remain on the window. Be sure that you use a scope bar only to specify and narrow a search or to filter items by specified criteria. If you need to provide a way for users to navigate or to select collections of items or data that should appear in the window, however, you should use a source list instead (described in <span class="content_text"><a href="XHIGWindows.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-CHDDIGDE">“Source Lists”</a></span>). For example, the Dictionary application uses a scope bar to allow users to dynamically filter results by reference type (such as dictionary, thesaurus, or Apple dictionary), as shown in <span class="content_text">Figure 14-21</span>.</p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-SW18" title="Figure 14-21A scope bar can act as a filter"></a><p><strong>Figure 14-21&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>A scope bar can act as a filter</p><img src = "../art/wn_dictionaryscopebar.jpg" alt = "" ></div><br/><p>As you choose the locations and categories that should appear in a scope bar, revisit the user’s mental model of the tasks your application performs. (See <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGHIDesign/XHIGHIDesign.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-CJBDDFAJ">“Reflect the User’s Mental Model”</a></span> for more information on discovering this cognitive model.) Determine the objects the user works with, and identify the attributes of those objects. For example, an application that allows users to create, use, and store recipes might display a scope bar when the user begins a search, providing buttons that correspond to different recipe collections.</p><p>If appropriate, allow users to define subsets of the locations and categories you offer by providing filter rows that display additional rules and filtering criteria. For example, the recipe application described above could display filter rows that allow users to filter their results by ingredient, cuisine, seasonal availability, complexity, date last used, diet type, and other criteria. You should also allow users to save their searches. As shown in <span class="content_text"><a href="XHIGWindows.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-SW17">Figure 14-20</a></span>, the Finder offers many types of additional filtering functionality and the ability to save searches.</p><p></p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-CHDDIGDE" title="Source Lists"></a><h3>Source Lists</h3><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1371"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1372"></a><p>A <strong>source list</strong> (also called a <strong>sidebar</strong>) is an area of a window, usually set off by a movable splitter, that provides users with a way to navigate or select objects in the application (for more information on splitters, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGControls/XHIGControls.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000359-CHDDBIJE">“Split Views”</a></span>). Typically, users select an object in the source list that they act on in the main part of the window.

A source list that provides the primary navigation or selection mechanism for the application as a whole displays a blue background. This type of source list should be the only source list in the application window and should always be visible (unless the user chooses to hide it). The Finder sidebar (shown on the left in <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1373"></a><span class="content_text"><a href="XHIGWindows.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-SW1">Figure 14-22</a></span>) is an example of this type of source list: It provides primary navigation and selection functionality for the application, it's separated from the rest of the window by a movable splitter, and it’s always visible (unless the user chooses to hide it and the toolbar).</p><p>The other style of source list is often used in preferences windows. This type of source list provides selection functionality for the window, but not the application as a whole. A source list of this type displays a white background and might not be separated from the rest of the window by a movable splitter. The Network System Preferences pane contains this type of source list, as shown in <span class="content_text">Figure 14-23</span>.</p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-SW33" title="Figure 14-23A source list may support selection in a window, not in the application as a whole"></a><p><strong>Figure 14-23&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>A source list may support selection in a window, not in the application as a whole</p><img src = "../art/wn_secondarysourcelist.jpg" alt = "" ></div><br/><p></p><p>Source lists don’t generally have headers like lists can, but they can display titles to distinguish subsets of objects or data.

This means that a source list can shield users from the details of file and document management, allowing them to work with user-customizable, application-specific containers that hold related items. These high-level container objects can hide the actual file-system locations of their files and data and conceal the associations between them. This can relieve users of the burden of locating and opening the auxiliary or related files they need to do their work. </p><p>Source lists are especially useful in single-window applications that are not necessarily document-based, but that allow users to create and manage content. For example, iTunes allows users to ignore the file-system locations of their songs, podcasts, and movies, and instead work with libraries and playlists. Similarly, iWeb focuses on website creation, not file management.</p><p>You should consider including a source list in your application when:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Navigation and selection of content are primary tasks.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Collections of objects are key to the user’s mental model (see <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGHIDesign/XHIGHIDesign.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-CJBDDFAJ">“Reflect the User’s Mental Model”</a></span> to learn more about the mental model).</p></li><li class="li"><p>The hierarchical arrangement of objects presents a natural way to navigate.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Arranging objects hierarchically removes complexity.</p></li></ul><p>Because the source list is a navigation and selection tool, it should not contain controls other than controls used to organize the data itself. For example, you can use a disclosure triangle to reveal an additional level of hierarchy (disclosure triangles are described in <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGControls/XHIGControls.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000359-TPXREF141">“Disclosure Triangles”</a></span>). <span class="content_text">Figure 14-24</span> shows how Mail uses disclosure triangles to display two levels of hierarchically organized information.</p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-SW19" title="Figure 14-24A source list can contain disclosure triangles"></a><p><strong>Figure 14-24&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>A source list can contain disclosure triangles</p><img src = "../art/wn_srclistdisctriangles.jpg" alt = "" ></div><br/><p>A source list should not contain more than two levels of hierarchy. If the data you need to display is organized in more than two levels of hierarchy, you can use a second source list, but you should not use additional disclosure triangles to expose additional levels of hierarchy in a single source list. If, however, your application is centered on the navigation of deeply nested objects, you should consider using a browser view instead of multiple source lists.  </p><p>As mentioned in <span class="content_text"><a href="XHIGWindows.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-SW2">“Source List Behavior and Appearance,”</a></span> if your application contains a single source list that provides primary navigation and selection functionality, you can use the blue background.

However, although items in a bottom bar are less frequently used than items in a toolbar, you should still take care to choose items that give users an easy way to perform common tasks.</p><p>Unlike toolbars, bottom bars are not user-customizable, so it’s especially important to provide a set of useful controls that is neither too general nor too specific.

Also, bottom bars should not contain contextual menus. If you need to offer a collection of commands that users can perform on a selected item in the window body, provide an Action menu control that displays the system-provided Action image (see <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGControls/XHIGControls.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000359-SW3">“Action Menus”</a></span> for more information on this control).</p><p>To decide whether to use regular-size or small controls in a bottom bar, consider the prominence these controls should have and the overall look of your window.</p><p>Create a bottom bar by leaving a horizontal strip of the window frame visible below the window body content view.

A drawer should contain frequently accessed controls that don’t need to be visible at all times. For example, <span class="content_text">Figure 14-28</span> shows a drawer that provides details about slide builds in the Keynote Build inspector.</p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-BGBBGIIF" title="Figure 14-28An open drawer next to its parent window"></a><p><strong>Figure 14-28&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>An open drawer next to its parent window</p><img src = "../art/wn_drawerinuse.jpg" alt = "An open drawer next to its parent window" ></div><br/><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-TPXREF14" title="When to Use Drawers"></a><h4>When to Use Drawers</h4><p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1376"></a>Use drawers only for controls that need to be accessed fairly frequently but that don’t need to be visible all the time. This is in contrast to the criterion for a panel, which should be visible and available whenever its main window is in the top layer. (For more information about panels, see <span class="content_text"><a href="XHIGWindows.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-TPXREF17">“Panels.”</a></span>)</p><p>Although a drawer is somewhat similar to a sheet in that it attaches to a window and slides out, the two elements are not interchangeable. Sheets are modal dialogs (as described in <span class="content_text"><a href="XHIGWindows.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-BGBDHEID">“When to Use Sheets”</a></span>), whereas drawers provide additional functionality. When a sheet is open, it is the focus of the window and it obscures the window contents; when a drawer is open, the entire parent window is still visible and accessible.</p><p>You should not use a drawer to provide users with a way to navigate hierarchically arranged content in your window. If you need to do this in your application, you should use a source list instead. See <span class="content_text"><a href="XHIGWindows.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-CHDDIGDE">“Source Lists”</a></span> to learn more about source lists.<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1377"></a></p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-TPXREF15" title="Drawer Behavior"></a><h4>Drawer Behavior</h4><p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1378"></a>The user shows or hides a drawer, typically by clicking a button or choosing a command. If a drawer contains a valid drop target, you may also want to open the drawer when the user drags an appropriate object to where the drawer appears.</p><p>When a drawer opens, it appears to be sliding from behind its parent window, to the left, right, or down. You should ensure that a parent window’s default position allows its drawer to open fully without disappearing offscreen. If a user moves a parent window to the edge of the screen and then opens a drawer, it should open on the side of the window that has room. If the user makes a window so big that there’s no room on either side, the drawer opens off the screen.</p><p>To support the illusion that a closed drawer is hidden behind its parent window, an open drawer should be smaller than its parent window. When the parent window is resized vertically, an open drawer resizes, if necessary, to ensure that it does not exceed the height of the parent window. (A drawer can be shorter than its parent window.) The illusion is further reinforced by the fact that the inner border of a drawer is hidden by the parent window and that the parent window’s shadow is seen on the drawer when appropriate.</p><p>The user can resize an open drawer by dragging its outside border. The degree to which a drawer can be resized is determined by the content of the drawer. If the user resizes a drawer significantly—to the point where content is mostly obscured—the drawer should simply close. For example, if a drawer contains a scrolling list, the user should be able to resize the drawer to cover up the edge of the list. But if the user makes the drawer so small that the items in the list are difficult to identify, the drawer should close. If the user sets a new size (if that is possible) for a drawer, the new size should be used the next time the drawer is opened.</p><p>A drawer should maintain its state (open or closed) when its parent window becomes inactive or when the window is closed and then reopened. When a parent window with an open drawer is minimized, the drawer should close; the drawer should reopen when the window is made active again.</p><p>A drawer can contain any control that is appropriate to its intended use. Follow normal layout guidelines, as stated in <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGLayout/XHIGLayout.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000360-BEIBEAFJ">“Positioning Regular-Size Controls in a Window Body.”</a></span></p><p>Consider a drawer part of the parent window; don’t dim a drawer’s controls when the parent window has focus, and vice versa<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1379"></a>.

The foremost document or application window that is the focus of the user’s attention is referred to as the <strong>main window</strong>. The main window is often also the <strong>key window</strong>. The key window is the window that accepts user input, whether from the keyboard, mouse, or alternative input device. The “close window” keyboard shortcut, Command-W, targets the key window.</p><p>However, the main window is not always the key window. There are times when a window other than the main window takes the focus of the input device, while the main window still remains the focus of the user’s attention. For example, when a person is using an inspector, a Find dialog, or the Fonts or Colors windows, the document is the main window and the other window is the key window.</p><p>If the main and key window are different windows, they are distinguished from one another by the look of their title bars (and toolbars, if they are present). In particular, note that the key window displays title-bar controls with color.</p><p>Main and key windows are both active windows. An active window is visually distinct from an <strong>inactive window</strong> in that its title bar (and its toolbar, if there is one) displays the standard window-frame color, while the title bar (and toolbar) of an inactive window displays a lighter shade of the window-frame color. Inactive windows are windows the user has open, but that are not in the foreground. Main and key windows are always in the foreground, but only the controls of the key window have color. An active window that is not key has active, but clear, controls. </p><div class="notebox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-SW42" title="Note"></a><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;A transparent panel that is key displays a subtly reflective title bar and a white title, whereas a non-key transparent panel displays a darker title bar and a light gray title.

In many cases, however, click-through could confuse a user who clicks an item unintentionally.</p><p>Click-through is not a property of a class of controls. Any control, including toolbar items, can support click-through in many contexts, but the same control could disable click-through when its use could be destructive or difficult to reverse in a particular context.</p><p>In an inactive window, items that do not provide click-through should appear in their disabled state. <span class="content_text">Figure 14-35</span> shows controls that do support click-through in an inactive window.</p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-TPXREF32" title="Figure 14-35An inactive window with controls that support click-through"></a><p><strong>Figure 14-35&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>An inactive window with controls that support click-through</p><img src = "../art/wn_clickthrough.jpg" alt = "An inactive window with controls that support click-through" ></div><br/><p>In a single window, you can provide click-through for any subset of items; you do not have to choose between supporting click-through for all items or none.

Use the following guidelines to help you determine which items should not support click-through.</p><p>Don’t provide click-through for an item or action that:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Is potentially harmful and does not allow the user to cancel it (for example, the Delete button in Mail)</p></li><li class="li"><p>Is difficult or impossible to cancel (such as the Send button in Mail)</p></li><li class="li"><p>Dismisses a dialog without telling the user what action was taken (for example, the Save button in a Save dialog that overwrites an existing file and automatically dismisses the dialog)</p></li><li class="li"><p>Removes the user from the current context (for example, selecting a new item in a Finder column can change the target of the Finder window)</p></li></ul><p>Clicking in any one of these situations should result in the containing window being brought forward, but no action being taken. <span class="content_text">Figure 14-36</span> shows an example of a control that does not support click-through, because its action is destructive.</p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-TPXREF33" title="Figure 14-36The Delete button on the inactive window does not support click-through"></a><p><strong>Figure 14-36&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The Delete button on the inactive window does not support click-through</p><img src = "../art/wn_clickthroughdisabled.jpg" alt = "The Delete button on the inactive window does not support click-through" ></div><br/><p>In general, you can implement click-through for a command that provides confirmation feedback before executing, even if the command ultimately results in destruction of data. For example, you can provide click-through for a delete button if you make sure to provide the user with the ability to cancel or confirm the action before it executes. For example, in Accounts preferences, the button for deleting users provides click-through because it also provides a confirmation dialog before executing. </p><p>If you want to implement click-through for an item that doesn’t provide confirmation feedback, consider how difficult it will be for the user to undo the action after it’s performed. For example, in Mail, the Delete button does not provide click-through because it deletes a message without providing feedback first, which is a potentially harmful action and one that is difficult to undo. Click-through for the New button in Mail is fine because its resulting action is not harmful and is easy to undo.<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1439"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1440"></a></p><p></p><p></p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-TPXREF26" title="Scrolling Windows"></a><h3>Scrolling Windows</h3><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1441"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1442"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1443"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1444"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1445"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1446"></a><p>People use <strong>scroll bars</strong> to view areas of a document or a list that is larger than can fit in the current window.

The scroller represents the relative location, in the whole document, of the portion that can be seen in the window.</p><p>If the entire contents of a document is visible in a window, the scroll bars do not contain scrollers. Scroll bars in inactive windows have an inactive appearance. In <span class="content_text"><a href="XHIGWindows.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-TPXREF33">Figure 14-36</a></span> you can see the inactive appearance in the scroll bar of the Mail viewer window. </p><p>For most document windows that contain a single view (scrolling text or tables, for example), do not specify any space between the window edge and scroll bars.</p><p>The user can use scroll bars by doing the following:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Dragging the scroller. This method is usually the fastest way to move around a document. The window’s contents changes in “real time” as the user drags the scroller.<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1449"></a></p></li><li class="li"><p>Clicking a scroll arrow. This means, “Show me more of the document that’s hidden in this direction.” The scroller moves in the direction of the arrow. Each scroll arrow click moves the content one unit; your application determines what one unit equals. For example, a word processor would move a line of text per click, a spreadsheet could move one row or column. To ensure smooth scrolling effects, specify units of the same size throughout a document.<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1450"></a></p></li><li class="li"><p>Clicking or pressing in the scroll track. Clicking advances the document by a windowful (the default) or to the pointer’s hot spot, depending on the user’s choice in Appearance preferences. A “windowful” is the height or width of the window, minus at least one unit of overlap to maintain the user’s context. This unit of overlap should be the same as one scroll arrow unit (for example, a line of text, a row of icons, or part of a picture). The Page Up and Page Down keys also move the document view by a windowful.<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1451"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1452"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1453"></a></p><p>Pressing in the scroll track displays consecutive windowfuls of the document until the location of the scroller catches up to the location of the pointer (or until the user releases the mouse button).</p></li></ul><p>It’s best not to add controls to the scroll-bar area of a window. If you add more than one control to this area, it’s hard for people to distinguish among controls and click the right one. Acceptable additions to the scroll area include a splitter bar and a status bar that shows, for example, the current page. To ensure that window controls are easy to use and understand, it’s best to place the majority of your features in the menus as commands. If you really want to provide additional access to features, consider creating a panel. Only frequently accessed features that significantly benefit users’ productivity should be elevated to the primary interface.</p><p>Panels that coexist with other windows and need to use the least amount of screen space possible may use small or mini scroll bars. If a window has small or mini scroll bars, all other controls within the window content area should also be the smaller version.

Although the behavior of a transparent panel is similar to the behavior of a standard panel, its appearance is designed to complement applications that focus on highly visual content or that provide an immersive experience, such as a full-screen slide show. For example, <span class="content_text">Figure 14-41</span> shows a transparent panel iChat provides.</p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-SW28" title="Figure 14-41An example of a transparent panel"></a><p><strong>Figure 14-41&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>An example of a transparent panel</p><img src = "../art/wn_transpanexample.jpg" alt = "" ></div><br/><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-SW7" title="When to Use Transparent Panels"></a><h4>When to Use Transparent Panels</h4><p>It’s important to understand that transparent panels are not intended to replace all panels in every application. In fact, in applications that don't focus on highly visual content or provide an immersive environment, a transparent panel can be more distracting to users than a standard panel, because there is no logical reason for its presence.</p><p>In general, therefore, you should use transparent panels only when at least one of the following statements is true:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Your application is media-centric, that is, focused on movies, photos, or slides.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Users use your application in a dark environment or in an immersion mode.</p></li><li class="li"><p>A standard panel would distract users from the main window.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Users make only quick adjustments in the panel and dismiss it quickly.</p></li></ul><p>For example, in Aperture (a photo post-production and management tool), a transparent panel is appropriate because it does not block the content the way a standard panel would. In addition, the transparent adjustment panel in Aperture contains easy-to-use controls that don’t require any keyboard input from the user. <span class="content_text">Figure 14-42</span> shows how this transparent panel allows users to focus on the images.</p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-SW29" title="Figure 14-42A transparent panel allows users to make adjustments without distracting them from the main window"></a><p><strong>Figure 14-42&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>A transparent panel allows users to make adjustments without distracting them from the main window</p><img src = "../art/wn_aperturetranspanel.jpg" alt = "" ></div><br/><p></p><p>If your application focuses on highly visual content only at specific times or only in some modes, a combination of standard and transparent panels is reasonable, as long as each panel is suited to its task and environment. Also, if you provide a transparent panel under these circumstances, don’t transform the panel into a standard (nontransparent) panel when your application switches modes. In other words, a transparent panel is always a transparent panel; it never converts to a standard panel.</p><p>For example, Keynote allows users to create presentations that contain text, images, video, and sound. In addition to providing the Mac OS X Colors and Fonts windows, Keynote provides an inspector window and a media browser, which are standard panels. The inspector window allows users to set slide transitions, edit tables and graphs, and make complex adjustments to text and formatting, and the media browser allows them to navigate collections of media files and make selections. Neither of these panels focuses solely on adjustments to visual content, so there is no reason for them to be transparent.</p><p>But Keynote also provides an image-adjustment panel, which helps users make simple adjustments to slide images. The image-adjustment panel is transparent, because users use it while they are focusing on the image, watching the effect of the adjustments they make. <span class="content_text">Figure 14-43</span> shows the transparent image-adjustment panel in Keynote.</p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-SW30" title="Figure 14-43A transparent panel can be appropriate for tasks that focus on highly visual content"></a><p><strong>Figure 14-43&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>A transparent panel can be appropriate for tasks that focus on highly visual content</p><img src = "../art/wn_keynotetranspan.jpg" alt = "" ></div><br/><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-SW43" title="Designing a Transparent Panel"></a><h4>Designing a Transparent Panel</h4><p>If a transparent panel is appropriate for your application, it’s important to design it appropriately to ensure that it looks good and meets users’ needs. In particular, a transparent panel should contain only simple adjustment controls that do not require much, if any, typing. Sliders and stepper-style controls work well, because they’re easy for users to use without focusing on them. As much as possible, you should avoid controls that require users to type or to select items, because they force users to shift their attention from the content to the panel. This defeats one of the main advantages of transparent panels, which is to allow users to focus on their content. </p><p>Because controls and text need to be visible on the dark translucent background of a transparent panel, you should design controls that are white with gray accents and use white or gray text. As users focus on the content behind the panel, the white text and controls appear to be floating above it.</p><p>Often, small amounts of color can enhance the information you provide in a transparent panel. For example, the morsels of color in the Aperture Adjustments panel (shown in <span class="content_text"><a href="XHIGWindows.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-SW29">Figure 14-42</a></span>) communicate ranges in white balance and exposure, in addition to color-specific settings, in a clear and unobtrusive way.</p><p>If you want to use color in your transparent panel, be sure to use it sparingly, because an overuse of color lessens its impact and can be distracting.

Possible approaches are to:<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1531"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1532"></a></p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Evaluate the input and check for errors as the user tabs from one field to the next. The drawback is that it isn’t clear to the user that the changes are taking effect as he or she tabs among items. The user doesn’t click a button, and so isn’t aware of completing an action.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Save user input in a queue and apply it when the user clicks a button, closes the dialog, or switches to another application. If your application waits to check user-input errors until the user tries to dismiss the dialog, you may have to present an alert, thereby forcing the user to revisit the dialog. If you do error checking as the user enters input, it takes more time up front, but you can warn the user immediately when invalid data is entered.</p></li></ul><p>In most cases, validating input after each keystroke is annoying and unnecessary. It’s better to design your interface to automatically disallow invalid input. For example, your application could automatically convert lowercase characters to uppercase when appropriate.</p><p>In addition to error checking, you need to decide when to apply user input. In some cases, changes can take effect immediately—for example, View Options for Finder windows. In other cases, it may be appropriate to wait until the user performs an action, such as clicking an Apply button.</p><p>In a dialog that has multiple panes (selected by buttons, tabs, or a pop-up menu), avoid validating data when a user switches from one pane to another.</p><p>Finally, you need to determine whether your application should automatically perform an operation based on user input or whether the user should initiate the operation—for example, by clicking a button. It’s acceptable to automatically perform an operation that completes quickly and returns user control within a couple of seconds. For an operation that takes a longer time to execute, it’s best to warn the user of the estimated time required and let the user initiate it.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-BABCAJID" title="Dismissing Dialogs"></a><h4>Dismissing Dialogs</h4><p>The buttons at the bottom right of a dialog all dismiss the dialog.

When there is no default button, pressing Return or Enter has no effect; the user must explicitly click a button. This guideline protects users from accidentally damaging their work by pressing Return or Enter. You can consider using a safe default button, such as Cancel. <span class="content_text"><a href="XHIGWindows.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DACDJICA">Figure 14-48</a></span> shows an example of a safe default button.</p><p>Don’t use a default button if you use the Return key in text entry boxes.

This button returns the computer to the state it was in before the dialog appeared. It means “forget I mentioned it.” Always map the keyboard shortcut Command-period and the Esc (Escape) key to the  Cancel button. These keyboard equivalents, along with Return and Enter,  are accelerator keys and serve the purpose of letting the user respond quickly to a dialog or an alert. In general, it’s not a good idea to assign other keyboard shortcuts to buttons. If you find it useful to assign keyboard shortcuts to some buttons that are used very often in your application,  be sure to follow the guidelines in <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGUserInput/XHIGUserInput.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000361-CHDIGFBH">“Keyboard Shortcuts.”</a></span><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1536"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1537"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1538"></a></p><p>In some circumstances, it’s appropriate to implement an <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1539"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1540"></a>Apply button—for example, to permit a user to see the effect of multiple text attributes before committing to them.

An Apply button should allow a user to preview the effect of the selected settings without committing to the changes. Be cautious about using an Apply button for operations that take a long time to implement or undo; it might not be obvious to users that they can interrupt or reverse the process. Save dialogs or dialogs that allow users to make changes that can’t be previewed easily should not include an Apply button.</p><p>Clicking the Apply button does not dismiss the dialog because the user must decide whether to accept the previewed changes (by clicking OK) or to reject them (by clicking Cancel). Do not use the Apply button as another OK button—when the user dismisses the dialog without clicking OK, all previewed changes should be discarded.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-SW45" title="Expanding Dialogs"></a><h4>Expanding Dialogs</h4><p>Sometimes you need to provide the user with additional information or functionality in a dialog, but you don’t want to display it all the time. To do this, you use one of the disclosure controls to expand the dialog and reveal the additional information or capability to the user.</p><p>If you want to allow the user to view details that elaborate on the primary information in a dialog, you use a disclosure triangle (note that disclosure triangles are also used in hierarchical lists). The disclosure triangle expands the dialog, revealing additional information and, if appropriate, extra functionality. An example of a dialog expanded by a disclosure triangle is shown in <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGControls/XHIGControls.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000359-CHDBGFGJ">Figure 15-76</a></span>.

The disclosure button expands the dialog to reveal selections in addition to those listed in the pop-up or command pop-down menu. An example of a dialog expanded by a disclosure button to reveal additional choices is shown in <span class="content_text"><a href="XHIGWindows.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-BACIHCHJ">Figure 14-58</a></span>.

If your application is not document-based or if it is a single-window application, however, you might instead choose to offer find or searching functionality in a scope bar. A scope bar is attached to a window and provides both search and filtering capabilities to users. <span class="content_text"><a href="XHIGWindows.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-SW16">Figure 14-19</a></span> shows a scope bar in Safari.

In general, the user opens a preferences window to change the default way an application displays an item or performs a task, closes the window, and expects the new settings to have taken effect. For some guidance on how to provide preferences in your application, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGUsingTechnologies/XHIGUsingTechnologies.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-TPXREF137">“Preferences.”</a></span> </p><p>Often, an application needs to provide a set of preferences for each of several different categories of functionality. For example, Safari allows the user to set preferences for bookmarks, webpage appearance, RSS display, and security measures, among other things. Because these categories are unrelated to each other, it would be confusing to display settings for all of them in one pane. Therefore, Safari (and many other applications) provides a preferences window with a toolbar that contains a toolbar item for each category. When the user clicks a toolbar item, the window displays a pane that contains the settings associated with that item. <span class="content_text">Figure 14-54</span> shows the General pane of Safari preferences.</p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-SW32" title="Figure 14-54An example of a preferences window"></a><p><strong>Figure 14-54&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>An example of a preferences window</p><img src = "../art/wn_safariprefs.jpg" alt = "" ></div><br/><p>If you choose to create a preferences window that uses a toolbar to switch among different categories of settings, make sure the toolbar is not customizable. This is because a toolbar in a preferences window does not provide a shortcut to frequently used commands, but acts as a convenient way to group settings. In addition, you should remove the show/hide toolbar control in your preferences window toolbar (you can see this control in <span class="content_text"><a href="XHIGWindows.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-BACDDGBI">Figure 14-4</a></span>). This is because there is no need to hide the toolbar in a preferences window (hiding it would also hide all but the currently selected collection of settings), and because novice users might mistakenly click the toolbar control when they mean to click the close button.</p><p>A preferences window should not include a resize control. In general, preferences windows do not need to display active minimize or zoom buttons. Remember that preferences windows are intended to provide users with a place to make adjustments to the way an application behaves, so there’s seldom a need for preferences windows to be resized or to remain open for a long time.</p><p></p><p>If you have changeable panes in your preferences window, the title of the window should be the title of the currently selected pane. For example, the title of the window shown in <span class="content_text">Figure 14-54</span> is “General” because the currently selected toolbar icon is labeled “General.” (If your preferences window does not contain additional panes, the title should be “<em>Application Name</em> Preferences”.) In addition, a changeable-pane preferences window should remember which pane the user selected the last time the window was open.</p><p>The menu item to open your preferences window should be in the application menu and be labeled Preferences. Use Command-comma for the keyboard shortcut.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-TPXREF36" title="The Open Dialog"></a><h3>The Open Dialog</h3><p>The <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1545"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1546"></a>Open dialog appears when the user chooses the <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1547"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1548"></a>Open command or presses <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-DontLinkElementID_1549"></a>Command-O.

For example, when a user attempts to open a broken alias, the Fix Alias dialog lets the user choose another item for the alias to open. An application can have more than one Choose dialog, but only one can be open at a time.

The system creates a list of native file types supported by the application to populate the menu. You can supplement this list with custom types and specify the default to show when the dialog opens. You should include an All Applicable Files item, but it does not have to be the default.</p></li></ul><p>If the dialog is not a sheet, the dialog’s default title is “Choose,” but you should change it to include the name of the task. For example, if the command that brings up the dialog is Choose Picture, the dialog should be titled “Choose Picture.” Also include some instructional text at the top, such as “Choose a picture to display in the background of ‘Documents.’” If it’s helpful, also change the Choose button to something more specific. </p><p>The default location is the user’s home folder.

For example, an option to print in reverse order should be provided by the operating system, not by your application. (Implementing this feature requires the application to know the hardware’s capabilities.)</p></li><li class="li"><p>Make interdependencies among options clear to users. For example, if a user selects double-sided printing, the option to print on transparencies should become unavailable.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Separate more advanced features from frequently used features. When the user chooses to display the advanced features, there should be an “advanced options” title above the advanced controls.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Provide visual feedback (such as the preview in the Layout pane of the Print dialog) when appropriate. A thumbnail showing the effect of changing a tone control, for example, helps users determine desired settings.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Save a user’s printing preferences for a document, at least while the document is open.
