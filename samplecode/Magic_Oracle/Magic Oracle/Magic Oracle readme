Magic Oracle AppleScript for Java Example 4/9/99This example demonstrates how to script your Java Application usingAppleScript. Functionality mimics the old black billiard ball that youasked a fortune and then shook vigorously in order to receive a crypticreply.It also demonstrates how to create a bean info to enhance theautomatically generated 'aete' created by the introspector.To submit your question to the "Magic Oracle", type your yes or noquestion in the text field and click the "Ask Oracle" button, pressreturn or enter, or grab the ball with your mouse and shake it aroundthe screen.You may also communicate via AppleScript using the Scriptable TextEditor.tell application "Magic Oracle"    ask Mystic of Main Frame "oracleFrame" parameters {"Is Java cool?"} end tellor using the more straight-forward terminology specified in thebeanInfo:tell application "Magic Oracle"    ask Mystic of frame "oracleFrame" question "Is Java cool?" end tellThe application will perform it's magic and return a string as aresponse.How this works:The application has a public method that takes a string parameter andreturns a string.java.lang.String askOracle( java.lang.String question );Terminology for this method is in the aete which was automaticallygenerated by MRJ, trimmed, edited, and then the 'scsz' resource wasremoved to freeze the terminology.MainFrameBeanInfo.java contains a property and a method descriptor. Theproperty descriptor provides a formal parameter name in the 'aete'. Themethod descriptor provides a more descriptive string for the method"askMystic()" in the 'aete'.If you would like to see the aete generated automatically as specifiedby the BeanInfo, make a copy of the Magic Oracle application. UsingResEdit, replace the aete in the application copy with the aete found inthe MRJ Scripting folder in the MRJ SDK. Make sure that you copy in the'scsz' resource so that generation of the 'aete' is activated. You willnow be able to open the application dictionary in the Scriptable TextEditor and see the results.For more information on AppleScript for Java, consult Technote 1162:Introduction to MRJ Scripting with AppleScript for Java located at:<http://devworld.apple.com/technotes/java/java-1.html>
