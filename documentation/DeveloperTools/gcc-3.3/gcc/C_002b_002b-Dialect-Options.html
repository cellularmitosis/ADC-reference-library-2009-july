<h3 class="section">3.5 Options Controlling C++ Dialect</h3>

<p><a name="index-compiler-options_002c-C_002b_002b-119"></a><a name="index-C_002b_002b-options_002c-command-line-120"></a><a name="index-options_002c-C_002b_002b-121"></a>This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for C++ programs; but you can also use most of the GNU compiler options
regardless of what language your program is in.  For example, you
might compile a file <code>firstClass.C</code> like this:

<pre class="example">     g++ -g -frepo -O -c firstClass.C
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In this example, only <span class="option">-frepo</span> is an option meant
only for C++ programs; you can use the other options with any
language supported by GCC.

   <p>Here is a list of options that are <em>only</em> for compiling C++ programs:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-fabi-version=</code><var>n</var><dd><a name="index-fabi_002dversion-122"></a>Use version <var>n</var> of the C++ ABI.  Version 1 is the version of the C++
ABI that first appeared in G++ 3.2.  Version 0 will always be the
version that conforms most closely to the C++ ABI specification. 
Therefore, the ABI obtained using version 0 will change as ABI bugs are
fixed.

     <p>The default is version 1.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-access-control</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002daccess_002dcontrol-123"></a>Turn off all access checking.  This switch is mainly useful for working
around bugs in the access control code.

     <br><dt><code>-fcheck-new</code><dd><a name="index-fcheck_002dnew-124"></a>Check that the pointer returned by <code>operator new</code> is non-null
before attempting to modify the storage allocated.  The current Working
Paper requires that <code>operator new</code> never return a null pointer, so
this check is normally unnecessary.

     <p>An alternative to using this option is to specify that your
<code>operator new</code> does not throw any exceptions; if you declare it
<span class="samp">throw()</span>, G++ will check the return value.  See also <span class="samp">new
(nothrow)</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-fconserve-space</code><dd><a name="index-fconserve_002dspace-125"></a>Put uninitialized or runtime-initialized global variables into the
common segment, as C does.  This saves space in the executable at the
cost of not diagnosing duplicate definitions.  If you compile with this
flag and your program mysteriously crashes after <code>main()</code> has
completed, you may have an object that is being destroyed twice because
two definitions were merged.

     <p>This option is no longer useful on most targets, now that support has
been added for putting variables into BSS without making them common.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-const-strings</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dconst_002dstrings-126"></a>Give string constants type <code>char *</code> instead of type <code>const
char *</code>.  By default, G++ uses type <code>const char *</code> as required by
the standard.  Even if you use <span class="option">-fno-const-strings</span>, you cannot
actually modify the value of a string constant, unless you also use
<span class="option">-fwritable-strings</span>.

     <p>This option might be removed in a future release of G++.  For maximum
portability, you should structure your code so that it works with
string constants that have type <code>const char *</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-fdollars-in-identifiers</code><dd><a name="index-fdollars_002din_002didentifiers-127"></a>Accept <span class="samp">$</span> in identifiers.  You can also explicitly prohibit use of
<span class="samp">$</span> with the option <span class="option">-fno-dollars-in-identifiers</span>.  (GNU C allows
<span class="samp">$</span> by default on most target systems, but there are a few exceptions.) 
Traditional C allowed the character <span class="samp">$</span> to form part of
identifiers.  However, ISO C and C++ forbid <span class="samp">$</span> in identifiers.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-elide-constructors</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002delide_002dconstructors-128"></a>The C++ standard allows an implementation to omit creating a temporary
which is only used to initialize another object of the same type. 
Specifying this option disables that optimization, and forces G++ to
call the copy constructor in all cases.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-enforce-eh-specs</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002denforce_002deh_002dspecs-129"></a>Don't check for violation of exception specifications at runtime.  This
option violates the C++ standard, but may be useful for reducing code
size in production builds, much like defining <span class="samp">NDEBUG</span>.  The compiler
will still optimize based on the exception specifications.

     <br><dt><code>-fexternal-templates</code><dd><a name="index-fexternal_002dtemplates-130"></a>
Cause <span class="samp">#pragma interface</span> and <span class="samp">implementation</span> to apply to
template instantiation; template instances are emitted or not according
to the location of the template definition.  See <a href="Template-Instantiation.html#Template-Instantiation">Template Instantiation</a>, for more information.

     <p>This option is deprecated.

     <br><dt><code>-falt-external-templates</code><dd><a name="index-falt_002dexternal_002dtemplates-131"></a>Similar to <span class="option">-fexternal-templates</span>, but template instances are
emitted or not according to the place where they are first instantiated. 
See <a href="Template-Instantiation.html#Template-Instantiation">Template Instantiation</a>, for more information.

     <p>This option is deprecated.

     <br><dt><code>-ffor-scope</code><dt><code>-fno-for-scope</code><dd><a name="index-ffor_002dscope-132"></a><a name="index-fno_002dfor_002dscope-133"></a>If <span class="option">-ffor-scope</span> is specified, the scope of variables declared in
a <i>for-init-statement</i> is limited to the <span class="samp">for</span> loop itself,
as specified by the C++ standard. 
If <span class="option">-fno-for-scope</span> is specified, the scope of variables declared in
a <i>for-init-statement</i> extends to the end of the enclosing scope,
as was the case in old versions of G++, and other (traditional)
implementations of C++.

     <p>The default if neither flag is given to follow the standard,
but to allow and give a warning for old-style code that would
otherwise be invalid, or have different behavior.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-gnu-keywords</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dgnu_002dkeywords-134"></a>Do not recognize <code>typeof</code> as a keyword, so that code can use this
word as an identifier.  You can use the keyword <code>__typeof__</code> instead. 
<span class="option">-ansi</span> implies <span class="option">-fno-gnu-keywords</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-implicit-templates</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dimplicit_002dtemplates-135"></a>Never emit code for non-inline templates which are instantiated
implicitly (i.e. by use); only emit code for explicit instantiations. 
See <a href="Template-Instantiation.html#Template-Instantiation">Template Instantiation</a>, for more information.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-implicit-inline-templates</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dimplicit_002dinline_002dtemplates-136"></a>Don't emit code for implicit instantiations of inline templates, either. 
The default is to handle inlines differently so that compiles with and
without optimization will need the same set of explicit instantiations.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-implement-inlines</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dimplement_002dinlines-137"></a>To save space, do not emit out-of-line copies of inline functions
controlled by <span class="samp">#pragma implementation</span>.  This will cause linker
errors if these functions are not inlined everywhere they are called.

     <!-- APPLE LOCAL begin -findirect-virtual-calls 2001-10-30 sts ** -->
<br><dt><code>-findirect-virtual-calls</code><dd><a name="index-findirect_002dvirtual_002dcalls-138"></a>Do not make direct calls to virtual functions; instead, always
go through the vtable. (APPLE ONLY)
<!-- APPLE LOCAL end -findirect-virtual-calls 2001-10-30 sts ** -->

     <!-- APPLE LOCAL begin -fapple-kext -->
<br><dt><code>-fapple-kext</code><dd><a name="index-fapple_002dkext-139"></a>Alter vtables, destructors, and other implementation details to more
closely resemble the GCC 2.95 ABI.  This is to make kernel extensions
loadable by Darwin kernels, and is required to build any Darwin kernel
extension.  <span class="option">-fno-exceptions</span> and <span class="option">-static</span> must also be
used with this flag.  (APPLE ONLY)
<!-- APPLE LOCAL end -fapple-kext -->

     <!-- APPLE LOCAL begin coalescing 2002-04-11 turly ** -->
<br><dt><code>-fcoalesce-templates</code><dd><a name="index-fcoalesce_002dtemplates-140"></a>Mark instantiated templates as "coalesced": the linker will discard
all but one, thus saving space. (APPLE ONLY)
<!-- APPLE LOCAL end coalescing 2002-04-11 turly ** -->

     <br><dt><code>-fms-extensions</code><dd><a name="index-fms_002dextensions-141"></a>Disable pedantic warnings about constructs used in MFC, such as implicit
int and getting a pointer to member function via non-standard syntax.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-nonansi-builtins</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dnonansi_002dbuiltins-142"></a>Disable built-in declarations of functions that are not mandated by
ANSI/ISO C.  These include <code>ffs</code>, <code>alloca</code>, <code>_exit</code>,
<code>index</code>, <code>bzero</code>, <code>conjf</code>, and other related functions.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-operator-names</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002doperator_002dnames-143"></a>Do not treat the operator name keywords <code>and</code>, <code>bitand</code>,
<code>bitor</code>, <code>compl</code>, <code>not</code>, <code>or</code> and <code>xor</code> as
synonyms as keywords.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-optional-diags</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002doptional_002ddiags-144"></a>Disable diagnostics that the standard says a compiler does not need to
issue.  Currently, the only such diagnostic issued by G++ is the one for
a name having multiple meanings within a class.

     <br><dt><code>-fpermissive</code><dd><a name="index-fpermissive-145"></a>Downgrade messages about nonconformant code from errors to warnings.  By
default, G++ effectively sets <span class="option">-pedantic-errors</span> without
<span class="option">-pedantic</span>; this option reverses that.  This behavior and this
option are superseded by <span class="option">-pedantic</span>, which works as it does for GNU C.

     <br><dt><code>-frepo</code><dd><a name="index-frepo-146"></a>Enable automatic template instantiation at link time.  This option also
implies <span class="option">-fno-implicit-templates</span>.  See <a href="Template-Instantiation.html#Template-Instantiation">Template Instantiation</a>, for more information.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-rtti</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002drtti-147"></a>Disable generation of information about every class with virtual
functions for use by the C++ runtime type identification features
(<span class="samp">dynamic_cast</span> and <span class="samp">typeid</span>).  If you don't use those parts
of the language, you can save some space by using this flag.  Note that
exception handling uses the same information, but it will generate it as
needed.

     <!-- APPLE LOCAL begin jet -->
<br><dt><code>-fskip-unused-source</code><dd><a name="index-fskip_002dunused_002dsource-148"></a>Skip declarations in the input files that aren't actually needed. 
This flag doesn't change the meaning of correct source code, but it
can suppress diagnostics about incorrect source code and suppress
output of debugging information for the parts of the input that are
skipped. 
<!-- APPLE LOCAL end jet -->

     <br><dt><code>-fstats</code><dd><a name="index-fstats-149"></a>Emit statistics about front-end processing at the end of the compilation. 
This information is generally only useful to the G++ development team.

     <br><dt><code>-ftemplate-depth-</code><var>n</var><dd><a name="index-ftemplate_002ddepth-150"></a>Set the maximum instantiation depth for template classes to <var>n</var>. 
A limit on the template instantiation depth is needed to detect
endless recursions during template class instantiation.  ANSI/ISO C++
conforming programs must not rely on a maximum depth greater than 17.

     <br><dt><code>-fuse-cxa-atexit</code><dd><a name="index-fuse_002dcxa_002datexit-151"></a>Register destructors for objects with static storage duration with the
<code>__cxa_atexit</code> function rather than the <code>atexit</code> function. 
This option is required for fully standards-compliant handling of static
destructors, but will only work if your C library supports
<code>__cxa_atexit</code>. 
<!-- APPLE LOCAL manual -->
This option is not supported on Mac OS X.

     <br><dt><code>-fvtable-gc</code><dd><a name="index-fvtable_002dgc-152"></a>Emit special relocations for vtables and virtual function references
so that the linker can identify unused virtual functions and zero out
vtable slots that refer to them.  This is most useful with
<span class="option">-ffunction-sections</span> and <span class="option">-Wl,--gc-sections</span>, in order to
also discard the functions themselves.

     <p>This optimization requires GNU as and GNU ld.  Not all systems support
this option.  <span class="option">-Wl,--gc-sections</span> is ignored without <span class="option">-static</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-weak</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dweak-153"></a>Do not use weak symbol support, even if it is provided by the linker. 
By default, G++ will use weak symbols if they are available.  This
option exists only for testing, and should not be used by end-users;
it will result in inferior code and has no benefits.  This option may
be removed in a future release of G++.

     <br><dt><code>-nostdinc++</code><dd><a name="index-nostdinc_002b_002b-154"></a>Do not search for header files in the standard directories specific to
C++, but do still search the other standard directories.  (This option
is used when building the C++ library.) 
</dl>

   <p>In addition, these optimization, warning, and code generation options
have meanings only for C++ programs:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-fno-default-inline</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002ddefault_002dinline-155"></a>Do not assume <span class="samp">inline</span> for functions defined inside a class scope. 
See <a href="Optimize-Options.html#Optimize-Options">Options That Control Optimization</a>.  Note that these
functions will have linkage like inline functions; they just won't be
inlined by default.

     <br><dt><code>-Wabi </code><span class="roman">(C++ only)</span><dd><a name="index-Wabi-156"></a>Warn when G++ generates code that is probably not compatible with the
vendor-neutral C++ ABI.  Although an effort has been made to warn about
all such cases, there are probably some cases that are not warned about,
even though G++ is generating incompatible code.  There may also be
cases where warnings are emitted even though the code that is generated
will be compatible.

     <p>You should rewrite your code to avoid these warnings if you are
concerned about the fact that code generated by G++ may not be binary
compatible with code generated by other compilers.

     <p>The known incompatibilities at this point include:

          <ul>
<li>Incorrect handling of tail-padding for bit-fields.  G++ may attempt to
pack data into the same byte as a base class.  For example:

          <pre class="smallexample">               struct A { virtual void f(); int f1 : 1; };
               struct B : public A { int f2 : 1; };
          </pre>
          <p class="noindent">In this case, G++ will place <code>B::f2</code> into the same byte
as<code>A::f1</code>; other compilers will not.  You can avoid this problem
by explicitly padding <code>A</code> so that its size is a multiple of the
byte size on your platform; that will cause G++ and other compilers to
layout <code>B</code> identically.

          <li>Incorrect handling of tail-padding for virtual bases.  G++ does not use
tail padding when laying out virtual bases.  For example:

          <pre class="smallexample">               struct A { virtual void f(); char c1; };
               struct B { B(); char c2; };
               struct C : public A, public virtual B {};
          </pre>
          <p class="noindent">In this case, G++ will not place <code>B</code> into the tail-padding for
<code>A</code>; other compilers will.  You can avoid this problem by
explicitly padding <code>A</code> so that its size is a multiple of its
alignment (ignoring virtual base classes); that will cause G++ and other
compilers to layout <code>C</code> identically.

          <li>Incorrect handling of bit-fields with declared widths greater than that
of their underlying types, when the bit-fields appear in a union.  For
example:

          <pre class="smallexample">               union U { int i : 4096; };
          </pre>
          <p class="noindent">Assuming that an <code>int</code> does not have 4096 bits, G++ will make the
union too small by the number of bits in an <code>int</code>.

          <li>Empty classes can be placed at incorrect offsets.  For example:

          <pre class="smallexample">               struct A {};
               
               struct B {
                 A a;
                 virtual void f ();
               };
               
               struct C : public B, public A {};
          </pre>
          <p class="noindent">G++ will place the <code>A</code> base class of <code>C</code> at a nonzero offset;
it should be placed at offset zero.  G++ mistakenly believes that the
<code>A</code> data member of <code>B</code> is already at offset zero.

          <li>Names of template functions whose types involve <code>typename</code> or
template template parameters can be mangled incorrectly.

          <pre class="smallexample">               template &lt;typename Q&gt;
               void f(typename Q::X) {}
               
               template &lt;template &lt;typename&gt; class Q&gt;
               void f(typename Q&lt;int&gt;::X) {}
          </pre>
          <p class="noindent">Instantiations of these templates may be mangled incorrectly.

     </ul>

     <br><dt><code>-Wctor-dtor-privacy </code><span class="roman">(C++ only)</span><dd><a name="index-Wctor_002ddtor_002dprivacy-157"></a>Warn when a class seems unusable, because all the constructors or
destructors in a class are private and the class has no friends or
public static member functions.  This warning is enabled by default.

     <br><dt><code>-Wnon-virtual-dtor </code><span class="roman">(C++ only)</span><dd><a name="index-Wnon_002dvirtual_002ddtor-158"></a>Warn when a class declares a non-virtual destructor that should probably
be virtual, because it looks like the class will be used polymorphically. 
This warning is enabled by <span class="option">-Wall</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-Wreorder </code><span class="roman">(C++ only)</span><dd><a name="index-Wreorder-159"></a><a name="index-reordering_002c-warning-160"></a><a name="index-warning-for-reordering-of-member-initializers-161"></a>Warn when the order of member initializers given in the code does not
match the order in which they must be executed.  For instance:

     <pre class="smallexample">          struct A {
            int i;
            int j;
            A(): j (0), i (1) { }
          };
     </pre>
     <p>Here the compiler will warn that the member initializers for <span class="samp">i</span>
and <span class="samp">j</span> will be rearranged to match the declaration order of the
members.  This warning is enabled by <span class="option">-Wall</span>. 
</dl>

   <p>The following <span class="option">-W...</span> options are not affected by <span class="option">-Wall</span>.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-Weffc++ </code><span class="roman">(C++ only)</span><dd><a name="index-Weffc_002b_002b-162"></a>Warn about violations of the following style guidelines from Scott Meyers'
<cite>Effective C++</cite> book:

          <ul>
<li>Item 11:  Define a copy constructor and an assignment operator for classes
with dynamically allocated memory.

          <li>Item 12:  Prefer initialization to assignment in constructors.

          <li>Item 14:  Make destructors virtual in base classes.

          <li>Item 15:  Have <code>operator=</code> return a reference to <code>*this</code>.

          <li>Item 23:  Don't try to return a reference when you must return an object.

     </ul>

     <p>and about violations of the following style guidelines from Scott Meyers'
<cite>More Effective C++</cite> book:

          <ul>
<li>Item 6:  Distinguish between prefix and postfix forms of increment and
decrement operators.

          <li>Item 7:  Never overload <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code>, or <code>,</code>.

     </ul>

     <p>If you use this option, you should be aware that the standard library
headers do not obey all of these guidelines; you can use <span class="samp">grep -v</span>
to filter out those warnings.

     <br><dt><code>-Wno-deprecated </code><span class="roman">(C++ only)</span><dd><a name="index-Wno_002ddeprecated-163"></a>Do not warn about usage of deprecated features.  See <a href="Deprecated-Features.html#Deprecated-Features">Deprecated Features</a>.

     <br><dt><code>-Wno-non-template-friend </code><span class="roman">(C++ only)</span><dd><a name="index-Wno_002dnon_002dtemplate_002dfriend-164"></a>Disable warnings when non-templatized friend functions are declared
within a template.  With the advent of explicit template specification
support in G++, if the name of the friend is an unqualified-id (i.e.,
<span class="samp">friend foo(int)</span>), the C++ language specification demands that the
friend declare or define an ordinary, nontemplate function.  (Section
14.5.3).  Before G++ implemented explicit specification, unqualified-ids
could be interpreted as a particular specialization of a templatized
function.  Because this non-conforming behavior is no longer the default
behavior for G++, <span class="option">-Wnon-template-friend</span> allows the compiler to
check existing code for potential trouble spots, and is on by default. 
This new compiler behavior can be turned off with

     <br><dt><code>-Wold-style-cast </code><span class="roman">(C++ only)</span><dd><a name="index-Wold_002dstyle_002dcast-165"></a>Warn if an old-style (C-style) cast to a non-void type is used within
a C++ program.  The new-style casts (<span class="samp">static_cast</span>,
<span class="samp">reinterpret_cast</span>, and <span class="samp">const_cast</span>) are less vulnerable to
unintended effects, and much easier to grep for.

base class.  For example, in:

     <pre class="smallexample">          struct A {
            virtual void f();
          };

          };
     </pre>
     <p>the <code>A</code> class version of <code>f</code> is hidden in <code>B</code>, and code
like this:

     <pre class="smallexample">          B* b;
          b-&gt;f();
     </pre>

     <br><dt><code>-Wsign-promo </code><span class="roman">(C++ only)</span><dd><a name="index-Wsign_002dpromo-170"></a>Warn when overload resolution chooses a promotion from unsigned or
enumeral type to a signed type over a conversion to an unsigned type of
the same size.  Previous versions of G++ would try to preserve
unsignedness, but the standard mandates the current behavior.

     <br><dt><code>-Wsynth </code><span class="roman">(C++ only)</span><dd><a name="index-Wsynth-171"></a><a name="index-warning-for-synthesized-methods-172"></a><a name="index-synthesized-methods_002c-warning-173"></a>Warn when G++'s synthesis behavior does not match that of cfront.  For
instance:

     <pre class="smallexample">          struct A {
            operator int ();
            A&amp; operator = (int);

            A a,b;
            a = b;
          }
     </pre>
     <p>In this example, G++ will synthesize a default <span class="samp">A&amp; operator =
(const A&amp;);</span>, while cfront will use the user-defined <span class="samp">operator =</span>.
