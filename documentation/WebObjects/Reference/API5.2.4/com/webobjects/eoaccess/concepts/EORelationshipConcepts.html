  A relationship is directional: One entity is considered the source, and
  the other is considered the destination. The relationship belongs to the
  source entity, and may only be traversed from source to destination. To
  simulate a two-way relationship you have to create an EORelationship for
  each direction. Although the relationship is directional, no inverse is
  implied (although an inverse relationship may exist).<p>
  A relationship maintains an array of joins identifying attributes from the
  related entities (see the EOJoin class specification for more information).
  Most relationships simply relate the objects of one entity to those of
  another by comparing attribute values between them. Such a relationship
  must be defined as to-one or to-many based on how many objects of the
  destination match each object of the source. This is called the <b>
  cardinality</b> of the relationship. In a to-one relationship, there must
  be exactly one destination object for each source object; in a to-many
  relationship there can be any number of destination objects for each
  source object.<p>
  A chain of relationships across several entities can be flattened,
  creating a single relationship that spans them all. For example, suppose
  you have a relationship between movies and directors, and a relationship
  between directors and talent. You can traverse these relationships to
  create a flattened relationship going directly from movies to talent. A
  flattened relationship is determined to be to-many or to-one based on the
  relationships it spans; if all are to-one, then the flattened relationship
  is to-one, but if any of them is to-many the flattened relationship is
  to-many.<p>
  Like the other major modeling classes, EORelationship provides a user
  dictionary that the application can use to store application-specific
  information related to the relationship.<p>
  <h2>Specifying the Join Semantic</h2>
  The relationship holds the join semantic; you can specify this semantic with
  <em>setJoinSemantic</em> . There are four types of join semantic :
  <em>InnerJoin , FullOuterJoin , LeftOuterJoin , and RightOuterJoin</em> . An
  inner join produces results only for destinations of the join relationship
  that have non-NULL values. A full outer join produces results for all
  source records, regardless of the values of the relationships. A left
  outer join preserves rows in the left (source) table, keeping them even if
  there's no corresponding row in the right table, while a right outer join
  preserves rows in the right (destination) table. Note that not all join
  semantics are supported by all database servers.<p>
  <h2>Creating a Simple Relationship</h2>
  A simple relationship is defined by the attributes it compares in
  connecting its source and destination entities. Each source-destination
  pair of attributes is encapsulated in an EOJoin object. For example, to
  create a relationship from the Movie entity to the Studio entity, a join
  has to be created from the <em>studioId</em> attribute of the Movie entity
  to the same attribute of the Studio entity. The values of these two
  attributes must be equal for a match to result. Note that <em>studioId</em>
  is the primary key attribute for the Studio entity, so there can only be
  one studio per movie; this relationship is therefore to-one.<p>
  This code excerpt creates an EORelationship for the relationship described
  above and adds it to the EOEntity for the Movie entity:<p>
  <code>
  <blockcode><pre>
  EOEntity movieEntity;//Assume this exists.
  EOEntity studioEntity;//Assume this exists.
  EOAttribute studioIDAttribute;
  EOAttribute movieStudioIDAttribute;
  EOJoin toStudioJoin;
  EORelationship toStudioRelationship;
  studioIDAttribute =studioEntity.attributeNamed("studioId ");
  movieStudioIDAttribute =movieEntity.attributeNamed("studioId ");
  toStudioJoin =new EOJoin(movieStudioIDAttribute,studioIDAttribute);
  toStudioRelationship =new EORelationship();
  toStudioRelationship.setName("studio ");
  movieEntity.addRelationship(toStudioRelationship);
  toStudioRelationship.addJoin(toStudioJoin);
  toStudioRelationship.setToMany(false);
  toStudioRelationship.setJoinSemantic(EORelationship.InnerJoin);
  </pre></blockquote>
  </code><p>
  This code first gets the attributes from the source and destination
  entities, and then creates an EOJoin with them. Next, a new EORelationship
  is created, its name is set, and it's added to <em>movieEntity</em> . The
  EOJoin is added to the relationship and the relationship is set to be
  to-one. Finally, in the <em>setJoinSemantic</em> line, <em>InnerJoin</em>
  indicates that only objects that actually have a matching destination
  object will be included in the result when the relationship is traversed.
  Creating a to-many relationship in the opposite direction merely swaps the
  source and destination attributes, and assigns the relationship to the
  EOEntity for the Studio entity:<p>
  <code>
  <blockcode><pre>
  EOJoin toMoviesJoin;
  EORelationship toMoviesRelationship;
  toMoviesJoin =new EOJoin(studioIDAttribute,movieStudioIDAttribute);
  toMoviesRelationship =new EORelationship();
  toMoviesRelationship.setName("movies ");
  studioEntity.addRelationship(toMoviesRelationship);
  toMoviesRelationship.addJoin(toMoviesJoin);
  toMoviesRelationship.setToMany(true);
  toMoviesRelationship.setJoinSemantic(EORelationship.InnerJoin);
  </pre></blockquote>
  </code><p>
  Note that this relationship is to-many precisely because the destination
  attribute isn't the primary key for its entity (Movie), and therefore isn't
  unique with regard to that entity.<p>
  A relationship isn't restricted to only one EOJoin. It's entirely possible
  for a relationship to be defined based on two or more attributes in the
  source and destination entities. For example, consider an employees
  database that contains a picture of each employee identified by first and
  last name. you'd define the relationship by joining each of the first and
  last names in the Employee entity to the same attribute in the
  <em>EmpPhoto</em> attribute.
  A simple relationship is considered to reference all of the attributes in
  its joins. You can use the <em>referencesProperty</em> method to find out
  if an EORelationship references a particular attribute.<p>
  <h2>Creating a Flattened Relationship</h2>
  A flattened relationship depends on several simple relationships already
  existing. Assuming that several do exist, creating a flattened
  relationship is straightforward. For example, suppose that the Movie
  entity has a to-many relationship to the Director entity, called
  <em>toDirectors</em> . The Director entity in turn has a relationship to the
  Talent entity called <em>toTalent</em> . In the Movies database, the
  Director table acts as an intermediate table between Movie and Talent. In
  this situation, it make sense to flatten the relationship Movies has to
  Director(<em>toDirectors</em>) to give Movie access to the Talent table
  through Director's <em>toTalent</em> relationship. For more discussion of
  when to use flattened relationships, refer to the chapters "Designing
  Enterprise Objects" and "Advanced Enterprise Object Modeling" in the
  <i><b>Enterprise Objects Framework Developer's Guide</b></i>.<p>
  This code excerpt creates a flattened relationship from Movie to Talent:<p>
  <code>
  <blockcode><pre>
  EOEntity movieEntity;//Assume this exists.
  EORelationship toDirectorsRelationship =new EORelationship();
  toDirectorsRelationship.setEntity(movieEntity);
  toDirectorsRelationship.setName("directors ");
  toDirectorsRelationship.setDefinition:("toDirector.toTalent ");
  movieEntity.addRelationship(toDirectorsRelationship);
  </pre></blockquote>
  </code><p>
  All that's needed to establish the relationship is a data path (also
  called the definition) naming each component relationship connected, with
  the names separated by periods. Note that because the cardinality of a
  flattened relationship is determinable from its components, no
  <em>setToMany</em> message is required here.<p>
  A simple relationship is considered to reference all of the relationships
  in its definition, plus every attribute referenced by the component
  relationships. You can use the <em>referencesProperty</em> method to find
  out if an EORelationship references another relationship or attribute.<p>
