MySndPlayDB was written to be a Carbon compatible replacement for SndPlayDoubleBuffer.  It will,of course, also work in a non-Carbon environment, so even non-Carbon applications might want totake a look at it.A replacement for SndPlayDoubleBuffer is not as easy as I had hoped.  It requires that I walkthe sound channel's data, which should be OK since you can allocate the sound channel memoryourself.  There are no accessors to get at the sound channel structure, and it's not an opaquetype.  Engineering has said that this should be OK.This also requires that I have a wrapper around SndDoImmediate for any quietCmd or flushCmdthat is issued so that I can clean up memory allocated per channel.  To clean up this memorythere is a notification procedure that disposes of the per channel allocated memory.  For thisto run, you must call WaitNextEvent, etc., so that the Notification Manager has time to run.This should not effect too many applications, but a game, perhaps, might need to take this intoaccount.The code is heavily commented, at least I think so, so it should be pretty easy to follow thecode and figure out what's going on.Good luck.
