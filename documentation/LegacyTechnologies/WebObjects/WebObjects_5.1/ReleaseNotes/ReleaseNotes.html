<h1>WebObjects 5.1 Release Notes</h1>
<i>Last Updated January 2002</i>
<P>
This document lists those problems known to exist in WebObjects 5.1. For late breaking, up to date news on the web, please refer to the WebObjects documentation at <A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/webobjects">http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/webobjects</A> and the Technical Notes available at <A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/technotes/index.html">http://developer.apple.com/technotes/index.html</A>.
<P>
<H2><BR><BR>Using JDBC With WebObjects 5.1</H2>
The best source of driver information is Sun's website:

<A HREF="http://industry.java.sun.com/products/jdbc/drivers/">http://industry.java.sun.com/products/jdbc/drivers/</A>
<P>
Only JDBC 2.0 compatible drivers work with the WebObjects 5.1 runtime regardless
of platform.  The database vendor typically provides the JDBC driver in
the form of a jar or zip file.  
<P>
The JDBC driver must be installed in a place where the Java VM can
find it.  The simplest procedure is to add the JDBC driver jar (or
zip) file to the Java VM's "extensions" directory.  On Mac OS X, this
directory is always /Library/Java/Home/lib/ext/.  On Windows 2000,
this directory would be something like C:\jdk1.3\jre\lib\ext\ but the
exact details depend on where you installed the JDK 1.3 on your
machine.
<P>
If you prefer, you can instead add the JDBC driver to your CLASSPATH,
either explicitly listing the jar file or exploding the jar into a
directory that is on the CLASSPATH.
<P>
When doing development on Windows 2000, the situation is somewhat more
complicated.  The WebObjects 5.1 runtime uses a Java 2 VM and requires a JDK
1.3 compatible JDBC driver just like Mac OS X and other
platforms.  However, EOModeler uses the Java Bridge which supports
only JDK 1.1 on Windows and therefore requires a JDK 1.1 compatible
driver.  Consequently, to develop and test on
Windows 2000, you will need two versions of a particular JDBC driver:
one that is JDK 1.3 compatible for the WebObjects 5.1 runtime, and another that
is JDK 1.1 compatible for use by EOModeler and the Java Bridge.
<P>
To use a JDBC 1.1 driver with EOModeler on Windows 2000, you should
add it to the JavaConfig.plist.  Let's call it "driver11.jar".  If your
WebObjects installation is not in C:/Apple, substitute the appropriate
path below.  We use the Unix notation of "/" for the directory
separator.
<OL>
<LI>  login as an administrator
<LI>  copy driver11.jar to C:/Apple/Library/Java/
<LI>  Edit the file C:/Apple/Library/Java/JavaConfig.plist
<LI>  Add $NEXT_ROOT/Library/Java/driver11.jar to the entry for the 
    "DefaultClasspath".  Items in the list should be separated by a
    semicolon ";".  Use the term "$NEXT_ROOT" literaly, following the
    pattern of the other entries.
</OL>
Note that on Mac OS X, the Java Bridge supports the Java 2 VM so the
JDK 1.3 compatible driver is used for both EOModeler and the WebObjects 5.1
runtime.  If Windows is used only as a deployment platform, then the
JDK 1.1 compatible driver is not needed.

		<TD>The JDBC Adaptor uses standard JDBC functions to call stored procedures and to fetch the results.  An Oracle stored procedure does not produce a result set in the usual way.  Instead, it uses an Oracle-specific REF CURSOR parameter to provide access to results.  The JDBC Adaptor offers limited support for the Oracle REF CURSOR only as the return value for an Oracle stored function, not as an OUT parameter for an Oracle stored procedure.  In Oracle, the function is created with the SQL command "CREATE FUNCTION" as opposed to "CREATE PROCEDURE" which is used for procedures.  In EOModeler, the Oracle stored function is modeled in the same way as any stored procedure. The external type of the returnValue parameter should be set to "REF CURSOR" even though this is not in the popup list of supported types. Its column name should be "000" (a string of three zeroes) to indicate that it is a return value from the stored function.  (Reverse-engineering the store function should set this up automatically.)  An Oracle stored function of this type may be used as the "Fetch All" procedure for an Entity. Other Oracle stored procedures using only in and out parameters with JDBC compatible types should work normally as long as no result set is expected.</TD>

When you compile the application, foo.jar will appear at the same level as &lt;your-application&gt;.jar under Contents/Resources/Java.<BR>
		3. Modify the OTHER_CLASSPATH flag (which is normally commented out) in the Makefile.preamble file so it contains both the deployment and development locations:<P>
		OTHER_CLASSPATH = APPROOT/Contents/Resources/Java/<BR>
		foo.jar$(CLASSPATH_DELIMITER)$(SRCROOT)/Java/foo.jar<P>

		<TD>There are certain issues which project import in Project Builder does not solve, and which must be resolved by the developer after importing the project.  Known issues include:<P>
		1) The organization of the file groups in the file browser in PB will closely mirror that of the original PBWO project, rather than the organization of the WebObjects Application PB template.<BR>
		2) Information in the Makefile.preamble and Makefile.postamble files in a PBWO project cannot be processed by project import and will not appear in the PB project.<BR>
		3) JavaClient applications with a subproject whose Java files are compiled for both the server and the client sides (e.g., a Common.subproj) will have their files linked to only the Application Server target in PB, not also to the Web Server target.<BR>
		4) The project's signature in the PkgInfo file after compilation will be APPL???? or FMWK???? not APPLwebo or FMWKwebo.<BR>
		5) The default debugger for an imported project will be gdb, not jdb.<BR>
		6) Aggregate projects may import strangely, or not at all.</TD>

	<tr>
		<TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><FONT SIZE="2">Workaround&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></TD>
		<TD>Most of these issues can be worked around by the user after import.  To fix the corresponding issues above, do the following:<P>
		1) File groups can be reorganized in a highly flexible manner in PB.  In particular, the file groups representing .subproj folders no longer have any functional purpose in compiling a project in PB - since file organization and build product organization are orthogonal in PB - and those files can be reorganized as desired.<BR>
		2) Data in Makefile.preamble and Makefile.postamble files must be ported manually after import.  Build variables will likely have to be set in the Build Settings panel of one or more targets.  Additional targets can be implemented as Shell Script or Copy Files Build Phases on one or more targets.<BR>
		3) After importing a subproject which contains Java files intended for both the server and the client sides, files can be added to any targets which the import process did not automatically add them to.  It is valid for files to be attached to multiple targets in PB.<BR>
		4) The product signature is defined in the Application Settings or Framework Settings tab of the project's main target (the one with the same name as the project).  The CFBundleSignature value (labelled just "signature" in the Simple Settings view) can be changed from ???? to webo after import.<BR>
		5) The debugger used to debug a project is defined in the Executables tab of the project's main target.  Go to the Debugger subtab and change the radio button to select "Java Debugger" rather than "Gdb".<BR>
		6) Aggregate projects are not supported in WebObjects 5.  Individual products in an aggregate PBWO project should be identified and imported individually into separate PB projects.</TD>

		<TD>1. Make sure you regenerate the makefile as explained in the JavaConverter documentation.<BR>
		2. JavaConverter doesn't bring over the files in the "SUPPORTING FILES", including the makefile preambles and postambles. All of the makefiles need to be added by hand to this folder.<BR>
		3. JavaConverter flags a JC_ERROR message on the invocation of pageWithName in the logout method for the MenuHeader class (if you still have that class in your project). Ignore this message. This use of pageWithName is legal.<BR>
		4. Make sure your Application class has the following main function to intialize the WOF Stack:<BR>
		<PRE>
		public static void main(String argv[]) {
		   WOApplication.main(argv, Application.class);
	        }</PRE><BR>
		5. JavaConverter doesn't handle EOModel conversions, so make sure your model is pointing to the correct adaptor. In addition, you may have to convert the attribute type names. NSString should be changed to String. NSDate and NSCalendarDate should be changed to NSTimestamp. NSNumber should be changed to java.math.BigDecimal.<BR>
		6. If you have generated the Java stub for a DirectToWeb dynamic template, make sure your file has the following constructor:
		<PRE>
		public YOUR_CLASS_NAME(WOContext aContext) {
		   super(aContext);
	        }</PRE><BR>
		7. Pages you have frozen using DirectToWeb could contain variable definitions like<BR>
		private EOEnterpriseObject itemForMovies;<BR>
		change all itemFor... references from private to protected so that WebObjects can resolve these keys at runtime.</TD>

		<TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><FONT SIZE="2">Description</FONT></TD>
		<TD>Enterprise Objects Framework's query building mechanism doesn't handle relationships to inheritance hierarchies.  For example, suppose that you are are attempting to qualify a fetch through a to-many relationship (planes) that points to the top of a horizontally mapped inheritance hierarchy (for the entities Plane, FighterPlane, and TrainerPlane).  If you want the query to test against all tables, you'd expect Enterprise Objects Framework to generate SQL similar to the following:<P>
		<PRE>
		SELECT  t0.AIRPORT_ID
		FROM PLANE t1, FIGHTER t2, TRAINER t3, AIRPORT t0
		WHERE
		   (t1.LENGTH &lt;= 1000 AND t0.AIRPORT_ID  = t1.AIRPORT_FK) OR

		   (t3.LENGTH &lt;= 1000 AND t0.AIRPORT_ID  = t1.AIRPORT_FK) 
		</PRE>
		Instead, Enterprise Objects Framework generates the following SQL:<P>
		<PRE>
		SELECT  t0.AIRPORT_ID
		FROM PLANE t1, AIRPORT t0
		WHERE  
		   (t1.LENGTH &lt;= 1000) AND
		   t0.AIRPORT_ID = t1.AIRPORT_FK<P>

		   In other words, only the table for the root of the hierarchy is queried.</TD>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><FONT SIZE="2">Workaround&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></TD>
		<TD>You can create a qualifier that generates the correct SQL by:<P>
		1. Adding relationships in the source entity to all the tables in the inheritance hierarchy.  For example, to the Airport entity, you'd add the relationships toFighters and toTrainers to the destination entities FighterPlane and TrainerPlane, respectively.  Mark the relationships so they aren't class properties.<P>
		2. When building your query, explicitly list these extra relationships.  In the Planes example, you'd fetch from Airport where "planes.length &lt; 1000 OR toFigtherPlanes.length &lt; 1000 OR toTrainerPlanes.length &lt; 1000"<BR>
		Alternatively, you might be able to solve this problem more generally by writing a post processor for EOQualifiers that splits up clauses that perform inheritance tests.  The post processor could even programmatically generate the additional relationships on demand and register them with the model using names like "plane_Subclass_Fighter".<BR>
		A generic EOQualifier post processor could be wired into Enterprise Objects Framework so that application writers don't have to know it exists.  The right place for such a mechanism is probably in  EOKeyValueQualifier's schemaBasedQualifierWithRootEntity: method (see EOSQLQualifier.h).  You could put the post processor code in a subclass of EOKeyValueQualifier (with an appropriate call to super after the transformation, if any, is performed) and have your subclass pose as EOKeyValueQualifier.</TD>

	</tr>

		<TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><FONT SIZE="2">Description</FONT></TD>
		<TD>NSTimestamp provided wrappers for some functionality of java.util.Calendar to aid those porting applications that used NSCalendarDate and NSGregorianDate from previous versions of WebObjects.  However, NSTimestamp's primary purpose is to provide consistent date values that use an accurate timezone implementation (NSTimeZone, rather than java.util.SimpleTimeZone).<P>
		In order to maintain consistency for applications that use database persistence, it was necessary to ensure that all timezones are internally represented in UTC, rather than a local timezone.  NSTimestamp objects returned by the no-argument constructor used to be located in the timezone local to the application; now such objects are located in UTC (also known as Greenwich Mean Time or GMT).<P>
		This will cause some methods that have been deprecated to behave differently.  These methods include:<P>
		dayOfCommonEra<BR>
		dayOfMonth<BR> 
		dayOfWeek<BR> 
		dayOfYear<BR> 
		gregorianUnitsSinceTimestamp<BR> 
		hourOfDay<BR>

		setSeconds<BR> 
		setTime<BR> 
		setYear<BR> 
		timestampByAddingGregorianUnits<BR> 
		timeZone<BR> 
		yearOfCommonEra<P>
		It is possible to continue to use these methods, but it is important to understand that the NSTimestamp object, even if created using a timezone parameter, is located in UTC.  Gregorian units for such an object are thus relative to UTC and not the timezone local to the application.<P>
		Deprecated methods that should be unaffected by this change are:<P>
		currentTimeIntervalSinceReferenceDate<BR>
		distantFuture<BR> 
		distantPast<BR> 
		earlierTimestamp<BR>

		microsecondOfSecond<BR>

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><FONT SIZE="2">Description</FONT></TD>
		<TD>The so-called "relative distinguished name" (RDN,  which is used as the primary key) in the LDAP API is often derived from the value(s) of other attribute(s) of an EO. If this value contains special characters, a special syntax must be used by the JNDI/LDAP Adaptor for the RDN (but not for the attribute).These special characters are: ","  "="  "+"  "&lt;"  "&gt;"  "#"  ";"Even more special (in their handling) are: Backslash "\", Quote (") itself.Conforming with RFC 2253 (and 1779), these are escaped by preceding them with a backslash "\". Two exceptions are the "more special" characters backslash and quote, for which this doesn't (always) work. For these two characters, their hexadecimal notation (again according to RFC 2253) is used, which is "#5C" and "#22", respectively.Some servers handle special characters in a very unique way, and the above scheme doesn't work with all of them. For example, it works with OpenLDAP, but not with iPlanet. Since it doesn't seem to be possible to handle special characters transparently with all servers, in these cases the application needs to handle special characters explicitly. (In the case of iPlanet, it might modify both the attribute value and the RDN value in exactly the same way, to avoid so-called "multi-valued" data.)</TD>

A better solution, assuming you only need the request object, is to implement createSessionForRequest() in your subclass of WOApplication:
		<pre>

For example, imagine that you have a Key class that has 3 member variables: rank (of type int), requestDate (of type NSTimestamp) and message (of type String).

		            value = formatter.parseObject((String)value);

Search for the "WOAPP_RESOURCES" key. ?Add "Localizable.strings" as part of the value, within the parentheses. Edit the Makefile. Search for the "GLOBAL_RESOURCES" key and append "Localizable.strings" to the value. Reopen the project.For Project Builder on Mac OS X, if the project was imported from Project Builder WO (or ProjectBuilder on Windows), then the global resource is handled correctly and appears in the "Resources" area and is labeled as "Global".

		<TD>There isn't really a workaround, as this is the expected behavior for Project Builder (which differs greatly from ProjectBuilderWO).  What you should do is add the folder that contains the resources (e.g. "folderName") as a folder reference to "Resources" or "WebServerResources"; do not add the individual resources directly.  Project Builder will not directly keep track of the individual resources, but the directory hierarchy will be preserved when you build (e.g. "folderName" will exist in the "WebServerResources" directory in the build project, and "folderName" will contain all of your resources).  This is essentially what is done for WebObjects component templates (directories ending with .wo, containing the HTML template and the WebObjects declarations).  See the documentation for Project Builder for further details.</TD>

		<TD>Any Formatter attached to a WOTextField is required to support function composition using its format() and parseObject() methods. format(parseObject(format(obj))) and parseObject(format(parseObject(text))) must be legal operations.  The parseObject() and format() methods need not be perfect inverse functions, but the results of the composition should be logical.  For example, with a NSNumberFormatter set to round off any fractional data, the parseObject() method will initially return a real number.  But after the initial format() invocation ensures the number conforms to this NSNumberFormatter's pattern, the number will always be the same integer, no matter how many parseObject() and format() operations are used.This is necessary as WOTextFields are both input and output elements, and forms may be resubmitted without change any number of times.  Using function composition ensures that the value from the first form submission is the same value used in all subsequent form submissions, until the form value is actually changed by the user.</TD>

		<TD>"Value Type" column in EOModeler is not well described.</TD>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><FONT SIZE="2">Description</FONT></TD>
		<TD>In EOModeler, the Value Type for an attribute can be set while editing an attribute in "Table Mode".  If the "Value Type" column is not visible, use the pop-up menu labled "Add Column" in the lower left corner of the pane.<P>
		The Value Type of an attribute in an EOModel controls how the JDBC adaptor handles important details in its negotiations with the database. A Value Type is typically a single character.<P>
		For attributes with a Value Class of java.lang.Number the following value types are defined:<BR>
		b = Byte<BR>
		s = Short<BR>
		i = Integer<BR>
		l = Long<BR>
		f = Float<BR>
		d = Double<BR>
		B = java.math.BigDecimal<BR>
		c = Boolean<P>
		Since java.lang.Number is an abstract superclass, the Value Type controls which concrete class the JDBC adaptor should instantiate based on the raw data provided from the database.<P>
		It also controls which JDBC methods are used to send and retrieve the data to and from the database. For attributes with a Value Class of java.lang.String the following value types are defined:<BR>
		&lt;none&gt;<BR>
		c<BR>
		S<BR>
		C<BR>
		E<P>
		These Value Types affect which method on the java.sql.PreparedStatement are used to transfer text data between the database and the JDBC adaptor.  An empty Value Type is backward compatible behavior with WebObjects v4.5 and uses the setString() method if the text is less than the database's advertised maximum varchar length, and setCharacterStream(), if it is too large.  If the database fails to advertise a maximum length, the default is 256 characters.  A Value Type of 'S' uses setString() regardless of the text's length.  A Value Type of 'C' uses setCharacterStream() regardless of the text's length.  A Value Type of 'E' converts the text into raw UTF-8 bytes, and then uses setBinaryStream() to save them in a binary typed column in the database.  The Value Type of 'c' tells the adaptor to generate SQL using RTRIM to strip off all trailing spaces, such as those found in CHAR columns.<P>
		'S' is appropriate for most text columns.  'C' is good for columns which usually contain large amounts of data.  'c' should be used when trailing spaces are not significant in a CHAR column. (It's better to use a VARCHAR column if possible.)  We recommend against using 'E', except in extreme cases.  It is the database's responsibility to handle text encoding issues, and using 'E' is usually an indication the database is not correctly configured.<P>
		For attributes with a Value Class of NSTimestamp the following value types are defined:<BR>
		&lt;none&gt;<BR>
		D<BR>
		t<BR>
		T<BR>
		M<P>
		These value types affect how the data is transfer between the JDBC adaptor and the database.  An empty Value Type uses get/setObject() on the ResultSet and PreparedStatement.  It assumes the database can provide a value compatible with a java.sql.Timestamp.  A 'D' indicates WebObject's JDBC adaptor should use get/setDate.  A 't' indicates get/setTime(), and a 'T' uses get/setTimestamp().  The 'M' value type is a workaround for a bug in some MS SQLServer JDBC drivers.  It only support java.sql.Date.<P>
		BLOB and CLOB columns are handled specially by the adaptor to support Oracle. The Value Type has no influence.</TD>
