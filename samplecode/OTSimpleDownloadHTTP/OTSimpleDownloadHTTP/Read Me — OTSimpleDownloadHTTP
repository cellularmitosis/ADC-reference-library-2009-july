Read Me About OTSimpleDownloadHTTP for CodeWarrior (ProjectBuilder is below)2.0This sample demonstrates the easiest way to use Open Transport to download an HTTP URL from a web server.  The code from this sample is featured in the latest release (v1.3) of the book “Inside Macintosh: Open Transport”.Packing ListThe package contains the following items items: • OTSimpleDownloadHTTP.mcp — A project to build the Carbon version. • OTSimpleDownloadHTTP(Carb) — A compiled version of the above.• OTSimpleDownloadHTTPTest.c — A test application that calls the uses the download module.• OTSimpleDownloadHTTP.h — Interface to the download module.• OTSimpleDownloadHTTP.c — A module that exports a single, simple routine to download an HTTP URL using OT.Sample RequirementsI tested this code with Carbon 1.2.5 running under Mac OS 9 and on Mac OSX.  The code should run just fine with Carbon 1.2.5 (or newer) and Universal Interfaces 3.3.2 (or newer).  Running the SampleTo run the sample, simply double click the application.  You can then choose to either enter a number (to download one of the pre-defined URLs listed on the console window), or type in your own HTTP URL.  The contents of the URL (including the HTTP headers!) will be placed in a file in the same folder as the application.Building the SampleThe sample was built using the Metrowerks CodeWarrior IDE 4.1 environment Carbon SDK 1.2.5 and Universal Interfaces 3.3.2.  Both the Carbon SDK and Universal intefaces can be downloaded from Apple website at : http://developer.apple.com/sdk/index.htmlTo rebuild the sample, first open the project and change the “Access Paths” to point to the interfaces and libraries from the Carbon 1.2.5 SDK (or newer) and the Universal Interfaces 3.3.2 (or newer).  Then choose Make from the Project menu.Credits and Version HistoryIf you find any problems with this sample, mail <DevSupport@apple.com> with “Attn: Quinn” as the first line of your mail and I’ll try to fix them up.Version 1.0d1 was the first release.Version 1.0d2 corrects a style issue, where I was assigning an event code (lookResult), which will be positive, to a variable of type OSStatus.Version 1.0d3 corrects a bug in the comments where I was recommending the use of "\0x13" instead of "\0x0d".  Also brought the test URLs up to date with the recent ADR web site reorganisation.Version 2.0 Project was updated for CodeWarrior IDE 4.1 and carbonized for OSX.Share and EnjoyQuinn “The Eskimo!”Apple Developer Technical SupportNetworking, Communications, Hardware9 Jul 1998============Read Me About OTSimpleDownloadHTTP for ProjectBuilder2.0This sample demonstrates the easiest way to use Open Transport to download an HTTP URL from a web server.
