Why Was This Archived?This sample was archived because QuickDraw GX is no longer supported by Apple.  The latest Mac OS releases, Mac OS 8.5.x and 8.6, will be the final operating system releases from Apple to include support for QuickDraw GX. In its place, Apple introduced two new technologies: Apple Type Services for Unicode Imaging (ATSUI) and Apple Advanced Typography (AAT). ATSUI provides the same high-quality typography and expanded Unicode-based multilingual line layout as GX, and AAT provides advanced layout support, including GX font support. Apple recommends that GX developers transition to these new technologies at their first opportunity. Quinn "The Eskimo!"Worldwide Developer Technical Support9 Jun 1999
