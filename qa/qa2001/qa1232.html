                    Q: What is the X Window System (X11) for Mac OS X?
                </p>
                <p id="p4">
                    A: X11 for Mac OS X is an implementation of the X Window System that makes it possible to run X11-based applications in Mac OS X.  See <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/x11/">www.apple.com/macosx/features/x11</a> for more information.

                    Q: Where can I download X11 for Mac OS X?
                </p>
                <p id="p4">
                    A: X11 is included on the standard distribution of Mac OS X 10.3 client. User must do a custom install and select X11 package. For Mac OS X Server 10.3, you should download it from <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/x11/download/">www.apple.com/macosx/features/x11/download</a>.

                    Q: Is the X11 beta for Jaguar still available?
                </p>
                <p id="p4">
                    A: Now that we have released X11 1.0 for Panther, we have ended our highly-successful beta process. We would like to express our appreciation for all of you who helped us by participating in the X11 for Mac OS X beta process. We made a wide range of improvements to the product based on your feedback, the bulk of which have been released as Open Source and will become part of XFree86 4.4 <a href="http://developer.apple.com/darwin/projects/X11">http://developer.apple.com/darwin/projects/X11</a>. Please observe the terms of the beta license agreement and do not redistribute private copies of that beta.

                    Q: I've installed X11 for Mac OS X, what should I do next?
                </p>
                <p id="p4">
                    A: After installing X11, you can activate the X11 server by launching the X11 application in the Utilities folder in the Applications folder. To find other X11 applications and toolkits, please see resources at the bottom of this F.A.Q.
                </p>

                 <p id="p2">
                    Q: Launching X11 from <code>/Applications/X11.app</code> doesn't work. How do I make it work?
                </p>
                <p id="p4">
                    A: The X11 at <code>/Applications/X11.app</code> mostly likely comes from your previous version of Mac OS X and X11 Beta system. In Mac OS X 10.3, X11 has been moved to <code>/Applications/Utilities/X11.app</code>. Remove the version in <code>/Applications/X11.app</code>.

                    Q: Where is the source code to X11 for Mac OS X?
                </p>
                <p id="p4">
                    A: Yes, the source code for the X11 server is available from the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/darwin/">Darwin</a> site. To build this source, you will need the <code>X11LibApple.pkg</code>, which gets installed when you install the binary package. Source code is only available for the X11 server, and not for the <code>quartz-wm</code> window manager or <code>X11LibApple.pkg</code>. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p id="p2">
                    Q: To which version of XFree86 does X11 for Mac OS X correspond?
                </p>
                <p id="p4">
                    A: The current release version corresponds to XFree86 4.3.

<h2>Technical Questions</h2>
                <p id="p2">
                    Q: Where are things installed?
                </p>
                <p id="p4">
                    A: In <code>/Applications/Utilities/X11.app</code>, <code>/usr/X11R6</code>, and <code>/usr/bin/open-x11</code>. If you have an existing <code>/etc/X11</code> it is backed up during installation and a new one is installed.
                       Symlinks are also added at <code>/usr/include/X11</code> and <code>/usr/lib/X11</code>.</p>
                <br>
                <p id="p2">
                    Q: Does <code>X11.app</code> process my <code>~/.xinitrc</code>?
                </p>
                <p id="p4">                                
                    You may have a previous installation of X11 or XDarwin with a pre-existing <code>~/.xinitrc</code>. The first time you launch <code>X11.app</code> after installation, it will ask whether to back up your existing <code>~/.xinitrc</code> to <code>~/.xinitrc.old</code> and use the standard /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc. If you reply no, it will use your existing<code>~/.xinitrc</code>. If you reply yes, it will use <code>/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc</code> (the X11 default).<br>
                    If neither <code>~/.xinitrc</code> or <code>/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc</code> are present, X11 for Mac OS X will use hard coded values that launch an xterm and the <code>quartz-wm</code> window manager.

                <p id="p2">
                    Q: Does X11 work with a previously installed version of XDarwin?
                </p>
                <p id="p4">
                    A: We recommend you back up and move aside your previous installation of XDarwin and then install X11 for Mac OS X. A few people have been able to get X11 for Mac OS X and XDarwin to co-exist.

                <p id="p2">
                    Q: I don't see <code>/Applications/Utilities/X11.app</code> after installing.
                </p>
                <p id="p4">
                    A: Make sure you install the <code>X11.pkg</code>, not just the <code>X11SDK.pkg</code>.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p id="p2">
                    Q: I do not see an <code>xterm</code> startup when launching <code>X11.app</code>.
                </p>
                <p id="p4">
                    A: A default <code>xterm</code> will launch if you did a clean install and are using the standard xinitrc environment. See <code>xinitrc</code> related question above.
                </p>

                <p id="p2">
                    Q: How do I copy and paste using X11 for Mac OS X?
                </p>
                <p id="p4">
                    A: X11 for Mac OS X allows cut and paste between X11 and native applications using PRIMARY and PASTEBOARD selections. <br>
                    You can cut text from X11 applications by selecting the text, performing a cmd-c or copy operation. You can paste in native Mac OS X applications as usual using Cmd-V.<br>
                    Because there is no standard for pasting in X11 applications (some use middle mouse button, some use control-v, etc.), cmd-v doesn't work for pasting in X11 applications by design. As a result, the &quot;Paste&quot; menu item will be grayed out when X11 applications are in focus. You should use the control-v or the middle mouse button instead for pasting (See X11 Preferences for emulating a middle mouse button). <br>
                    The &quot;Paste&quot; menu option will be active when non-X windows are active within X11.app (e.g., when entering text in the &quot;Customize Applications&quot; menu item).<br>
                    A common request has been to make cmd-v work across all X11 applications. This isn't possible without re-writing all X11 applications to standardize on a single approach, which is outside the domain of X11 for Mac OS X.

                    Q: Can I run another window manager instead of <code>quartz-wm</code>?
                </p>
                <p id="p4">
                    A: Yes, you can. Add a <code>~/.xinitrc</code> which runs your favorite window manager instead of <code>quartz-wm</code>.
                </p>
                <br>                
                <p id="p2">
                    Q: How do I make copy and paste work with other window managers?
                </p>
                <p id="p4">
                    A: Running <code>quartz-wm --only-proxy</code> will activate the selection proxying features, but none of the window management code.

                <p id="p4">
                    A: Yes there is a hidden option. From an xterm or terminal execute : <code>defaults write com.apple.x11 wm_ffm true</code>

                <p id="p4">
                    A: You can use the <code>/usr/bin/open-x11</code> script to launch X applications from Terminal.

                <p id="p4">
                    A: The best (and safest) way is to simply <code>ssh -X user@remotehost</code> from the initial <code>xterm</code>. X forwarding and your <code>DISPLAY</code> environment variable on the remote host will automatically be set. Remote host must have X Forwarding enabled in <code>ssh_config</code> file. MacOSX does not enable this by default.

                    A: See <a href="../../qa/qa2001/qa1067.html">Technical Q&amp;A QA1067</a>.

                </p>
                <p id="p4">
                    A: When you use the Applications menu, the environment variables are the ones that <code>X11.app</code> has inherited from where it was started. So if you launch X11 from the Finder or Dock, very likely your environment will be limited. See previous question to set the <code>PATH</code> environment for all applications include <code>X11.app</code>.

                <p id="p4">
                    A: You can set the keyboard mapping using the &quot;Input&quot; tab in the preferences panel.

                    Q: Why can't I connect to the X Server after a network config change? It requires a restart of the X server.
                </p>
                <p id="p4">
                    A: This is expected behavior in the Xauthority authentication mechanism which X11 for Mac OS X uses by default. The problem is that Xauth uses two keys, the ip address and hostname of the system running the X server. But these keys don't get updated if you change the network configuration. You can disable authentication from the &quot;Security&quot; tab of <code>X11.app</code>'s preferences. Be aware that doing so may create a security hole.
                </p>

                    Q: Do I need a multi-button mouse to use X11 for Mac OS X?
                </p>
                <p id="p4">
                    A: No, you can emulate a three button mouse by using single button mouse in combination with the keyboard. Multi button mice are supported by default. See the X11.app Preferences (Input tab) to enable three button mouse emulation.

                <p id="p4">
                    A: Make sure you install the X11 SDK from the Developer CD.

                <p id="p4">
                    A: The workaround is to add <code>-no-cpp-precomp</code> to your <code>CFLAGS</code> when configuring or building.

                    <li>
                        Added Pseudocolor (8-bit) visual plane support so applications requiring 8 bit support should find the visuals by default. You can also add &quot;<code>-depth 8</code>&quot; (see Xquartz man page) when starting the X Server if you want to run it only in 8 bit mode, which is unrecommended as OpenGL support is not available in 8 bit mode.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Added an option to quit X11 without presenting warning dialog : &quot;<code>defaults write com.apple.x11 no_quit_alert true</code>&quot;. See man page for Xquartz for more details.

                        Fixed problem so that windows can be resized by user to any size and not be limited by the Dock's height.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fixed window focus problem when un-minimizing X11 windows from the Dock.

                    <li>
                        Added support for Gnome, KDE hints - so all windows will not have window decoration.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Focused windows were not being checked in the &quot;Window&quot; menu.

                    <li>

                        Cmd-V doesn't work in X11 applications by design - use the paste paradigm specific to the X11 application. e.g. use middle mouse button or control-v instead.
