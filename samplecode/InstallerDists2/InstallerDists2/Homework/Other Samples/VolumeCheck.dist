<!-- 
	Purpose: Shows how to use a volume-check script and some built in functions to restrict the installation of your software on a specific volume.				
	Overview: Introduces volume-check, my.result, my.target, ans system.log(). Shows how to check for specific system versions and restrict installs onto a volume without the required version of Mac OS X.												
-->

    <title>My Great Software</title>

<!-- 
	The installation-check and volume-check scripts allow the distribution script to restrict the software from being installed on certain hardware or on a certain volume.				
-->
	<volume-check script="MyVolumeCheck()"/>

	<script>
		
<!-- 
	All JavaScripts in a distribution script have access to the system object.  Both the installation-check and volume-check scripts have access to a special object my.result. "my.result" object has three attributes that can be set to specify how the user will be presented with a failure.  See below for examples of this.
 
 	This volume-check script checks to make sure the target system has 10.4.1 installed. A volume-check script is in charge of determining if the software should be allowed on a given volume.  These scripts have access to two more important built in objects (in addition to system) my.target and choices.  For now we will only cover my.target. The volume-check script will be called once for each volume on the system, each time with a different my.target object.  The runtime used for each of these calls is different, so it is not possible to pass information from one volume check script to another.
-->
		function MyVolumeCheck()
		{
<!-- 
	Each target which contains a version of Mac OS X, has a systemVersion object. A volume which does not contain a system will not have this object, so make sure you check the object before using it. The valid attributes for this object are ProductBuldVersion, ProductName, and ProductVersion.									
-->
			var sysVersion = my.target.systemVersion;
			
			//Log some information about each system to the installer log.
			if(sysVersion)
				system.log(my.target + " : " + sysVersion.ProductVersion);
			else
				system.log(my.target + " : No  System");
				
<!-- 
	If the volume has no operating system, or the version is less then 10.4.1 then	we do not allow.  Becuase the version number is a tuple, scripts should use system.compareVersion() to compare versions (it works much like strcmp).			
-->
			if(!sysVersion || (1 != system.compareVersions("10.4.1",sysVersion.ProductVersion))){
<!--
	If a volume should not be allowed for install, my.result.type must be 'Fatal' and my.result.message must be specified.  'Fatal' is the only valid type for volume checks. As always, your messages should be localized (see system.localized* functions)	
-->
				my.result.message = "This software requires Mac OS X 10.4.1 or later to run.";
				my.result.type = 'Fatal';
				
				<!--On failure, false must be returned.-->
