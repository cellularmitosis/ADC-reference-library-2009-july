<h2> Improving Performance</h2>
</a><a name="5070">
Performance is a major concern of web site administrators. This section provides a list of areas to check to achieve the maximum possible performance.<p>
</a><ul><a name="5071">
<p><li>Configure your operating system so that it delivers the best performance possible for your needs. Check your operating system's documentation and your web server's documentation for performance tuning information. 
</a><a name="5072">
<p><li>When possible, use an API-based adaptor in place of the default CGI adaptor.
</a><a name="5073">
<p>The API-based adaptors have a performance advantage over CGI adaptors in that the associated server can dynamically load the adaptor; servers using CGI adaptors, on the other hand, spawn a new adaptor process for each request and kill the process after the response is provided.<p>
</a><a name="5074">
<p><li>Make sure that the applications are written to perform optimally. 
</a><a name="5077">
<p>The <em>WebObjects Developer's Guide</em> offers some suggested coding practices to improve performance. <p>
</a><a name="5078">
<p><li>Enable component-definition caching for all applications. 
</a><a name="5079">
<p>Component-definition caching is off by default as a convenience for programmers debugging applications. When the application is deployed, component-definition caching should be enabled so that each component's HTML and declarations files are parsed only once per session. Component-definition caching can be enabled programmatically by sending <strong>setCachingEnabled:</strong> to the WOApplication object (in Java, WebApplication). You can also use the Monitor to enable caching by doing the following:<p>
</a></ul><ol>
<a name="5080">
<P><li>In the Declared Apps list, click the inspector button for the application to display the application inspector. 
</a><ol>
<a name="5081">
<li>Click the More button to display the application instance inspector.
</a><a name="5082">
<li>Click the Component caching check box.
</a><a name="5083">
<li>Click the Save Settings button at the bottom of the frame.
</a></ol>
</ol>
<ul><a name="5084">
<p><li>Shut down and restart application instances periodically.
</a><a name="5085">
<p>Because no program is ever perfect, WebObjects applications may leak a certain amount of memory per transaction. For this reason, you should periodically shut down and start up each application instance as described in "<a href="ServingWebObjects30.html#5104">Automatic Scheduling</a>" in this guide.<p>
</a><a name="5089">
<p><li>Perform load balancing or increase the listen queue depth to improve response time for a specific application.
</a><p><a name="5090">If the response time is consistently slow, add more application instances so that 
the load is balanced among those instances. For more information, see the section
"<a href="ServingWebObjects31.html#5124">Load Balancing</a>" in this guide. 
</a><a name="5094">If the response time is sometimes acceptable and sometimes slow, consider 
increasing the size of the listen queue, which holds requests awaiting processing. 
For more information, see the section "<a href="ServingWebObjects32.html#5169">Increasing the Listen Queue Depth</a>" in 
this guide.
</a></p><a name="5098">
<p><li>Consider changing the physical configuration of your system. 
</a><a name="5099">
<p>Determine the size of a single application instance (you can look this up on the application's WOStats page) and multiply that number by the number of instances you intend to run on a given machine. The result is the amount of physical memory that should be installed on that machine. <p>
</a><a name="5100">
<p>If you can't add that much physical memory, increase the amount of virtual memory to cover the difference between the physical memory needed and the physical memory you have. <p>
</a><a name="5101">
<p>You can also try to reduce the size of the application instance by limiting the amount of state that it stores. Set the session time-out value to ensure that sessions expire after a reasonable length of time. Shut down and restart the application more often to reduce its size. <p>
</a><a name="5102">
<p>If you use WebObjects mainly for applications that access a database, you'll achieve the best performance with a dedicated database server and a separate server for WebObjects applications. <p>
</a></ul>
