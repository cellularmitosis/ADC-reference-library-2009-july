                            (a) set to 1 if you're building Carbon Mach-O for PPC. TARGET_REZ_CARBON_MACHO must also be set to 1,

                            (b) (OBSOLETE) set to 1 if you're building non-carbon resource-fork based code fragment, platformPowerPC architecture
    TARGET_REZ_MAC_X86 - set to 1 if you're building Carbon Mach-O for Intel, TARGET_REZ_CARBON_MACHO must also be set to 1,
    						platformIA32NativeEntryPoint architecture
	(OBSOLETE) TARGET_REZ_CARBON_CFM - set to 1 if you're building Carbon PPC data-fork based code fragment,
                                       platformPowerPCNativeEntryPoint architecture
	TARGET_REZ_CARBON_MACHO - set to 1 when building Carbon Mach-O components for Mac OS X PPC or Intel, used with TARGET_REZ_MAC_X86 and TARGET_REZ_MAC_PPC
    TARGET_REZ_WIN32 - set to 1 when building for Windows, platformWin32 architecture
