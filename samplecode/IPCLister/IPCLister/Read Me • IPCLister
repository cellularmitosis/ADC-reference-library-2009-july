IPCListerA small example of how to use IPCListPortsThis sample collects and displays all the PPC/AppleEvent capablemachines in your current zone and puts them in a nice list.Click on one of the machines, and the other list will display all the PPC port names currently open on that machine.  This is all the IAC capable applications, plus all the PPC ports that have been open for other reasons (unless they were opened non-Network capable).Sounds a lot like the PPC browser?  It's what the PPC browsers does, yeah, but this shows you howyou can do it silently, without putting up a dialog.IPCListPorts allows you to find the specific applications you arelooking for anywhere on the network WITHOUT having to prompt theuser to make the (error prone) selection for you.You can find that special service you want to connect to with no worries.IPCList and Zone code by Jim LutherRest of the stuff by Me.C.K.
