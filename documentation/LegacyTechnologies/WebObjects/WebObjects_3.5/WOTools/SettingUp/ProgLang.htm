<h2> Choosing the Programming Language</h2>

</a><a name="7072">

WebObjects supports three languages:<p>

</a><ul><a name="7073">

<li>Java

</a><a name="7074">

<li>Objective-C

</a><a name="9869">

<li>WebScript

</a></ul><a name="9870">

Java and Objective-C are <em>compiled</em> languages. WebScript, which is based on Objective-C, is a <em>scripted</em> language. A scripted language allows you to make changes to your application while it is running. When you use compiled code, your application runs faster, but you must build your application before running it.<p>

</a><a name="7077">

Java files have the extension <strong>.java</strong>, Objective-C files have the extension <strong>.m</strong>, and WebScript files have the extension <strong>.wos</strong>.<p>

</a><a name="7078">

The language you choose in the Wizard applies to the following files:<p>

</a><ul><a name="9602">

<p><li>The Main <em>component</em>. A component in WebObjects represents a page in your application (or possibly part of a page). When you create your project, Project Builder provides you with an initial component called Main. The component's code file implements the behavior of the component.

</a><a name="9606">

<p><li>The <em>application </em>and<em> session </em>code files. Application code contains variables and methods that affect the entire application. Session code contains variables and methods that affect a single user's session.

</a></ul><a name="9628">

If, for example, you specify Java as your primary language, the Wizard will create the files <strong>Application.java</strong>, <strong>Session.java</strong>, and <strong>Main.java</strong> for you. You can mix languages in a project by choosing a different language when you create other components.<p>
