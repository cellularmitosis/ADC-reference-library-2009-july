However, an article in issue 13 of <i>develop</i> says, not to callExitMovies, as ExitToShell does this for me. This seems to destroy the balanceof these routines. Which is the correct technique?<br><br><font size="+4">A</font>  EnterMovies creates a new QuickTime environment if the current A5 world doesn't already have one. If the current A5 world has a QuickTime environment from a previous EnterMovies call, then nothing is done except to increment a counterthat keeps track of the number of times EnterMovies was called. This is done toaccount for DAs which use an application's A5 world, so that if an applicationhas already called EnterMovies, the movie toolbox knows that it doesn't have toreinitialize when the DA calls EnterMovies. When the DA calls ExitMovies, itdecrements the counter, and as long as all EnterMovies and ExitMovies calls arebalanced, the Movie Toolbox doesn't dispose of the QuickTime world until thelast ExitMovies call is made.<p>Since ExitToShell automatically calls ExitMovies for you, you can avoid some ofthe problems that developers have with disposing of movie structures improperlyand in the wrong order. Letting ExitToShell do the final cleanup avoids theseproblems, because the entire A5 world and heap is disposed of as well.</p><p>If you currently have nested EnterMovies and ExitMovies calls, this is what werecommend:</p><p>1.	If you're writing an application, and you call EnterMovies, but don't callExitMovies, any external that uses the same A5 world and calls EnterMovies andExitMovies increments the counter and then decrements the counter and doesnothing else.</p><p>2.	If you're writing an external that runs under someone else's application,you have two choices:</p><p>A.	Call EnterMovies, but never call ExitMovies. This causes QuickTime toinitialize once during the first call to any of your externals.</p><p>B.	Call EnterMovies at the beginning of each external and ExitMovies at the endof each external. Be aware that this can waste a lot of CPU time if the mainapplication (or something else in the A5 world) doesn't call EnterMovies first,since each of the EnterMovies calls in your externals requires QuickTime toreinitialize. This can be a serious problem if your external is called often.However, if your external has an initialization routine and a close routinethat is called before and after all your other routines, you can callEnterMovies in the initialization routine, and then call ExitMovies in yourclose routine. Of course, each of the routines called in between could calleither EnterMovies and ExitMovies, or not call either of them at all, dependingon your implementation.</p><!-- begin_date --><H4 ALIGN=center>[May 01 1995]</H4><!-- end_date --></td></tr></table></CENTER><!-- begin_footer_information -->	<table width="680" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
