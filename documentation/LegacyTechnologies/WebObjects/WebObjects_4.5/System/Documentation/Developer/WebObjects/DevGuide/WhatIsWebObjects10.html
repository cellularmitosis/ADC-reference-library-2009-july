Usually a component represents an entire page, so the word &#32;"page" is used interchangeably with the word "component." Components don't always represent an entire page, however. For &#32;example, a component might represent only a header or footer of a page; you can nest it inside of a component that represents the rest of the page. <p></a><a name="9601">Components are made up of:<p></a><ul><a name="9604"><li>A template that specifies how the component looks</a><a name="9607"><li>Code that specifies how the component acts</a><a name="9610"><li>Bindings that associate the component's template with its code</a></ul><a name="9621">Typically, components consist of some form of these three files, but any given component might contain more or fewer parts. For example, a component may not need a code file at all; it may need only a template file and a set of bindings. Another component might have a code file but no template file or bindings. Plus, if you create a component using Project Builder or WebObjects Builder, you'll get a fourth file, <em>Component</em><strong>.api</strong>, which contains API that should be made public to other components.<p></a><a name="9783">Note that the various parts of a component are actually located in various Project Builder suitcases: the template and bindings files are located under WebComponents, the code files are located under Classes, and API &#32;files (if you have any) wind up under a suitcase named Resources.<p></a><P> <a href="WhatIsWOApp.html"><IMG SRC="ArrowUp.gif">Table of Contents</a> <a href="WhatIsWebObjects11.html"><IMG SRC="ArrowRight.gif">Next Section</a><P></body></html>
