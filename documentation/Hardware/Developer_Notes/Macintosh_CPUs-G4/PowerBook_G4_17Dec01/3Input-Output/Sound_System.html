The sound circuitryhandles audio data as 16-bit samples at a 48 kHz sample rate. </p><p>The sound circuitry and system software can create soundsdigitally and either play the sounds through the built-in speakersor send the sound signals out through the sound output jack or oneof the USB ports. </p><p>The PowerBook G4 computer can record sound data from eitherthe built-in microphone, an audio CD, a USB audio device, or a CardBuscard. For each sound input source, sound playthrough can be enabledor disabled. Sound data from digital sources is converted to analogform for output to the speakers and the sound output jack. </p><dl><dd> <a href="#TPXREF141">"Sound Inputs"</a></dd><dd> <a href="#TPXREF145">"Sound Outputs"</a></dd><dd> <a href="#TPXREF148">"Digitizing Sound"</a></dd></dl><br><a name = "TPXREF141"></a><h3><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Sound Inputs</font></h3><p>The sound system accepts inputs from four possible sources:</p><ul><li>the built-inmicrophone</font></li><li>a CD or DVD in the DVD-ROM/CD-RW Combo drive</font></li><li>a digital audio device connected to a USB or FireWire port</font></li><li>sound signals from the communication (modem) slot</font></li></ul><p>The microphone preamp has a dedicated analog input channelin the Tumbler ciruitry; the other inputs send digital data.

Thatsignal level assures good quality digitizing without driving theanalog input into clipping. </p><br><a name = "TPXREF143"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Modem Activity Sound Signals</font></h4><p>Modem activity sound signals from the communications slotare sent to the Tumbler sound circuitry as 8-bit digital data. </p><br><a name = "TPXREF145"></a><h3><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Sound Outputs</font></h3><p>The sound system sends sound output signals to the built-inspeakers and the external sound output jack. </p><br><a name = "TPXREF146"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Headphone Jack</font></h4><p>The headphone jack is located on the left side of the computer.The headphone jack provides enough current to drive a pair of low-impedanceheadphones. It can also be used as a line-level output. </p><p>The headphone jack has the following electrical characteristics: </p><ul><li>impedancesuitable for driving standard 32-ohm headphones</font></li><li>output level 2.0 V peak-to-peak (0.7 V RMS) </font></li><li>signal-to-noise (SNR) 90 dB unweighted (typical)</font></li><li>total harmonic distortion (THD) 0.03% or less</font></li></ul><br><a name = "TPXREF147"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Internal Speakers</font></h4><p>The computer has two 20mm speakers, one on either side ofthe keyboard. The computer turns off the sound signals to the speakerswhen an external device is connected to the sound output jack andduring power cycling.</p><br><a name = "TPXREF148"></a><h3><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Digitizing Sound</font></h3><p>The sound circuitry digitizes and records sound as 48-kHz16-bit samples. If a sound sampled at a lower rate on another computeris played as output, the Sound Manager transparently upsamples thesound to 48 kHz prior to outputting the audio to the sound circuitry. </p><p>When recording sound from a microphone, applications thatmay be affected by feedback should disable sound playthrough bycalling the Sound Manager APIs. </p><p></p><br><a href="External_Video_Port_.html" target="content"><img src="../images/previous.gif" border="0"></a><a href="../4Expansion/index.html" target="_top"><img src="../images/next.gif" border="0"></a>&nbsp;<br><br><p><hr><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">&#169; 2001 Apple Computer, Inc.
