Since each applicationcan have multiple users simultaneously, it may have multiple Sessionobjects. Each session has its own data and its own cached copiesof the components that the user has requested, as shown in  <a href="#CJBBFHCH">Figure 7-1</a>.</p><br><a name = "CJBBFHCH"></a><p><b><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">Figure7-1 Relationship between application andsession</font></b></p> <img src = "../Art/sessions.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/sessions.gif]"><p>The session is represented as an instance of the Session class(<code>Session.java</code>). Initially,the session has only WebObjects-provided behavior, but you can addyour own methods and variables. For example, if you were buildingan online shopping application, the session would be an appropriateplace to store a user's shopping cart, because the session istied to one particular user and persists as long as the user isusing the application.</p><p>When an incoming request is processed, WebObjects automaticallyactivates the Session instance associated with the user who originatedthe request, as described in  <a sector="mod" href="../UserInput/iRequest_Processing.html" target="_top">"Request Processing"</a>. </p><p>The WOComponent class includes a method for accessing thecurrently active session. Since all your components inherit fromthis class and WebObjects automatically activates the correct sessionwhen a request is processed, calling the <code>session</code> methodfrom your component (or in a keypath) provides you with the sessionfor the current user.</p><br>    <br><a href="Using_the_S_anage_State.html" target="_right"><img src="../Images/previous.gif" border="0" alt="Previous"></a><a href="Displaying___of_Objects.html" target="_right"><img src="../Images/next.gif" border="0" alt="Next"></a>&nbsp;<hr alt=""><p><font face="Palatino" size="1">&#169; 2001 Apple Computer, Inc.</font></p><!-- start of footer --><!--#include virtual="/includes/framesetfooter" --><!-- end of footer --></body></html>
