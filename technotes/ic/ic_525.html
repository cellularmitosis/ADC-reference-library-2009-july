It should then extract the content and update the display.</li></ul><p>Note that the second computer doesn't know (or care) that it received itswindow-change request from the first computer. Also, this application designmakes it simple to record actions to a file, so you can make your applicationscriptable, or drive it from a script using AppleScript or some suitablethird-party application, such as UserLand Frontier.</p><p>This design is also much easier to debug, as you can do all the work on one machine.</p><p>There's a nice article on this technique in issue #10 of <i>develop</i> called"Apple Event Objects and You," as well as a course from Apple Developer University.</p><p>(When the Developer Support Center mentions a third-party product by name, it's meant to be a possible solution for you to investigate, not a recommendation. The DSC doesn't evaluate third-party tools, nor does the  DSC maintain complete lists of possible third-party solutions. Consult  resources such as the Macintosh Products Guide, Macintosh Development Tools &amp; Languages, the Redgate Buyer's Guide, your dealer, electronic bulletin boards, and reviews in technical magazines to find a product that will fit your needs.)</p>      <P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><h2>Macintosh XTND translators and graphic type registry</h2><p>Date Written:  10/9/92</p><p>Last reviewed:  11/24/92</p><p>I need to translate TIFF, PhotoShop, Targa, PICT, EPSF and other file typesthat are going to be 24-bit depth and beyond. The last <i>Developer CD Series</i> disc has XTND 1.3.5, which I'm studying. Does Apple have other XTND files available? Do you have a registry of graphic file types with information about them that can be used to write XTND translators? I want to avoid having to license or request the file structures from companies.</p><p>___</p><p>All that Apple has on developing translators is the XTND Developers Kit, which can be found on the Developer CD Series; it is also the most current version.</p><p>Apple doesn't maintain a registry of graphic file types (nor any other type offile type). You have two avenues to pursue to meet your development needs. Thefirst, you already stated you wanted to avoid: contacting the companiesindividually and requesting the formats/translators directly. The second mightbe less painful from an effort point of view--purchasing prewritten translatorsfrom a company that specializes in them. Dataviz and at least one otherthird-party developer write and sell a varied set of translators. You can checkthe Redgate Buyers Guide or Macintosh periodicals such as MacWorld and MacUserfor more information on what they offer and how to contact them.</p>         <P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P>                  <P><A NAME=Downloads></A></P>                  <H2>Downloadables</H2>                  <TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <td width=50 align=left>                  <P ALIGN=center><img src="images/acrobatsmall.gif" width=22 height=23 align=middle alt="Acrobat gif"></P>               </TD>               <td align="left">                  <P>Acrobat version of this Note (32K)</P>               </TD>               <td width=60 align=left>                  <P><A HREF="pdf/ic_525.pdf">Download</A></P>               </TD>            </TR>                     </TABLE>         <BR>                  <P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><!-- end_content --><!-- begin_footer_information -->	<table width="680" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
