/*
    Introduction
    ------------
    Since Mac OS X 10.2 it has been possible to synchronously send an Apple event 
    from a thread other than the main thread.  The technique for doing this is 
    documented in Technote 2053 &quot;Mac OS X 10.2&quot;.
    
    &lt;http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2002/tn2053.html&gt;
    
    Unfortunately, this technique isn't quite right.  Specifically, due to a bug 
    in Apple Event Manager &lt;rdar://problem/4976113&gt;, it is not safe to dispose of 
    the Mach port (using mach_port_destroy, as documented in the technote, or, more 
    correctly, using mach_port_mod_refs) that you created to use as the reply port. 
    Doing this triggers a race condition that, very rarely, can cause the system 
    to destroy some other, completely unrelated, Mach port within your process.  
    This could cause all sorts of problems.  One common symptom is that, after 
    accidentally destroying the Mach port associated with a thread, your program 
    dies with the following message:
    
    /SourceCache/Libc/Libc-320.1.3/pthreads/pthread.c:897: failed assertion `ret == MACH_MSG_SUCCESS'
    
    The best workaround to this problem is to not dispose of the Mach port that 
    you use as the Apple event reply port.  If you have a limited number of 
    secondary threads from which you need to send Apple events, it's relatively 
    easy to allocate an Apple event reply port for each thread and then never 
    dispose it.  However, if you have general case code, it might be tricky 
    to track down all of the threads that send Apple events and make sure they 
    have reply ports.  This module was designed as a general case solution to 
    the problem.
    
    The module exports a single function, AESendMessageThreadSafeSynchronous, which, 
    as its name suggests, sends an Apple event and waits for the reply (that is, 
    a synchronous IPC) and is safe to call from an arbitrary thread.  It's basically 
    a wrapper around the system function AESendMessage, with added smarts to manage 
    a per-thread Apple event reply port.
    
    When &lt;rdar://problem/4976113&gt; is fixed, this module should be unnecessary but 
    benign.
    
    For information about how this works, see the comments in the implementation.
