The enclosure includes data and power connectorsfor the boot drive and a second internal drive on the Ultra DMA/66interface. It also has a power connector for a third internal driveconnected to an optional PCI controller card. </p><p>The boot drive occupies one of the lower bays and is connectedby way of an Ultra DMA/66 (ATA-5) interface. The Ultra DMA/66 cableassembly also has data and power connectors for a second 3.5 x 1-inchdrive, which can be stacked on top of the boot drive. </p><p>The drives on the Ultra DMA/66 bus operate in a Device 0/1configuration. The boot drive is device-select jumpered as Device 0 (master). Normally, an additional Ultra DMA/66 drive should bejumpered as Device 1 (slave). If necessary, the device configurationsof the drives could be reversed, but in any case, the two driveson the Ultra DMA/66 bus must be configured complementarily. </p><p>The Ultra DMA/66 bus supports PIO Mode 4, DMA Mode 2, andUltra DMA Mode 4 data transfers. </p><p>The other two lower bays are available for devices connectedto a separate PCI controller card. An Ultra SCSI 160 drive and UltraSCSI 160 PCI controller card are available as a configuration option. </p><p>None of the lower drive bays can be modified to support removable-mediadrives. </p><br><a name = "TPXREF119"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Ultra DMA/66 Hard Disk</font></h4><p>The boot disk in the Power Mac G4 computer is installed inone of the lower bays and connected by way of the Ultra DMA/66 (ATA-5)interface. </p><br><a name = "TPXREF120"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Optional Ultra SCSI 160 Drive</font></h4><p>An Ultra SCSI 160 drive and Ultra SCSI 160 PCI controllercard are available as a configuration option.
