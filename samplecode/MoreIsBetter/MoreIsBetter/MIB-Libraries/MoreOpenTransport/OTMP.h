Revision 1.9  2002/11/08 23:42:32         
When using framework includes, explicitly include the frameworks we need. Convert nil to NULL.

Revision 1.8  2001/11/07 15:56:59         
Tidy up headers, add CVS logs, update copyright.


         <7>     21/9/01    Quinn   Changes for CWPro7 Mach-O build.
         <6>      8/2/01    Quinn   [2619462] The fix for the MP bug is in CarbonLib 1.2.5.
         <5>      8/2/01    Quinn   Add missing word to comment.
         <4>      8/2/01    Quinn   Add OTMPGetMessage and OTMPPutMessage.
         <3>     5/12/00    Quinn   Looks like the bug fix won't make it into CarbonLib 1.2.
         <2>    10/11/00    Quinn   Added OTMPGetCanRunStatus.
         <1>     7/11/00    Quinn   First checked in.

// to complete.  You can use this callback to call WaitNextEvent, or 
// yield time in whatever way is appropriate for your application.
// This is very similar to the kOTSyncIdleEvent idea, except that 
// there is only one callback for the entire library.

// OTMP from your application's main thread or a Thread Manager thread. 
// If you always call OTMP from preemptively scheduled MP tasks this 
// callback is unnecessary.

	// If the routine returns an error, OTMP will break out of its 
	// sync wait loop.  You should only do this under the most dire 
	// circumstances!!!  It will leave the entire library in a very
