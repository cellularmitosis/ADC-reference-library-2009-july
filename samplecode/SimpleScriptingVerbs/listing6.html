This sample is a follow-on to the SimpleScripting sample. It shows how to add
verbs to the terminology provided by a scriptable application. (A verb is a
command or action that can be invoked in a script.)




Step 1:  Setting up

Create a new .sdef file that includes the standard scripting suite and add it
to your Xcode project.  Usually, this file will have the same name as your
application.  Going along with that convention, the .sdef file in this sample
has been named &quot;SimpleScriptingVerbs.sdef&quot;.  In the contents of that file, enter
an empty dictionary that includes the standard AppleScript suite as follows:


&lt;dictionary xmlns:xi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2003/XInclude&quot;&gt;

    &lt;xi:include
href=&quot;file:///System/Library/ScriptingDefinitions/CocoaStandard.sdef&quot;
xpointer=&quot;xpointer(/dictionary/suite)&quot;/&gt;

        &lt;!-- add your own suite definitions here --&gt;

&lt;/dictionary&gt;


The important parts of this definition are as follows:

1. The 'xi' namespace declaration in the opening dictionary element declares
that enclosed elements using the 'xi' namespace will follow conventions defined
by the XInclude standard.  This will allow us to include the standard
definitions.

2. The 'xi:include' element includes the Standard Suite in the .sdef.

NOTE: Prior to Mac OS X 10.5 developers would copy the standard suite from the
ScriptingDefinitions sample
(http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/ScriptingDefinitions/index.html) directly
into their .sdef file.  For backwards compatibility with Mac OS X 10.4, you may
continue to use that technique, but moving forward the XInclude technique
described above is recommended.




Step 2: Add a starting suite

Add a new suite to your .sdef file at the end of the dictionary just before the
closing &lt;/dictionary&gt; tag:


    &lt;suite name=&quot;Simple Scripting Verbs&quot; code=&quot;SVrb&quot; description=&quot;Terminology for
the SimpleScriptingVerbs Sample.&quot;&gt;
    
        &lt;!-- We'll put our verb definitions here --&gt;
         
    &lt;/suite&gt;

It is inside of this suite definition where you will put your application
specific scripting information.  You can add additional suites if you like and
use them to group related scripting functionality, but for most purposes one
suite should be sufficient.

Important points to note here:
  - the suite has a unique four-character code associated with it 'SVrb' that
uniquely identifies our suite.  We will used that four letter code when putting
together eight character code identifiers for our scripting commands (verbs).




Step 3: Add some verbs to the script suite.

These are the verbs we have added to this example:



(a) the 'do simple command' verb.

        &lt;command name=&quot;do simple command&quot; code=&quot;SVrbSimp&quot; description=&quot;run a simple
command with no parameters&quot;&gt;
            &lt;cocoa class=&quot;SimpleCommand&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;result type=&quot;integer&quot; description=&quot;returns the number seven&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/command&gt;

This is a simple verb with no parameters.  It returns an integer number.  Verbs
don't get much simpler than this.

Important points to note here:

  - Note the code value has eight characters in it.  This is actually two four
character codes combined together.  The first four characters will be the 'event
class' in the in the Apple event sent to your application for this command.  And
the last four letters will be the 'event code' in the Apple event sent for the
command.
    
  - the Cocoa class that implements the command is identified by the &quot;&lt;cocoa
class=&quot;SimpleCommand&quot;/&gt;&quot; element in the xml.  Here we identify the
'SimpleCommand' class that is implemented in the files SimpleCommand.h and
SimpleCommand.m.  When Cocoa receives this command it will instantiate an
instance of the class SimpleCommand and then it will call the
-performDefaultImplementation method on that instance.  You put your code for
performing the command in the performDefaultImplementation method of that class.



(b) the 'do direct parameter command' verb.

        &lt;command name=&quot;do direct parameter command&quot; code=&quot;SVrbDpCm&quot; description=&quot;run
a simple command with a direct parameter&quot;&gt;
            &lt;cocoa class=&quot;DirectParameterCommand&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;direct-parameter description=&quot;a text parameter passed to the command&quot;&gt;
                &lt;type type=&quot;text&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/direct-parameter&gt;
            &lt;result type=&quot;text&quot; description=&quot;the direct parameter enclosed in quotes&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/command&gt;

This is a simple verb that receives a single string parameter and returns a
string value (a copy of the parameter enclosed in quotes).  

Important points to note here:

  - Note the code value has eight characters in it.  This is actually two four
character codes combined together.  The first four characters will be the 'event
class' in the in the Apple event sent to your application for this command.  And
the last four letters will be the 'event code' in the Apple event sent for the
command.  Here we have used the Suite's four letter code as the event class and
then we have used a unique four letter code as the event code.
    
  - the Cocoa class that implements the command is identified by the &quot;&lt;cocoa
class=&quot;DirectParameterCommand&quot;/&gt;&quot; element in the xml.  Here we identify the
'DirectParameterCommand' class that is implemented in the files
DirectParameterCommand.h and DirectParameterCommand.m.  When Cocoa receives this
command it will instantiate an instance of the class DirectParameterCommand and
then it will call the -performDefaultImplementation method on that instance. 
You put your code for performing the command in the performDefaultImplementation
method of that class.

  - inside of your performDefaultImplementation method you can access the
direct parameter by calling the [self directParameter].    
  
  

(c) the 'do command with args' verb.

        &lt;command name=&quot;do command with args&quot; code=&quot;SVrbAgCm&quot; description=&quot;run a
command with a bunch of arguments&quot;&gt;
            &lt;cocoa class=&quot;CommandWithArgs&quot;/&gt;
            
            &lt;direct-parameter description=&quot;a text parameter passed to the command&quot;&gt;
                &lt;type type=&quot;text&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/direct-parameter&gt;
            
            &lt;parameter name=&quot;blinking&quot; code=&quot;savo&quot; type=&quot;boolean&quot; optional=&quot;yes&quot; 
                description=&quot;a boolean parameter.&quot;&gt;
                &lt;cocoa key=&quot;SaveOptions&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/parameter&gt;
            
            &lt;parameter name=&quot;preferred hand&quot; code=&quot;LRnd&quot; type=&quot;preferredhands&quot;
optional=&quot;yes&quot; 
                description=&quot;a parameter using our enumeration.&quot;&gt;
                &lt;cocoa key=&quot;TheHand&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/parameter&gt;
            
            &lt;parameter name=&quot;prose&quot; code=&quot;Pros&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; optional=&quot;yes&quot; 
                description=&quot;a text parameter.&quot;&gt;
                &lt;cocoa key=&quot;ProseText&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/parameter&gt;
            
            &lt;parameter name=&quot;ivalue&quot; code=&quot;iVal&quot; type=&quot;integer&quot; optional=&quot;yes&quot; 
                description=&quot;an integer parameter.&quot;&gt;
                &lt;cocoa key=&quot;IntegerValue&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/parameter&gt;
            
            &lt;parameter name=&quot;rvalue&quot; code=&quot;rVal&quot; type=&quot;real&quot; optional=&quot;yes&quot; 
                description=&quot;an real number parameter.&quot;&gt;
                &lt;cocoa key=&quot;RealValue&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/parameter&gt;
            
            &lt;result type=&quot;text&quot; description=&quot;the direct parameter enclosed in quotes&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/command&gt;

This is a verb that receives a number of arguments and returns a string value
(either a copy of the prose parameter enclosed in quotes or, if the prose
parameter is not provided, a copy of the direct parameter enclosed in quotes).  

Important points to note here:

  - Note the code value has eight characters in it.  This is actually two four
character codes combined together.  The first four characters will be the 'event
class' in the in the Apple event sent to your application for this command.  And
the last four letters will be the 'event code' in the Apple event sent for the
command.  Here we have used the Suit's four letter code as the event class and
then we have used a unique four letter code as the event code.
    
  - the Cocoa class that implements the command is identified by the &quot;&lt;cocoa
class=&quot;CommandWithArgs&quot;/&gt;&quot; element in the xml.  Here we identify the
'CommandWithArgs' class that is implemented in the files CommandWithArgs.h and
CommandWithArgs.m.  When Cocoa receives this command it will instantiate an
instance of the class CommandWithArgs and then it will call the
-performDefaultImplementation method on that instance.  You put your code for
performing the command in the performDefaultImplementation method of that class.

  - each parameter has a cocoa key associated with it.  For example, the
'rvalue' command has a cocoa key of 'RealValue' associated with it.  Inside of
your performDefaultImplementation method you can retrieve all of the arguments
by calling [self evaluatedArguments].   The evaluatedArguments method will
return a NSDictionary with each of the arguments associated with their
respective Cocoa key.  For example, inside of the performDefaultImplementation
method, you could call [[self evaluatedArguments] objectForKey:@&quot;RealValue&quot;] to
retrieve the value of the 'rvalue' parameter.  Of course, if a parameter has
been marked as optional and the user has not provided that parameter, then there
will be no entry in the NSDictionary for its cocoa key.

  - the 'preferred hand' parameter illustrates how you can use an AppleScript
enumeration as a parameter.  For more information about using enumerations, see
the SimpleScriptingProperties example.
  
  - even though we have provided a number of parameter definitions, verbs will
always receive a direct parameter.  Inside of your performDefaultImplementation
method you can access this value by calling [self directParameter].
 



Step 4:  Where to next?

Well, now that you have the very basics in hand, you're ready to start adding
scriptability to your application.  But, careful planning before you start
adding in scripting features will be well worth your while.  So, please consider
reading the following documentation.

- The items listed in the section &quot;Making Your Application Scriptable&quot; on this
page are essential reading.  Everyone new to scripting should read through these
documents and familiarize themselves with the topics discussed.
http://developer.apple.com/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/GS_AppleScript/index.html

- &quot;Designing for Scriptability in Cocoa Scripting Guide provides a high-level
checklist of design issues and tactics:
http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ScriptableCocoaApplications/index.html

- This Scripting Interface Guidelines document provides more detailed
information you should consider when adding scriptability to your application: 
http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2002/tn2106.html

- The AppleScript terminology and Apple Event Codes document provides a listing
of four character codes that area already defined for use with specific terms. 
As you are adding terminology to your application you should always check there
to see if a four character code has already been defined for a term you would
like to use AND to make sure a four character code you would like to use is not
already being used by some other terminology. 
http://developer.apple.com/releasenotes/AppleScript/ASTerminology_AppleEventCodes/TermsAndCodes.html

- NSScriptCommand class is the one you use for implementing verbs (aka
commands) 
http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSScriptCommand_Class/Reference/Reference.html
