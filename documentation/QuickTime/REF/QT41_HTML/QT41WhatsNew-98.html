It was decided to factor out QuickTime for Java's dependencies on AWT to those classes that interact directly with it and to create an abstraction layer between the core QuickTime for Java classes and any environmental requirements. </P><P CLASS="T1-Text1"><A NAME="pgfId-39167"></A>It is still possible to keep the AWT-dependent methods in those classes which have used them in the past, but still have those classes load and do their work if AWT classes are not present in the runtime system. These include constructors for <TT>QDRect</TT>, <TT>QDColor</TT>, <TT>QDPoint</TT>, <TT>Track.getDimensions</TT>, <TT>FullScreen</TT> methods, and <TT>getInitialSize() </TT>in a variety of classes in the app packages.</P><P CLASS="T1-Text1"><A NAME="pgfId-29860"></A>A <TT>QDDimension</TT> class has been provided which is used in those situations instead and you are strongly encouraged to support usage of this class. The changed API calls should be used instead of these deprecated methods.</P><P CLASS="T1-Text1"><A NAME="pgfId-29861"></A>The existing usage of <TT>java.awt.Dimension</TT> still remains, and will be supported. This is a deprecation, not a removal: if any problems arise, they should be reported to Apple.</P><P CLASS="T1-Text1"><A NAME="pgfId-29862"></A>Changes to the <TT>QTPlayer</TT> are also in effect. <TT>QTPlayer</TT> no longer implements <TT>java.awt.event</TT> listeners -- it delegates handling of events to a <TT>QTPlayerEventHandler</TT> object. This object will construct an event handler based on selection criteria defined by a <TT>QTPlayerEventHandlerMaker</TT> class which an application can register. If there are no custom event handlers for the given <TT>QTPlayer</TT> instance and the source object (for instance, a <TT>java.awt.Component</TT>), then the system will use its default event handlers, i.e., <TT>QTPlayerAWTEventHandler</TT>. This event handler can be subclassed by applications to do any custom AWT event handling if this is desirable, and then the application should register this event handler. The event handler that is made can be controlled also by the application.</P><hr>&#169; 2000 Apple Computer, Inc.<!-- QTnavbar start --><P><I>Inside Macintosh: QuickTime Reference</I><P>| <A HREF="QT41WhatsNew-97.html">Previous</A> | <A HREF="QT41WhatsNew-1.html">Chapter Contents</A> | <A HREF="QT41WhatsNew.html">Chapter Top</A> | <A HREF="QT41WhatsNew-99.html">Next</A> |</P><!-- QTnavbar end --></DIV><!-- start of footer --><!--#include virtual="/includes/framesetfooter" --><!-- end of footer --></BODY></HTML>
