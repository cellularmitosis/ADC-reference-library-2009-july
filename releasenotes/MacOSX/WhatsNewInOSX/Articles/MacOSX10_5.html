<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004696-DontLinkElementID_1" title="Cross-Functional Features"></a><h2>Cross-Functional Features</h2><p>Mac OS X v10.5 supports the features described in this section across system technologies.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004696-SW8" title="64-Bit Support"></a><h3>64-Bit Support</h3><p>In Mac OS X v10.5, most system libraries and frameworks are now 64-bit ready, meaning they can be used in both 32-bit and 64-bit applications. The conversion of frameworks to support 64-bit required some implementation changes to ensure the proper handling of 64-bit data structures; however, most of these changes should be transparent to your use of the frameworks. Building for 64-bit means you can create applications that address extremely large data sets, up to 128TB on the current Intel-based CPUs. On Intel-based Macintosh computers, some 64-bit applications may even run faster than their 32-bit equivalents because of the availability of extra processor resources in 64-bit mode. </p><p>Although most APIs support 64-bit development, some older APIs were not ported to 64-bit or offer restricted support for 64-bit applications. Many of these APIs are legacy Carbon managers that have been either wholly or partially deprecated in favor of more modern equivalents. What follows is a partial list of APIs that will not support 64-bit. For a complete description of 64-bit support in Carbon, see <em><a href="../../../../documentation/Carbon/Conceptual/Carbon64BitGuide/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004381" target="_top">64-Bit Guide for Carbon Developers</a></em>. </p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Code Fragment Manager (use the Mach-O executable format instead)</p></li><li class="li"><p>Desktop Manager (use Icon Services and Launch Services instead)</p></li><li class="li"><p>Display Manager (use Quartz Services instead)</p></li><li class="li"><p>QuickDraw (use Quartz or Cocoa instead)</p></li><li class="li"><p>QuickTime Musical Instruments (use Core Audio instead)</p></li><li class="li"><p>Sound Manager (use Core Audio instead)</p></li></ul><p>In addition to the list of deprecated APIs, there are a few modern APIs that are not deprecated, but which have not been ported to 64-bit. Development of 32-bit applications with these APIs is still supported, but if you want to create a 64-bit application, you must use alternative technologies. Among these APIs are the following:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>The entire QuickTime C API (not deprecated, but developers should use QuickTime Kit instead in 64-bit applications)</p></li><li class="li"><p>HIToolbox, Window Manager, and most other Carbon user interface APIs (not deprecated, but developers should use Cocoa user interface classes and other alternatives); see <em><a href="../../../../documentation/Carbon/Conceptual/Carbon64BitGuide/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004381" target="_top">64-Bit Guide for Carbon Developers</a></em> for the list of specific APIs and transition paths. </p></li></ul><p>Mac OS X uses the LP64 model that is in use by other 64-bit UNIX systems, which means fewer headaches when porting from other operating systems. For general information on the LP64 model and how to write 64-bit applications, see <em><a href="../../../../documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/64bitPorting/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001064" target="_top">64-Bit Transition Guide</a></em>. For Cocoa-specific transition information, see <em><a href="../../../../documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Cocoa64BitGuide/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004247" target="_top">64-Bit Transition Guide for Cocoa</a></em>. For Carbon-specific transition information, see <em><a href="../../../../documentation/Carbon/Conceptual/Carbon64BitGuide/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004381" target="_top">64-Bit Guide for Carbon Developers</a></em>.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004696-SW5" title="Garbage Collection"></a><h3>Garbage Collection</h3><p>Mac OS X v10.5 introduces support for garbage collection in Cocoa applications. Garbage collection is a form of automatic memory management used in many other development environments. When you implement an application using  garbage collection, it becomes unnecessary for you to issue <code>retain</code>, <code>release</code>, and <code>autorelease</code> messages to retain or free your Cocoa objects. Instead, the garbage collector keeps track of all in-use objects and automatically frees objects that are not referenced by your application.</p><p>Garbage collection in Mac OS X v10.5 is an opt-in feature. You are not required to use it in your applications. For more information about how to support garbage collection in your Cocoa applications, see <em><a href="../../../../documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/GarbageCollection/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002431" target="_top">Garbage Collection Programming Guide</a></em>. </p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004696-SW3" title="Objective-C 2.0"></a><h3>Objective-C 2.0</h3><p>Objective-C 2.0 is an update to the Objective-C language that adds support for many modern language features, including the following:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Object properties, which offer an alternative way to declare member variables</p></li><li class="li"><p>Support for garbage collection; see <span class="content_text"><a href="MacOSX10_5.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004696-SW5">“Garbage Collection”</a></span></p></li><li class="li"><p>A new <code>for</code> operator syntax for performing fast enumerations of collections</p></li><li class="li"><p>Protocol enhancements</p></li><li class="li"><p>Deprecation syntax</p></li></ul><p>For information about the new features of Objective-C 2.0, see the following documents:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p><em><a href="../../../../documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001163" target="_top">The Objective-C 2.0 Programming Language</a></em></p></li><li class="li"><p><em><a href="../../../../documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ObjCRuntimeRef/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001418" target="_top">Objective-C 2.0 Runtime Reference</a></em></p></li></ul><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004696-SW11" title="Resolution-Independent User Interface"></a><h3>Resolution-Independent User Interface</h3><p>Resolution independence decouples the resolution of the user's screen from the resolution you use to do drawing in your source code. While previous versions of Mac OS X assumed a screen resolution of 72 dots per inch (dpi), most modern screens actually have resolutions that are 100 dpi or more. Content rendered for a 72 dpi screen appears smaller on such screens—a problem that will only get worse as screen resolutions increase. To address this issue, Mac OS X v10.5 supports content scaling for screen-based rendering.</p><p>When drawing to a screen where content scaling is enabled, a scale factor is applied to content to render it at the correct size. For content drawn using Quartz and Cocoa primitives, this scaling behavior works seamlessly in most cases to retain your window’s crisp graphics. If your code assumes a specific pixel alignment or screen resolution, however, that code may not render correctly at scale factors greater than or less than 1.0. For example, bitmap images may be automatically scaled during drawing to fit into the larger pixel space, a process that may introduce artifacts.  </p><p>Although the Mac OS X frameworks handle many aspects related to resolution-independent drawing, there are still things you need to do in your drawing code to support resolution independence: </p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Update the images and artwork in your user interface. As the pixel density of displays increases, you need to make sure your application's custom artwork can scale accordingly. That is, your art needs to be larger in terms of pixel dimensions to avoid loss of resolution onscreen at higher scale factors.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Update code that relies on precise pixel alignment to take the current scale factor into account. Both Cocoa and Carbon provide ways to access the current scale factor.</p></li></ul><p>Content scaling is currently enabled using the Quartz Debug application. For more information about resolution-independence and how to support it in your code, see <em><a href="../../../../documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/HiDPIOverview/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003409" target="_top">Resolution Independence Guidelines</a></em>. </p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004696-DontLinkElementID_2" title="Security Enhancements"></a><h3>Security Enhancements</h3><p>Mac OS X v10.5 includes several new improvements in the underlying operating system security. The sections that follow describe some of the key features. For general information about the security features available in Mac OS X, see <em><a href="../../../../documentation/Security/Conceptual/Security_Overview/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000976" target="_top">Security Overview</a></em>. </p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004696-DontLinkElementID_3" title="Mandatory Access Control Framework"></a><h4>Mandatory Access Control Framework</h4><p>The Mandatory Access Control (MAC) framework provides a fine-grained security architecture for controlling the execution of processes at the kernel level. This feature enables the “sandboxing” of applications, which lets you limit the access of a given application to only those features you designate. You might use this feature to prevent an application that should not need network access from communicating over the network.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004696-DontLinkElementID_4" title="Code Signing"></a><h4>Code Signing</h4><p>Code signing enables you to attach a digital signature to your applications. Mac OS X v10.5 uses these signatures to check the validity of your application bundle and ensure that it has not been modified. If the contents of your bundle change, perhaps because they have been tampered with, the system alerts the user to this fact. Code signing also results in fewer alert panels after installing system updates because the validity of signed applications can be guaranteed using the signature instead of by prompting the user.</p><p>For more information on code signing, see <em><a href="../../../../documentation/Security/Conceptual/CodeSigningGuide/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40005929" target="_top">Code Signing Guide</a></em>. </p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004696-DontLinkElementID_5" title="Restrictions on Executing Dynamically Generated Code"></a><h4>Restrictions on Executing Dynamically Generated Code</h4><p>One way for malicious programs to bypass system security is to inject some data (such as a carefully crafted image or other seemingly valid data file) into a program’s process space and trick the program into executing the code contained in that data. In earlier versions of Mac OS X, the system placed no restrictions on where code could reside in the process space. In Mac OS X v10.4, a change was made to prevent the execution of code in a program’s stack space on Intel-based Macintosh computers by default. If needed, a program could override this behavior by passing the <code>allow_stack_execute</code> option to the <code>ld</code> program at link time or by dynamically allowing execution in this space using the <code>mprotect</code> system call. </p><p>In Mac OS X v10.5, the system is increasing the restrictions on executing code in two ways. First, the system now disallows the execution of stack-based code on both PowerPC-based and Intel-based Macintosh computers by default. Second, for 64-bit programs, the system now disallows attempts to execute code in any portion of the process space unless that portion is explicitly marked as executable. Most developers may not notice these changes because code compiled and linked statically is automatically marked as executable by the <code>ld</code> program. If your 64-bit application generates code dynamically, however, you must explicitly mark that code as executable or your program will receive a <code>SIGBUS</code> signal and exit when trying to execute that code. As before, you can use the <code>mprotect</code> system call with the <code>PROT_EXEC</code> option to grant execute permissions to a block of memory containing dynamically generated code. For information on how to use this call, see <code><a href="../../../../documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man2/mprotect.2.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/2/mprotect" target="_top">mprotect</a></code> man page.</p><p>For more information, see <em><a href="../../RN-StackExecution/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006105" target="_top">Stack Execution Release Notes</a></em>. </p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004696-DontLinkElementID_6" title="Quarantine"></a><h4>Quarantine</h4><p>Applications that download files from the Internet or receive files from external sources (such as email attachments) can use the Quarantine feature to provide a first line of defense against malicious software such as Trojan horses. When an application receives an unknown file, it should add quarantine attributes to the file using new functions found in Launch Services. The attributes associate basic information with the file, such as its type, when it was received, and the URL from which it came. When the user tries to open a file that has quarantine attributes associated with it, Mac OS X inspects the file and automatically prevents known malicious files from being opened. For other files, the system asks the user what to do about the file, providing the user with information found in the quarantine attributes. If the user approves the opening of the file, the quarantine for that file is lifted.</p><p>If you are developing a web browser or email program, or if your software somehow deals with files from unknown sources, you should use the Quarantine feature as part of your program’s basic security procedures. Quarantine is part of the Launch Services API, which is itself part of the Core Services framework. For more information about the Quarantine API, see the <code>LSQuarantine.h</code> header file in that framework.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004696-DontLinkElementID_7" title="New and Updated Features"></a><h2>New and Updated Features</h2><p>Mac OS X v10.5 supports the following new and updated features, which are listed alphabetically:</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004696-DontLinkElementID_8" title="Address Book Framework"></a><h3>Address Book Framework</h3><p>The Address Book framework adds support for sharing accounts, which are part of the Identity Services feature (see <span class="content_text"><a href="MacOSX10_5.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004696-SW9">“Identity Services”</a></span>). The Address Book framework includes a new <code>ABIdentityPicker</code> class, which posts a user interface for assigning sharing accounts to specific features of your application.  For example, a slideshow application could use this feature to restrict access to the slideshows it manages. </p><p>For reference information about the Address Book framework, see <em><a href="../../../../documentation/UserExperience/Reference/AddressBook/ObjC_classic/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001692" target="_top">Address Book Objective-C Framework Reference</a></em> or <em><a href="../../../../documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/AddressBookC_Collection/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003856" target="_top">Address Book C Framework Reference</a></em>. </p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004696-DontLinkElementID_9" title="AppleScript"></a><h3>AppleScript</h3><p>AppleScript in Mac OS X v10.5 has been updated to support the following features:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Unicode—script text and internal text operations now use Unicode exclusively</p></li><li class="li"><p>64-bit support; see <span class="content_text"><a href="MacOSX10_5.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004696-SW8">“64-Bit Support”</a></span></p></li><li class="li"><p>Easier access to applications in scripts</p></li></ul><p>Mac OS X v10.5 also includes additional scripting support, which is described in <span class="content_text"><a href="MacOSX10_5.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004696-SW13">“Scripting.”</a></span></p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004696-DontLinkElementID_10" title="Automator"></a><h3>Automator</h3><p>The Automator application includes a new, more intuitive user interface for finding actions and building workflows. It also includes several new features that make it easier to create workflows and dynamically modify actions as they execute. These features include the following:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Watch Me Do—this feature lets you build an action by recording your interactions with Mac OS X and its applications. The Automator toolbar now includes a Record button for initiating recording of an action. </p></li><li class="li"><p>Workflow variables—these are placeholders that you can use to represent a piece of text or a value (such as the current date) that can be evaluated at workflow runtime. You can reuse variables throughout your workflow to avoid repetitive data entry. </p></li><li class="li"><p>Application integration—you can now integrate workflows into your application using the <code>AMWorkflow</code> and <code>AMWorkflowController</code> classes. These classes give your application the ability to execute workflows and control input and variable definitions programmatically. </p></li></ul><p>For information about the <code>AMWorkflow</code> and <code>AMWorkflowController</code> classes, see <em><a href="../../../../documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/AutomatorReference/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001452" target="_top">Automator Framework Reference</a></em>. </p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004696-DontLinkElementID_11" title="Calendar Store Framework"></a><h3>Calendar Store Framework</h3><p>The Calendar Store framework provides access to data from the iCal application. You can fetch calendars, events, and tasks from the iCal data storage using several different techniques, including predicate-based queries. You can register for notifications that let you know when calendar, event, and task objects change. You can also make changes to records and save those changes to the user’s calendar. </p><p>For information about the classes of the Calendar Store framework, see <em><a href="../../../../documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/CalendarStoreReference/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004333" target="_top">Calendar Store Framework Reference</a></em>. </p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004696-SW10" title="Carbon"></a><h3>Carbon</h3><p>The HIToolbox includes new functions to make it easier to integrate Cocoa views into your Carbon applications. Using these functions, you can create HIView-based wrappers for your Cocoa <code>NSView</code> objects and embed the corresponding <code>HIViewRef</code> objects into your windows. Once embedded, you use the standard HIView functions to manipulate the wrapper objects. Wrapped Cocoa views can be used in both composited and noncomposited windows.</p><p>The new Text Input Sources API now provides information about and supports the manipulation of text input sources. This API replaces the input source management functions in the Script Manager (such as the <code>KeyScript</code> function), Keyboard Layout Access (KL API), and the Text Services Manager (such as the <code>SetDefaultInputMethod</code> function).</p><p>For information about creating wrappers for Cocoa views, see <em><a href="../../../../documentation/Carbon/Reference/HIViewReference/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000785" target="_top">HIView Reference</a></em>.

In Mac OS X v10.5, if you are iterating a mutable collection and modify the collection, Cocoa now throws an exception. This behavior affects only those applications that are built against the version of Cocoa found in Mac OS X v10.5 and later, but it does represent a significant change from the way Cocoa used to behave. </p><p>The new behavior enforces a more correct (and safer) approach to iteration, which is that you should never modify the collection you are enumerating. Instead, you should modify a copy of the collection or simply gather the list of objects to modify during the iteration and act upon them after the iteration is complete. Alternatively, you can use the new iteration features available in Objective-C 2.0; see <span class="content_text"><a href="MacOSX10_5.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004696-SW3">“Objective-C 2.0.”</a></span> </p><p>For more information about collections and iteration, see <em><a href="../../../../documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Collections/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000034i" target="_top">Collections Programming Topics for Cocoa</a></em>. </p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004696-SW7" title="Core Animation"></a><h3>Core Animation</h3><p>Core Animation is a new set of Objective-C classes for doing sophisticated 2D rendering and animation. Using Core Animation, you can create everything from basic window content to Front Row–style user interfaces, and achieve respectable animation performance, without having to tune your code using OpenGL or other low-level drawing routines. This performance is achieved using server-side content caching, which restricts the compositing operations performed by the server to only those parts of a view or window whose contents actually changed.  </p><p>At the heart of the Core Animation programming model are layer objects, which are similar in many ways to Cocoa views. Like views, you can arrange layers in hierarchies, change their size and position, and tell them to draw themselves. Unlike views, layers do not support event-handling, accessibility, or drag and drop. You can also manipulate the layout of layers in more ways than traditional Cocoa views. In addition to positioning layers using a layout manager, you can apply affine transforms to layers to rotate, scale, skew, or translate them in relation to their parent layer. </p><p>Layer content can be animated implicitly or explicitly depending on the actions you take. Modifying specific properties of a layer, such as its geometry, visual attributes, or children, typically triggers an implicit animation to transition from the old state to the new state of the property. For example, adding a child layer triggers an animation that causes the child layer to fade gradually into view. You can also trigger animations explicitly in a layer by modifying its transformation matrix. </p><p>You can manipulate layers independent of, or in conjunction with, the views and windows of your application. Both Cocoa and Carbon applications can take advantage of the Core Animation’s integration with the <code>NSView</code> class to add animation effects to windows. Layers can also support the following types of content: </p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Quartz Composer compositions</p></li><li class="li"><p>OpenGL content</p></li><li class="li"><p>Core Image filter effects</p></li><li class="li"><p>Quartz and Cocoa drawing content</p></li><li class="li"><p>QuickTime playback and capture</p></li></ul><p>The Core Animation features are part of the Quartz Core framework (<code>QuartzCore.framework</code>).

Now, you simply build your executable and run it. Hitting a breakpoint interrupts the program and displays the debugger window. (You can also debug from any editor window now.) Other features of the new debugging environment include the following:  </p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Variable tooltips.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Reorganization (and in some cases consolidation) of toolbar and menu items to improve space usage, while still keeping all the needed tools available.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Consolidation of the Standard I/O Log, Run Log, and Console log into the Console log window. </p></li></ul><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004696-DontLinkElementID_37" title="Research Assistant"></a><h4>Research Assistant</h4><p>The Xcode documentation window provides an easy way for you to find information quickly, but now there is an even faster way to get the information you need as you type. This feature is called the Research Assistant. </p><p>The Research Assistant is an inspector that displays documentation for the currently selected text (see <span class="content_text"><a href="MacOSX10_5.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004696-SW24">Figure 1</a></span>).

In addition to support for new controls (such as Cocoa toolbars), the new version features major improvements in the following areas:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Object palettes</p></li><li class="li"><p>Inspectors</p></li><li class="li"><p>Creating connections between objects</p></li><li class="li"><p>Custom object integration</p></li><li class="li"><p>New support for refactoring your nib files</p></li><li class="li"><p>Support for adding Core Animation–based behaviors</p></li></ul><p>In place of the old palette window, Interface Builder now lets you choose views and controls from an object library. This library groups related controls into categories and lets you either browse for the desired element or search for it by name. The library also provides controls for displaying controls in the size (regular, small, mini) that you want and seeing your selection reflected in the library window. </p><p>Thanks to improvements in the underlying infrastructure for managing controls, it is now much easier to integrate your own controls into Interface Builder. Interface Builder includes the Interface Builder Kit framework and an Xcode project template for creating custom plug-ins. Most of the work needed to integrate custom controls now occurs directly in the nib file of your plug-in, with more advanced features requiring only modest amounts of code. </p><p>Because of its infrastructure improvements, Interface Builder now supports the ability to inspect multiple objects. The basic attributes inspector breaks up attributes by class, allowing each class to define a separate section for its own content. Selecting multiple objects of different types still displays any attributes inspectors that are common among the selected objects. Other types of inspectors, such as the size inspector also remain active in most cases, allowing you to modify the size of multiple controls all at once.</p><p><span class="content_text">Figure 3</span> shows the new look of the Interface Builder application, including the new document, library, and inspector windows.  </p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004696-SW17" title="Figure 3Interface Builder 3.0"></a><p><strong>Figure 3&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Interface Builder 3.0</p><img src = "../Art/interface_builder.jpg" alt = "Interface Builder 3.0" ></div><br/><p>For information about Interface Builder features and how to use them, see <em><a href="../../../../documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/IB_UserGuide/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40005344" target="_top">Interface Builder User Guide</a></em>.

The Instruments application provides an integrated set of tools for debugging and analyzing performance problems in your application. </p><p><span class="content_text">Figure 4</span> shows the Instruments user interface. Instead of analyzing different aspects of your program’s performance individually, Instruments lets you configure multiple “instruments” to gather several different types of data simultaneously. Instruments let you gather information about CPU usage, disk I/O, memory usage, garbage collection events, Cocoa notifications, and more. The data for each instrument is displayed along a horizontal time axis, giving you the chance to correlate results from different instruments and thus see the “big picture” of your application’s behavior.  </p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004696-SW12" title="Figure 4The Instruments application interface"></a><p><strong>Figure 4&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The Instruments application interface</p><img src = "../Art/instruments_window.jpg" alt = "The Instruments application interface" ></div><br/><p>An important aspect of Instruments is the repeatability of data gathering operations. Instruments lets you record a sequence of events in your application and store them in the master track. You can then replay a sequence of events to reproduce the exact same conditions in your application. This repeatability means that each new set of data you gather can be compared directly to any old sets, resulting in a more meaningful comparison of performance data. It also means that you can automate much of the data gathering operation. Because events are shown alongside data results, it is easier to correlate performance problems with the events that caused them. </p><p>For an introduction to Instruments, see <em><a href="../../../../documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/InstrumentsUserGuide/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004652" target="_top">Instruments User Guide</a></em>.  </p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004696-DontLinkElementID_47" title="Dashcode"></a><h3>Dashcode</h3><p>Dashcode is an integrated environment for laying out, coding, and testing Dashboard widgets. Although users see and use widgets as applications, they’re actually packaged webpages powered by standard technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Although it is easy for anyone with web design experience to build a widget using existing webpage editors, as a widget’s code and layout get more complex, managing and testing of that widget becomes increasingly difficult. Dashcode provides the following features to help simplify the widget design process:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>A project manager to marshall your widget’s resources</p></li><li class="li"><p>Visual tools to design your widget interface</p></li><li class="li"><p>Tools to set metadata values, specify required images, and package your widget</p></li><li class="li"><p>A source code editor to implement your widget’s behavior</p></li><li class="li"><p>A debugger to help you resolve issues in your widget’s implementation</p></li></ul><p><span class="content_text">Figure 5</span> shows the Dashcode canvas, inspector, and library windows. The canvas is a drag-and-drop layout environment where you lay out widgets visually. Using the inspector window, you can apply style information to the controls, text, and shape elements that you drag in from the library. </p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004696-SW19"
