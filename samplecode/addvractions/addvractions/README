README - AddVRActionsAddVRActions is a sample application that illustrates how to add wired actions to a QuickTime VR movie. Currently you can add two kinds of wired actions to VR movies: (1) actions that are global to a particular node and (2) actions associated with a particular hot spot in a node. This sample code adds a node-specific action that sets the pan angle when the user first enters the node. It also adds a node-specific event that sets the node to auto-pan on idle events. This sample code adds a hot-spot-specific action that sets the pan angle when the user clicks on a hot spot.Enjoy, QuickTime Team
