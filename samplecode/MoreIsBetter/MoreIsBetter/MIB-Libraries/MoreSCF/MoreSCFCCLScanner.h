$Log: MoreSCFCCLScanner.h,v $
Revision 1.4  2002/12/12 15:24:03         
Correct the file name in the header comment.

Revision 1.3  2002/11/25 16:48:17         
Added MoreSCSetDefaultCCL. Also made changes to support building with CFM, even on Mac OS 9.  The algorithm to scan for CCLs is the same on 9 vs X, so we might as well use the same code.

Revision 1.2  2002/11/09 00:00:52         
Added compile time environment check. When using framework includes, explicitly include the frameworks we need. Convert nil to NULL.

Revision 1.1  2002/01/16 22:52:26         
First checked in.
