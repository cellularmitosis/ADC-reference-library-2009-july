Contact information consists of information such as names, phone numbers<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-DontLinkElementID_1272"></a>, fax numbers<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-DontLinkElementID_1273"></a>, and email addresses<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-DontLinkElementID_1274"></a> of the people known to the current user. Using the Address Book framework, you can access contact information from the user’s database or display it in a customizable window.</p><p>Although the Address Book interfaces that allow you to customize the display window use the terms "people picker" and "picker," these are not acceptable names to use in your application's user interface. Instead, you should give the display window a name that describes its contents as they relate to your application, such as "Addresses" or "Contacts."</p><p>The appearance of a people-picker window is customizable to allow you to display only the data relevant to your application. For example, Mail customizes this window to show the email addresses of the contacts, as shown in <span class="content_text">Figure 6-1</span>. </p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-TPXREF125" title="Figure 6-1A people-picker window as used in Mail"></a><p><strong>Figure 6-1&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>A people-picker window as used in Mail</p><img src = "../art/mt_peoplepicker.jpg" alt = "People Picker window as used in Mail" ></div><br/><p>You customize the appearance of a people-picker window using the interfaces of the Address Book framework. See <em><a href="../../AddressBook/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000117i" target="_top">Address Book Programming Guide for Mac OS X</a></em> for more information on using this framework.<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-DontLinkElementID_1275"></a></p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-SW2" title="Animation"></a><h2>Animation</h2><p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-DontLinkElementID_1276"></a>A hallmark of Mac OS X is the use of animation to enhance the user experience, such as in the minimizing of windows to the Dock, the unfurling of sheets, and the sliding of drawers. In Mac OS X v10.5 and later, animation powers the movement of icons in the Finder Cover Flow view, the springing of items from a stack in the Dock, and the arrival of buddies in an iChat window, among other things. <span class="content_text">Figure 6-2</span> shows a "time-lapsed” view of items springing from a stack.</p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-SW1" title="Figure 6-2Animation allows items in a stack to emerge smoothly"></a><p><strong>Figure 6-2&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Animation allows items in a stack to emerge smoothly</p><img src = "../art/mt_animationex.jpg" alt = "" ></div><br/><p>Animation allows users track the movements of objects, helps them understand the effects of their actions, and lends a sense of physicality and realism to the virtual world they see on the display screen. In general, animation is ideal for:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Communicating progress</p></li><li class="li"><p>Providing meaningful feedback</p></li><li class="li"><p>Clarifying a process or concept</p></li></ul><p>If you are developing an application to run in Mac OS X v10.5 and later, you, too, can take advantage of animation by using Core Animation programming interfaces. As with most powerful tools, however, it’s important to use animation wisely, that is, as a subtle enhancement to the user experience, not as the focus of the user experience. For example, you might consider using animation in the following cases:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>When users navigate a collection.</p><p>When navigation is similar to familiar, real-world activities, such as flipping through pages in a book or DVDs on a shelf, users are better able to grasp the organization and extent of a collection. In addition, when items in a collection appear to have realistic dimensionality and weight, they’re easier to recognize at a glance. </p></li><li class="li"><p>When it’s helpful for users to understand the consequences of an action before they commit to it.</p><p>Showing users the results of an action before they complete it allows them to be sure of themselves and avoid mistakes. For example, items in the Dock move aside when users drag an object into the Dock area, showing them where the new object will reside when they release the mouse button.</p></li><li class="li"><p>When users enter or initiate a different interaction mode. </p><p>When users enter a different mode of interaction, such as full-screen mode, animation can guide them and provide clues that help them keep track of the current mode. For example, the animated star field in Time Machine provides a completely different user experience that helps the user distinguish between the Time Machine view of the system and the user’s standard view of the system.</p></li><li class="li"><p>When an object changes its properties. </p><p>Showing an object’s transition from one state to another, instead of showing only the beginning and ending states, helps users understand what’s happening and gives them a greater sense of control over the process. For example, in an application that allows users to change several properties of a document at one time, an icon that smoothly shows the effects of the combination of changes would provide valuable feedback.</p></li><li class="li"><p>When an action occurs so quickly, users can’t track it. </p><p>Although speed and efficiency are essential in software, sometimes an action can take place so quickly that its context or result is unclear. When it’s important that users understand a connection or a process, animation can help them watch actions occur in a more human time frame. For example, when the user minimizes a window it doesn’t just disappear from the desktop and reappear in the Dock; instead, it moves fluidly from the desktop to the Dock so the user knows where it went.</p></li></ul><p>If you decide to use animation, therefore, be sure the animation subtly enhances the tasks and concepts your application focuses on and doesn’t distract from them. Although animation can clarify obscure or hidden processes and provide valuable feedback, gratuitous or illogical animation can degrade the user experience, in addition to decreasing the performance of your application. In particular, you should:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Avoid replicating a Front Row or Time Machine style of user interface for an application that requires a lot of user input (especially textual input) or that users use for content creation. A fully animated, full-screen user interface that displays large, simplified controls does not make detailed content-creation tasks easier or more efficient.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Avoid animating everything.</p><p>Although it’s tempting to think that more animation results in greater clarification and better feedback, it’s not generally true. Most tasks and actions in an application are best performed quickly and with a minimum of fanfare.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Avoid animating routine user-interface actions supported by system-provided controls, such as:</p><ul class="nested"><li class="nested li"><p>Switching tabs</p></li><li class="nested li"><p>Opening or closing views</p></li><li class="nested li"><p>Clicking toolbar items</p></li></ul><p>Users understand how common user interface elements work, and they don’t appreciate being forced to spend extra time watching unnecessary animation every time they click a button.</p></li></ul><p>To learn more about using animation in your application, see <em><a href="../../../../Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreAnimation_guide/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004514" target="_top">Core Animation Programming Guide</a></em>.<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-DontLinkElementID_1277"></a></p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-BAJEAJHB" title="Automator"></a><h2>Automator</h2><p>With Automator<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-DontLinkElementID_1278"></a>, a user can automate common procedures and build workflows by arranging processes from different applications into a desired order. Familiar Apple applications, such as Mail, iPhoto, and Safari make their tasks available to users to organize into a workflow. These tasks (called <em>actions</em>) are simple and narrowly defined, such as opening a file or applying a filter, so a user can include them in different workflows.</p><p>As an application developer, you can define actions that represent discrete tasks your application can perform. You make these actions available to users by creating action plug-ins that implement the appropriate behavior. An action plug-in contains a nib file and some code to manage the action’s user interface and implement its behavior. You can develop action plug-ins using either AppleScript or Objective-C. You might consider creating a set of basic actions to ship with your application so users have a starting point for using your application with Automator.</p><p>For more information on developing Automator actions, see <em><a href="../../../../AppleApplications/Conceptual/AutomatorConcepts/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001450" target="_top">Automator Programming Guide</a></em>.</p><p>As you design the user interface of an action, keep the following guidelines in mind<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-DontLinkElementID_1279"></a>:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Users stack actions on top of each other in Automator. Because display screens are wider than they are tall, you should minimize the use of vertical space. One way to do this is to use a pop-up menu instead of radio buttons, even if there are only two choices.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Don’t use group boxes. An action does not need to separate or group controls with a group box. </p></li><li class="li"><p>Avoid tab views. Instead, use hidden tab views to alternate between different sets of controls.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Avoid using labels to repeat the action’s title or description; these take up space without providing value.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Use a disclosure triangle to hide and display optional settings. (See <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGControls/XHIGControls.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000359-TPXREF141">“Disclosure Triangles”</a></span> for more information on disclosure triangles.)</p></li><li class="li"><p>Use small Aqua controls to minimize the use of space. (In <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGControls/XHIGControls.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000359-TP6">“Controls”</a></span> you can find information on the dimensions of those controls that are available in the small size.)</p></li><li class="li"><p>Use 10-pixel margins to make the best use of the space.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Provide feedback. Use the appropriate progress indicator when an action needs time to complete (see <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGControls/XHIGControls.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000359-TPXREF106">“Progress Indicators”</a></span> for more information on these controls).</p></li><li class="li"><p>If possible, display an example showing the effect of the action so users can see the impact of various settings. <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-DontLinkElementID_1280"></a></p></li></ul><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-SW3" title="Bonjour"></a><h2>Bonjour</h2><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-DontLinkElementID_1281"></a><p>If you develop applications that need to communicate with other computers and processes on the Internet or a local area network, you should avoid making assumptions about the user’s network settings. Ensuring fast, efficient connections to other programs and computers is an important part of providing a good user experience.</p><p>Mac OS X supports a dynamically updating networking model. Because a user may change IP addresses many times during a single session, don’t save settings based on the IP address. Use Bonjour whenever a user might otherwise be required to set an IP address. Bonjour<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-DontLinkElementID_1282"></a> enables automatic discovery of computers, devices, and services on IP networks. The use of Bonjour can dramatically simplify network configuration for your users.

Mac OS X provides a standard Colors window for picking colors. Shown in <span class="content_text">Figure 6-3</span> this window lets the user enter color data using any of five different color models.

Appearing and disappearing with a single keystroke or mouse gesture, Dashboard presents a default or user-defined set of widgets in a format reminiscent of a heads-up display. Each widget is small, visually appealing, and clearly indicative of its purpose. For example, each of the Mac OS X Dashboard widgets shown in <span class="content_text"><a href="XHIGUsingTechnologies.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-BAJGDGIG">Figure 6-4</a></span> is an attractive, scaled-down interface to a common task.</p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-BAJGDGIG" title="Figure 6-4Dashboard widgets"></a><p><strong>Figure 6-4&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Dashboard widgets</p><img src = "../art/mt_dashboardview.jpg" alt = "" ></div><br/><p>You can develop a standalone widget that performs a lightweight, well-defined task or a widget whose task is actually performed by your larger, more functional application. This section summarizes both the high-level and user-interface guidelines you should follow as you design your widget. Step-by-step instructions for how to implement a Dashboard widget, including plentiful code and user interface examples, are available in <em><!--a target="_top" -->Dashboard Tutorial<!--/a--></em>.</p><p>Many of the user-interface design principles covered in <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGHIDesign/XHIGHIDesign.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-TP6">“Human Interface Design”</a></span> are also applicable to Dashboard widgets. Following these guidelines gives users an automatic familiarity with this technology<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-DontLinkElementID_1287"></a>.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-SW5" title="High-Level Design Guidelines for Widgets"></a><h3>High-Level Design Guidelines for Widgets</h3><p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-DontLinkElementID_1288"></a>Dashboard widgets are small and compact in part because they occupy prime screen space but also because they perform a single, well-defined task. It's especially important to avoid providing functionality that is extraneous to a widget's central task, because this dilutes a widget's usefulness. As with the design of a full-size application, taking the time to carefully define your widget's target audience (see <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGDesignProcess/XHIGDesignProcess.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002718-TPXREF114">“Involving Users in the Design Process”</a></span>) will help you focus on the task your widget will perform.</p><p>As you design your widget, keep these high-level guidelines in mind:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>A widget’s purpose should be immediately apparent to the user. </p><p>To achieve this, be sure you understand the user's mental model of the task your widget performs (for more information on this concept, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGHIDesign/XHIGHIDesign.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-CJBDDFAJ">“Reflect the User’s Mental Model”</a></span>).</p></li><li class="li"><p>A widget is not the place to display aggressive company advertising or branding.</p><p>Your widget is not merely an entrance to another application, even if that other application performs the processing for the widget’s task. If you take advantage of Dashboard’s prominence to display a banner ad, for example, users will be likely to stop including your widget in the Dashboard display.</p></li><li class="li"><p>A widget is not simply a miniaturized version of a standard application window.</p><p>Avoid making your widget look crowded by displaying only the controls that are essential to the task.</p></li></ul><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-SW6" title="User-Interface Design Guidelines for Widgets"></a><h3>User-Interface Design Guidelines for Widgets</h3><p>When you’ve decided on the widget’s task, follow these guidelines for designing the user interface:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Use color to enhance the visual impact of your widgets.</p><p>Widgets should be visually stimulating, and good color choices can help convey the type of task the widget performs. As with application icons (described in <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGIcons/XHIGIcons.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000967-TPXREF117">“Icon Genres and Families”</a></span>), you should consider using bright, saturated colors for fun, creative tasks and more sombre, desaturated colors for utilitarian tasks</p></li><li class="li"><p>Don’t use Aqua controls on the front of your widget. Instead, design controls that support and enhance the task-oriented appearance of the widget.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Display the widget’s information at once. Dashboard appears and disappears quickly, so you don’t want to make the user wait for your content to display.</p></li><li class="li"><p>The default size of the widget should be small, but it should be able to expand if the task requires it. </p><p>Be aware that a user might want to populate the Dashboard with a very large number of widgets. If your widget is too large and seems to monopolize the screen, a user might choose not to include it.</p><p>If appropriate you can provide a resize control, but recognize that if a user misses this control and clicks outside the widget, Dashboard is hidden.</p></li><li class="li"><p>The default set of information your widget displays should be minimal and should not require scrolling. </p><p>If, however, the widget’s function is to provide a lot of information, consider making the presence of a scroll bar an option the user can select.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Use clearly readable fonts.</p><p>Avoid sacrificing readability to achieve a particular appearance.

These technologies provide benefits for all users and present the possibility of a new paradigm for human-computer interaction.</p><p><strong>Speech recognition</strong> is the ability for the computer to recognize and respond to a person’s speech. Using speech recognition, users can accomplish tasks comprising multiple steps—for example, “Schedule a meeting next Friday at 3 p.m. with John, Paul, and George” or “Create a 3-by-3 table”—with one spoken command. Mac OS X users can control the computer by voice rather than be limited to the mouse or keyboard; consequently, speech-recognition technology is very important for people with special needs and also for general users. Developers can take advantage of the speech engine and API included with Mac OS X, as well as the built-in user interface.</p><p><strong>Speech synthesis</strong> also called text-to-speech (TTS), converts text into audible speech. It provides a way to deliver information to users without forcing them to shift attention from their current task. For example, the computer could, in the background, deliver such messages as “Your download is complete; one of the files has been corrupted” and “You have email from your boss; would you like to read it now?” TTS is also crucial for users with vision or attention disabilities. As with speech recognition, Mac OS X TTS provides both an API and several user interface features.</p><p>For information about implementing speech synthesis and recognition, see the documents in <span class="content_text"><a href="../../../SpeechTechnologies-date.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000440-TP30000437-TP30000576" target="_top">Guides > User Experience > Speech Technologies</a></span>.<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-DontLinkElementID_1315"></a></p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-BAJHACBI" title="Spotlight"></a><h2>Spotlight</h2><p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-DontLinkElementID_1316"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-DontLinkElementID_1317"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-DontLinkElementID_1318"></a>Spotlight is a powerful Mac OS X search technology available to both users and application developers. Built on top of Search Kit and integrated with the file system, Spotlight makes searching for files on the computer as easy as searching the web. With Spotlight, users can search for things using attributes that have meaning for them, such as the intended audience for a document, the orientation of an image, or the key signature of the music in an audio file. Information like this (called metadata) is embedded in a file by the application that created it. Spotlight’s power comes from being able to extract, store, update, and organize the metadata of files to allow fast, comprehensive searches.</p><p>Spotlight is always available to users to help them find their files on the computer. Even better, the search technologies that power Spotlight are available to developers to help them find files to display, plug-ins to load, and data to use in their applications. For example, a developer can define complex queries to find only the types of files an application needs to work with or provide Spotlight functionality from within an application. The rest of this section introduces the user’s view of Spotlight and describes some of the ways an application can take advantage of its features.</p><p>Users can easily initiate a Spotlight search using the Spotlight icon at the far right end of the menu bar. <span class="content_text"><a href="XHIGUsingTechnologies.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-BAJGBDJB">Figure 6-9</a></span> shows the Spotlight icon and search field displayed when a user clicks the icon.</p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-BAJGBDJB" title="Figure 6-9The Spotlight icon and search field"></a><p><strong>Figure 6-9&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The Spotlight icon and search field</p><img src = "../art/mt_spotlightsearchfield.jpg" alt = "The Spotlight icon and search field" ></div><br/><p>In addition, a user can select a word or phrase in a text document and Control-click to reveal a contextual menu that allows a Spotlight search for the selected text. <span class="content_text"><a href="XHIGUsingTechnologies.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-BAJCCFAB">Figure 6-10</a></span> shows this contextual menu.<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-DontLinkElementID_1319"></a></p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-BAJCCFAB" title="Figure 6-10Spotlight search in a contextual menu"></a><p><strong>Figure 6-10&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Spotlight search in a contextual menu</p><img src = "../art/mt_mailspotlightsearch.jpg" alt = "Spotlight search in a contextual menu" ></div><br/><p>Whichever way a search is initiated, Spotlight quickly displays the results, conveniently sorted into categories the user can adjust in Spotlight Preferences. <span class="content_text"><a href="XHIGUsingTechnologies.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-BAJHEFFA">Figure 6-11</a></span> shows the standard Spotlight results window.</p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-BAJHEFFA" title="Figure 6-11A Spotlight results window"></a><p><strong>Figure 6-11&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>A Spotlight results window</p><img src = "../art/mt_mailspotlightresults.jpg" alt = "A Spotlight results window" ></div><br/><p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-DontLinkElementID_1320"></a>To applications, Spotlight provides almost limitless ability to find files and to give advanced file-search capabilities to users within the context of the application. For example, an application might choose to replicate the Spotlight contextual-menu item (shown in <span class="content_text"><a href="XHIGUsingTechnologies.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-BAJCCFAB">Figure 6-10</a></span>) with a button that initiates a Spotlight search for the user’s selected text. The application could then display its own window that contains all the search results or a filtered subset of them.</p><p>An application might also choose to give users access to Spotlight searches in a rounded search field (for more information on this control, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGControls/XHIGControls.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000359-TPXREF210">“Search Fields”</a></span>). A user often needs to work on a file that was saved in an atypical place or given an unexpected or forgotten name. If an application offers only a Finder-based Open dialog, it might force the user to waste a lot of time navigating the file system, trying to remember what the file was named and where it was saved. Instead, an application can provide a Spotlight-powered search that allows the user to search the entire file system, using meaningful attributes other than the filename.</p><p>Applications can also use Spotlight functionality behind the scenes to find needed files or plug-ins. For example, an application that provides a back-up service might allow the user to choose a broad category of file type to back up, such as images. Instead of asking users to identify all the folders that contain their images or just backing up a Pictures folder, the application could perform a Spotlight search to find every image file in the file system, regardless of its location.</p><p>It’s important to emphasize that Spotlight is tuned to search for files; it’s not intended to do extensive text-based searching within a document. If you need to do fine-grained textual searching, you should use Search Kit technologies instead. An application that stores data in database records, for example, should not base its database search on Spotlight because the data are not stored in separate files. For more information on using Search Kit in your application, see <em><a href="../../SearchKitConcepts/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001071" target="_top">Search Kit Programming Guide</a></em>.</p><p>Spotlight offers unparalleled search functionality to both users and developers. Along with these opportunities, however, comes an important developer responsibility. If your application uses a custom file format, you must supply a plug-in (called a Spotlight importer) that describes the types of metadata your file format contains. This ensures that a user will be able to search for the files your application creates using the attributes described by the metadata your files contain. For comprehensive information on how to do this, see <em><a href="../../../../Carbon/Conceptual/MDImporters/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001267" target="_top">Spotlight Importer Programming Guide</a></em>.<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-DontLinkElementID_1321"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-DontLinkElementID_1322"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-DontLinkElementID_1323"></a></p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-TP9" title="User Assistance"></a><h2>User Assistance</h2><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-DontLinkElementID_1324"></a><p>Mac OS X supports two user help components: Apple Help and help tags<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000355-DontLinkElementID_1325"></a>. Help tags allow you to provide temporary context-sensitive help whereas Apple Help allows you to provide a more thorough discussion of a topic or procedure.</p><p>Use these mechanisms to provide user help in your application instead of using help mechanisms that are specific to your application. When users refer to help, it is usually because they are having difficulty accomplishing a task and therefore might be frustrated.

For example, “Add or remove a language from your list” or “Reduce red tint in the selected area”. Most help tags can use this format.</p><p>Give extra information to explain the results of the user’s action. This kind of tag is most effective in an interface that already includes some instructional text, because the tag and the interface text work together to describe what the control does and how the user manipulates it.</p><p>Define terms that may be unknown to the user. This kind of tag should be used only if the interface already contains instructions to the user.</p></li></ul>
