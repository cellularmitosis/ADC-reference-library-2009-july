Legal values are either <TT>&quot;true&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;false,&quot;</TT> and the default is <TT>&quot;false.&quot;</TT> Common usage is:<P><TT><A NAME="pgfId-54745"></A>&lt;smil qt:autoplay=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;</TT><P><LI><A NAME="pgfId-46862"></A>next: Specifies to the player that after this presentation is finished, the presentation referenced in the attribute value should be invoked and played in the same space. Used to chain presentations together. A valid attribute value is any URL. This capability is equivalent to the QuickTime browser plug-in's &quot;qtnext&quot; attribute. Common usage is:<P><TT><A NAME="pgfId-54749"></A>    &lt;smil qt:next=&quot;nextpresentation.smi&quot;/&gt;</TT><P><LI><A NAME="pgfId-46974"></A>time-slider: Specifies whether a time line should be displayed as part of the user interface. Because by default the QuickTime playback engine dynamically loads media objects as required, the duration of the overall media presentation can change as a movie is played or navigated. When the duration changes, the time line will change to reflect that. This can be unnecessarily confusing to the user. Therefore, by default, QuickTime movies created from a SMIL document do not display a time line as part of their user interface. This behavior can be overriden using the &quot;time-slider&quot; attribute. Common usage is:<P><TT><A NAME="pgfId-54753"></A>    &lt;smil qt:time-slider=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;</TT><P><LI><A NAME="pgfId-46976"></A>immediate-instantiation: Specifies whether the media objects within the presentation should be instantiated immediately, i.e., at the same time the presentation itself is instantiated, or whether instantiation should be deferred until the element is ready to be played back. Legal values are either <TT>&quot;true&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;false,&quot;</TT> and the default is <TT>&quot;false.&quot;</TT>  The value of this attribute may be overridden on a media-object basis by using it as an attribute to individual media-object elements, as described below. Because this attribute causes all media objects to be instantiated, it can take considerable time and memory for a complex presentation or one being loaded over a slow network connection. Therefore, it is recommended that it only be used on small media objects. Common usage is:<P><TT><A NAME="pgfId-54757"></A>    &lt;smil qt:immediate-instantiation=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;</TT><P><LI><A NAME="pgfId-46868"></A>chapter-mode: Specifies to the player, both QuickTime Player and the Movie Controller, the way in which chapters should be used in the user interface when a time line is part of the interface. The chapter-mode attribute can have a value of &quot;all&quot; or &quot;clip&quot;. If the attribute is not present, the default value is &quot;all&quot;. If the chapter-mode attribute is &quot;all&quot;, then the player displays the time line of the entire duration of the presentation. Each chapter represents a point along that time line. If the chapter-mode attribute is set to &quot;clip&quot;, then the time line no longer represents the entire duration of presentation. Instead, it represents the duration of the current chapter. The &quot;clip&quot; behavior is useful for long presentations where the granularity of the timeline may be unacceptably low. It is also useful for network-based presentations, particularly those using streaming media, where the actual duration of a clip isn't known until it has started to play. By using the &quot;clip&quot; value of the chapter-mode, the user will not be exposed to the duration changes of the presentation caused by the loading of media as the presentation is played or navigated. Common usage is:<P><TT><A NAME="pgfId-54761"></A>    &lt;smil qt:chapter-mode=&quot;clip&quot;/&gt;</TT><P></UL><hr>&#169; 2000 Apple Computer, Inc.<!-- QTnavbar start --><P><I>Inside Macintosh: QuickTime Reference</I><P>| <A HREF="QT41WhatsNew-8.html">Previous</A> | <A HREF="QT41WhatsNew-1.html">Chapter Contents</A> | <A HREF="QT41WhatsNew.html">Chapter Top</A> | <A HREF="QT41WhatsNew-10.html">Next</A> |</P><!-- QTnavbar end --></DIV><!-- start of footer --><!--#include virtual="/includes/framesetfooter" --><!-- end of footer --></BODY></HTML>
