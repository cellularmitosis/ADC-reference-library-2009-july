<P><U><A HREF="../../Reference/DynamicElements/WORepetition.html">WORepetition</A></U> has two attributes that you must bind to: <B>list</B> and <B>item</B>. The <B>list</B> attribute must be bound to an array. The <B>item</B> attribute is bound automatically when you bind the <B>list</B> attribute.
<P>A WORepetition is like a loop in a structured programming language. It uses <B>item</B> to iterate through the <B>list</B>. Creating a WORepetition is equivalent to saying "for each <B>item</B> in the array <B>list</B>, display the contents."

<P><B>Tip:</B> It's common to use WORepetitions with tables. To learn how to bind a WORepetition that has a table row as its contents, see "<U><A HREF="BindInInspector.html#REF83876">Binding Elements Using the Inspector</A></U>."
