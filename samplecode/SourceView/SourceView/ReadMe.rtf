\cf0 "SourceView" is a Cocoa sample application that demonstrates how to use 
\f2 NSOutlineView
\f1  driven by 
\f2 NSTreeController
\f1  and various other Cocoa classes to produce a Finder-like source view.\

\cf0 \
Among the features demonstrated are -\
\
- Source outline view using 
\f2 NSOutlineView
\f1  using a custom outline cell 
\f2 ImageAndTextCell
\f1 ,\
- Loading dictionary data from disk using 
\f2 [\CocoaLigature0 NSDictionary dictionaryWithContentsOfFile\'c9] 
\f1 \CocoaLigature1 to populate the outline view,\
- Outline view uses selection highlight style: 
\f2 \cf2 \CocoaLigature0 NSTableViewSelectionHighlightStyleSourceList
\f1 \cf0 , which gives is a gradient-style selection.\CocoaLigature1 \
- Icon view of directories using 
\f2 NSCollectionView
\f1 ,\
- Viewing URLs using 
\f2 WebView
\f1 ,\
- Outline view drag and drop support for URLs and file system-based objects (from Safari, Finder, etc),
\f2 \

\f1 - Factoring or organizing its various NSViews into a separate nib using 
\f2 NSViewController
\f1 ,\
- Factoring or organizing its various Windows into a separate nib using 
\f2 NSWindowController
\f1 ,\
- Obtaining file system icons using 
\f2 NSWorkspace
\f1 ,\
- 
\f2 NSplitView
\f1  sub-pane size management during divider resize,\
- Using template images in our buttons such as 
\f2 \CocoaLigature0 NSImageNameAddTemplate
\f1  and 
\f2 NSImageNameRemoveTemplate
\f1 ,\CocoaLigature1 \
- 
\f2 NSWindow
\f1  edge alteration using
\f2  [NSWindow \CocoaLigature0 setContentBorderThickness]
\f1 \CocoaLigature1 \

\cf0 The supplied Xcode project was created using Xcode v3.0 running under Mac OS X 10.5.x or later. The project will create a Universal Binary.\

\f0\b \cf0 Using the Sample
\f1\b0 \
Simply build and run the sample using Xcode, launch SourceView and examine the contents in the outline view.\
The first section "Devices" is automatically added with the help of: 
\f2 \CocoaLigature0 [[NSWorkspace sharedWorkspace] mountedLocalVolumePaths]
\f1 \CocoaLigature1 . The second section "Places" is also automatically added by the window controller.\
\
The sections following are determined by the external 
\f2 Outline.dict
\f1  file, read in as a NSDictionary and populated into the 
\f2 NSOutlineView
\f1 .  You can experiment on your own with adding and removing items in this file.\
