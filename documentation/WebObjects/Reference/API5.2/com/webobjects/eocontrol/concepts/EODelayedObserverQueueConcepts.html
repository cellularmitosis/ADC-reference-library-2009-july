  <h3>Enqueuing a Delayed Observer</h3><P>
  The enqueueObserver method records an EODelayedObserver for later change
  notification. However, enqueuing is usually performed automatically by an
  EODelayedObserver in its objectWillChange method. Hence, it's typically
  enough that an object being observed invoke willChange as needed. For
  example, in Java Client and Application Kit applications, an
  EODisplayGroup (EOInterface) does this (among many other things) on
  receiving an ObjectsChangedInEditingContextNotification from its
  EOEditingContext.<P>
  Although individual EODelayedObserverQueues can be created, single
  instance provided by the static method defaultObserverQueue can be used.
  Using separate queues bypasses the prioritization mechanism, which may
  cause problems between the objects using the separate queues. By using
  separate queues, EODelayedObserver subclasses should record a
  designated EODelayedObserverQueue which is always used, and
  observerQueue is implemented to return that object
  To remove an enqueued observer, dequeueObserver method can be used.
  EODelayedObserver also defines the discardPendingNotification method,
  which removes the receiver from its designated queue.<P>
  <h3>Change Notification</h3><P>
  The actual process of change notification is initiated by the
  enqueueObserver messages that line observers up to receive notifications.
  Regardless of how many times enqueueObserver is invoked for a particular
  observer, that observer is only put in the queue once. The first observer
  enqueued during the run loop also sets up the EODelayedObserverQueue to
  receive a message at the end of the run loop. EODelayedObserver sets up
  this delayed invocation in NSRunLoop.DefaultRunLoopMode, but this mode can
  be changed or additional modes can be added in which delayed invocation
  occurs.<P>
  notifyObserversUpToPriority cycles through the queue of EODelayedObservers
  in priority order, from ObserverPriorityFirst to the priority given,
  sending each observer a subjectChanged message. Each time, it returns to
  the earliest priority (rather than continuing through the queue) in case
  the message resulted in another EODelayedObserver with a earlier priority
  being enqueued. This guarantees an optimal delivery of
  change notifications.<P>
  <h3>Observer Proxies</h3><P>
  It may not always be possible for a custom observer class to inherit from
  EODelayedObserver. To aid such objects in participating in delayed change
  notifications, the Framework defines a subclass of EODelayedObserver,
  EOObserverProxy, which implements its subjectChanged method to invoke an
  action method of custom object. An EOObserverProxy can be created,
  providing the "real" observer, the action method to invoke, and the
  priority at which the EOObserverProxy should be enqueued. Then, instead of
  registering the custom object as an observer of objects, the proxy can be
  registered(using EOObserverCenter's addObserver). When the proxy receives an
  objectWillChange message, it enqueues itself for delayed change notification,
  receives the subjectChanged message from the EODelayedObserverQueue, and then
  sends the action message to the "real" observer.
