In QuickTime, a structure of time-based data is called a<B CLASS="bold"> movie.</B> With QuickTime, applications can create, display, edit, copy, and compress movies and movie data in most of the same ways that they currently manipulate text and still-image graphics.</LI><LI CLASS="B1.Bullet1"><A NAME="pgfId=45986"> </A><B CLASS="bold">What kind of data does QuickTime handle?<BR></B><A NAME="marker=45985"> </A>Besides processing video data, QuickTime can handle still images, animated images (sprites), vector graphics, multiple sound channels, MIDI music, 3D objects, virtual reality panoramas and objects, and even text. It can add a wide range of media-rich features to any application.</LI><LI CLASS="B1.Bullet1"><A NAME="pgfId=45988"> </A><B CLASS="bold">Which platforms support QuickTime?<BR></B><A NAME="marker=45987"> </A>QuickTime is a fully cross-platform technology for the MacOS, Windows95/98, and WindowsNT. Although Mac&nbsp;OS and Windows 95/98/NT applications are structured differently, their interfaces to QuickTime are virtually identical. Anything QuickTime can do on one platform it can do on the other. On the MacOS platform, QuickTime is implemented as a set of system extensions that run under System 7.0 or later. On the Windows platform it is implemented as a dynamic-link library (DLL).</LI><LI CLASS="B1.Bullet1"><A NAME="pgfId=45990"> </A><B CLASS="bold">How do users obtain the System Software?<BR></B><A NAME="marker=45989"> </A>Apple distributes the QuickTime system software on the Internet, free of charge, in separate versions for the MacOS and Windows. Apple and other manufacturers also ship QuickTime in new computers as built-in software. Finally, software developers can license QuickTime from Apple and include it with their products.</LI><LI CLASS="B1.Bullet1"><A NAME="pgfId=45992"> </A><B CLASS="bold">What data formats does QuickTime use?<BR></B><A NAME="marker=45991"> </A>QuickTime imports and exports data in more than 70 formats, including most common multimedia and compression standards. As future versions of the QuickTime system software add support for new formats, QuickTime applications created today will access and work with the new formats automatically.</LI><LI CLASS="B1.Bullet1"><A NAME="pgfId=45994"> </A><B CLASS="bold">What is the QuickTime API like?<BR></B><A NAME="marker=45993"> </A>Applications access QuickTime's features through a set of about 1200 system-level functions and associated data structures. However, you don't need to understand the whole QuickTime API; this book provides you with a road map to the specific calls you need for each programming task. Besides implementing most standard multimedia effects, the QuickTime API also lets you create custom software components to perform new actions. </LI></UL><hr>&#169; 1997 Apple Computer, Inc.<!-- QTnavbar start --><P><I>QuickTime API Documentation</I><P><A target="doc" HREF="xxIntroductions.2.htm">Previous</A> | <A target="doc" HREF="xxIntroductions.2.htm">Chapter Top</A> | <A target="doc" HREF="xxIntroductions.1.htm">Chapter Contents</A> | <A target="doc" HREF="xxIntroductions.4.htm">Next</A> | <!-- QTnavbar end --><!-- start of footer --><!--#include virtual="/includes/framesetfooter" --><!-- end of footer --></BODY></HTML>
