ð QuickDraw 3D Ð BoxTexThis sample snippet shows how to do basic texture mapping of an obect, such as a box.    Note that QuickDraw 3D's box object comes parameterized, so if you are texture mapping a mesh or trigrid, you need to supply parameterizations (in this instance you'd need to supply UV parameterizations, to tell the texture shader where to place the texture map).Nick ThompsonDeveloper SupportAppleLink: NICKT
