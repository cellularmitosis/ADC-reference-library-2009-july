The executable files forthe adaptors are placed in the <code>/System/Library/WebObjects/Adaptors</code> directory.</p><p>The source files for the adaptors are placed in the <tt>/Developer/Examples/WebObjects/Source/Adaptors</tt> directory.Also included are HTML files containing instructions for buildingand installing each adaptor. The code of the adaptors is open source,so you can install them anywhere.</p><br><a name = "TPXREF107"></a><h3><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Deployment Files</font></h3><p>These files are divided into two groups:<ul><li><b>Runtimeenvironment</b> The runtime environment of WebObjects isimplemented in <b>framework</b> (<code>.framework</code>)files, whose purpose is similar to dynamically linked library (DLL)files in Windows. Framework files are installed in the <tt>/System/Library/Frameworks</tt> directory.These frameworks are used by any WebObjects application, includingthe deployment tools of WebObjects</font></li><li><b>Deployment tools</b> WebObjects Deploymentincludes two deployment tools you use to configure and monitor yoursite. The files that make up these tools are placed in the <tt>/System/Library/WebObjects/JavaApplications</tt> directory.  <a href="#BCIIHBBD">Table 3-1</a> showsthe purpose of each tool.
