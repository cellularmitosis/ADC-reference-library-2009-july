	/* The StrongBox class adds a new property to the Bucket and it is
	also a container for a list of buckets.
	
	Two points of interest in this class are the weight and value
	accessor methods that we use to implement the weight and value
	AppleScript properties.  These accessors implement read only
	properties and they return a calculated result reflecting the sum
	total of the weights of all of the items contained in the strong box.
	
	We take care of most of the 'infrastructure' type operations
	needed for scripting in the Element class (the superclass of the
	Trinket class), so all we have to worry about here is storage management
	and providing accessors for the properties.*/
@interface StrongBox : Bucket {
	NSString *label;
	NSMutableArray *theBuckets;
}

	/* storage management */
-(id) init;
- (void) dealloc;

	/* kvc method for the 'weight' AppleScript property.  Note that here we
	are providing a specialization of the weight method provided by the Bucket
	class.  We do this because when calculating the weight of all of the objects
	in the strong box, we want to include the total weight of all of the buckets
	it contains, so we perform that extra calculation in this specialization.
	
	Also note, 'weight' is a declared as a read only property in our scripting
	definition file so we have not defined a 'setWeight:' method here.  */
- (NSNumber *)weight;

	/* kvc method for the 'value' AppleScript property.  Here we are also
	providing a specialization of the weight method provided by the Bucket class
	for exactly the same reasons: to factor in the value of all of the buckets
	contained in the strong box.  And, as with the 'weight' property, 'value' is
	a declared as a read only property in our scripting definition file so
	we have not defined a 'setValue:' method here. */
- (NSNumber *)value;


	/* kvc methods for the 'label' AppleScript property */
- (NSString *)label;
- (void)setLabel:(NSString *)value;


	/* kvc methods for the 'buckets' AppleScript element.  Here we implement the methods
	necessary for maintaining the list of buckets inside of a StrongBox.  Note the names.
	I our scripting definition file we specified that the 'strong box' class contains an
	element of type 'bucket', like so:
		<element type="bucket"/>
	Cocoa will use the plural form of the class name when naming the property used by
	AppleScript to access the list of buckets, and we should use the property name
	when naming our methods.  So, using the property name, we name our methods as follows:
		- (NSArray*) buckets;
		-(void) insertInBuckets:(id) bucket;
		-(void) insertInBuckets:(id) bucket atIndex:(unsigned)index;
		-(void) removeFromBucketsAtIndex:(unsigned)index;
			
	*/
	
	/* return the entire list of buckets */
- (NSArray*) buckets;

	/* insert a bucket at the beginning of the list */
-(void) insertInBuckets:(id) bucket;

	/* insert a bucket at some position in the list */
-(void) insertInBuckets:(id) bucket atIndex:(unsigned)index;

	/* remove a bucket from the list */
-(void) removeFromBucketsAtIndex:(unsigned)index;



/*
Note that if we had wanted to use a different name in our Objective-C code as our
property accessor, say, 'bucketsInStrongBox', then we would have specified that
in our scripting definition file with an element declaration such as:
		<element type="bucket">
			<cocoa key="bucketsInStrongBox"/>
		</element>
and then we would have named our methods for maintaining the list of buckets like so:
	- (NSArray*) bucketsInStrongBox;
	-(void) insertInBucketsInStrongBox:(id) bucket;
	-(void) insertInBucketsInStrongBox:(id) bucket atIndex:(unsigned)index;
	-(void) removeFromBucketsInStrongBoxAtIndex:(unsigned)index;
