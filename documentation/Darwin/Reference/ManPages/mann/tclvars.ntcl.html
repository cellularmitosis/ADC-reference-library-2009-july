tclvars(n)                                  Tcl Built-In Commands                                 tclvars(n)

<b>NAME</b>
       tclvars - Variables used by Tcl
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________


<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  following  global  variables  are  created and managed automatically by the Tcl library.  Except
       where noted below, these variables should normally be treated as  read-only  by  application-specific
       code and by users.

       <b>env</b>    This  variable  is  maintained by Tcl as an array whose elements are the environment variables
              for the process.  Reading an element will return the value of  the  corresponding  environment
              variable.   Setting an element of the array will modify the corresponding environment variable
              or create a new one if it doesn't already exist.  Unsetting an element of <b>env</b> will remove  the
              corresponding  environment  variable.   Changes  to  the <b>env</b> array will affect the environment
              passed to children by commands like <b>exec</b>.  If the entire <b>env</b> array is unset then Tcl will stop
              monitoring <b>env</b> accesses and will not update environment variables.
              Under  Windows, the environment variables PATH and COMSPEC in any capitalization are converted |
              automatically to upper case.  For instance, the PATH variable could be exported by the operat- |
              ing system as ``path'', ``Path'', ``PaTh'', etc., causing otherwise simple Tcl code to have to |
              support many special cases.  All other environment variables inherited by Tcl are left unmodi- |
              fied.   Setting  an  env  array  variable  to blank is the same as unsetting it as this is the |
              behavior of the underlying Windows OS.  It should be noted that relying  on  an  existing  and |
              empty  environment variable won't work on windows and is discouraged for cross-platform usage.
              On the Macintosh, the environment variable is constructed by  Tcl  as  no  global  environment
              variable exists.  The environment variables that are created for Tcl include:

              <b>LOGIN</b>  This holds the Chooser name of the Macintosh.

              <b>USER</b>   This also holds the Chooser name of the Macintosh.

              <b>SYS_FOLDER</b>
                     The path to the system directory.

              <b>APPLE_M_FOLDER</b>
                     The path to the Apple Menu directory.

              <b>CP_FOLDER</b>
                     The path to the control panels directory.

              <b>DESK_FOLDER</b>
                     The path to the desk top directory.

              <b>EXT_FOLDER</b>
                     The path to the system extensions directory.

              <b>PREF_FOLDER</b>
                     The path to the preferences directory.

              <b>PRINT_MON_FOLDER</b>
                     The path to the print monitor directory.

              <b>SHARED_TRASH_FOLDER</b>
                     The path to the network trash directory.

              <b>TRASH_FOLDER</b>
                     The path to the trash directory.

              <b>START_UP_FOLDER</b>
                     The path to the start up directory.

              <b>HOME</b>   The path to the application's default directory.

              You can also create your own environment variables for the Macintosh.  A file named  <u>Tcl</u> <u>Envi</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ronment&nbsp;Environment</font>
              <u>ronment</u> <u>Variables</u> may be placed in the preferences folder in the Mac system folder.  Each line
              of this file should be of the form <u>VAR</u><b>_</b><u>NAME=var</u><b>_</b><u>data</u>.

              The last alternative is to place environment variables in a 'STR#' resource named <u>Tcl</u> <u>Environ</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment&nbsp;Environment</font>
              <u>ment</u> <u>Variables</u> of the application.  This is considered a little more ``Mac like'' than a  Unix
              style  Environment  Variable  file.   Each entry in the 'STR#' resource has the same format as
              above.  The source code file <u>tclMacEnv.c</u> contains the implementation of  the  env  mechanisms.
              This  file  contains many #define's that allow customization of the env mechanisms to fit your
              applications needs.

       <b>errorCode</b>
              After an error has occurred, this variable will be set to hold  additional  information  about
              the  error  in a form that is easy to process with programs.  <b>errorCode</b> consists of a Tcl list
              with one or more elements.  The first element of  the  list  identifies  a  general  class  of
              errors,  and  determines the format of the rest of the list.  The following formats for <b>error</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">Code&nbsp;errorCode</font>
              <b>Code</b> are used by the Tcl core; individual applications may define additional formats.

              <b>ARITH</b> <u>code</u> <u>msg</u>
                     This format is used when an arithmetic error occurs (e.g. an attempt to divide by  zero
                     in the <b>expr</b> command).  <u>Code</u> identifies the precise error and <u>msg</u> provides a human-read-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able&nbsp;human-readable</font>
                     able description of the error.  <u>Code</u> will be either DIVZERO (for an attempt  to  divide
                     by  zero),  DOMAIN  (if  an  argument  is  outside  the  domain  of a function, such as
                     acos(-3)), IOVERFLOW (for integer overflow), OVERFLOW (for a floating-point  overflow),
                     or UNKNOWN (if the cause of the error cannot be determined).

              <b>CHILDKILLED</b> <u>pid</u> <u>sigName</u> <u>msg</u>
                     This format is used when a child process has been killed because of a signal.  The sec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ond&nbsp;second</font>
                     ond element of <b>errorCode</b> will be the process's identifier (in decimal).  The third ele-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment&nbsp;element</font>
                     ment  will  be the symbolic name of the signal that caused the process to terminate; it
                     will be one of the names from the include file signal.h, such as <b>SIGPIPE</b>.   The  fourth
                     element  will  be a short human-readable message describing the signal, such as ``write
                     on pipe with no readers'' for <b>SIGPIPE</b>.

              <b>CHILDSTATUS</b> <u>pid</u> <u>code</u>
                     This format is used when a child process has exited with a non-zero exit  status.   The
                     second element of <b>errorCode</b> will be the process's identifier (in decimal) and the third
                     element will be the exit code returned by the process (also in decimal).

              <b>CHILDSUSP</b> <u>pid</u> <u>sigName</u> <u>msg</u>
                     This format is used when a child process has been suspended because of a  signal.   The
                     second  element  of  <b>errorCode</b> will be the process's identifier, in decimal.  The third
                     element will be the symbolic name of the signal that caused  the  process  to  suspend;
                     this  will  be  one  of the names from the include file signal.h, such as <b>SIGTTIN</b>.  The
                     fourth element will be a short human-readable message describing the  signal,  such  as
                     ``background tty read'' for <b>SIGTTIN</b>.

              <b>NONE</b>   This  format  is  used  for  errors where no additional information is available for an
                     error besides the message returned with the error.  In these cases <b>errorCode</b> will  con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sist&nbsp;consist</font>
                     sist of a list containing a single element whose contents are <b>NONE</b>.

              <b>POSIX</b> <u>errName</u> <u>msg</u>
                     If the first element of <b>errorCode</b> is <b>POSIX</b>, then the error occurred during a POSIX ker-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nel&nbsp;kernel</font>
                     nel call.  The second element of the list will contain the symbolic name of  the  error
                     that  occurred,  such  as <b>ENOENT</b>; this will be one of the values defined in the include
                     file errno.h.  The third element of the list will be a  human-readable  message  corre-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sponding&nbsp;corresponding</font>
                     sponding to <u>errName</u>, such as ``no such file or directory'' for the <b>ENOENT</b> case.

              To  set  <b>errorCode</b>,  applications  should  use library procedures such as <b>Tcl_SetErrorCode</b> and
              <b>Tcl_PosixError</b>, or they may invoke the <b>error</b> command.  If one of  these  methods  hasn't  been
              used, then the Tcl interpreter will reset the variable to <b>NONE</b> after the next error.

       <b>errorInfo</b>
              After  an  error  has occurred, this string will contain one or more lines identifying the Tcl
              commands and procedures that were being executed when the most  recent  error  occurred.   Its
              contents  take the form of a stack trace showing the various nested Tcl commands that had been
              invoked at the time of the error.

       <b>tcl_library</b>
              This variable holds the name of a directory containing the system library of Tcl scripts, such
              as  those  used  for auto-loading.  The value of this variable is returned by the <b>info</b> <b>library</b>
              command.  See the <b>library</b> manual entry for details of  the  facilities  provided  by  the  Tcl
              script  library.   Normally each application or package will have its own application-specific
              script library in addition to the Tcl script library; each application  should  set  a  global
              variable  with a name like <b>$</b><u>app</u><b>_library</b> (where <u>app</u> is the application's name) to hold the net-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">work&nbsp;network</font>
              work file name for that application's library directory.  The initial value of <b>tcl_library</b>  is
              set  when  an  interpreter  is created by searching several different directories until one is
              found that contains an appropriate Tcl startup script.  If the <b>TCL_LIBRARY</b>  environment  vari-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able&nbsp;variable</font>
              able  exists,  then  the  directory  it  names  is checked first.  If <b>TCL_LIBRARY</b> isn't set or
              doesn't refer to an appropriate directory, then Tcl checks several other directories based  on
              a compiled-in default location, the location of the binary containing the application, and the
              current working directory.

       <b>tcl_patchLevel</b>
              When an interpreter is created Tcl initializes this variable to hold a string giving the  cur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rent&nbsp;current</font>
              rent  patch  level  for Tcl, such as <b>7.3p2</b> for Tcl 7.3 with the first two official patches, or
              <b>7.4b4</b> for the fourth beta release of Tcl 7.4.  The value of this variable is returned  by  the
              <b>info</b> <b>patchlevel</b> command.

       <b>tcl_pkg-</b>                                                                                              |
       <b>Path</b>                                                                                           |      |
              This variable holds a list of directories indicating where packages  are  normally  installed. |
              It  is  not  used on Windows.  It typically contains either one or two entries; if it contains |
              two entries, the first is normally a directory for platform-dependent packages  (e.g.,  shared |
              library  binaries)  and  the  second is normally a directory for platform-independent packages |
              (e.g., script files). Typically a package is installed as a subdirectory of one of the entries |
              in  <b>$tcl_pkgPath</b>.  The  directories  in  <b>$tcl_pkgPath</b> are included by default in the <b>auto_path</b> |
              variable, so they and their immediate subdirectories are automatically searched  for  packages |
              during  <b>package</b>  <b>require</b>  commands.   Note:  <b>tcl_pkgPath</b> it not intended to be modified by the |
              application.  Its value is added to <b>auto_path</b> at  startup;  changes  to  <b>tcl_pkgPath</b>  are  not |
              reflected  in  <b>auto_path</b>.   If  you want Tcl to search additional directories for packages you |
              should add the names of those directories to <b>auto_path</b>, not <b>tcl_pkgPath</b>.

       <b>tcl_platform</b>
              This is an associative array whose elements contain information about the  platform  on  which
              the application is running, such as the name of the operating system, its current release num-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ber,&nbsp;number,</font>
              ber, and the machine's instruction set.  The elements listed below will always be defined, but
              they  may  have empty strings as values if Tcl couldn't retrieve any relevant information.  In
              addition, extensions and applications may add additional values to the array.  The  predefined
              elements are:


              <b>byte-</b>                                                                                          |
              <b>Order</b>                                                                                      |   |
                     The native byte order of this machine: either <b>littleEndian</b> or <b>bigEndian</b>.

              <b>debug</b>  If this variable exists, then the  interpreter  was  compiled  with  debugging  symbols
                     enabled.   This  variable  will  only exist on Windows so extension writers can specify
                     which package to load depending on the C run-time library that is loaded.

              <b>machine</b>
                     The instruction set executed by this machine, such as <b>intel</b>, <b>PPC</b>, <b>68k</b>,  or  <b>sun4m</b>.   On
                     UNIX machines, this is the value returned by <b>uname</b> <b>-m</b>.

              <b>os</b>     The  name  of the operating system running on this machine, such as <b>Windows</b> <b>95</b>, <b>Windows</b>
                     <b>NT</b>, <b>MacOS</b>, or <b>SunOS</b>.  On UNIX machines, this is the value returned  by  <b>uname</b>  <b>-s</b>.   On
                     Windows  95  and  Windows  98,  the value returned will be <b>Windows</b> <b>95</b> to provide better
                     backwards compatibility to Windows 95; to distinguish between the two, check the <b>osVer</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion.&nbsp;osVersion.</font>
                     <b>sion</b>.

              <b>osVersion</b>
                     The version number for the operating system running on this machine.  On UNIX machines,
                     this is the value returned by <b>uname</b> <b>-r</b>.  On Windows 95, the version  will  be  4.0;  on
                     Windows 98, the version will be 4.10.

              <b>platform</b>
                     Either  <b>windows</b>, <b>macintosh</b>, or <b>unix</b>.  This identifies the general operating environment
                     of the machine.

              <b>threaded</b>
                     If this variable exists, then the interpreter was compiled with threads enabled.

              <b>user</b>   This identifies the current user based on the login information available on the  plat-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">form.&nbsp;platform.</font>
                     form.   This comes from the USER or LOGNAME environment variable on Unix, and the value

              <b>wordSize</b>
                     This gives the size of the native-machine word in bytes (strictly, it is  same  as  the |
                     result of evaluating <u>sizeof(long)</u> in C.)

       <b>tcl_precision</b>
              This  variable controls the number of digits to generate when converting floating-point values |
              to strings.  It defaults to 12.  17 digits is ``perfect'' for IEEE floating-point in  that  it |
              allows  double-precision  values to be converted to strings and back to binary with no loss of |
              information.  However, using 17 digits prevents any  rounding,  which  produces  longer,  less |
              intuitive results.  For example, <b>expr</b> <b>1.4</b> returns 1.3999999999999999 with <b>tcl_precision</b> set to |
              17, vs. 1.4 if <b>tcl_precision</b> is 12.                                                            |
              All interpreters in a process share a single <b>tcl_precision</b> value: changing it  in  one  inter- |
              preter will affect all other interpreters as well.  However, safe interpreters are not allowed |
              to modify the variable.                                                                        |

       <b>tcl_rcFileName</b>
              This variable is used during initialization to indicate the name of  a  user-specific  startup
              file.   If  it  is  set by application-specific initialization, then the Tcl startup code will
              check for the existence of this file and <b>source</b> it if it exists.  For example,  for  <b>wish</b>  the
              variable is set to <b>~/.wishrc</b> for Unix and <b>~/wishrc.tcl</b> for Windows.

       <b>tcl_rcRsrcName</b>
              This  variable  is only used on Macintosh systems.  The variable is used during initialization
              to indicate the name of a user-specific <b>TEXT</b> resource located in the application or  extension
              resource  forks.   If  it  is set by application-specific initialization, then the Tcl startup
              code will check for the existence of this resource and <b>source</b> it if it exists.   For  example,
              the Macintosh <b>wish</b> application has the variable is set to <b>tclshrc</b>.

       <b>tcl_traceCompile</b>
              The  value  of  this  variable can be set to control how much tracing information is displayed
              during bytecode compilation.  By default, tcl_traceCompile is zero and no information is  dis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">played.&nbsp;displayed.</font>
              played.   Setting tcl_traceCompile to 1 generates a one line summary in stdout whenever a pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cedure&nbsp;procedure</font>
              cedure or top level command is compiled.  Setting it to 2 generates a detailed listing in std-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">out&nbsp;stdout</font>
              out of the bytecode instructions emitted during every compilation.  This variable is useful in
              tracking down suspected problems with the Tcl compiler.  It is also occasionally  useful  when
              converting existing code to use Tcl8.0.

              This  variable and functionality only exist if TCL_COMPILE_DEBUG was defined during Tcl's com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pilation.&nbsp;compilation.</font>
              pilation.

       <b>tcl_traceExec</b>
              The value of this variable can be set to control how much  tracing  information  is  displayed
              during bytecode execution.  By default, tcl_traceExec is zero and no information is displayed.
              Setting tcl_traceExec to 1 generates a one line trace in stdout on each call to a  Tcl  proce-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dure.&nbsp;procedure.</font>
              dure.   Setting  it  to  2 generates a line of output whenever any Tcl command is invoked that
              contains the name of the command and its arguments.  Setting it to 3 produces a detailed trace
              showing  the result of executing each bytecode instruction.  Note that when tcl_traceExec is 2
              or 3, commands such as set and incr that have been entirely replaced by a sequence of bytecode
              instructions  are not shown.  Setting this variable is useful in tracking down suspected prob-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lems&nbsp;problems</font>
              lems with the bytecode compiler and interpreter.  It is also occasionally useful when convert-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;converting</font>
              ing code to use Tcl8.0.

              This  variable and functionality only exist if TCL_COMPILE_DEBUG was defined during Tcl's com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pilation.&nbsp;compilation.</font>
              pilation.

       <b>tcl_wordchars</b>
              The value of this variable is a regular expression that can be set to control what are consid-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ered&nbsp;considered</font>
              ered  ``word''  characters,  for instances like selecting a word by double-clicking in text in
              Tk.  It is platform dependent.  On Windows, it defaults to <b>\S</b>, meaning anything but a  Unicode
              space  character.   Otherwise  it defaults to <b>\w</b>, which is any Unicode word character (number,
              letter, or underscore).

       <b>tcl_nonwordchars</b>
              The value of this variable is a regular expression that can be set to control what are consid-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ered&nbsp;considered</font>
              ered  ``non-word''  characters, for instances like selecting a word by double-clicking in text
              in Tk.  It is platform dependent.  On Windows, it defaults to <b>\s</b>, meaning  any  Unicode  space
              character.   Otherwise it defaults to <b>\W</b>, which is anything but a Unicode word character (num-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ber,&nbsp;(number,</font>
              ber, letter, or underscore).

       <b>tcl_version</b>
              When an interpreter is created Tcl initializes this variable to hold the  version  number  for
              this  version  of  Tcl  in  the  form <u>x.y</u>.  Changes to <u>x</u> represent major changes with probable
              incompatibilities and changes to <u>y</u> represent small enhancements  and  bug  fixes  that  retain
              backward  compatibility.   The  value of this variable is returned by the <b>info</b> <b>tclversion</b> com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand.&nbsp;command.</font>
              mand.
