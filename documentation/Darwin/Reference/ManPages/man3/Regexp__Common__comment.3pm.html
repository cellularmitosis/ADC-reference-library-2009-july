<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       Please consult the manual of Regexp::Common for a general description of the works of this interface.

       Do not use this module directly, but load it via <u>Regexp::Common</u>.

       This modules gives you regular expressions for comments in various languages.

       <b>THE</b> <b>LANGUAGES</b>

       Below, the comments of each of the languages are described.  The patterns are available as
       $RE{comment}{LANG}, foreach language <u>LANG</u>. Some languages have variants; it's described at the
       individual languages how to get the patterns for the variants.  Unless mentioned otherwise, "{-keep}"
       sets $1, $2, $3 and $4 to the entire comment, the opening marker, the content of the comment, and the
       closing marker (for many languages, the latter is a newline) respectively.

       ABC Comments in <u>ABC</u> start with a backslash ("\"), and last till the end of the line.  See
           &lt;<a href="http://homepages.cwi.nl/%7Esteven/abc/">http://homepages.cwi.nl/%7Esteven/abc/</a>.

       Ada Comments in <u>Ada</u> start with "--", and last till the end of the line.

       Advisor
           <u>Advisor</u> is a language used by the HP product <u>glance</u>. Comments for this language start with either
           "#" or "//", and last till the end of the line.

       Algol 68
           In <u>Algol</u> <u>68</u>, comments are either delimited by "#", or by one of the keywords "co" or "comment".
           The keywords should not be part of another word. See
           &lt;<a href="http://westein.arb-phys.uni-dortmund.de/~wb/a68s.txt">http://westein.arb-phys.uni-dortmund.de/~wb/a68s.txt</a>.  With "{-keep}", only $1 will be set,

           comments (although the compiler might mock at you if you score less than 5 points).  Regardless
           whether "{-keep}", $1 will be set, and set to the entire comment. This pattern requires <u>perl</u>
           <u>5.8.0</u> or newer.

       COBOL
           Traditionally, comments in <u>COBOL</u> are indicated by an asteriks in the seventh column. This is what
           the pattern matches. Modern compiler may more lenient though. See
           &lt;<a href="http://www.csis.ul.ie/cobol/Course/COBOLIntro.htm">http://www.csis.ul.ie/cobol/Course/COBOLIntro.htm</a>, and

       Haskell
           There are two types of comments in <u>Haskell</u>. They either start with at least two dashes, or are
           nested comments, delimited with "{-" and "-}".  Under "{-keep}", only $1 will be set, returning
           the entire comment.  This pattern requires <u>perl</u> <u>5.6.0</u> or newer.

       HTML
           In <u>HTML</u>, comments only appear inside a <u>comment</u> <u>declaration</u>.  A comment declaration starts with a
           "&lt;!", and ends with a "&gt;". Inside this declaration, we have zero or more comments.  Comments
           starts with "--" and end with "--", and are optionally followed by whitespace. The pattern
           $RE{comment}{HTML} recognizes those comment declarations (and hence more than a comment).  Note
           that this is not the same as something that starts with "&lt;!--" and ends with "--&gt;", because the
           following will be matched completely:

               &lt;!--  First  Comment   --
                 --&gt; Second Comment &lt;!--
                 --  Third  Comment   --&gt;

           Do not be fooled by what your favourite browser thinks is an HTML comment.

           If "{-keep}" is used, the following are returned:

           $1  captures the entire comment declaration.

           $2  captures the MDO (markup declaration open), "&lt;!".

           $3  captures the content between the MDO and the MDC.

           $4  captures the (last) comment, without the surrounding dashes.

           $5  captures the MDC (markup declaration close), "&gt;".

       Hugo
           There are two types of comments in <u>Hugo</u>. They either start with "!" (which cannot be followed by
           a "\"), or are nested comments, delimited with "!\" and "\!".  Under "{-keep}", only $1 will be
           set, returning the entire comment.  This pattern requires <u>perl</u> <u>5.6.0</u> or newer.

       Icon
           <u>Icon</u> has comments that start with "#" and end at the next new line.  See

       INTERCAL
           Comments in INTERCAL are single line comments. They start with one of the keywords "NOT" or
           "N'T", and can optionally be preceeded by the keywords "DO" and "PLEASE". If both keywords are
           used, "PLEASE" preceeds "DO". Keywords are separated by whitespace.

       J   The language <u>J</u> uses comments that start with "NB.", and that last till the end of the line. See
           &lt;<a href="http://www.jsoftware.com/books/help/primer/contents.htm">http://www.jsoftware.com/books/help/primer/contents.htm</a>, and &lt;<a href="http://www.jsoftware.com/">http://www.jsoftware.com/</a>.

           &lt;<a href="http://www.lua.org/manual/manual.html">http://www.lua.org/manual/manual.html</a>.

       M, MUMPS
           In "M" (aka "MUMPS"), comments start with a semi-colon, and last till the end of a line. The
           language specification requires the semi-colon to be preceeded by one or more <u>linestart</u>
           <u>character</u>s.  Those characters default to a space, but that's configurable. This requirement, of
           preceeding the comment with linestart characters is <b>not</b> tested for. See
           &lt;<a href="ftp://ftp.intersys.com/pub/openm/ism/ism64docs.zip">ftp://ftp.intersys.com/pub/openm/ism/ism64docs.zip</a>,

       mutt
           Configuration files for <u>mutt</u> have comments starting with a "#" and lasting the rest of the line.

       Nickle
           The <u>Nickle</u> language has one line comments starting with "#" (like Perl), or multiline comments
           delimited by "/*" and "*/" (like C). Under "-keep", only $1 will be set. See also
           &lt;<a href="http://www.nickle.org">http://www.nickle.org</a>.

       Oberon
           Comments in <u>Oberon</u> start with "(*" and end with "*)".  See
           &lt;<a href="http://www.oberon.ethz.ch/oreport.html">http://www.oberon.ethz.ch/oreport.html</a>.

       Pascal
           There are many implementations of Pascal. This modules provides pattern for comments of several
           implementations.

           $RE{comment}{Pascal}
               This is the pattern that recognizes comments according to the Pascal ISO standard. This
               standard says that comments start with either "{", or "(*", and end with "}" or "*)". This
               means that "{*)" and "(*}" are considered to be comments. Many Pascal applications don't
               allow this.  See &lt;<a href="http://www.pascal-central.com/docs/iso10206.txt">http://www.pascal-central.com/docs/iso10206.txt</a>

           $RE{comment}{Alice}
               The <u>Alice</u> <u>Pascal</u> compiler accepts comments that start with "{" and end with "}". Comments are
               not allowed to contain newlines.  See &lt;<a href="http://www.templetons.com/brad/alice/language/">http://www.templetons.com/brad/alice/language/</a>.

           $RE{comment}{Pascal}{Delphi}, $RE{comment}{Pascal}{Free} and $RE{comment}{Pascal}{GPC}
               The <u>Delphi</u> <u>Pascal</u>, <u>Free</u> <u>Pascal</u> and the <u>Gnu</u> <u>Pascal</u> <u>Compiler</u> implementations of Pascal all have
               comments that either start with "//" and last till the end of the line, are delimited with
               "{" and "}" or are delimited with "(*" and "*)". Patterns for those comments are given by
               $RE{comment}{Pascal}{Delphi}, $RE{comment}{Pascal}{Free} and $RE{comment}{Pascal}{GPC}
               respectively. These patterns only set $1 when "{-keep}" is used, which will then include the
               entire comment.

               See &lt;<a href="http://info.borland.com/techpubs/delphi5/oplg/">http://info.borland.com/techpubs/delphi5/oplg/</a>,

           $RE{comment}{Pascal}{Workshop}
               The <u>Workshop</u> <u>Pascal</u> compiler, from SUN Microsystems, allows comments that are delimited with
               either "{" and "}", delimited with "(*)" and "*"), delimited with "/*", and "*/", or starting
               and ending with a double quote ("""). When "{-keep}" is used, only $1 is set, and returns the
               entire comment.

               See &lt;<a href="http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/802-5762">http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/802-5762</a>.

       PEARL
           Comments in <u>PEARL</u> start with a "!" and last till the end of the line, or start with "/*" and end
           with "*/". With "{-keep}", $1 will be set to the entire comment.

       PHP Comments in <u>PHP</u> start with either "#" or "//" and last till the end of the line, or are delimited
           by "/*" and "*/". With "{-keep}", $1 will be set to the entire comment.

       PL/B
           In <u>PL/B</u>, comments start with either "." or ";", and end with the next newline. See
           &lt;<a href="http://www.mmcctech.com/pl-b/plb-0010.htm">http://www.mmcctech.com/pl-b/plb-0010.htm</a>.

           &lt;<a href="http://www.questionmark.com/uk/qml/overview.doc">http://www.questionmark.com/uk/qml/overview.doc</a>.

       R   The statistical language <u>R</u> uses comments that start with a "#" and end with the following new
           line. See &lt;<a href="http://www.r-project.org/">http://www.r-project.org/</a>.

       SLIDE
           The <u>SLIDE</u> language has two froms of comments. First there is the line comment, which starts with
           a "#" and includes the rest of the line (just like Perl). Second, there is the multiline, nested
           comment, which are delimited by "(*" and "*)". Under C{-keep}&gt;, only $1 is set, and is set to the
           entire comment. This pattern needs at least Perl version 5.6.0. See
           &lt;<a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~ug/slide/docs/slide/spec/spec_frame_intro.shtml">http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~ug/slide/docs/slide/spec/spec_frame_intro.shtml</a>.

           (that's two dashes and a space) ending with the following newline, and comments starting with
           "/*", and ending with the next ";" or "*/" that isn't inside single or double quotes. A pattern
           for this is returned by $RE{comment}{SQL}{MySQL}. With "{-keep}", only $1 will be set, and it

        Revision 2.100  2003/01/21 23:19:40  abigail
        The whole world understands RCS/CVS version numbers, that 1.9 is an
        older version than 1.10. Except CPAN. Curse the <!-- a -->idiot(s)<!-- /a --> who think
        that version numbers are floats (in which universe do floats have
        more than one decimal dot?).
        Everything is bumped to version 2.100 because CPAN couldn't deal
        with the fact one file had version 1.10.

        - Created a 'nested' function (simplified version from
          Regexp::Common::balanced).
        - Comments that use 'from' to eol or balanced (nested) delimiters
          are now generated from a data array.

        Dylan and Haskell comments can be nested, hence version 5.6.0 of Perl
        is needed to be able to make a regex matching them.
