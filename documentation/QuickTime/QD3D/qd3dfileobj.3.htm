A draw context object receives the raw data needed to draw an image on a particular window system, and the associated view object is an abstraction in which you perform all drawing. Similarly, a storage object receives the raw data read from or written to a particular piece of storage, and the associated file object is an abstraction in which you perform all I/O operations. View objects maintain information about the current state of the drawing, and file objects maintain information about the current state of I/O operations. Just as you must perform all drawing in a rendering loop, between calls to <TT CLASS="cv">Q3View_StartRendering</TT> and <TT CLASS="cv">Q3View_EndRendering</TT>, you must perform all file writing in a <B CLASS="bold">writing loop,</B> between calls to <TT CLASS="cv">Q3View_StartWriting</TT> and <TT CLASS="cv">Q3View_EndWriting</TT>.
