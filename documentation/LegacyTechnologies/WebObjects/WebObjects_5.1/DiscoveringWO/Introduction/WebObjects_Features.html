Frequently, programmers reinvent thewheel to provide required features and capabilities to their applications,or invest a lot of work integrating partial solutions. WebObjects comeswith much of the logic needed by a Web application, and providesan infrastructure that enables developers to work both effectively <em>and</em> efficiently.</p><br><a name = "TPXREF102"></a><h3><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Database Access and Independence</font></h3><p>Almost any service beyond providing access to organized, staticdata relies on a database. Hence, it is very important to make databaseaccess powerful and efficient, both in use and implementation. WebObjectsrelies on the Enterprise Objects layer, which represents your databaseusing Java objects (enterprise objects) with custom behavior andvalidation rules. </p><p>Other solutions for database access rely on technology suchas embedding database access code, like SQL (Structured Query Language),within the Web pages themselves, which makes modifying the applicationmuch more difficult. </p><p>The Enterprise Object technology handles the dirty work ofdatabase access tasks, like caching, fetching, saving, and relationshipmodeling, allowing you to concentrate on the implementation of yourcustom business logic. It even constructs the basic Java code requiredfor your objects&#151;you modify this code to add specialized logic,appropriate to your application. By providing this level of objectabstraction, Enterprise Objects allows you to modify your databaseschema or even move to a totally different storage mechanism withoutany code modification.</p><br><a name = "TPXREF103"></a><h3><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Scalability</font></h3><p>WebObjects is scalable at several levels, from developmentto deployment.</p><p>At the development level, individual pages and componentscan be developed in a modular fashion and reused, because they areeach individual Java objects or WebObjects components. Further,a project can be easily broken into frameworks and products to facilitatecode sharing and multiple-developer organization.</p><p>The WebObjects system itself scales over a broad range ofuser load, without any developer intervention. When a new requestis made to your application, a new session is created, which encapsulatesthe activity and changes of a particular user. Caches are maintainedby the application as well as by each of its sessions (a sessionrepresents the activity of one user) to speed response generationand minimize database access. In addition, WebObjects automaticallycaches component definitions to minimize the need to read filesfrom disk. For more detail on session and state management see  <a sector="mod" href="../SessionStateMaintenance/iUsing_the_S_anage_State.html" target="_top">"Using the Session to Manage State"</a>.</p><p>At deployment, WebObjects offers a linear scaling mechanism.The simplest deployment system is one computer running a Web server,WebObjects, and a database server. As your needs increase, the databaseserver and Web server can be moved to other computers. Additionalinstances of your application can run in parallel and use the samedatabase transparently. If demand increases further, additionalapplication servers can be added using the same database and Webservers. WebObjects even automatically adds new application serversto its load balancing system to ensure the most efficient accesspossible. (See <i>Deploying WebObjects Applications</i> formore information on deployment.)</p><br><a name = "TPXREF104"></a><h3><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Object Orientation</font></h3><p>Experience has demonstrated that object orientation is a veryuseful paradigm for many development projects. WebObjects is designedon an object-oriented model, with every part of the system, fromcomponents to the process of generating pages itself, organized usingan object model. </p><p>As a developer, you gain many benefits from this model. Youcan customize the process of page generation by adding your logicto standard methods, which are invoked at determined stages. Thisis possible because all WebObjects components inherit from the WOComponentclass. A <b>component</b> is an object that encompassesthe look and behavior of a Web page, or a portion of one. </p><p>Pages or components that share behavior&#151;for example, a componentthat displays search results for each of the entities you have inyour database&#151;can gain the usual benefits of inheritance, savingyou from writing duplicate code and all the attendant inefficiencies.</p><p>You are also freed from the need to conceive of your dataas anything but first-class objects. Rather than thinking abouttables, columns, and rows in a database when retrieving informationor manipulating relationships, you manage data by creating objectsor arrays of objects, and by invoking their methods. The EnterpriseObject technology manipulates the database for you to reflect yourchanges.</p><br><a name = "TPXREF105"></a><h3><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Dynamic Publishing</font></h3><p>The most basic websites are composed of static pages in HTMLthat are served to a user's browser. These pages change infrequently,and the scope of the changes is such that it is practical to manuallyupdate the documents on the rare occasion that they change.</p><p>Increasingly though, users need more dynamic or frequentlyupdated content via the Web. Weather reports, news stories, andstock quotes change frequently, and it's impractical or impossibleto alter static text documents on a Web server to reflect new informationoften enough to be useful. Instead, special software generates HTML(hypertext markup language) code on the fly. (The pages generatedcan include current information obtained from a data source, oftena relational database.) This code is then sent to a user's Web browser.  <a href="#BAJFFDBF">Figure 2-1</a> illustrateshow requests by a Web browser are processed to generate a responsepage.</p><br><a name = "BAJFFDBF"></a><p><b><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">Figure2-1 Dynamic page generation in WebObjects</font></b></p> <img src = "../Art/dynamicwebobjects.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/dynamicwebobjects.gif]"><p>Each page in a WebObjects application is created as a template.These templates can contain static text like a regular Web page,other templates in a recursive structure, or special WebObjectstags. These tags are similar to HTML tags, but are instead associated witha WebObjects element, whose attributes can be bound to methods orinstance variables of your Java class. For more on components, elements,and attributes see  <a sector="mod" href="../DynamicContent/iThe_Main_Component.html" target="_top">"The Main Component"</a>.</p><p>When the template is requested, WebObjects fills in the missingdata represented by the tags by calling the methods associated withthe element's attributes and inserting the result into the returnedHTML code on the fly. The called methods might access a database, performcalculations, or carry out any other custom logic you have defined.</p><p>Several other common idioms exist for dynamic page generation.These range from various third-party solutions to hand-rolled Perlor Java servlet systems. Few offer the easy database access, orclose association with Java logic that WebObjects provides. Another problemcommon to most other solutions is a lack of scalability&#151;page-basedlogic rapidly becomes impossible to maintain as the size of thesite increases. </p><br><a name = "TPXREF106"></a><h3><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">User Input</font></h3><p>There is a qualitative change in the kind of services yourapplication can offer to its users when it no longer relies solelyon navigation for control. By allowing the users of your applicationto input data, you increase the application's scope dramaticallybeyond that of solely sharing already extant information. For example,you have to come up with logic that validates the data the userenters, so that your database does not become corrupted.</p><p>A few mechanisms for user input are in common use. Most involveencoding the data into a string that is attached to the URL (UniformResource Locator) of the page the user requests, and parsing iton the server end via a custom program written to use the CGI (CommonGateway Interface) protocol. </p><p>WebObjects instead follows the same paradigm used for dynamicpage generation. Standard HTML form elements can be associated withvariables and methods in your Java code and, when the user submitsa form, the methods indicated are called with the user-entered dataas an argument. Your methods can take any action you determine to recordthis input&#151;and if you associate a form element with a databasefield via the enterprise object property representing it, user inputis recorded in the database automatically. (See <i>WebObjectsProgramming Topics</i> in <code>http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/webobjects/Topics/TopicsTOC.html</code> formore information on enterprise objects.)</p><br><a name = "TPXREF107"></a><h3><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Client-Server Applications</font></h3><p>One of the most pressing issues in Web application developmentis the need to come up with ways of maintaining state&#151;informationabout the user's session, her interaction with the applicationduring a given period&#151;between requests. Because HTTP (Hypertext TransferProtocol) is a stateless protocol, there is no connection maintainedbetween the user's browser and the Web server. This leaves theresponsibility for maintaining state up to you.</p><p>In a desktop application, the notion of state is implicit:there is only one user. In a Web application, however, there maybe hundreds of simultaneous users.</p><p>There are two ways of maintaining state in a Web application:using cookies and customizing URLs.</p><p>When <b>cookies</b> are used, information is storedon a Web browser (the client) by the Web server. When the serverneeds to determine the current state of a client, it retrieves the cookie.The drawback of this approach is that Web browsers can be configuredto refuse cookies. In such cases, the application's functionalitycan be severely limited.</p><p>To ensure that state can be maintained, whether cookies areenabled or not on the client, many Web applications use customizedURLs, in which they add the kind of information that would otherwisebe stored on a cookie.</p><p>WebObjects can maintain state using either of these approaches.However, you don't have to worry about which one is actually used.All you do is store the required state information in an instanceof the Session class. When a request is processed, WebObjects automaticallyactivates the Session instance associated with the user who initiatedthe request (the fact that such information was retrieved from acookie or from the URL is transparent to you). See  <a sector="mod" href="../SessionStateMaintenance/iUsing_the_S_anage_State.html" target="_top">"Using the Session to Manage State"</a> formore information.</p><br>    <br><a href="Introductio__WebObjects.html" target="_right"><img src="../Images/previous.gif" border="0" alt="Previous"></a><a href="Development_Tools.html" target="_right"><img src="../Images/next.gif" border="0" alt="Next"></a>&nbsp;<hr alt=""><p><font face="Palatino" size="1">&#169; 2001 Apple Computer, Inc.</font></p><!-- start of footer --><!--#include virtual="/includes/framesetfooter" --><!-- end of footer --></body></html>
