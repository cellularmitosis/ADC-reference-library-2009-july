Techniques</font></h2><!-- apple_doc: pageHeadingEnd -->

<p>This tutorial uses some of the Direct to Java Client customization
techniques. Before teaching you how to implement them, however,
this section provides a summary of all the customization techniques
available in Direct to Java Client, including their costs and appropriate
usage.</p>
<p>The first customization tool is the Direct to Java Client <b>Assistant</b>,
which you've already used in  <a href="../BasicTutorial/iBasic_Tutor_htmlTP9.html" target="_top">Chapter 3, "Basic Tutorial."</a> It
allows you to</p>
<ul><li>change an
entity's type (main, enumeration, or other)</font></li>
<li>change the properties that are displayed in any of the four
tasks (form, query, list, and identify)</font></li>
<li>add new property keys</font></li>
<li>change the widget type of property keys</font></li>
<li>make basic customizations to the client application, such
as changing the window titles and setting window sizes</font></li></ul>
<p>The costs of using Assistant are very low: if you make changes
to your data model, in most cases the rule system picks them up.
(Some changes you make in Assistant, such as changing entity types,
may not guarantee that changes in your model are picked up by the rule
system.) For this reason, you should do as much customization as
possible within Assistant before moving on to more advanced customization
techniques, which make synchronizing the user interface with the
data model more complicated.</p>
<p>The second customization tool is writing <b>custom rules</b>.
You do this in the Rule Editor application. The look and behavior
of Direct to Java Client applications is defined by rules that work
with the WebObjects rule system. The rule system is an integral
part of the two WebObjects rapid development solutions, Direct to
Web and Direct to Java Client. You can learn more about it in  <a href="../InsideTheRuleSystem/iInside_the__htmlTP1.html" target="_top">Chapter 7, "Inside the Rule System."</a></p>
<p>Using custom rules is more difficult than just using Assistant,
but the costs of using the rules are no higher than using Assistant
(Assistant simply writes rules based on the customizations you make
within it.) Many custom rules apply to specific entities, so if
you change the entities in your model, you may invalidate some rules.
But this is easily fixed by changing the argument in the rule that
references a particular entity.</p>
<p>A simple rule is to specify the minimum width for all windows
in an application:</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Left-Hand Side:</b></dt>
<dd><code>(controllerType='windowController')</code></dd>
<dt><b>Key:</b></dt>
<dd><code>minimumWidth</code></dd>
<dt><b>Value:</b></dt>
<dd><code>512</code></dd>
<dt><b>Priority:</b></dt>
<dd><code>50</code></dd></dl>
<p>You can define this characteristic for windows throughout
your application programmatically, but it's much easier and more
maintainable to just write a rule. Rules are very abstract, and
once you learn their syntax and semantics, you'll find them to
be a powerful customization technique.</p>
<p>The next customization technique is <b>freezing XML</b> which
allows you to explicitly state the result of a rule system request.
The dynamically generated user interfaces Direct to Java Client
produces are described in XML. In Assistant, the XML pane shows
the XML description for each task for each entity for each window
type in your application. Usually you start with this generated
XML and customize it to suit your needs. This technique is fully
explained in the chapter  <a href="../T6FreezeXML/iTask_Freezi_htmlTP1.html" target="_top">"Task: Freezing XML User Interfaces"</a>.</p>
<p>Freezing XML incurs more costs than writing custom rules or
using Assistant since the user interface description is static.
If you make changes to your data model, you'll have to manually
find and update any specific references to the entities and attributes
in the user interface description. Since the XML descriptions are
very abstract, this task is not too difficult. But, you should use
Assistant as much as possible to customize your application before
moving on to frozen XML.</p>
<p>In addition to using frozen XML, you can use <b>frozen
interface files</b> created in Interface Builder. Although
this gives you more control over the user interface, it makes maintenance
more difficult, it makes platform-specific layout and localization
much harder, and it makes data model synchronization more challenging.  <a href="../T7MixingStaticAndDyn/iTask_Mixing_htmlTP1.html" target="_top">Chapter 14, "Task: Mixing Static and Dynamic User Interfaces",</a> teaches you to how freeze
interface files and integrate them in dynamically generated user
interfaces.</p>
<p>Among the most advanced techniques is writing <b>custom
controller classes</b>. These are usually subclasses of EOController,
and they can include any Swing component or any component written
in Java. For instance, if you'd like a JPasswordField widget
somewhere in your application, you'd have to write a custom controller
class since this widget isn't provided for you by default. Then,
in the XML description for the window or modal dialog, you'd specify
the custom controller class using the <code>className</code> attribute.</p>
<p>Using custom controller classes provides you with total control
over the user interface, but it incurs high costs. It requires you
to write source code (an inherently buggy process), which makes
data model synchronization quite difficult, especially if you use
the custom controller class with frozen XML.</p>
