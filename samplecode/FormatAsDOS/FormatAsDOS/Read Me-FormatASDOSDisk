	FormatAsDOSDisk.c	Written by Jim Luther with some modifications by Virginia McCulloh	Apple Developer Technical Support	August, 1996, Cupertino, CA	Copyright 1996, Apple Computer, Inc.		This snippet demonstrates how to use the newer Disk Initialization	Package calls DIXFormat() and DIXZero() to format a floppy disk as	a DOS disk.  DIXFormat, DIXZero, and DIReformat are documented in 	the IM:Files Errata Tech Note.		Please note this snippet does not provide any prompts.  It merely takes	the floppy in the first floppy drive and reformats it as a DOS disk with 	the name "MS-DOS Disk".  This purpose of this snippet is to demonstrate	the newer API.		This runs under Metrowerks CodeWarrior 8 with the Universal 	Interfaces 2.1 from ETO #18.
