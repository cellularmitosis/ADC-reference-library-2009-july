<pre class="sourcecodebox">/*  File:    Sample.h  Contains:  MultiFinder-Aware Simple Sample Application        Sample is an example application that demonstrates how to        initialize the commonly used toolbox managers, operate         successfully under MultiFinder, handle desk accessories,         and create, grow, and zoom windows.          It does not by any means demonstrate all the techniques         you need for a large application. In particular, Sample         does not cover exception handling, multiple windows/documents,         sophisticated memory management, printing, or undo. All of         these are vital parts of a normal full-sized application.          This application is an example of the form of a Macintosh         application; it is NOT a template. It is NOT intended to be         used as a foundation for the next world-class, best-selling,         600K application. A stick figure drawing of the human body may         be a good example of the form for a painting, but that does not         mean it should be used as the basis for the next Mona Lisa.              We recommend that you review this program or TESample before         beginning a new application.  Written by:     Copyright:  Copyright &copy; 1988-1999 by Apple Computer, Inc., All Rights Reserved.        You may incorporate this Apple sample source code into your program(s) without        restriction.

The list is pretty much in order of importance, but by no means  complete.    1.  What is the minimum size needed to give almost 100 percent assurance    that the application won't crash because it ran out of memory? This    includes not only things that you do have direct control over such as    checking for NIL handles and pointers, but also things that some    feel are not so much under their control such as QuickDraw and the    Segment Loader.      2.  What kind of performance can a user expect from the application when    it is running in the minimum memory configuration? Performance includes    not only speed in handling data, but also things like how many documents    can be opened, etc.      3.  What are the typical sizes of scraps [is a boy dog] that a user might    wish to work with when lauching or switching to your application? If    the amount of memory is too small, the scrap may get lost [will have    to be shot]. This can be quite frustrating to the user.      4.  The previous items have concentrated on topics that tend to cause an    increase in the minimum size to request from MultiFinder. On the flip    side, however, should be the consideration of what environments the    application may be running in. There may be a high probability that    many users with relatively small memory configurations will want to    avail themselves of your application. Or, many users might want to use it    while several other, possibly related/complementary applications are    running. If that is the case, it would be helpful to have a fairly    small minimum size.    So, what did we decide on Sample? First, Sample has little risk of  running out of memory once it starts. Second, performance isn't much  of an issue since it doesn't do much and multiple windows are not  allowed. Third, there are no edit operations in Sample itself, so we  just want to provide enough space for a reasonable scrap to survive  between desk accessory launches. Lastly, Sample should intrude as little  as possible, so the effort should be towards making it as small as possible.  We looked at some heap dumps while the application was running under  various partition sizes. With a size of 23K, there was approximately  8-9K free, which is a good 'slop' factor in an application like this  which doesn't do much, but where we'd still like the scrap to survive  most of the time. */#define kMinSize  23        /* application's minimum size (in K) *//*  We made the preferred size bigger than the minimum size by 12K, so that  there would be even more room for the scrap, FKEYs, etc. */#define kPrefSize  35        /* application's preferred size (in K) */#define  rMenuBar  128        /* application's menu bar */#define  rAboutAlert  128        /* about alert */#define  rUserAlert  129        /* error user alert */#define  rWindow    128        /* application's window *//* kSysEnvironsVersion is passed to SysEnvirons to tell it which version of the   SysEnvRec we understand. */#define  kSysEnvironsVersion    1/* kOSEvent is the event number of the suspend/resume and mouse-moved events sent   by MultiFinder.
