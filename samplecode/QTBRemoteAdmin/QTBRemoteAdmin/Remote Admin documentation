It uses Machports which, for security reasons, require the remote admin tool to run in the same user context asQuickTime Broadcaster. This example uses a daemon (which must be run in the same user context as QuickTimeBroadcast) to communicate to a cgi which runs in a different user context. The daemon acts as a proxy andpasses messages between the cgi and QuickTime Broadcaster. The connection between QuickTime Broadcasterand the daemon is secure, the connection between the daemon and the cgi is not, however. A real worldimplementation to be used by customers would have to provide some form of security so that anyone can'tconnect to the daemon and control QuickTime Broadcaster.Below is a graph representing this implementation:    -----------------------     Mach ports     --------       TCP ports    -----    |QuickTime Broadcaster|<------------------>|Daemon|<------------------>|cgi|	-----------------------       secure       --------       not secure   -----Other notes:- The calls to QuickTime Broadcaster could potentially throw exceptions which are not handled in this samplecode. It is possible to extract the exception message, this will return a localized explanation of the problem.- The daemon can be stopped from Terminal using 'ps x' to find the process id and then using the "kill" command.Setting up QuickTime Broadcaster Remote Admin:1. Launch QuickTime Broadcaster and set up some presets (including a network preset) or save a broadcast settings document.2. Copy "QuickTimeLogo.gif" to:	/Library/WebServer/Documents/images/ (create the /images directory if necessary)3. Copy "BroadcasterAdmin" to:	/Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables/4. Using Terminal, add executable permissions to "BroadcasterAdmin" (type "chmod a+x BroadcasterAdmin").5. Log out of the machine.6. ssh/telnet to the machine and run "BroadcasterDaemon" from Terminal (type "./BroadcasterDaemon").7. Open a browser and type in http://hostname/cgi-bin/BroadcasterAdmin8. Enter the path to the Broadcaster application (don't include the name of the application).9. Set launch with UI to no.10. Select some presets or enter the path to the settings file and click Broadcast.
