<P>
GDB supports multiple command interpreters, and some command
infrastructure to allow users or user interface writers to switch
between interpreters or run commands in other interpreters.

</P>
<P>
GDB currently supports two command interpreters, the console
interpreter (sometimes called the command-line interpreter or CLI)
and the machine interface interpreter (or GDB/MI).  This manual
describes both of these interfaces in great detail.

</P>
<P>
By default, GDB will start with the console interpreter.
However, the user may choose to start GDB with another
interpreter by specifying the @option{-i} or @option{--interpreter}
startup options.  Defined interpreters include:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>console</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1328"></A>
The traditional console or command-line interpreter.  This is the most often
used interpreter with GDB. With no interpreter specified at runtime,
GDB will use this interpreter.

<DT><CODE>mi</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1329"></A>
The newest GDB/MI interface (currently <CODE>mi2</CODE>).  Used primarily
by programs wishing to use GDB as a backend for a debugger GUI
or an IDE.  For more information, see section <A HREF="gdb_25.html#SEC236">The GDB/MI Interface</A>.

<DT><CODE>mi2</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1330"></A>
The current GDB/MI interface.

<DT><CODE>mi1</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1331"></A>
The GDB/MI interface included in GDB 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3.

</DL>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1332"></A>
The interpreter being used by GDB may not be dynamically
switched at runtime.  Although possible, this could lead to a very
precarious situation.  Consider an IDE using GDB/MI.  If a user
enters the command "interpreter-set console" in a console view,
GDB would switch to using the console interpreter, rendering
the IDE inoperable!

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1333"></A>
Although you may only choose a single interpreter at startup, you may execute
commands in any interpreter from the current interpreter using the appropriate
command.  If you are running the console interpreter, simply use the
<CODE>interpreter-exec</CODE> command:

</P>

<PRE>
interpreter-exec mi "-data-list-register-names"
</PRE>

<P>
GDB/MI has a similar command, although it is only available in versions of
GDB which support GDB/MI version 2 (or greater).
