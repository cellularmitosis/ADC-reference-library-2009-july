C++ To SLM C++ snippet (Sunday, August 30, 1992 16:47:55) - version 002----------------------This snippet shows how to turn a generic C++ class (not Pascal/Handleobject based) into a Shared Library class. The Makefile is a suitabletemplate for similar work. Some of you wonder why the Makefile is nota typical Build style Makefile. Well, it makes sense to create a moreflexible Makefile to generate libraries, than to create a makefilethat assumes that you are always building an empty application or something similar.Environment:Shared Library Manager 1.0a6 (from ETO #8)MPW 3.2 Latest (from ETO #8)MPW C++ 3.2MPW C 3.2.2 (beware, C 3.2.3 could cause problems,if you still have problems with 3.2.2, roll to 3.2.1).System 7.0.1 + tuneup, Quadra 900.Instructions:1: Go to the folder where the Makefile resides.2: Execute: make >instructions.3: Execute: doit instructions.4: Go to the Built folder and move the ProcessLibrary    file to the Extensions folder on the System disk.5. Run testtool.Any problems? Well, then remove all the object files, and useMPW C 3.2.1. I tested this with MPW C 3.2.2, and it seems to workOK, but this all is still alpha.Kent Sandvik, Developer Technical Support, Platforms&Tools Group.Net: ksand@apple.comALink: KSAND
