General Comments

- QTSession.open and close:

A QTSession.open will perform a gestalt check to ensure that QuickTime is present and is initialized. This is a required call before any QuickTime Java classes can be used.

When the user closes the window the program will quit, first calling QTSession.close to terminate QuickTime. It is necessary for programs to call QTSession.close if they have previously called QTSession.open in order to shut down QuickTime properly.
