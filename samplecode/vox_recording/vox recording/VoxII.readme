This application uses Quad buffering for both recording and playback.  Once a buffer is filled by the recording, the buffer is passed to the playback to be played.  The playback has a small delay between the buffers which does not sound very good.  The delay sounds a little like a skip in a record.  The way to quit the application is to hold down the mouse button until the app quits.The recording is done with vox recording on, so it only records the sound which is at least of a certain level.  For more information about what vox recording is see IM VI and a future DEVELOP article (?).
