It shows how to use offscreen pixmaps and#	bitmaps to produce flicker-free updating with a#	minimum of re-structuring of code. OffSample attempts#	to reduce the amount of 'knowledge' that it has of#	the offscreen structure so as to minimize its#	dependence on that unit.##	OffSample emphasizes using the Offscreen unit; it#	is not intended to be viewed as a complete application#	from which to base some larger effort. Instead, its#	method of using offscreen bitmaps and pixmaps should#	be studied and adapted to other applications that#	desire features such as flicker-free updating.#------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/#define kMinSize				75		/* application's minimum size (in K) */#define kPrefSize				245		/* application's preferred size (in K) */#define	rMenuBar				128		/* application's menu bar */#define	rAboutAlert				128		/* about alert */#define	rUserAlert				129		/* error user alert */#define	rWindow					128		/* application's window *//* kSysEnvironsVersion is passed to SysEnvirons to tell it which version of the   SysEnvRec we understand. */#define	kSysEnvironsVersion		1/* kOSEvent is the event number of the suspend/resume and mouse-moved events sent   by MultiFinder.
