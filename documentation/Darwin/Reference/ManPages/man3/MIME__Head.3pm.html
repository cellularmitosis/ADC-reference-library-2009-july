MIME::Head(3)                        User Contributed Perl Documentation                       MIME::Head(3)



<b>NAME</b>
       MIME::Head - MIME message header (a subclass of Mail::Header)

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       Before reading further, you should see MIME::Tools to make sure that you understand where this module
       fits into the grand scheme of things.  Go on, do it now.  I'll wait.

       Ready?  Ok...

       <b>Construction</b>

           ### Create a new, empty header, and populate it manually:
           $head = MIME::Head-&gt;new;
           $head-&gt;replace('content-type', 'text/plain; charset=US-ASCII');
           $head-&gt;replace('content-length', $len);

           ### Parse a new header from a filehandle:
           $head = MIME::Head-&gt;read(\*STDIN);

           ### Parse a new header from a file, or a readable pipe:
           $testhead = MIME::Head-&gt;from_file("/tmp/test.hdr");
           $a_b_head = MIME::Head-&gt;from_file("cat a.hdr b.hdr |");

       <b>Output</b>

           ### Output to filehandle:
           $head-&gt;print(\*STDOUT);

           ### Output as string:
           print STDOUT $head-&gt;as_string;
           print STDOUT $head-&gt;stringify;

       <b>Getting</b> <b>field</b> <b>contents</b>

           ### Is this a reply?
           $is_reply = 1 if ($head-&gt;get('Subject') =~ /^Re: /);

           ### Get receipt information:
           print "Last received from: ", $head-&gt;get('Received', 0), "\n";
           @all_received = $head-&gt;get('Received');

           ### Print the subject, or the empty string if none:
           print "Subject: ", $head-&gt;get('Subject',0), "\n";

           ### Too many hops?  Count 'em and see!
           if ($head-&gt;count('Received') &gt; 5) { ...

           ### Test whether a given field exists
           warn "missing subject!" if (! $head-&gt;count('subject'));

       <b>Setting</b> <b>field</b> <b>contents</b>

           ### Declare this to be an HTML header:
           $head-&gt;replace('Content-type', 'text/html');

       <b>Manipulating</b> <b>field</b> <b>contents</b>

           ### Get rid of internal newlines in fields:
           $head-&gt;unfold;

           ### Decode any Q- or B-encoded-text in fields (DEPRECATED):
           $head-&gt;decode;

       <b>Getting</b> <b>high-level</b> <b>MIME</b> <b>information</b>

           ### Get/set a given MIME attribute:
           unless ($charset = $head-&gt;mime_attr('content-type.charset')) {
               $head-&gt;mime_attr("content-type.charset" =&gt; "US-ASCII");
           }

           ### The content type (e.g., "text/html"):
           $mime_type     = $head-&gt;mime_type;

           ### The content transfer encoding (e.g., "quoted-printable"):
           $mime_encoding = $head-&gt;mime_encoding;

           ### The recommended name when extracted:
           $file_name     = $head-&gt;recommended_filename;

           ### The boundary text, for multipart messages:
           $boundary      = $head-&gt;multipart_boundary;

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       A class for parsing in and manipulating RFC-822 message headers, with some methods geared towards
       standard (and not so standard) MIME fields as specified in RFC-1521, <u>Multipurpose</u> <u>Internet</u> <u>Mail</u>
       <u>Extensions</u>.

<b>PUBLIC</b> <b>INTERFACE</b>
       <b>Creation,</b> <b>input,</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b>


       new [ARG],[OPTIONS]
           <u>Class</u> <u>method,</u> <u>inherited.</u>  Creates a new header object.  Arguments are the same as those in the
           superclass.

       from_file EXPR,OPTIONS
           <u>Class</u> <u>or</u> <u>instance</u> <u>method</u>.  For convenience, you can use this to parse a header object in from
           EXPR, which may actually be any expression that can be sent to <u>open()</u> so as to return a readable
           filehandle.  The "file" will be opened, read, and then closed:

               ### Create a new header by parsing in a file:
               my $head = MIME::Head-&gt;from_file("/tmp/test.hdr");

           Since this method can function as either a class constructor <u>or</u> an instance initializer, the
           above is exactly equivalent to:

               ### Create a new header by parsing in a file:
               my $head = MIME::Head-&gt;new-&gt;from_file("/tmp/test.hdr");

           On success, the object will be returned; on failure, the undefined value.

           The OPTIONS are the same as in <u>new()</u>, and are passed into <u>new()</u> if this is invoked as a class
           method.

           <b>Note:</b> This is really just a convenience front-end onto "read()", provided mostly for backwards-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">compatibility&nbsp;backwardscompatibility</font>
           compatibility with MIME-parser 1.0.

       read FILEHANDLE
           <u>Instance</u> <u>(or</u> <u>class)</u> <u>method.</u>  This initiallizes a header object by reading it in from a
           FILEHANDLE, until the terminating blank line is encountered.  A syntax error or end-of-stream
           will also halt processing.

           Supply this routine with a reference to a filehandle glob; e.g., "\*STDIN":

               ### Create a new header by parsing in STDIN:
               $head-&gt;read(\*STDIN);

           On success, the self object will be returned; on failure, a false value.

           <b>Note:</b> in the MIME world, it is perfectly legal for a header to be empty, consisting of nothing
           but the terminating blank line.  Thus, we can't just use the formula that "no tags equals error".

           <b>Warning:</b> as of the time of this writing, Mail::Header::read did not flag either syntax errors or
           unexpected end-of-file conditions (an EOF before the terminating blank line).  MIME::ParserBase
           takes this into account.

       <b>Getting/setting</b> <b>fields</b>

       The following are methods related to retrieving and modifying the header fields.  Some are inherited
       from Mail::Header, but I've kept the documentation around for convenience.

       add TAG,TEXT,[INDEX]
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method,</u> <u>inherited.</u>  Add a new occurence of the field named TAG, given by TEXT:

               ### Add the trace information:
               $head-&gt;add('Received',
                          'from eryq.pr.mcs.net by gonzo.net with smtp');

           Normally, the new occurence will be <u>appended</u> to the existing occurences.  However, if the
           optional INDEX argument is 0, then the new occurence will be <u>prepended</u>.  If you want to be
           <u>explicit</u> about appending, specify an INDEX of -1.

           <b>Warning</b>: this method always adds new occurences; it doesn't overwrite any existing occurences...
           so if you just want to <u>change</u> the value of a field (creating it if necessary), then you probably
           <b>don't</b> want to use this method: consider using "replace()" instead.

       count TAG
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method,</u> <u>inherited.</u>  Returns the number of occurences of a field; in a boolean context,
           this tells you whether a given field exists:

               ### Was a "Subject:" field given?
               $subject_was_given = $head-&gt;count('subject');

           The TAG is treated in a case-insensitive manner.  This method returns some false value if the
           field doesn't exist, and some true value if it does.

       decode [FORCE]
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method,</u> <u>DEPRECATED.</u>  Go through all the header fields, looking for RFC-1522-style "Q"
           (quoted-printable, sort of) or "B" (base64) encoding, and decode them in-place.  Fellow
           Americans, you probably don't know what the hell I'm talking about.  Europeans, Russians, et al,
           you probably do.  ":-)".

           <b>This</b> <b>method</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>deprecated.</b>  See "decode_headers" in MIME::Parser for the full reasons.  If
           you absolutely must use it and don't like the warning, then provide a FORCE:

              "I_NEED_TO_FIX_THIS"
                     Just shut up and do it.  Not recommended.
                     Provided only for those who need to keep old scripts functioning.

              "I_KNOW_WHAT_I_AM_DOING"
                     Just shut up and do it.  Not recommended.
                     Provided for those who REALLY know what they are doing.

           <b>What</b> <b>this</b> <b>method</b> <b>does.</b>  For an example, let's consider a valid email header you might get:

               From: =?US-ASCII?Q?Keith_Moore?= &lt;moore@cs.utk.edu&gt;
               To: =?ISO-8859-1?Q?Keld_J=F8rn_Simonsen?= &lt;keld@dkuug.dk&gt;
               CC: =?ISO-8859-1?Q?Andr=E9_?= Pirard &lt;PIRARD@vm1.ulg.ac.be&gt;
               Subject: =?ISO-8859-1?B?SWYgeW91IGNhbiByZWFkIHRoaXMgeW8=?=
                =?ISO-8859-2?B?dSB1bmRlcnN0YW5kIHRoZSBleGFtcGxlLg==?=
                =?US-ASCII?Q?.._cool!?=

           That basically decodes to (sorry, I can only approximate the Latin characters with 7 bit
           sequences /o and 'e):

               From: Keith Moore &lt;moore@cs.utk.edu&gt;
               To: Keld J/orn Simonsen &lt;keld@dkuug.dk&gt;
               CC: Andr'e  Pirard &lt;PIRARD@vm1.ulg.ac.be&gt;
               Subject: If you can read this you understand the example... cool!

           <b>Note:</b> currently, the decodings are done without regard to the character set: thus, the Q-encoding
           "=F8" is simply translated to the octet (hexadecimal "F8"), period.  For piece-by-piece decoding
           of a given field, you want the array context of "MIME::Word::decode_mimewords()".

           <b>Warning:</b> the CRLF+SPACE separator that splits up long encoded words into shorter sequences (see
           the Subject: example above) gets lost when the field is unfolded, and so decoding after unfolding
           causes a spurious space to be left in the field.  <u>THEREFORE:</u> <u>if</u> <u>you're</u> <u>going</u> <u>to</u> <u>decode,</u> <u>do</u> <u>so</u>
           <u>BEFORE</u> <u>unfolding!</u>

           This method returns the self object.

           <u>Thanks</u> <u>to</u> <u>Kent</u> <u>Boortz</u> <u>for</u> <u>providing</u> <u>the</u> <u>idea,</u> <u>and</u> <u>the</u> <u>baseline</u> <u>RFC-1522-decoding</u> <u>code.</u>

       delete TAG,[INDEX]
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method,</u> <u>inherited.</u>  Delete all occurences of the field named TAG.

               ### Remove some MIME information:
               $head-&gt;delete('MIME-Version');
               $head-&gt;delete('Content-type');

       get TAG,[INDEX]
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method,</u> <u>inherited.</u>  Get the contents of field TAG.

           If a <b>numeric</b> <b>INDEX</b> is given, returns the occurence at that index, or undef if not present:

               ### Print the first and last 'Received:' entries (explicitly):
               print "First, or most recent: ", $head-&gt;get('received', 0), "\n";
               print "Last, or least recent: ", $head-&gt;get('received',-1), "\n";

           If <b>no</b> <b>INDEX</b> is given, but invoked in a <b>scalar</b> context, then INDEX simply defaults to 0:

               ### Get the first 'Received:' entry (implicitly):
               my $most_recent = $head-&gt;get('received');

           If <b>no</b> <b>INDEX</b> is given, and invoked in an <b>array</b> context, then <u>all</u> occurences of the field are
           returned:

               ### Get all 'Received:' entries:
               my @all_received = $head-&gt;get('received');

       get_all FIELD
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method.</u>  Returns the list of <u>all</u> occurences of the field, or the empty list if the field
           is not present:

               ### How did it get here?
               @history = $head-&gt;get_all('Received');

           <b>Note:</b> I had originally experimented with having "get()" return all occurences when invoked in an
           array context... but that causes a lot of accidents when you get careless and do stuff like this:

               print "\u$field: ", $head-&gt;get($field), "\n";

           It also made the intuitive behaviour unclear if the INDEX argument was given in an array context.
           So I opted for an explicit approach to asking for all occurences.

       print [OUTSTREAM]
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method,</u> <u>override.</u>  Print the header out to the given OUTSTREAM, or the currently-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">selected&nbsp;currentlyselected</font>
           selected filehandle if none.  The OUTSTREAM may be a filehandle, or any object that responds to a
           <u>print()</u> message.

           The override actually lets you print to any object that responds to a <u>print()</u> method.  This is
           vital for outputting MIME entities to scalars.

           Also, it defaults to the <u>currently-selected</u> filehandle if none is given (not STDOUT!), so <u>please</u>
           supply a filehandle to prevent confusion.

       stringify
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method.</u>  Return the header as a string.  You can also invoke it as "as_string".

       unfold [FIELD]
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method,</u> <u>inherited.</u>  Unfold (remove newlines in) the text of all occurences of the given
           FIELD.  If the FIELD is omitted, <u>all</u> fields are unfolded.  Returns the "self" object.

       <b>MIME-specific</b> <b>methods</b>

       All of the following methods extract information from the following fields:

           Content-type
           Content-transfer-encoding
           Content-disposition

       Be aware that they do not just return the raw contents of those fields, and in some cases they will
       fill in sensible (I hope) default values.  Use "get()" or "mime_attr()" if you need to grab and
       process the raw field text.

       <b>Note:</b> some of these methods are provided both as a convenience and for backwards-compatibility only,
       while others (like <u>recommended</u><b>_</b><u>filename()</u>) <u>really</u> <u>do</u> <u>have</u> <u>to</u> <u>be</u> <u>in</u> <u>MIME::Head</u> <u>to</u> <u>work</u> <u>properly,</u> since
       they look for their value in more than one field.  However, if you know that a value is restricted to
       a single field, you should really use the Mail::Field interface to get it.

       mime_attr ATTR,[VALUE]
           A quick-and-easy interface to set/get the attributes in structured MIME fields:

               $head-&gt;mime_attr("content-type"         =&gt; "text/html");
               $head-&gt;mime_attr("content-type.charset" =&gt; "US-ASCII");
               $head-&gt;mime_attr("content-type.name"    =&gt; "homepage.html");

           This would cause the final output to look something like this:

               Content-type: text/html; charset=US-ASCII; name="homepage.html"

           Note that the special empty sub-field tag indicates the anonymous first sub-field.

           <b>Giving</b> <b>VALUE</b> <b>as</b> <b>undefined</b> will cause the contents of the named subfield to be deleted:

               $head-&gt;mime_attr("content-type.charset" =&gt; undef);

           <b>Supplying</b> <b>no</b> <b>VALUE</b> <b>argument</b> just returns the attribute's value, or undefined if it isn't there:

               $type = $head-&gt;mime_attr("content-type");      ### text/html
               $name = $head-&gt;mime_attr("content-type.name"); ### homepage.html

           In all cases, the new/current value is returned.

       mime_encoding
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method.</u>  Try <u>real</u> <u>hard</u> to determine the content transfer encoding (e.g., "base64",
           "binary"), which is returned in all-lowercase.

           If no encoding could be found, the default of "7bit" is returned.  I quote from RFC-1521 section
           5:

               This is the default value -- that is, "Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7BIT"
               is assumed if the Content-Transfer-Encoding header field is not present.

           I do one other form of fixup: "7_bit", "7-bit", and "7 bit" are corrected to "7bit"; likewise for
           "8bit".

       mime_type [DEFAULT]
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method.</u>  Try "real hard" to determine the content type (e.g., "text/plain", "image/gif",
           "x-weird-type", which is returned in all-lowercase.  "Real hard" means that if no content type
           could be found, the default (usually "text/plain") is returned.  From RFC-1521 section 7.1:

               The default Content-Type for Internet mail is
               "text/plain; charset=us-ascii".

           Unless this is a part of a "multipart/digest", in which case "message/rfc822" is the default.
           Note that you can also <u>set</u> the default, but you shouldn't: normally only the MIME parser uses
           this feature.

       multipart_boundary
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method.</u>  If this is a header for a multipart message, return the "encapsulation
           boundary" used to separate the parts.  The boundary is returned exactly as given in the
           "Content-type:" field; that is, the leading double-hyphen ("--") is <u>not</u> prepended.

           Well, <u>almost</u> exactly... this passage from RFC-1521 dictates that we remove any trailing spaces:

              If a boundary appears to end with white space, the white space
              must be presumed to have been added by a gateway, and must be deleted.

           Returns undef (<b>not</b> the empty string) if either the message is not multipart or if there is no
           specified boundary.

       recommended_filename
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method.</u>  Return the recommended external filename.  This is used when extracting the
           data from the MIME stream.

           Returns undef if no filename could be suggested.

<b>NOTES</b>
       Why have separate objects for the entity, head, and body?
           See the documentation for the MIME-tools distribution for the rationale behind this decision.

       Why assume that MIME headers are email headers?
           I quote from Achim Bohnet, who gave feedback on v.1.9 (I think he's using the word "header" where
           I would use "field"; e.g., to refer to "Subject:", "Content-type:", etc.):

               There is also IMHO no requirement [for] MIME::Heads to look
               like [email] headers; so to speak, the MIME::Head [simply stores]
               the attributes of a complex object, e.g.:

                   new MIME::Head type =&gt; "text/plain",
                                  charset =&gt; ...,
                                  disposition =&gt; ..., ... ;

           I agree in principle, but (alas and dammit) RFC-1521 says otherwise.  RFC-1521 [MIME] headers are
           a syntactic subset of RFC-822 [email] headers.  Perhaps a better name for these modules would be
           RFC1521:: instead of MIME::, but we're a little beyond that stage now.

           In my mind's eye, I see an abstract class, call it MIME::Attrs, which does what Achim suggests...
           so you could say:

                my $attrs = new MIME::Attrs type =&gt; "text/plain",
                                            charset =&gt; ...,
                                            disposition =&gt; ..., ... ;

           We could even make it a superclass of MIME::Head: that way, MIME::Head would have to implement
           its interface, <u>and</u> allow itself to be initiallized from a MIME::Attrs object.

           However, when you read RFC-1521, you begin to see how much MIME information is organized by its
           presence in particular fields.  I imagine that we'd begin to mirror the structure of RFC-1521
           fields and subfields to such a degree that this might not give us a tremendous gain over just
           having MIME::Head.

       Why all this "occurence" and "index" jazz?  Isn't every field unique?
           Aaaaaaaaaahh....no.

           Looking at a typical mail message header, it is sooooooo tempting to just store the fields as a
           hash of strings, one string per hash entry.  Unfortunately, there's the little matter of the
           "Received:" field, which (unlike "From:", "To:", etc.) will often have multiple occurences; e.g.:

               Received: from gsfc.nasa.gov by eryq.pr.mcs.net  with smtp
                   (Linux Smail3.1.28.1 #5) id m0tStZ7-0007X4C;
                    Thu, 21 Dec 95 16:34 CST
               Received: from rhine.gsfc.nasa.gov by gsfc.nasa.gov
                    (5.65/Ultrix3.0-C) id AA13596;
                    Thu, 21 Dec 95 17:20:38 -0500
               Received: (from eryq@localhost) by rhine.gsfc.nasa.gov
                    (8.6.12/8.6.12) id RAA28069;
                    Thu, 21 Dec 1995 17:27:54 -0500
               Date: Thu, 21 Dec 1995 17:27:54 -0500
               From: Eryq &lt;eryq@rhine.gsfc.nasa.gov&gt;
               Message-Id: &lt;199512212227.RAA28069@rhine.gsfc.nasa.gov&gt;
               To: eryq@eryq.pr.mcs.net
               Subject: Stuff and things

           The "Received:" field is used for tracing message routes, and although it's not generally used
           for anything other than human debugging, I didn't want to inconvenience anyone who actually
           wanted to get at that information.

           I also didn't want to make this a special case; after all, who knows what other fields could have
           multiple occurences in the future?  So, clearly, multiple entries had to somehow be stored
           multiple times... and the different occurences had to be retrievable.
