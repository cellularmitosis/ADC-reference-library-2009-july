README - QTEffectsby Scott Kuechle<http://developer.apple.com/contact/feedback.html>Version 1.09/27/1999This sample demonstrates how to create a QuickTime movie with a video effect as a transitionfrom one picture to another. This project differs from the QTShowEffect sample code it is based on in that it allows the user to create the effect "by hand" e.g. without the aid of the standard QuickTime effects parameter dialog box. Instead, the program itself builds the correct effects parameter description atoms.Here's a quick rundown of how the program works:¥ First, a QuickTime movie with two video tracks is created - these two tracks will be used as sources for a explode video effect¥ The effect description and sample description structures for the explode effect are created	   ¥ An effects track and media are created and added to our movie for the explode effect¥ The input map for the effect is created, and references for the two video tracks are added to this input map		To build the effects movie, simply build and launch the application. At the prompt, specify a location for the movie. The resulting movie, when played with any QuickTime capable player (such as QuickTime Player), will show the source track "B" growing from a single point and expanding out until it entirely covers source track "A".Enjoy
