       Class:          <b>Angle</b>
       Command-Line Switch:           <b>-angle</b>

              Specifes  the  angle of slope from the inner edge to the outer edge of the tab.  An angle of 0
              specifies square tabs. Valid ranges are 0 to 45 degrees inclusive. Default is 15  degrees.  If
              <b>tabPos</b> is e or w, this option is ignored.

       Name:           <b>auto</b>
       Class:          <b>Auto</b>
       Command-Line Switch:           <b>-auto</b>

              Specifies whether to use the automatic packing/unpacking algorithm of the notebook. A value of
              true indicates that page frames will  be  unpacked  and  packed  acoording  to  the  algorithm
              described  in  the  select command. A value of <b>false</b> leaves the current page packed and subse-
              quent <b>selects</b>, <b>next</b>, or <b>previous</b> commands do not switch pages automatically.  In  either  case
              the  page's  associated  command  (see the <b>add</b> command's description of the command option) is
              invoked. The value may have any of the forms accepted by the  <b>Tcl_GetBoolean</b>,  such  as  <b>true</b>,
              <b>false</b>, <b>0</b>, <b>1</b>, <b>yes</b>, or <b>no</b>.

       Name:           <b>backdrop</b>
       Class:          <b>Backdrop</b>
       Command-Line Switch:           <b>-backdrop</b>

              Specifies a background color to use when filling in the backdrop area behind the tabs.

       Name:           <b>background</b>
       Class:          <b>Background</b>
       Command-Line Switch:           <b>-background</b>

              Specifies  a background color to use for displaying a page and its associated tab. This can be
              thought of as the selected tab background color, since the tab associated  with  the  selected
              page is the selected tab.

       Name:           <b>bevelAmount</b>
       Class:          <b>BevelAmount</b>
       Command-Line Switch:           <b>-bevelamount</b>

              Specifes  the  size of tab corners. A value of 0 with <b>angle</b> set to 0 results in square tabs. A
              <b>bevelAmount</b> of 4, means that the tab will be drawn with angled corners that cut  in  4  pixels
              from the edge of the tab. The default is 0.

       Name:           <b>borderWidth</b>
       Class:          <b>BorderWidth</b>
       Command-Line Switch:           <b>-borderwidth</b>

              Specifies  the  width of shadowed border to place around the notebook area of the tabnotebook.
              The default value is 2.

       Name:           <b>disabledForeground</b>
       Class:          <b>DisabledForeground</b>
       Command-Line Switch:           <b>-disabledforeground</b>

              Specifies a foreground color to use for displaying a tab's label when its <b>state</b> is disabled.

       Name:           <b>equalTabs</b>
       Class:          <b>EqualTabs</b>
       Command-Line Switch:           <b>-equaltabs</b>

              Specifies whether to force tabs to be equal sized or not. A value of <b>true</b> means constrain tabs
              to  be equal sized. A value of <b>false</b> allows each tab to size based on the text label size. The
              value may have any of the forms accepted by the <b>Tcl_GetBoolean</b>, such as  <b>true</b>,  <b>false</b>,  <b>0</b>,  <b>1</b>,
              <b>yes</b>, or <b>no</b>.

              For  horizontally  positioned tabs (<b>tabpos</b> is either <b>s</b> or <b>n</b>), <b>true</b> forces all tabs to be equal
              width (the width being equal to the longest label plus any <b>padX</b>  specified).  Horizontal  tabs
              are always equal in height.

              For  vertically  positioned  tabs  (<b>tabpos</b> is either <b>w</b> or <b>e</b>), <b>true</b> forces all tabs to be equal
              height (the height being equal to the height of the label with the largest  font).  Vertically
              oriented tabs are always equal in width.

       Name:           <b>foreground</b>
       Class:          <b>Foreground</b>
       Command-Line Switch:           <b>-foreground</b>

              Specifies  a  foreground color to use for displaying a page and its associated tab label. This
              can be thought of as the selected tab background color, since  the  tab  associated  with  the
              selected page is the selected tab.

       Name:           <b>gap</b>
       Class:          <b>Gap</b>
       Command-Line Switch:           <b>-gap</b>

              Specifies  the  amount of pixel space to place between each tab. Value may be any pixel offset
              value. In addition, a special keyword <b>overlap</b> can be used as the value to achieve  a  standard
              overlap of tabs. This value may have any of the forms acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.

       Name:           <b>margin</b>
       Class:          <b>Margin</b>
       Command-Line Switch:           <b>-Bmargin</b>

              Specifies  the  amount  of  space to place between the outside edge of the tabnotebook and the
              outside edge of its tabs. If <b>tabPos</b> is <b>s</b>, this is the amount of space between the bottom  edge
              of  the tabnotebook and the bottom edge of the set of tabs. If <b>tabPos</b> is <b>n</b>, this is the amount
              of space between the top edge of the tabnotebook and the top edge of the set of tabs. If  <b>tab</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">Pos&nbsp;tabPos</font>
              <b>Pos</b>  is <b>e</b>, this is the amount of space between the right edge of the tabnotebook and the right
              edge of the set of tabs. If <b>tabPos</b> is <b>w</b>, this is the amount of space between the left edge  of
              the  tabnotebook  and  the  left edge of the set of tabs. This value may have any of the forms
              acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.

       Name:           <b>padX</b>
       Class:          <b>PadX</b>
       Command-Line Switch:           <b>-padx</b>

              Specifies a non-negative value indicating how much extra space to request for a tab around its
              label  in  the  X-direction. When computing how large a window it needs, the tab will add this
              amount to the width it would normally need The tab will end up with extra  internal  space  to
              the  left  and  right  of  its  text label. This value may have any of the forms acceptable to
              <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.

       Name:           <b>padY</b>
       Class:          <b>PadY</b>
       Command-Line Switch:           <b>-pady</b>

              Specifies a non-negative value indicating how much extra space to request for a tab around its
              label  in  the  Y-direction. When computing how large a window it needs, the tab will add this
              amount to the height it would normally need The tab will end up with extra internal  space  to
              the  top  and  bottom  of  its  text label. This value may have any of the forms acceptable to
              <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.

       Name:           <b>raiseSelect</b>
       Class:          <b>RaiseSelect</b>
       Command-Line Switch:           <b>-raiseselect</b>

              Specifes whether to slightly raise the selected tab from the rest of the  tabs.  The  selected
              tab  is  drawn  2  pixels closer to the outside of the tabnotebook than the unselected tabs. A
              value of <b>true</b> says to raise selected tabs, a value  of  <b>false</b>  turns  this  feature  off.  The
              default  is <b>false</b>. The value may have any of the forms accepted by the <b>Tcl_GetBoolean</b>, such as
              <b>true</b>, <b>false</b>, <b>0</b>, <b>1</b>, <b>yes</b>, or <b>no</b>.

       Name:           <b>start</b>
       Class:          <b>Start</b>
       Command-Line Switch:           <b>-start</b>

              Specifies the amount of space to place between the left or top edge of the tabnotebook and the
              starting  edge  of  its  tabs.  For  horizontally positioned tabs, this is the amount of space
              between the left edge of the notebook and the left edge of the first tab. For vertically posi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tioned&nbsp;positioned</font>
              tioned  tabs,  this  is the amount of space between the top of the notebook and the top of the
              first tab. This value may change if the user performs a MButton-2 scroll  on  the  tabs.  This
              value may have any of the forms acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.

       Name:           <b>state</b>
       Class:          <b>State</b>
       Command-Line Switch:           <b>-state</b>

              Sets the active state of the tabnotebook. Specifying <b>normal</b> allows all pages to be selectable.
              Specifying <b>disabled</b> disables the notebook causing all page tabs to be drawn in  the  <b>disabled</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">Foreground&nbsp;disabledForeground</font>
              <b>Foreground</b> color.

       Name:           <b>tabBackground</b>

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  <b>iwidgets::tabnotebook</b> command creates a new window (given by the pathName argument) and makes it
       into a <b>tabnotebook</b> widget. Additional options, described above may be specified on the  command  line
       or in the option database to configure aspects of the tabnotebook such as its colors, font, and text.
       The iwidgets::tabnotebook command returns its pathName argument. At the time this command is invoked,
       there must not exist a window named pathName, but pathName's parent must exist.

       A  <b>tabnotebook</b>  is a widget that contains a set of tabbed pages. It displays one page from the set as
       the selected page. A Tab displays the label for the page to which it is attached and serves as a page
       selector.  When  a  page's  tab  is selected, the page's contents are displayed in the page area. The
       selected tab has a three-dimensional effect to make it appear to float above the other tabs. The tabs
       are displayed as a group along either the left, top, right, or bottom edge. When first created a tab-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">notebook&nbsp;tabnotebook</font>
       notebook has no pages. Pages may be added or deleted using widget commands described below.

       A special option may be provided to the tabnotebook. The <b>-auto</b> option specifies whether the  tabnote-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">book&nbsp;tabnotebook</font>
       book will automatically handle the unpacking and packing of pages when pages are selected. A value of
       true signifies that the notebook will automatically manage it. This is the default value. A value  of
       false signifies the notebook will not perform automatic switching of pages.

<b>NOTEBOOK</b> <b>PAGES</b>
       A  tabnotebook's  pages  area  contains a single child site frame. When a new page is created it is a
       child of this frame. The page's child site frame serves as a geometry container for  applications  to
       pack  widgets into. It is this frame that is automatically unpacked or packed when the auto option is
       true. This creates the effect of one page being visible at a time. When a new page is  selected,  the
       previously  selected  page's  child site frame is automatically unpacked from the tabnotebook's child
       site frame and the newly selected page's child site is  packed  into  the  tabnotebook's  child  site
       frame.

       However,  sometimes  it  is desirable to handle page changes in a different manner. By specifying the
       <b>auto</b> option as <b>false</b>, child site packing can be disabled and done differently. For example, all  wid-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">gets&nbsp;widgets</font>
       gets  might  be  packed into the first page's child site <b>frame</b>. Then when a new page is selected, the
       application can reconfigure the widgets and give the appearance that the page was flipped.

       In both cases the command option for a page specifies a Tcl Command  to  execute  when  the  page  is
       selected. In the case of <b>auto</b> being <b>true</b>, it is between the unpacking of the previously selected page
       and the packing of the newly selected page.

       Notebook pages can also be controlled with scroll bars or other widgets that obey  the  <b>scrollcommand</b>
       protocol.  By  giving a scrollbar a <b>-command</b> to call the tabnotebook's <b>select</b> method, the tabnotebook
       can be controlled with a scrollbar.

       The notebook area is implemented with the notebook mega widget.

<b>TABS</b>
       Tabs appear along the edge of the notebook area. Tabs are drawn to appear attached to  their  associ-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ated&nbsp;associated</font>
       ated  page.  When a tab is clicked on, the associated page is selected and the tab is drawn as raised
       above all other tabs and as a seamless part of its notebook page. Tabs can  be  controlled  in  their
       location  along  the  edges, the angle tab sides are drawn with, gap between tabs, starting margin of
       tabs, internal padding around text labels in a tab, the font, and its label.

       The Tab area is implemented with the <b>tabset</b> mega widget.  See <!-- a --><b>tabset(1)</b><!-- /a --><b></b>. Tabs may be  oriented  along
       either  the north, south, east, or west sides with the <b>tabPos</b> option. North and south tabs may appear
       as angled, square, or bevelled. West and east tabs may appear as square or bevelled. By changing  tab
       gaps,  tab  angles,  bevelling,  orientations,  colors, fonts, start locations, and margins; tabs may
       appear in a wide variety of styles. For example, it is possible to  implement  Microsoft-style  tabs,
       Borland property tab styles, or Borland Delphi style tabs all with the same tabnotebook.

<b>WIDGET-SPECIFIC</b> <b>METHODS</b>
       The  <b>iwidgets::tabnotebook</b> command creates a new Tcl command whose name is <u>pathName</u>. This command may
       be used to invoke various operations on the widget. It has the following general form:

              <u>pathName</u> <u>option</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?

       <u>option</u> and the <u>arg</u>s determine the exact behavior of the command.

       Many of the widget commands for a notebook take as one argument an indicator of  which  page  of  the
       notebook  to  operate on. These indicators are called indexes and may be specified in any of the fol-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lowing&nbsp;following</font>
       lowing forms:

       <u>number</u> Specifies the page numerically, where 0 corresponds to the first page in the  notebook,  1  to
              the second, and so on.

       <b>select</b> Specifies  the currently selected page's index. If no page is currently selected, the value -1
              is returned.

       <b>end</b>    Specifes the last page in the tabnotebook's index. If the notebook is empty this  will  return
              -1.

       <u>pattern</u>
              If  the  index doesn't satisfy any of the above forms, then this form is used. Pattern is pat-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tern-matched&nbsp;pattern-matched</font>
              tern-matched against the label of each page in the notebook, in order from the  first  to  the
              last  page,  until a matching entry is found. The rules of Tcl_StringMatch are used.  The fol-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lowing&nbsp;following</font>
              lowing commands are possible for tabnotebook widgets:

       <u>pathName</u> <b>add</b> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> ...?
              Add a new page at the end of the tabnotebook. A new child site frame is created.  Returns  the
              child  site  pathName.  If additional arguments are present, they specify any of the following
              options:

              <b>-angle</b> <u>value</u>
                     Specifes the angle of slope from the inner edge to the outer edge of the tab. An  angle
                     of  0  specifies square tabs. Valid ranges are 0 to 45 degrees inclusive. Default is 15
                     degrees. If this option is specified as an empty string (the default), then  the  angle
                     option  for the overall tabnotebook is used. This is generally only set at the tabnote-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">book&nbsp;tabnotebook</font>
                     book level. Tabs normally will want to share the same angle value.

              <b>-background</b> <u>value</u>
                     Specifies a background color to use for displaying tabs when they are selected and  for
                     displaying  the  current  page.  If  this  option  is specified as an empty string (the
                     default), then the background option for the overall tabnotebook is used.

              <b>-bevelamount</b> <u>value</u>
                     Specifes the size of tab corners. A value of 0 with angle set to 0  results  in  square
                     tabs. A bevelAmount of 4, means that the tab will be drawn with angled corners that cut
                     in 4 pixels from the edge of the tab.  The default is 0. This is generally only set  at
                     the tabnotebook level.  Tabs normally will want to share the same bevelAmount.

              <b>-bitmap</b> <u>value</u>
                     If  label is a non-empty string, specifies a bitmap to display in this page's tab. Bit-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">map&nbsp;Bitmap</font>
                     map may be of any of the forms accepted by Tk_GetPixmap.

              <b>-command</b> <u>value</u>
                     Specifies a Tcl command to be executed when this page is selected. This allows the pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">grammer&nbsp;programmer</font>
                     grammer a hook to reconfigure this page's widgets or any other page's widgets.

                     If  the  tabnotebook has the auto option set to true, when a page is selected this com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
                     mand will be called immediately after the previously  selected  page  is  unpacked  and
                     immediately  before  this page is selected. The index value select is valid during this
                     Tcl command. `index select' will return this page's page number.

                     If the auto option is set to false, when a page is selected the unpack and  pack  calls
                     are bypassed. This Tcl command is still called.

              <b>-disabledforeground</b> <u>value</u>
                     Specifies  a  foreground  color to use for displaying tab labels when tabs are in their
                     disable state. If this option is specified as an empty string (the default),  then  the
                     disabledforeground option for the overall tabnotebook is used.

              <b>-font</b> <u>value</u>
                     Specifies  the  font  to use when drawing a text label on a page tab. If this option is
                     specified as an empty string then the font option for the overall tabnotebook is used..

              <b>-foreground</b> <u>value</u>
                     Specifies  a  foreground color to use for displaying tab labels when they are selected.
                     If this option is specified as an empty  string  (the  default),  then  the  foreground
                     option for the overall tabnotebook is used.

              <b>-label</b> <u>value</u>
                     Specifies  a  string to display as an identifying label for a notebook page. This label
                     serves as an additional identifier used to reference the page. This label may  be  used
                     for the index value in widget commands.

              <b>-tabbackground</b> <u>value</u>
                     Specifies  a  background  color  to use for displaying a tab when it is not elected. If
                     this option is specified as an empty  string  (the  default),  then  the  tabBackground
                     option for the overall tabnotebook is used.

              <b>-tabforeground</b> <u>value</u>
                     Specifies  a foreground color to use for displaying the tab's text label when it is not
                     selected. If this option is specified as an empty string (the default), then  the  tab-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">Foreground&nbsp;tabForeground</font>
                     Foreground option for the overall tabnotebook is used.

              <b>-padx</b> <u>value</u>
                     Specifies  a  non-negative  value  indicating how much extra space to request for a tab
                     around its label in the X-direction. When computing how large a window  it  needs,  the
                     tab  will  add this amount to the width it would normally need The tab will end up with
                     extra internal space to the left and right of its text label. This value may  have  any
                     of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels. If this option is specified as an empty string
                     (the default), then the padX option for the overall tabnotebook is used

              <b>-pady</b> <u>value</u>
                     Specifies a non-negative value indicating how much extra space to  request  for  a  tab
                     around  its  label  in the Y-direction. When computing how large a window it needs, the
                     tab will add this amount to the height it would normally need The tab will end up  with
                     extra  internal  space to the top and bottom of its text label. This value may have any
                     of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels. If this option is specified as an empty string
                     (the default), then the padY option for the overall tabnotebook is used

              <b>-state</b> <u>value</u>
                     Specifies  one  of  two  states for the page: normal or disabled. In normal state unse-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lected&nbsp;unselected</font>
                     lected tabs are displayed using the tabforeground and  tabbackground  option  from  the
                     tabnotebook or the page. Selected tabs and pages are displayed using the foreground and
                     background option from the tabnotebook or the page. The disabled state means  that  the
                     page  and  its  tab  is  insensitive:  it  doesn't  respond  to mouse button presses or
                     releases. In this state the entry is  displayed  according  to  its  disabledForeground
                     option for the tabnotebook and the background/tabbackground option from the page or the
                     tabnotebook.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>childSite</b> ?<u>index</u>?
              If passed no arguments, returns a list of pathNames for all the pages in the  tabnotebook.  If
              the tab notebook is empty, an empty list is returned

              If  <u>index</u>  is  passed,  it  returns  the <u>pathName</u> for the page's child site <b>frame</b> specified by
              <u>index</u>. Widgets that are created with this <u>pathName</u> will be displayed when the associated  page
              is selected. If <u>index</u> is not a valid index, an empty string is returned.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>configure</b> ?<u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> ...?
              Query  or modify the configuration options of the widget. If no <u>option</u> is specified, returns a
              list describing all of the available options for <u>pathName</u> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b>  for  informa-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;information</font>
              tion  on  the  format  of  this  list). If option is specified with no value, then the command
              returns a list describing the one named option (this list will be identical to the correspond-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;corresponding</font>
              ing  sublist  of  the  value  returned if no option is specified). If one or more option-value
              pairs are specified, then the command modifies the given widget <!-- a -->option(s)<!-- /a --> to  have  the  given
              <!-- a -->value(s)<!-- /a -->;  in this case the command returns an empty string. <u>Option</u> may have any of the values
              accepted by the iwidgets::tabnotebook command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>delete</b> <u>index1</u> ?<u>index2</u>?
              Delete all of the pages between <u>index1</u> and <u>index2</u> inclusive.  If <u>index2</u>  is  omitted  then  it
              defaults to <u>index1</u>. Returns an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>index</b> <u>index</u>
              Returns the numerical index corresponding to <u>index</u>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>insert</b> <u>index</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> ...?
              Insert  a  new  page  in  the tabnotebook before the page specified by <u>index</u>. A new child site
              <b>frame</b> is created. The additional arguments are the same as for the <b>add</b>  command.  Returns  the
              child site <u>pathName</u>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>next</b>
              Advances  the  selected page to the next page (order is determined by insertion order). If the
              currently selected page is the last page in the notebook, the selection wraps  around  to  the
              first page in the notebook. It behaves as if the user selected the new page.

              For  notebooks  with <b>auto</b> set to <b>true</b> the current page's child site is unpacked from the note-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">book's&nbsp;notebook's</font>
              book's child site frame. Then the next page's child site is packed into the  notebook's  child
              site  frame.  The  Tcl command given with the command option will be invoked between these two
              operations.

              For notebooks with <b>auto</b> set to <b>false</b> the Tcl command given with the  command  option  will  be
              invoked.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>pageconfigure</b> <u>index</u> ?<u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> ...?
              This command is similar to the <b>configure</b> command, except that it applies to the options for an
              individual page, whereas configure applies to the options for  the  tabnotebook  as  a  whole.
              <u>Options</u>  may  have any of the values accepted by the add widget command. If options are speci-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fied,&nbsp;specified,</font>
              fied, options are modified as indicated in the  command  and  the  command  returns  an  empty
              string.  If  no  options are specified, returns a list describing the current options for page
              index (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for information on the format of this list).

       <u>pathName</u> <b>prev</b>
              Moves the selected page to the previous page (order is determined by insertion order). If  the
              currently  selected  page is the first page in the notebook, the selection wraps around to the
              last page in the notebook. It behaves as if the user selected the new page.

              For notebooks with <b>auto</b> set to <b>true</b> the current page's child site is unpacked from  the  note-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">book's&nbsp;notebook's</font>
              book's  child  site  <b>frame</b>.  Then the previous page's child site is packed into the notebook's
              child site frame.  The Tcl command given with the command option will be invoked between these
              two operations.

              For  notebooks  with  <b>auto</b>  set to <b>false</b> the Tcl command given with the command option will be
              invoked.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>select</b> <u>index</u>
              Selects the page specified by <u>index</u> as the currently selected page.  It behaves as if the user
              selected the new page.

              For  notebooks  with <b>auto</b> set to <b>true</b> the current page's child site is unpacked from the note-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">book's&nbsp;notebook's</font>
              book's child site frame. Then the <u>index</u> page's child site is packed into the notebook's  child
              site  frame.  The  Tcl command given with the command option will be invoked between these two
              operations.

              For notebooks with <b>auto</b> set to <b>false</b> the Tcl command given with the  command  option  will  be
              invoked.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>view</b>
              Returns the currently selected page. This command is for compatibility with the <b>scrollbar</b> wid-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">get.&nbsp;widget.</font>
              get.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>view</b> <u>index</u>
              Selects the page specified by <u>index</u> as the currently selected page.  This command is for  com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">patibility&nbsp;compatibility</font>
              patibility with the <b>scrollbar</b> widget.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>view</b> <b>moveto</b> <u>fraction</u>
              Uses  the  <u>fraction</u> value to determine the corresponding page to move to.  This command is for
              compatibility with the <b>scrollbar</b> widget.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>view</b> <b>scroll</b> <u>num</u> <u>what</u>
              Uses the <u>num</u> value to determine how many pages to move forward or backward (<u>num</u> can  be  nega-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tive&nbsp;negative</font>
              tive  or  positive).  The <u>what</u> argument is ignored. This command is for compatibility with the
              <b>scrollbar</b> widget.

<b>COMPONENTS</b>
       Generally all behavior of the internal components, <b>tabset</b> and <b>notebook</b> are controlled via  the  <b>page</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">configure&nbsp;pageconfigure</font>
       <b>configure</b> method.  The following section documents these two components.

       Name:   <b>tabset</b>
       Class:  <b>Tabset</b>

              This  is  the  tabset  component. It implements the tabs that are associated with the notebook
              component.

              See the "<b>Tabset</b>" widget manual entry for details on the <b>tabset</b> component item.

       Name:   <b>notebook</b>
       Class:  <b>Notebook</b>

              This is the notebook component. It implements the notebook that contains the pages of the tab-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">notebook.&nbsp;tabnotebook.</font>
              notebook.

              See the "<b>Notebook</b>" widget manual entry for details on the <b>notebook</b> component item.

<b>EXAMPLE</b>
       Following is an example that creates a tabnotebook with two pages.


              package require Iwidgets 4.0
              # Create the tabnotebook widget and pack it.
                iwidgets::tabnotebook .tn -width 100 -height 100
                pack .tn \
                      -anchor nw \
                      -fill both \
                      -expand yes \
                      -side left \
                      -padx 10 \
                      -pady 10

              # Add two pages to the tabnotebook,
              # labelled "Page One" and "Page Two"
                .tn add -label "Page One"
                .tn add -label "Page Two"

              # Get the child site frames of these two pages.
                set page1CS [.tn childsite 0]
                set page2CS [.tn childsite "Page Two"]

              # Create buttons on each page of the tabnotebook.
                button $page1CS.b -text "Button One"
                pack $page1CS.b
                button $page2CS.b -text "Button Two"
                pack $page2CS.b

              # Select the first page of the tabnotebook.
                .tn select 0
