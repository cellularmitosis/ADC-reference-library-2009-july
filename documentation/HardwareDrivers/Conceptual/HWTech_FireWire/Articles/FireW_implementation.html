<h3>17-inch MacBook Pro Computers (April 2006)</h3>
<p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003892-DontLinkElementID_24"></a>
The 17-inch MacBook Pro computers introduced in April 2006, based on the Intel Core Duo microprocessor, provide one FireWire 400 port and one FireWire 800 port, supported by a single Open HCI FireWire controller with an integrated FireWire 800 PHY (Physical Layer).  The FireWire 400 port supports IEEE 1394a with a maximum data rate of 400 Mbps (50 MBps).  The FireWire 800 port supports IEEE 1394b with a maximum data rate of 800 Mbps (100 MBps).  The Open HCI controller provides the FireWire Link layer and DMA (Direct Memory Access) through the 32-bit 33 MHz PCI interface on the South Bridge.  The integrated PHY implements the electrical signaling protocol and arbitration defined in the IEEE 1394a and IEEE 1394b standards.  </p>
<p>FireWire cable power is present anytime the AC adaptor is powering the system, including shutdown. On battery power, FireWire power is present only during system run and is un-powered in sleep and shutdown to prevent unintentional battery drain.</p>
<p>Both of the FireWire connectors provide unregulated 12 V power, with a maximum combined load of 1.5 A.  Developers should design to use 14 W sustained power, or less.  One port may provide up to 14 W if no power is drawn from the other port, or both ports combined may provide up to a total of 14 W, such as 7 W from each port, simultaneously.   </p>
<div class="notebox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003892-SW7" title="Note"></a>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;
The 17-inch MacBook Pro includes fast-acting over-current protection, hence, FireWire devices that consume cable power must comply with IEEE 1394 section 4.2.2.7 regarding maximum inrush energy.</p>
</div>
<p>Output voltage depends on the system's battery charge level.  Output voltage may be lower when the battery is not fully charged.</p>
<p>Because the 17-inch MacBook Pro has two FireWire ports, the PHY will repeat data between the ports whenever power is available, even if the computer is asleep or off. </p>

<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003892-DontLinkElementID_26"></a>
The Mac mini computers introduced in February 2006, based on the Intel Core Duo microprocessor or Intel Core Solo microprocessor, provide one FireWire 400 port supported by an Open HCI FireWire controller with an integrated FireWire 400 PHY  (Physical Layer).  The port supports IEEE 1394a with a maximum data rate of 400 Mbps (50 MBps).

<h3>Power Mac G5 Computers (October 2005) </h3>
<p>The PowerMac G5 computer has one FireWire 800 port based on IEEE 1394b and two FireWire 400 IEEE 1394a ports. The three FireWire ports are all on the same FireWire bus. They share a single power supply that can provide up to 15 watts total. The FireWire 800 port and the FireWire 400 ports provide a regulated power of approximately 25 VDC. <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003892-DontLinkElementID_27"></a>

</p>
<p>The South Bridge IC provides DMA (direct memory access) support for the FireWire interface. The controller in the South Bridge IC implements the FireWire link layer. The South Bridge IC is connected to the FireWire PHY and implements the electrical signaling protocol of the FireWire interfaces and implements the FireWire arbitration functions.</p>
<p>The PowerMac G5 computer provides front and rear port repeating when the computer is powered on or asleep, and rear port repeating when the system is powered off. The repeater will always appear to be an active device even though nothing is plugged into the port. </p>
