communications	function. The error occurred because the pointer to the communications code	was .errNotAKey	While invoking a font we could not find a key for the desired font number	and style. The error occurred because the font tables got messed up.errFaceListBad	We went looking for an entry in the face list that should be there but	we couldn't find it. See peek.c.errSizeListBad	The size list contained an entry that could not be reconciled with the face	list. See fontHassle.c	errUnknownPICTVersion	When running our own PICT opcode parser we ran into an PICT version	we didn't recognize. See opcodeConvert.cerrUnknownPSLevel	When we queried for the PostScript level we received an answer we	weren't expecting. See query.cerrInLineTimeout	We got tired of waiting for a response from the printer. See formatIn.cerrNoSaveFileName	We tried to get the filename of the PostScript file we will create but	the driver didn't have the name. See pdef0.c or spoolFile.c	errNoProcSetRes	While generating the PostScript prolog we were unable to get the resource	describing the needed procedure sets. See header.c	errBadSpoolFileVersion	While foreground Printing we went to read the header of our spool file but	found that the version number in the header was bad. See pmSupervisor.cerrCouldNotMakeNumberedFilename	See spoolFile.c in numberedFilename(). We were trying to make a unique	filename by adding numbers to the back of a basename. We tried lots of	numbers but still couln't make a unique name.errPSFileNameNull	See spoolFile.c. The flag was set indicating that we should save to disk but	the filename pointer was NULL.errWhereIsSystemFolder	See download.c. If machinesSystemFolder() in machinInfo.c can't find the	system folder then we return this error.errBitmapFontNotLoaded								We called FMSwapFont and the output record contained a fontHandle which was	a handled to a resource which is not loaded.errDidNotDownloadFont	See download.c. This should not be a fatal error but should be caught by the	caller to download(). The error means that a PostScript outline could not	be found for a PostScript font and that we didn't have an 'sfnt' to work	with.	errBadConverterIndex	When saving to disk we look at the jobType in the print record. We couldn't	find a matching entry in ourt 'fSav' resource. See pmSupervisor.cerrNullColorInfo	The function getColor() was called with a NULL GetColorInfo handle. See GetColor.cerrNoPagesSpooled	The applioation made a PrOpenDoc call and a PrCloseDoc call with no PrOpenPage/PrClosePage	calls in between. errBadConverterID	The 'PDEF' we wanted to run as the converter doesn't exist.	See SavePSInterface.cerrNoPattern	We couldn't find or make a pixpat. See PSPattern.c errPSStateUnderflow	We tried to pop our top most gState. See PSClip.c	errChannelNotBinary	Application indicated that it will send binary data with PrGeneral call. After query,	it turns out that the channel is ascii.errPrinterNotLevel2	Application indicated that it will use level 2 operators with PrGeneral call. After query,	it turns out that the printer is a level 1 printer.errBadFontKeyType	We were trying to set a font and the corresponding font key was not of an expected type. errFunctionNotAvailable	We tried to call a callback function that had not been initialized. See	PSClip.herrNULLFormatString	The format string passed to OutFormatVar() in FormatOut.c was NULL. This is	not a good thing.errFontNotFound	A font query reply didn't match any fonts in list of ps names.errNotAFolderAlias	We tried to track down a Print Monitor Document Folder alias but couldn't	because either there wasn't an alias or the alias lead to a file not	a folder. See SpoolFile.c trackDownPMFolder().	errMissingPAPA	We went looking for the driver's PAPA resource but we couldn't find it. This is very bad.	DMG589 Returning this error when psCreateDMJobCollection is called with a NULL PapaHandle.errMissingPrinterInfo	The current printer does not have an entry in the printer database. On entry in the database	is required since it is there we hold the current print mode. 	errGlyphsDontFit	In FontUtilitiees.c, we were trying to output some TrueType glyph definitions into	64K PostScript strings but we were unable to get even one glyph to fit. The code	requires the glyphs to end on long word boundaries so failure to meet that condition	was most likely the problem. errProfileNotInList	In ColorSyncUtil.c, we tried to use/close a temporary profile that was not in	our list of temporary profiles. errUnsupportedStream	The PSStream type passed in to a given library call is not supported.errHintWrongSize	One of the converter's hints was a different size than expected. 		errSystemProfileNotFound	In JobHeader.c when trying to setup the color handling information playback, we	got a hint to tell us to use ColorSync color matching and the destination profile	hint was not found. When we went to use the system profile as the default for this case,	we couldn't get the System profile. At that point we are hosed.			errPSStreamNullOutProc	The converter call psConvOpenDoc was passed a PSPrintStream type PSStream,	but the function pointer for the output routine was NULL. errTriedToWriteNullBuffer	In PrStream.c, one of the routines tried to write a buffer that does not	exist. This should never happen.errWhoTookThatOutBuffer	In PrStream, we tried to dequeue a write buffer, but it disappeared. The async	code should have been stopped and therefore shouldn't have take the buffer.errMoreDataToFlush	When the converter tells the client to flush its buffers, the client is	expected to return quickly. The client returns this error if it did not	finish flushing. The converter will then call the flush routine again. rb852errWrongStructVersion	A caller to one of the externally visable API's (NessieInfoLib is an example)	passed in a version of a structure that is not compatable with the current	version of the code.	errInvalidLibraryNumber	A caller of the function getLibraryVersion supplied an invalid library number.	errMissedTTFont	We were about to make a bitmap font for the printer, but came across an 'sfnt'	resource. This means that we misclassified a TrueType font. See DumpBMFont.c	rb1008errNoRoomInPapa	In Papa.c, we tried to add a tag to an extended papa and there was not enough room	for it. errInvalidDTPType	Returned from psGetDTPType, this error code indicates that the PAPA described an	invalid/unrecognized desktop printer type. 	errBadLibraryVersion		The library version available doesn't contain the routines we need so we can't use it.	Initially this is because we now rely on the streams code availability in PSUtilsLib	but there will be other reasons in the future.		errCantFGorBGPrint	Certain jobs require that the printing app can accept high level events or that we are	printing background to Nessie.  If neither is available we will return this error.	errInvalidPluginSubType	Returned by the Plug-ins Manager if it the requested subtype is of an invalid subtype.	The only invalid subtype is that it uses internally to cache the information	about what libraries support a given type.errInvalidExtendedPapa	In PAPA.c, we wanted to walk the tags in an extended PAPA, but the extended PAPA	looked bad.	errInvalidPluginsCache	Even though we validated the plugin's cache before beginning to use it, we got an error	that indicated the cache was not valid.	errInvalidDownloaderInfo	A Download Manager client passed us a DownloadInfo structure that is no longer valid. The way	this might occur is if it took one we returned and stored it away for later use. If in the meantime	the user has moved plugins out of the plugins folder or replaced PrintingLib with a different version	and	the DownloadInfo structure passed references a modified or non-existent file, then this error	is returned.errCantMakeStreamForDTP	A Download Manager client passed a PAPA resource to psDownloadFile for a DTP type that we don't know how to 	support. If the same PAPA is passed to psCanDownloadFile we will say we can't download the file. This	scenario is unlikely to happen, but it can happen if the DM client calls psCanDownloadFile with one PAPA	and then calls psDownloadFile with another. This would happen if, for example, Nessie failed to again	call psCanDownloadFile if a 'spool' file intended for the Download Manager were dragged from one DTP	to another.errRequiresJava	The routine called requires JManager, but it was not available.	This error is returned from ppdWebSearchDlg() and ppdWebSearch(). 	errRequiresThread	The routine called requires the Thread Manager which was not available.	This error is returned from ppdWebSearchDlg() and ppdWebSearch(). 	errRequiresAppearance	The routine called requires the Appearance Manager which was not available.	This error is returned from ppdWebSearchDlg().	errHoseCantBeUsed	A hose returns this error on the open call if it cannot be used. The initial use of this error 	is for the Open Transport PAP hose -- it's returned if OT is not installed or doesn't meet the 	version requirement.errSalamanderNotAvailable	A comm channel was chosen that required the Salamander library but it isn't available. This should	only happen with our own internal builds but to be safe I'm adding an error code.errJavaFailure	We were unable to use the Java VMN even though it was available. This error will occur	if we can't get a session or if one of the java.* classes that should be available	is not. See WebPPD.h	errBadParsePPD	The psAutoSetup routine in the NessieInfoLib was asked to setup the PPD but the PPD that was	selected had a parsing error. The Generic PPD is substituted.errNeedsManualConfig	The psAutoSetup routine could not complete the setup because either there are installable options	for which there are no queries or the installable options query failed.		errDTPNotFound	This error is returned from the function psNessieFindDTP() if it	was unable to find a DTP that matched the specified driver and PAPA.	errFatalPrinterErr	This error is used when there is a fatal printer error reported by the printer but it	is not a PostScript error. I'm not sure when this occurs other than for serious printer bugs.	errCouldNotMoveSpoolFile	Returned in PrDraft.c this error occurs if we spooled into the temp file of a volume	that was different than the eventual destination of the spool file. This can only	happen if a DTP not on the boot volume is deleted between the time a spool job	is started and it is finished.errNoFontObject	We did not convert StdText calls to ATSUI format because we either could	not get a FontObject or a font scaler for the requested font and face.	This is not a fatal error, it just prevents us from doing partial fonts	for that font. See StdTextToATS.c errNoFontEncoding	We could not find the proper encoding for a font when trying to convert StdText	to ATSUI. This is not a fatal error. See StdTextATS.c errApplyEncoding	We could not convert StdText character codes into glyph codes while converting	StdText to ATSUI text. This is not a fatal error. See StdTextAts.c rb2178errPSNameTooBig	The PostScript name returned by OFA was larger than we were capable of using.	See getFontObjPSName() in FontHassle.c.  	errBadlyFormedBitmapFont	We detected that the bitmap font data had a first character value or last character	value that was out of range.		errBadlyFormedFond	We detected a FOND that had a first character value or last character value that	was out of range.		errUSBHoseOldClassDriver	The USB hose returns this error when the underlying USB printer class driver is too old.	This is an issue because of bugs in it with releases 1.0 & 1.1 (hopefully fixed in 1.2).errNeedPowerPC		8.6.5 requires power pc architecture. errBadLPRDeviceOrAddress					errNoLPRConnection					Timeout error trying to connect to LPR device.			errLPRConnectionError				Error when connecting to LPR printer.  Likely cause is a misconfigured or inactive tcp/ip service.errUnableToDoNewIrdaConnection				Error when connecting to IR device.*********************/#endif		// __PSWRITERERR__
