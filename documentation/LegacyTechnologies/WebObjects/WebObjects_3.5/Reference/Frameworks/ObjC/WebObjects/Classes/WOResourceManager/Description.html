<P>
WOResourceManager manages an application's resources. It defines methods that retrieve resources from standard directories. Each WebObjects application contains a resource manager object, which you can access by sending <B>resourceManager</B> to the <A HREF="../WOApplication/WOApplication.html" target=_top>WOApplication</A> class
<P>
An application contains standard directories that store application resources. 
A deployed WebObjects application typically has the following directories:
<PRE><I>NeXT_ROOT</I>/NextLibrary/WOApps/<I>MyApp</I>/
	MyApp[.exe]
	Resources/
	WebServerResources/

<I>DocRoot</I>/WebObjects/<I>MyApp</I>/
	WebServerResources/
</PRE>
<P>
The <B>Resources</B> directory contains the component directories, the application and session script files (if any), and any other resource files that an application might need access to (for example, plists or EOModel files). The <B>WebServerResources</B> directory contains resources that both the application and the HTTP server might need access to, such as image files that should be displayed in the browser. Because the HTTP server needs access to these files, the <B>WebServerResources</B> directory is mirrored under the document root.
<P>
Alternatively, you can place the entire application directory under the document root, but doing so represents a security risk because you allow outside access to all internal files through the document root.
<P>
Project Builder helps you make the distinction between application resources and HTTP server resources. You place components under Web Components, application resources under Resources, and HTTP server resources under WebServerResources. When you build the project, Project Builder copies the resources into the appropriate subdirectories of the <B>.woa</B>.

<H3>Shared Resource Directories</H3>
<P>
You can access shared resource files by specifying a framework name when retrieving the resource. WOResourceManager can locate all frameworks that have been linked to the application. (In Project Builder, you should add the framework to the project under Frameworks.)
<P>
A WebObjects framework typically has the following directories:
<PRE><I>NeXTROOT</I>/NextLibrary/Frameworks/<I>MyFramework</I>/
	Resources/
	WebServerResources/

<I>DocRoot</I>/WebObjects/Frameworks/<I>MyFramework</I>/
	WebServerResources/
</PRE>
The resource directories of the framework contain the same types of resources as an application: components, plists, EOModels, and any other type of resource.

<H3>Development Shortcut</H3>
<P>
When you're in development mode, you typically do not have an application installed in <I>NeXT_ROOT</I><B>/NextLibrary/WOApps</B>. Instead you have a project directory under the document root, and the built <B>.woa</B> directory is inside that project directory. As a convenience for debugging, WOResourceManager looks one level up from the <B>.woa</B> directory to see if the directory is inside of a project directory. If it is, WOResourceManager uses the components and resources from the project directory instead of the resources inside the <B>Resources</B> and <B>WebServerResources</B> directories of the <B>.woa</B> directory. This way, you can edit scripts or replace images and other resource files in the project and not have to rebuild the application.

<H3>Localized Resources</H3>
<P>
Localization in WebObjects depends on an array of languages stored in the WOSession object using WOSession's <B>setLanguages:</B>. The order of languages indicates the preferred order. Localized resources are located in <I>Language</I><B>.lproj</B> subdirectories under the <B>Resources</B> or <B>WebServerResources</B> directories. The <B>.lproj</B> directories are always searched before the top-level resource directory is searched to ensure that if a localized resource is available, it will be used.
<P>
WOResourceManager does not have API for reading the localization <B>.strings</B> file. To access the <B>.strings</B> file use the method <B>stringForKey:inTableNamed:withDefaultValue:</B> in either <A HREF="../WOApplication/WOApplication.html" target=_top>WOApplication</A> or <A HREF="../WOComponent/WOComponent.html" target=_top>WOComponent</A>.
<P>

<H3>Search Path for Resources</H3>
<P>
When WOResourceManager searches for a resource, it searches either in the framework you specify or in the application (if you use <B>nil</B> for the framework argument). The following directories are searched in this order:
<UL>
<P><LI>
Any <I>Language</I><B>.lproj</B> subdirectories of the  <B>WebServerResources</B> directory
<P><LI>
The <B>WebServerResources</B> directory 
<P><LI>
Any <I>Language</I><B>.lproj</B> subdirectories of the <B>Resources</B> directory
<P><LI>
The <B>Resources</B> directory
<P><LI>
If the application is being searched, the top level of the application directory (<B>.woa</B>) 
</UL>

<P>
Returns the absolute path for the resource <I>aResourceFile</I>. Include the file's extension when specifying <I>aResourceFile</I>. If the file is in the application, specify <B>nil</B> for the framework argument. 
<P>
This method always returns a path like <I>NeXT_ROOT</I><B>/NextLibrary/WOApps/</B><I>MyApp</I><B>.woa/WebServerResources/</B><I>MyResource</I>. It does not return the path relative to the HTTP server's document root unless the entire application is located in the document root.

   <TT>- (NSString *)<B>urlForResourceNamed:</B>(NSString *)<I>aResourceFile</I> <B>inFramework:</B>(NSString *)<I>aFrameworkName</I> </TT>
<P>
Returns the URL associated with a resource named <I>aResourceFile</I>. The URL returned is of the following form:
<PRE>WebObjects/<I>MyApp</I>.woa/WebServerResources/English.lproj/<I>aResourceFile</I></PRE> 
<P>
Include the file's extension when specifying <I>aResourceFile</I>. If the file is in the application, specify <B>nil</B> for the framework argument.
<P>
This method locates resources under the application or framework. The URL returned is computed by concatenating the application's base URL (returned by WOApplication's <B>baseURL</B> method) and the relative path of the resource. This method does <I>not</I> check to see if the file is actually under the document root. For example, if your application is installed in <I>NeXT_ROOT</I><B>/NextLibrary/WOApps</B>, and the method finds <I>aResourceFile</I> in the <B>Resources</B> directory, it returns:
<PRE>/WebObjects/<I>MyApp</I>.woa/Resources/<I>aResourceFile</I></PRE>
even though the <B>Resources</B> directory is not under the document root.
