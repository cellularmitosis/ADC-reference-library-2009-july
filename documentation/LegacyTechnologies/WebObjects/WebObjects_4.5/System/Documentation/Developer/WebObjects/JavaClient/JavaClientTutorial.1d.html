When an attribute is a class property, it means that the property will be included in your class definition and that it can be fetched from the database. To put it another way, only attributes that are marked as class properties become part of your enterprise objects.</P><A NAME="pgfId=1006496"> </A>You should only mark as class properties those attributes whose values are meaningful in the objects that are created when you fetch from the database. Attributes that are essentially database artifacts, such as primary and foreign keys, shouldn't be marked as class properties unless the key has meaning to the user and must be displayed in the user interface.
