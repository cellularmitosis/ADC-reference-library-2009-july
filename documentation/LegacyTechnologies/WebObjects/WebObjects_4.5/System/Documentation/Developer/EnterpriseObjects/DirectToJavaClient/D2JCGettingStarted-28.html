This is fine; users need to be able to edit all of a customer's data. However, the properties are ordered poorly. A customer's name should come first, and the components of a customer's address should be grouped together and ordered so they appear as a proper address.</P><OL><LI><A NAME="pgfId-23626"></A>Order the Customer form property keys as follows: <B>firstName</B>, <B>lastName</B>, <B>memberSince</B>, <B>phone</B>, <B>streetAddress</B>, <B>city</B>, <B>state</B>, <B>zip</B>, <B>creditCard</B>, <B>rentals</B>.<P><LI><A NAME="pgfId-23627"></A>Examine the Credit Card pane at the bottom of the Customer window.<P><A NAME="pgfId-23628"></A>The property keys are poorly ordered, and the "Num" in the "Authorization Num" label should be spelled out.<P><LI><A NAME="pgfId-23629"></A>Using the Properties Assistant, order CreditCard's form property keys as: <B>cardNumber</B>, <B>expirationDate</B>, <B>limit</B>, <B>authorizationNum</B>, <B>authorizationDate</B>, <B>customer</B>.<P><A NAME="pgfId-23630"></A>Note that <B>customer</B> is a to-one relationship from CreditCard to Customer. Ordinarily, a to-one relationship is represented in a form, but <B>customer</B> isn't represented here. That's because Direct to Java Client filters the <B>customer</B> property key out of the user interface rather than display it recursively. Since the CreditCard form is contained within a Customer form, Customer information is already displayed. This feature is called <I>entity hierarchy filtering.</I><P><UL><B>Warning:&nbsp;</B>Be careful about removing relationships from the set of property keys. Even though a relationship isn't necessary for a window you're looking at, it might be needed by another window.<BR><BR>As an example, consider the MovieRole entity, which has to-one relationships to Movie and Talent. Similarly, Movie and Talent have to-many relationships back to their MovieRoles. Since MovieRole is an "other" entity, MovieRole records are manipulated in a master-detail user interface in Movie and Talent form windows. In a Movie form window, the interface for displaying and setting a MovieRole's value uses only the <B>roleName</B> attribute and the <B>talent</B> relationship. Entity hierarchy filtering prevents the interface from using the <B>movie</B> relationship.<BR><BR>When you're looking at the Movie form window, you might consider removing MovieRole's <B>movie</B> relationship from the form task's property keys. It's filtered out, but you might think of removing it anyway for clarity. However, if you remove it, the <B>movie</B> relationship won't be displayed in the Talent form window either. In the Talent window a MovieRole's <B>movie</B> relationship is important information.</P></UL><LI><A NAME="pgfId-23632"></A>In the Widgets pane of the Assistant, change the <B>authorizationNum</B> label to "Authorization Number."<P><LI><A NAME="pgfId-23633"></A>Examine the Rentals pane.<P><A NAME="pgfId-23634"></A>The Rentals pane looks OK, so move on to the next form window.<P></OL><HR>&#169 1999 Apple Computer, Inc. &#150 (Draft.
