CI(1)                                                                                                  CI(1)



<b>NAME</b>
       ci - check in RCS revisions

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>ci</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>file</u> ...

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       <b>ci</b>  stores  new revisions into RCS files.  Each pathname matching an RCS suffix is taken to be an RCS
       file.  All others are assumed to be working files containing new revisions.  <b>ci</b> deposits the contents
       of  each  working file into the corresponding RCS file.  If only a working file is given, <b>ci</b> tries to
       find the corresponding RCS file in an RCS subdirectory and then in the working file's directory.  For
       more details, see FILE NAMING below.

       For  <b>ci</b> to work, the caller's login must be on the access list, except if the access list is empty or
       the caller is the superuser or the owner of the file.  To  append  a  new  revision  to  an  existing
       branch,  the  tip revision on that branch must be locked by the caller.  Otherwise, only a new branch
       can be created.  This restriction is not enforced for the owner of the file if non-strict locking  is
       used (see <a href="rcs.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/rcs"><b>rcs</b>(1)</a>).  A lock held by someone else can be broken with the <b>rcs</b> command.

       Unless  the  <b>-f</b> option is given, <b>ci</b> checks whether the revision to be deposited differs from the pre-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ceding&nbsp;preceding</font>
       ceding one.  If not, instead of creating a new revision <b>ci</b> reverts to the preceding one.  To  revert,
       ordinary  <b>ci</b>  removes the working file and any lock; <b>ci</b> <b>-l</b> keeps and <b>ci</b> <b>-u</b> removes any lock, and then
       they both generate a new working file much as if <b>co</b> <b>-l</b> or <b>co</b> <b>-u</b> had been  applied  to  the  preceding
       revision.  When reverting, any <b>-n</b> and <b>-s</b> options apply to the preceding revision.

       For  each  revision  deposited,  <b>ci</b>  prompts for a log message.  The log message should summarize the
       change and must be terminated by end-of-file or by a line containing <b>.</b> by itself.  If  several  files
       are  checked  in  <b>ci</b>  asks whether to reuse the previous log message.  If the standard input is not a
       terminal, <b>ci</b> suppresses the prompt and uses the same log message for all files.  See also <b>-m</b>.

       If the RCS file does not exist, <b>ci</b> creates it and deposits the contents of the working  file  as  the
       initial revision (default number: <b>1.1</b>).  The access list is initialized to empty.  Instead of the log
       message, <b>ci</b> requests descriptive text (see <b>-t</b> below).

       The number <u>rev</u> of the deposited revision can be given by any of the options <b>-f</b>, <b>-i</b>, <b>-I</b>, <b>-j</b>,  <b>-k</b>,  <b>-l</b>,
       <b>-M</b>,  <b>-q</b>,  <b>-r</b>,  or <b>-u</b>.  <u>rev</u> can be symbolic, numeric, or mixed.  Symbolic names in <u>rev</u> must already be
       defined; see the <b>-n</b> and <b>-N</b> options for assigning names during checkin.  If <u>rev</u> is  <b>$</b>,  <b>ci</b>  determines
       the revision number from keyword values in the working file.

       If <u>rev</u> begins with a period, then the default branch (normally the trunk) is prepended to it.  If <u>rev</u>
       is a branch number followed by a period, then the latest revision on that branch is used.

       If <u>rev</u> is a revision number, it must be higher than the  latest  one  on  the  branch  to  which  <u>rev</u>
       belongs, or must start a new branch.

       If  <u>rev</u>  is a branch rather than a revision number, the new revision is appended to that branch.  The
       level number is obtained by incrementing the tip revision number of that branch.  If <u>rev</u> indicates  a
       non-existing branch, that branch is created with the initial revision numbered <u>rev</u><b>.1</b>.

       If  <u>rev</u>  is  omitted, <b>ci</b> tries to derive the new revision number from the caller's last lock.  If the
       caller has locked the tip revision of a branch, the new revision is appended to that branch.  The new
       revision  number is obtained by incrementing the tip revision number.  If the caller locked a non-tip
       revision, a new branch is started at that revision by incrementing the highest branch number at  that
       revision.  The default initial branch and level numbers are <b>1</b>.

       If  <u>rev</u>  is  omitted  and the caller has no lock, but owns the file and locking is not set to <u>strict</u>,
       then the revision is appended to the default branch  (normally  the  trunk;  see  the  <b>-b</b>  option  of
       <a href="rcs.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/rcs"><b>rcs</b>(1)</a>).

       Exception: On the trunk, revisions can be appended to the end, but not inserted.

<b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-r</b><u>rev</u>  Check in revision <u>rev</u>.

       <b>-r</b>     The  bare  <b>-r</b> option (without any revision) has an unusual meaning in <b>ci</b>.  With other RCS com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mands,&nbsp;commands,</font>
              mands, a bare <b>-r</b> option specifies the most recent revision on the default branch, but with <b>ci</b>,
              a bare <b>-r</b> option reestablishes the default behavior of releasing a lock and removing the work-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;working</font>
              ing file, and is used to override any default <b>-l</b> or <b>-u</b> options established by shell aliases or
              scripts.

       <b>-l</b>[<u>rev</u>]
              works  like  <b>-r</b>, except it performs an additional <b>co</b> <b>-l</b> for the deposited revision.  Thus, the
              deposited revision is immediately checked out again and locked.  This is useful for  saving  a
              revision although one wants to continue editing it after the checkin.

       <b>-u</b>[<u>rev</u>]
              works like <b>-l</b>, except that the deposited revision is not locked.  This lets one read the work-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;working</font>
              ing file immediately after checkin.

              The <b>-l</b>, bare <b>-r</b>, and <b>-u</b> options are mutually exclusive and silently override each other.   For
              example, <b>ci</b> <b>-u</b> <b>-r</b> is equivalent to <b>ci</b> <b>-r</b> because bare <b>-r</b> overrides <b>-u</b>.

       <b>-f</b>[<u>rev</u>]
              forces  a  deposit;  the new revision is deposited even it is not different from the preceding
              one.

       <b>-k</b>[<u>rev</u>]
              searches the working file for keyword values to determine its revision number, creation  date,
              state, and author (see <a href="co.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/co"><b>co</b>(1)</a>), and assigns these values to the deposited revision, rather than
              computing them locally.  It also generates a default login message noting  the  login  of  the
              caller and the actual checkin date.  This option is useful for software distribution.  A revi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion&nbsp;revision</font>
              sion that is sent to several sites should be checked in with the <b>-k</b> option at these  sites  to
              preserve  the  original number, date, author, and state.  The extracted keyword values and the
              default log message can be overridden with the options <b>-d</b>, <b>-m</b>, <b>-s</b>, <b>-w</b>,  and  any  option  that
              carries a revision number.

       <b>-q</b>[<u>rev</u>]
              quiet  mode; diagnostic output is not printed.  A revision that is not different from the pre-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ceding&nbsp;preceding</font>
              ceding one is not deposited, unless <b>-f</b> is given.

       <b>-i</b>[<u>rev</u>]
              initial checkin; report an error if the RCS file already exists.  This avoids race  conditions
              in certain applications.

       <b>-j</b>[<u>rev</u>]
              just checkin and do not initialize; report an error if the RCS file does not already exist.

       <b>-I</b>[<u>rev</u>]
              interactive mode; the user is prompted and questioned even if the standard input is not a ter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">minal.&nbsp;terminal.</font>
              minal.

       <b>-d</b>[<u>date</u>]
              uses <u>date</u> for the checkin date and time.  The <u>date</u> is specified in free format as explained in
              <a href="co.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/co"><b>co</b>(1)</a>.   This  is useful for lying about the checkin date, and for <b>-k</b> if no date is available.
              If <u>date</u> is empty, the working file's time of last modification is used.

       <b>-M</b>[<u>rev</u>]
              Set the modification time on any new working file to be the date of  the  retrieved  revision.
              For  example,  <b>ci</b> <b>-d</b> <b>-M</b> <b>-u</b> <u>f</u> does not alter <u>f</u>'s modification time, even if <u>f</u>'s contents change
              due to keyword substitution.  Use this option with care; it can confuse <a href="make.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/make"><b>make</b>(1)</a>.

       <b>-m</b><u>msg</u>  uses the string <u>msg</u> as the log message for all revisions checked in.  By convention, log  mes-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sages&nbsp;messages</font>
              sages  that start with <b>#</b> are comments and are ignored by programs like GNU Emacs's <b>vc</b> package.
              Also, log messages that start with <b>{</b><u>clumpname</u><b>}</b> (followed by  white  space)  are  meant  to  be
              clumped  together  if  possible, even if they are associated with different files; the <b>{</b><u>clump</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">name}&nbsp;{clumpname}</font>
              <u>name</u><b>}</b> label is used only for clumping, and is not considered to be part  of  the  log  message
              itself.

       <b>-n</b><u>name</u> assigns  the  symbolic name <u>name</u> to the number of the checked-in revision.  <b>ci</b> prints an error
              message if <u>name</u> is already assigned to another number.

       <b>-N</b><u>name</u> same as <b>-n</b>, except that it overrides a previous assignment of <u>name</u>.

       <b>-s</b><u>state</u>
              sets the state of the checked-in revision to the identifier <u>state</u>.  The default state is  <b>Exp</b>.

       <b>-t</b><u>file</u> writes  descriptive  text  from the contents of the named <u>file</u> into the RCS file, deleting the
              existing text.  The <u>file</u> cannot begin with <b>-</b>.

       <b>-t-</b><u>string</u>
              Write descriptive text from the <u>string</u> into the RCS file, deleting the existing text.

              The <b>-t</b> option, in both its forms, has effect only during an initial checkin;  it  is  silently
              ignored otherwise.

              During  the initial checkin, if <b>-t</b> is not given, <b>ci</b> obtains the text from standard input, ter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">minated&nbsp;terminated</font>
              minated by end-of-file or by a line containing <b>.</b> by itself.  The user is prompted for the text
              if interaction is possible; see <b>-I</b>.

              For backward compatibility with older versions of RCS, a bare <b>-t</b> option is ignored.

       <b>-T</b>     Set  the  RCS  file's  modification time to the new revision's time if the former precedes the
              latter and there is a new revision; preserve the RCS file's modification time  otherwise.   If
              you have locked a revision, <b>ci</b> usually updates the RCS file's modification time to the current
              time, because the lock is stored in the RCS file and removing the lock requires  changing  the
              RCS  file.  This can create an RCS file newer than the working file in one of two ways: first,
              <b>ci</b> <b>-M</b> can create a working file with a date before the current time; second, when reverting to
              the previous revision the RCS file can change while the working file remains unchanged.  These
              two cases can cause excessive recompilation caused by a <a href="make.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/make"><b>make</b>(1)</a> dependency of the working file
              on  the  RCS  file.   The  <b>-T</b> option inhibits this recompilation by lying about the RCS file's
              date.  Use this option with care; it can suppress recompilation even when  a  checkin  of  one
              working  file should affect another working file associated with the same RCS file.  For exam-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ple,&nbsp;example,</font>
              ple, suppose the RCS file's time is 01:00, the (changed) working file's time  is  02:00,  some
              other  copy  of  the  working  file  has a time of 03:00, and the current time is 04:00.  Then
              <b>ci</b> <b>-d</b> <b>-T</b> sets the RCS file's time to 02:00 instead of the usual 04:00; this causes <a href="make.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/make"><b>make</b>(1)</a>  to
              think (incorrectly) that the other copy is newer than the RCS file.

       <b>-w</b><u>login</u>
              uses <u>login</u> for the author field of the deposited revision.  Useful for lying about the author,
              and for <b>-k</b> if no author is available.

       <b>-V</b>     Print RCS's version number.

       <b>-V</b><u>n</u>    Emulate RCS version <u>n</u>.  See <a href="co.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/co"><b>co</b>(1)</a> for details.

       <b>-x</b><u>suffixes</u>
              specifies the suffixes for RCS files.  A nonempty suffix matches any pathname  ending  in  the
              suffix.  An empty suffix matches any pathname of the form <b>RCS/</b><u>path</u> or <u>path1</u><b>/RCS/</b><u>path2.</u>  The <b>-x</b>
              option can specify a list of suffixes separated by <b>/</b>.  For example, <b>-x,v/</b> specifies  two  suf-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fixes:&nbsp;suffixes:</font>
              fixes:  <b>,v</b>  and  the  empty  suffix.  If two or more suffixes are specified, they are tried in
              order when looking for an RCS file; the first one that works is used for that file.  If no RCS
              file is found but an RCS file can be created, the suffixes are tried in order to determine the
              new RCS file's name.  The default for <u>suffixes</u> is installation-dependent; normally it  is  <b>,v/</b>
              for hosts like Unix that permit commas in filenames, and is empty (i.e. just the empty suffix)
              for other hosts.

       <b>-z</b><u>zone</u> specifies the date output format in keyword substitution, and specifies the default time  zone
              for <u>date</u> in the <b>-d</b><u>date</u> option.  The <u>zone</u> should be empty, a numeric UTC offset, or the special
              string <b>LT</b> for local time.  The default is an empty <u>zone</u>, which uses the traditional RCS format
              of  UTC  without  any  time zone indication and with slashes separating the parts of the date;
              otherwise, times are output in ISO 8601 format with time zone  indication.   For  example,  if
              local  time  is January 11, 1990, 8pm Pacific Standard Time, eight hours west of UTC, then the
              time is output as follows:

                     <u>option</u>    <u>time</u> <u>output</u>
                     <b>-z</b>        <b>1990/01/12</b> <b>04:00:00</b>        <u>(default)</u>
                     <b>-zLT</b>      <b>1990-01-11</b> <b>20:00:00-08</b>
                     <b>-z+05:30</b>  <b>1990-01-12</b> <b>09:30:00+05:30</b>

              The <b>-z</b> option does not affect dates stored in RCS files, which are always UTC.

<b>FILE</b> <b>NAMING</b>
       Pairs of RCS files and working files can be specified in three ways (see also the example section).

       1) Both the RCS file and the working file are given.  The RCS pathname is of the form <u>path1</u><b>/</b><u>workfileX</u>
       and  the working pathname is of the form <u>path2</u><b>/</b><u>workfile</u> where <u>path1</u><b>/</b> and <u>path2</u><b>/</b> are (possibly differ-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ent&nbsp;different</font>
       ent or empty) paths, <u>workfile</u> is a filename, and <u>X</u> is an RCS suffix.  If  <u>X</u>  is  empty,  <u>path1</u><b>/</b>  must
       start with <b>RCS/</b> or must contain <b>/RCS/</b>.

       2)  Only  the  RCS  file is given.  Then the working file is created in the current directory and its
       name is derived from the name of the RCS file by removing <u>path1</u><b>/</b> and the suffix <u>X</u>.

       3) Only the working file is given.  Then <b>ci</b> considers each RCS suffix <u>X</u> in turn, looking for  an  RCS
       file  of  the  form <u>path2</u><b>/RCS/</b><u>workfileX</u> or (if the former is not found and <u>X</u> is nonempty) <u>path2</u><b>/</b><u>work</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fileX.&nbsp;path2/workfileX.</font>
       <u>fileX.</u>

       If the RCS file is specified without a path in 1) and 2), <b>ci</b> looks for the  RCS  file  first  in  the
       directory <b>./RCS</b> and then in the current directory.

       <b>ci</b>  reports  an  error if an attempt to open an RCS file fails for an unusual reason, even if the RCS
       file's pathname is just one of several possibilities.  For example, to suppress use of  RCS  commands
       in  a directory <u>d</u>, create a regular file named <u>d</u><b>/RCS</b> so that casual attempts to use RCS commands in <u>d</u>
       fail because <u>d</u><b>/RCS</b> is not a directory.

<b>EXAMPLES</b>
       Suppose <b>,v</b> is an RCS suffix and the current directory contains a subdirectory <b>RCS</b> with  an  RCS  file
       <b>io.c,v</b>.   Then  each  of the following commands check in a copy of <b>io.c</b> into <b>RCS/io.c,v</b> as the latest
       revision, removing <b>io.c</b>.

              <b>ci</b>  <b>io.c;</b>    <b>ci</b>  <b>RCS/io.c,v;</b>   <b>ci</b>  <b>io.c,v;</b>
              <b>ci</b>  <b>io.c</b>  <b>RCS/io.c,v;</b>    <b>ci</b>  <b>io.c</b>  <b>io.c,v;</b>
              <b>ci</b>  <b>RCS/io.c,v</b>  <b>io.c;</b>    <b>ci</b>  <b>io.c,v</b>  <b>io.c;</b>

       Suppose instead that the empty suffix is an RCS suffix and the current directory contains a subdirec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tory&nbsp;subdirectory</font>
       tory <b>RCS</b> with an RCS file <b>io.c</b>.  The each of the following commands checks in a new revision.

              <b>ci</b>  <b>io.c;</b>    <b>ci</b>  <b>RCS/io.c;</b>
              <b>ci</b>  <b>io.c</b>  <b>RCS/io.c;</b>
              <b>ci</b>  <b>RCS/io.c</b>  <b>io.c;</b>

<b>FILE</b> <b>MODES</b>
       An  RCS  file  created by <b>ci</b> inherits the read and execute permissions from the working file.  If the
       RCS file exists already, <b>ci</b> preserves its read and execute permissions.   <b>ci</b>  always  turns  off  all
       write permissions of RCS files.

<b>FILES</b>
       Temporary  files  are created in the directory containing the working file, and also in the temporary
       directory (see <b>TMPDIR</b> under <b>ENVIRONMENT</b>).  A semaphore file or files are  created  in  the  directory
       containing  the RCS file.  With a nonempty suffix, the semaphore names begin with the first character
       of the suffix; therefore, do not specify an suffix whose first character could be that of  a  working
       filename.   With  an empty suffix, the semaphore names end with <b>_</b> so working filenames should not end
       in <b>_</b>.

       <b>ci</b> never changes an RCS or working file.  Normally, <b>ci</b> unlinks the file and creates a  new  one;  but
       instead  of breaking a chain of one or more symbolic links to an RCS file, it unlinks the destination
       file instead.  Therefore, <b>ci</b> breaks any hard or symbolic links to any working file  it  changes;  and
       hard links to RCS files are ineffective, but symbolic links to RCS files are preserved.

       The effective user must be able to search and write the directory containing the RCS file.  Normally,
       the real user must be able to read the RCS and working files and to search and  write  the  directory
       containing  the  working file; however, some older hosts cannot easily switch between real and effec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tive&nbsp;effective</font>
       tive users, so on these hosts the effective user is used for all accesses.  The effective user is the
       same  as  the  real user unless your copies of <b>ci</b> and <b>co</b> have setuid privileges.  As described in the
       next section, these privileges yield extra security if the effective user  owns  all  RCS  files  and
       directories, and if only the effective user can write RCS directories.

       Users  can  control  access  to  RCS files by setting the permissions of the directory containing the
       files; only users with write access to the directory can use RCS commands to change  its  RCS  files.
       For  example,  in  hosts  that  allow  a user to belong to several groups, one can make a group's RCS
       directories writable to that group only.  This approach suffices for informal projects, but it  means
       that  any  group  member  can  arbitrarily  change  the  group's  RCS files, and can even remove them
       entirely.  Hence more formal projects sometimes distinguish between an  RCS  administrator,  who  can
       change  the  RCS  files at will, and other project members, who can check in new revisions but cannot
       otherwise change the RCS files.

<b>SETUID</b> <b>USE</b>
       To prevent anybody but their RCS administrator from deleting revisions, a set  of  users  can  employ
       setuid privileges as follows.

        Check that the host supports RCS setuid use.  Consult a trustworthy expert if there are any doubts.
         It is best if the <b>seteuid</b> system call works as described in Posix 1003.1a Draft 5, because RCS  can
         switch  back  and forth easily between real and effective users, even if the real user is <b>root</b>.  If
         not, the second best is if the <b>setuid</b> system call supports  saved  setuid  (the  {_POSIX_SAVED_IDS}
         behavior  of  Posix  1003.1-1990);  this  fails only if the real or effective user is <b>root</b>.  If RCS
         detects any failure in setuid, it quits immediately.

        Choose a user <u>A</u> to serve as RCS administrator for the set of users.  Only <u>A</u> can invoke the <b>rcs</b> com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
         mand  on  the users' RCS files.  <u>A</u> should not be <b>root</b> or any other user with special powers.  Mutu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ally&nbsp;Mutually</font>
         ally suspicious sets of users should use different administrators.

        Choose a pathname <u>B</u> to be a directory of files to be executed by the users.

        Have <u>A</u> set up <u>B</u> to contain copies of <b>ci</b> and <b>co</b> that are setuid to <u>A</u> by copying  the  commands  from
         their standard installation directory <u>D</u> as follows:

              <b>mkdir</b>  <u>B</u>
              <b>cp</b>  <u>D</u><b>/c[io]</b>  <u>B</u>
              <b>chmod</b>  <b>go-w,u+s</b>  <u>B</u><b>/c[io]</b>

        Have each user prepend <u>B</u> to their path as follows:

              <b>PATH=</b><u>B</u><b>:$PATH;</b>  <b>export</b>  <b>PATH</b>  # ordinary shell
              <b>set</b>  <b>path=(</b><u>B</u>  <b>$path)</b>  # C shell

        Have <u>A</u> create each RCS directory <u>R</u> with write access only to <u>A</u> as follows:

              <b>mkdir</b>  <u>R</u>
              <b>chmod</b>  <b>go-w</b>  <u>R</u>

        If  you want to let only certain users read the RCS files, put the users into a group <u>G</u>, and have <u>A</u>
         further protect the RCS directory as follows:

              <b>chgrp</b>  <u>G</u>  <u>R</u>
              <b>chmod</b>  <b>g-w,o-rwx</b>  <u>R</u>

        Have <u>A</u> copy old RCS files (if any) into <u>R</u>, to ensure that <u>A</u> owns them.

        An RCS file's access list limits who can check in and lock revisions.  The default access  list  is
         empty,  which grants checkin access to anyone who can read the RCS file.  If you want limit checkin
         access, have <u>A</u> invoke <b>rcs</b> <b>-a</b> on the file; see <a href="rcs.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/rcs"><b>rcs</b>(1)</a>.  In particular, <b>rcs</b> <b>-e</b> <b>-a</b><u>A</u> limits  access  to
         just <u>A</u>.

        Have <u>A</u> initialize any new RCS files with <b>rcs</b> <b>-i</b> before initial checkin, adding the <b>-a</b> option if you
         want to limit checkin access.

        Give setuid privileges only to <b>ci</b>, <b>co</b>, and <b>rcsclean</b>; do not give them to <b>rcs</b> or to any  other  com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand.&nbsp;command.</font>
         mand.

        Do not use other setuid commands to invoke RCS commands; setuid is trickier than you think!

<b>ENVIRONMENT</b>
       <b>RCSINIT</b>
              options  prepended  to  the  argument  list,  separated by spaces.  A backslash escapes spaces
              within an option.  The <b>RCSINIT</b> options are prepended to the argument lists of  most  RCS  com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mands.&nbsp;commands.</font>
              mands.  Useful <b>RCSINIT</b> options include <b>-q</b>, <b>-V</b>, <b>-x</b>, and <b>-z</b>.

       <b>TMPDIR</b> Name  of  the  temporary  directory.   If  not set, the environment variables <b>TMP</b> and <b>TEMP</b> are
              inspected instead and the first value found is taken; if none of them are set,  a  host-depen-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dent&nbsp;host-dependent</font>
              dent default is used, typically <b>/tmp</b>.

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       For each revision, <b>ci</b> prints the RCS file, the working file, and the number of both the deposited and
       the preceding revision.  The exit status is zero if and only if all operations were successful.
