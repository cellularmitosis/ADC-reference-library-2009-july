TELNET(1)                 BSD General Commands Manual                TELNET(1)

<b>NAME</b>
     <b>telnet</b> -- user interface to the TELNET protocol

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
     <b>telnet</b> [<b>-468EFKLNacdfruxy</b>] [<b>-S</b> <u>tos</u>] [<b>-X</b> <u>authtype</u>] [<b>-e</b> <u>escapechar</u>] [<b>-k</b> <u>realm</u>] [<b>-l</b> <u>user</u>] [<b>-n</b> <u>tracefile</u>]
            [<b>-s</b> <u>src</u><b>_</b><u>addr</u>] [<u>host</u> [<u>port</u>]]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
     The <b>telnet</b> command is used to communicate with another host using the TELNET protocol.  If <b>telnet</b> is
     invoked without the <u>host</u> argument, it enters command mode, indicated by its prompt (``telnet&gt;'').  In
     this mode, it accepts and executes the commands listed below.  If it is invoked with arguments, it per-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">forms&nbsp;performs</font>
     forms an <b>open</b> command with those arguments.

     Options:

     <b>-4</b>      Forces <b>telnet</b> to use IPv4 addresses only.

     <b>-6</b>      Forces <b>telnet</b> to use IPv6 addresses only.

     <b>-8</b>      Specifies an 8-bit data path.  This causes an attempt to negotiate the TELNET BINARY option on
             both input and output.

     <b>-E</b>      Stops any character from being recognized as an escape character.

     <b>-F</b>      If Kerberos V5 authentication is being used, the <b>-F</b> option allows the local credentials to be
             forwarded to the remote system, including any credentials that have already been forwarded into
             the local environment.

     <b>-K</b>      Specifies no automatic login to the remote system.

     <b>-L</b>      Specifies an 8-bit data path on output.  This causes the BINARY option to be negotiated on out-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">put.&nbsp;output.</font>
             put.

     <b>-N</b>      Prevents IP address to name lookup when destination host is given as an IP address.

     <b>-S</b> <u>tos</u>  Sets the IP type-of-service (TOS) option for the telnet connection to the value <u>tos</u>, which can
             be a numeric TOS value or, on systems that support it, a symbolic TOS name found in the
             <u>/etc/iptos</u> file.

     <b>-X</b> <u>atype</u>
             Disables the <u>atype</u> type of authentication.

     <b>-a</b>      Attempt automatic login.  This is now the default, so this option is ignored.  Currently, this
             sends the user name via the USER variable of the ENVIRON option if supported by the remote sys-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tem.&nbsp;system.</font>
             tem.  The name used is that of the current user as returned by <a href="../man2/getlogin.2.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/2/getlogin">getlogin(2)</a> if it agrees with
             the current user ID, otherwise it is the name associated with the user ID.

     <b>-c</b>      Disables the reading of the user's <u>.telnetrc</u> file.  (See the <b>toggle</b> <b>skiprc</b> command on this man
             page.)

     <b>-d</b>      Sets the initial value of the <b>debug</b> toggle to TRUE.

     <b>-e</b> <u>escapechar</u>
             Sets the initial <b>telnet</b> escape character to <u>escapechar</u>.  If <u>escapechar</u> is omitted, then there
             will be no escape character.

     <b>-f</b>      If Kerberos V5 authentication is being used, the <b>-f</b> option allows the local credentials to be
             forwarded to the remote system.

     <b>-k</b> <u>realm</u>
             If Kerberos authentication is being used, the <b>-k</b> option requests that <b>telnet</b> obtain tickets for
             the remote host in realm <u>realm</u> instead of the remote host's realm, as determined by
             <!-- a -->krb_realmofhost(3)<!-- /a -->.

     <b>-l</b> <u>user</u>
             When connecting to the remote system, if the remote system understands the ENVIRON option, then
             <u>user</u> will be sent to the remote system as the value for the variable USER.  This option implies
             the <b>-a</b> option.  This option may also be used with the <b>open</b> command.

     <b>-n</b> <u>tracefile</u>
             Opens <u>tracefile</u> for recording trace information.  See the <b>set</b> <b>tracefile</b> command below.

     <b>-r</b>      Specifies a user interface similar to <a href="rlogin.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/rlogin">rlogin(1)</a>.  In this mode, the escape character is set to
             the tilde (~) character, unless modified by the <b>-e</b> option.

     <b>-s</b> <u>src</u><b>_</b><u>addr</u>
             Set the source IP address for the <b>telnet</b> connection to <u>src</u><b>_</b><u>addr</u>, which can be an IP address or
             a host name.

     <b>-u</b>      Forces <b>telnet</b> to use AF_UNIX addresses only (e.g., UNIX domain sockets, accessed with a file
             path).

     <b>-x</b>      Turns on encryption of the data stream if possible.  This is now the default, so this option is
             ignored.

     <b>-y</b>      Suppresses encryption of the data stream.

     <u>host</u>    Indicates the official name, an alias, or the Internet address of a remote host.  If <u>host</u>
             starts with a `/', <b>telnet</b> establishes a connection to the corresponding named socket.

     <u>port</u>    Indicates a port number (address of an application).  If a number is not specified, the default
             <b>telnet</b> port is used.

     When in rlogin mode, a line of the form ~.  disconnects from the remote host; ~ is the <b>telnet</b> escape
     character.  Similarly, the line ~^Z suspends the <b>telnet</b> session.  The line ~^] escapes to the normal
     <b>telnet</b> escape prompt.

     Once a connection has been opened, <b>telnet</b> will attempt to enable the TELNET LINEMODE option.  If this
     fails, then <b>telnet</b> will revert to one of two input modes: either ``character at a time'' or ``old line
     by line'' depending on what the remote system supports.

     When LINEMODE is enabled, character processing is done on the local system, under the control of the
     remote system.  When input editing or character echoing is to be disabled, the remote system will relay
     that information.  The remote system will also relay changes to any special characters that happen on
     the remote system, so that they can take effect on the local system.

     In ``character at a time'' mode, most text typed is immediately sent to the remote host for processing.

     In ``old line by line'' mode, all text is echoed locally, and (normally) only completed lines are sent
     to the remote host.  The ``local echo character'' (initially ``^E'') may be used to turn off and on the
     local echo (this would mostly be used to enter passwords without the password being echoed).

     If the LINEMODE option is enabled, or if the <b>localchars</b> toggle is TRUE (the default for ``old line by
     line''; see below), the user's <b>quit</b>, <b>intr</b>, and <b>flush</b> characters are trapped locally, and sent as TELNET
     protocol sequences to the remote side.  If LINEMODE has ever been enabled, then the user's <b>susp</b> and <b>eof</b>
     are also sent as TELNET protocol sequences, and <b>quit</b> is sent as a TELNET ABORT instead of BREAK.  There
     are options (see <b>toggle</b> <b>autoflush</b> and <b>toggle</b> <b>autosynch</b> below) which cause this action to flush subse-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">quent&nbsp;subsequent</font>
     quent output to the terminal (until the remote host acknowledges the TELNET sequence) and flush previ-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ous&nbsp;previous</font>
     ous terminal input (in the case of <b>quit</b> and <b>intr</b>).

     While connected to a remote host, <b>telnet</b> command mode may be entered by typing the <b>telnet</b> ``escape
     character'' (initially ``^]'').  When in command mode, the normal terminal editing conventions are
     available.

     The following <b>telnet</b> commands are available.  Only enough of each command to uniquely identify it need
     be typed (this is also true for arguments to the <b>mode</b>, <b>set</b>, <b>toggle</b>, <b>unset</b>, <b>slc</b>, <b>environ</b>, and <b>display</b>
     commands).

     <b>auth</b> <u>argument</u> <u>...</u>
                The auth command manipulates the information sent through the TELNET AUTHENTICATE option.
                Valid arguments for the <b>auth</b> command are:

                <b>disable</b> <u>type</u>  Disables the specified type of authentication.  To obtain a list of available
                              types, use the <b>auth</b> <b>disable</b> <b>?</b> command.

                <b>enable</b> <u>type</u>   Enables the specified type of authentication.  To obtain a list of available
                              types, use the <b>auth</b> <b>enable</b> <b>?</b> command.

                <b>status</b>        Lists the current status of the various types of authentication.

     <b>close</b>      Close a TELNET session and return to command mode.

     <b>display</b> <u>argument</u> <u>...</u>
                Displays all, or some, of the <b>set</b> and <b>toggle</b> values (see below).

     <b>encrypt</b> <u>argument</u> <u>...</u>
                The encrypt command manipulates the information sent through the TELNET ENCRYPT option.

                Valid arguments for the <b>encrypt</b> command are:

                <b>disable</b> <u>type</u> [<b>input</b> | <b>output</b>]
                              Disables the specified type of encryption.  If you omit the input and output,
                              both input and output are disabled.  To obtain a list of available types, use
                              the <b>encrypt</b> <b>disable</b> <b>?</b> command.

                <b>enable</b> <u>type</u> [<b>input</b> | <b>output</b>]
                              Enables the specified type of encryption.  If you omit input and output, both
                              input and output are enabled.  To obtain a list of available types, use the
                              <b>encrypt</b> <b>enable</b> <b>?</b> command.

                <b>input</b>         This is the same as the <b>encrypt</b> <b>start</b> <b>input</b> command.

                <b>-input</b>        This is the same as the <b>encrypt</b> <b>stop</b> <b>input</b> command.

                <b>output</b>        This is the same as the <b>encrypt</b> <b>start</b> <b>output</b> command.

                <b>-output</b>       This is the same as the <b>encrypt</b> <b>stop</b> <b>output</b> command.

                <b>start</b> [<b>input</b> | <b>output</b>]
                              Attempts to start encryption.  If you omit <b>input</b> and <b>output</b>, both input and
                              output are enabled.  To obtain a list of available types, use the <b>encrypt</b>
                              <b>enable</b> <b>?</b> command.

                <b>status</b>        Lists the current status of encryption.

                <b>stop</b> [<b>input</b> | <b>output</b>]
                              Stops encryption.  If you omit input and output, encryption is on both input
                              and output.

                <b>type</b> <u>type</u>     Sets the default type of encryption to be used with later <b>encrypt</b> <b>start</b> or
                              <b>encrypt</b> <b>stop</b> commands.

     <b>environ</b> <u>arguments</u> <u>...</u>
                The <b>environ</b> command is used to manipulate the variables that may be sent through the TELNET
                ENVIRON option.  The initial set of variables is populated with the contents of the follow-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;following</font>
                ing environment variables, if present: USER, PRINTER, DISPLAY, TERM, COLUMNS, LINES. Only
                the first three are exported, by default.

                Valid arguments for the <b>environ</b> command are:

                <b>define</b> <u>variable</u> <u>[value]</u>
                            Define the variable <u>variable</u> to have a value of <u>value</u>.  If value is empty, the
                            value is taken from the environment variable.  Any variables defined by this
                            command are automatically exported.  The <u>value</u> may be enclosed in single or dou-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ble&nbsp;double</font>
                            ble quotes so that tabs and spaces may be included.

                <b>undefine</b> <u>variable</u>
                            Remove <u>variable</u> from the list of environment variables.

                <b>export</b> <u>variable</u>
                            Mark the variable <u>variable</u> to be exported to the remote side.

                <b>unexport</b> <u>variable</u>
                            Mark the variable <u>variable</u> to not be exported unless explicitly asked for by the
                            remote side.

                <b>list</b>        List the current set of environment variables.  Those marked with a <b>*</b> will be
                            sent automatically, other variables will only be sent if explicitly requested.

                <b>?</b>           Prints out help information for the <b>environ</b> command.

     <b>logout</b>     Sends the TELNET LOGOUT option to the remote side.  This command is similar to a <b>close</b> com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand;&nbsp;command;</font>
                mand; however, if the remote side does not support the LOGOUT option, nothing happens.  If,
                however, the remote side does support the LOGOUT option, this command should cause the
                remote side to close the TELNET connection.  If the remote side also supports the concept of
                suspending a user's session for later reattachment, the logout argument indicates that you
                should terminate the session immediately.

     <b>mode</b> <u>type</u>  <u>Type</u> is one of several options, depending on the state of the TELNET session.  The remote
                host is asked for permission to go into the requested mode.  If the remote host is capable
                of entering that mode, the requested mode will be entered.

                <b>character</b>     Disable the TELNET LINEMODE option, or, if the remote side does not understand
                              the LINEMODE option, then enter ``character at a time'' mode.

                <b>line</b>          Enable the TELNET LINEMODE option, or, if the remote side does not understand
                              the LINEMODE option, then attempt to enter ``old-line-by-line'' mode.

                <b>isig</b> (<b>-isig</b>)  Attempt to enable (disable) the TRAPSIG mode of the LINEMODE option.  This
                              requires that the LINEMODE option be enabled.

                <b>edit</b> (<b>-edit</b>)  Attempt to enable (disable) the EDIT mode of the LINEMODE option.  This
                              requires that the LINEMODE option be enabled.

                <b>softtabs</b> (<b>-softtabs</b>)
                              Attempt to enable (disable) the SOFT_TAB mode of the LINEMODE option.  This
                              requires that the LINEMODE option be enabled.

                <b>litecho</b> (<b>-litecho</b>)
                              Attempt to enable (disable) the LIT_ECHO mode of the LINEMODE option.  This
                              requires that the LINEMODE option be enabled.

                <b>?</b>             Prints out help information for the <b>mode</b> command.

     <b>open</b> <u>host</u> [<b>-l</b> <u>user</u>] [[<b>-</b>]<u>port</u>]
                Open a connection to the named host.  If no port number is specified, <b>telnet</b> will attempt to
                contact a TELNET server at the default port.  The host specification may be either a host
                name (see <a href="../man5/hosts.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/hosts">hosts(5)</a>), an Internet address specified in the ``dot notation'' (see <a href="../man3/inet.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/inet">inet(3)</a>), or
                IPv6 host name or IPv6 coloned-hexadecimal addreess.  The <b>-l</b> option may be used to specify
                the user name to be passed to the remote system via the ENVIRON option.  When connecting to
                a non-standard port, <b>telnet</b> omits any automatic initiation of TELNET options.  When the port
                number is preceded by a minus sign, the initial option negotiation is done.  After estab-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lishing&nbsp;establishing</font>
                lishing a connection, the file <u>.telnetrc</u> in the users home directory is opened.  Lines
                beginning with a # are comment lines.  Blank lines are ignored.  Lines that begin without
                white space are the start of a machine entry.  The first thing on the line is the name of
                the machine that is being connected to.  The rest of the line, and successive lines that
                begin with white space are assumed to be <b>telnet</b> commands and are processed as if they had
                been typed in manually to the <b>telnet</b> command prompt.

     <b>quit</b>       Close any open TELNET session and exit <b>telnet</b>.  An end of file (in command mode) will also
                close a session and exit.

     <b>send</b> <u>arguments</u>
                Sends one or more special character sequences to the remote host.  The following are the
                arguments which may be specified (more than one argument may be specified at a time):

                <b>abort</b>   Sends the TELNET ABORT (Abort processes) sequence.

                <b>ao</b>      Sends the TELNET AO (Abort Output) sequence, which should cause the remote system to
                        flush all output <u>from</u> the remote system <u>to</u> the user's terminal.

                <b>ayt</b>     Sends the TELNET AYT (Are You There) sequence, to which the remote system may or may
                        not choose to respond.

                <b>brk</b>     Sends the TELNET BRK (Break) sequence, which may have significance to the remote
                        system.

                <b>ec</b>      Sends the TELNET EC (Erase Character) sequence, which should cause the remote system
                        to erase the last character entered.

                <b>el</b>      Sends the TELNET EL (Erase Line) sequence, which should cause the remote system to
                        erase the line currently being entered.

                <b>eof</b>     Sends the TELNET EOF (End Of File) sequence.

                <b>eor</b>     Sends the TELNET EOR (End of Record) sequence.

                <b>escape</b>  Sends the current <b>telnet</b> escape character (initially ``^'').

                <b>ga</b>      Sends the TELNET GA (Go Ahead) sequence, which likely has no significance to the
                        remote system.

                <b>getstatus</b>
                        If the remote side supports the TELNET STATUS command, <b>getstatus</b> will send the sub-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">negotiation&nbsp;subnegotiation</font>
                        negotiation to request that the server send its current option status.

                <b>ip</b>      Sends the TELNET IP (Interrupt Process) sequence, which should cause the remote sys-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tem&nbsp;system</font>
                        tem to abort the currently running process.

                <b>nop</b>     Sends the TELNET NOP (No OPeration) sequence.

                <b>susp</b>    Sends the TELNET SUSP (SUSPend process) sequence.

                <b>synch</b>   Sends the TELNET SYNCH sequence.  This sequence causes the remote system to discard
                        all previously typed (but not yet read) input.  This sequence is sent as TCP urgent
                        data (and may not work if the remote system is a 4.2BSD system -- if it doesn't
                        work, a lower case ``r'' may be echoed on the terminal).

                <b>do</b> <u>cmd</u>

                <b>dont</b> <u>cmd</u>

                <b>will</b> <u>cmd</u>

                <b>wont</b> <u>cmd</u>
                        Sends the TELNET DO <u>cmd</u> sequence.  <u>Cmd</u> can be either a decimal number between 0 and
                        255, or a symbolic name for a specific TELNET command.  <u>Cmd</u> can also be either <b>help</b>
                        or <b>?</b> to print out help information, including a list of known symbolic names.

                <b>?</b>       Prints out help information for the <b>send</b> command.

     <b>set</b> <u>argument</u> <u>value</u>

     <b>unset</b> <u>argument</u> <u>value</u>
                The <b>set</b> command will set any one of a number of <b>telnet</b> variables to a specific value or to
                TRUE.  The special value <b>off</b> turns off the function associated with the variable, this is
                equivalent to using the <b>unset</b> command.  The <b>unset</b> command will disable or set to FALSE any
                of the specified functions.  The values of variables may be interrogated with the <b>display</b>
                command.  The variables which may be set or unset, but not toggled, are listed here.  In
                addition, any of the variables for the <b>toggle</b> command may be explicitly set or unset using
                the <b>set</b> and <b>unset</b> commands.

                <b>ayt</b>     If TELNET is in localchars mode, or LINEMODE is enabled, and the status character is
                        typed, a TELNET AYT sequence (see <b>send</b> <b>ayt</b> preceding) is sent to the remote host.
                        The initial value for the ``Are You There'' character is the terminal's status char-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">acter.&nbsp;character.</font>
                        acter.

                <b>echo</b>    This is the value (initially ``^E'') which, when in ``line by line'' mode, toggles
                        between doing local echoing of entered characters (for normal processing), and sup-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pressing&nbsp;suppressing</font>
                        pressing echoing of entered characters (for entering, say, a password).

                <b>eof</b>     If <b>telnet</b> is operating in LINEMODE or ``old line by line'' mode, entering this char-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">acter&nbsp;character</font>
                        acter as the first character on a line will cause this character to be sent to the
                        remote system.  The initial value of the eof character is taken to be the terminal's
                        <b>eof</b> character.

                <b>erase</b>   If <b>telnet</b> is in <b>localchars</b> mode (see <b>toggle</b> <b>localchars</b> below), <b>and</b> if <b>telnet</b> is
                        operating in ``character at a time'' mode, then when this character is typed, a
                        TELNET EC sequence (see <b>send</b> <b>ec</b> above) is sent to the remote system.  The initial
                        value for the erase character is taken to be the terminal's <b>erase</b> character.

                <b>escape</b>  This is the <b>telnet</b> escape character (initially ``^['') which causes entry into
                        <b>telnet</b> command mode (when connected to a remote system).

                <b>flushoutput</b>
                        If <b>telnet</b> is in <b>localchars</b> mode (see <b>toggle</b> <b>localchars</b> below) and the <b>flushoutput</b>
                        character is typed, a TELNET AO sequence (see <b>send</b> <b>ao</b> above) is sent to the remote
                        host.  The initial value for the flush character is taken to be the terminal's <b>flush</b>
                        character.

                <b>forw1</b>

                <b>forw2</b>   If <b>telnet</b> is operating in LINEMODE, these are the characters that, when typed, cause
                        partial lines to be forwarded to the remote system.  The initial value for the for-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">warding&nbsp;forwarding</font>
                        warding characters are taken from the terminal's eol and eol2 characters.

                <b>interrupt</b>
                        If <b>telnet</b> is in <b>localchars</b> mode (see <b>toggle</b> <b>localchars</b> below) and the <b>interrupt</b>
                        character is typed, a TELNET IP sequence (see <b>send</b> <b>ip</b> above) is sent to the remote
                        host.  The initial value for the interrupt character is taken to be the terminal's
                        <b>intr</b> character.

                <b>kill</b>    If <b>telnet</b> is in <b>localchars</b> mode (see <b>toggle</b> <b>localchars</b> below), <b>and</b> if <b>telnet</b> is
                        operating in ``character at a time'' mode, then when this character is typed, a
                        TELNET EL sequence (see <b>send</b> <b>el</b> above) is sent to the remote system.  The initial
                        value for the kill character is taken to be the terminal's <b>kill</b> character.

                <b>lnext</b>   If <b>telnet</b> is operating in LINEMODE or ``old line by line'' mode, then this character
                        is taken to be the terminal's <b>lnext</b> character.  The initial value for the lnext
                        character is taken to be the terminal's <b>lnext</b> character.

                <b>quit</b>    If <b>telnet</b> is in <b>localchars</b> mode (see <b>toggle</b> <b>localchars</b> below) and the <b>quit</b> character
                        is typed, a TELNET BRK sequence (see <b>send</b> <b>brk</b> above) is sent to the remote host.
                        The initial value for the quit character is taken to be the terminal's <b>quit</b> charac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ter.&nbsp;character.</font>
                        ter.

                <b>reprint</b>
                        If <b>telnet</b> is operating in LINEMODE or ``old line by line'' mode, then this character
                        is taken to be the terminal's <b>reprint</b> character.  The initial value for the reprint
                        character is taken to be the terminal's <b>reprint</b> character.

                <b>rlogin</b>  This is the rlogin escape character.  If set, the normal <b>telnet</b> escape character is
                        ignored unless it is preceded by this character at the beginning of a line.  This
                        character, at the beginning of a line followed by a "."  closes the connection; when
                        followed by a ^Z it suspends the <b>telnet</b> command.  The initial state is to disable
                        the <b>rlogin</b> escape character.

                <b>start</b>   If the TELNET TOGGLE-FLOW-CONTROL option has been enabled, then this character is
                        taken to be the terminal's <b>start</b> character.  The initial value for the start charac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ter&nbsp;character</font>
                        ter is taken to be the terminal's <b>start</b> character.

                <b>stop</b>    If the TELNET TOGGLE-FLOW-CONTROL option has been enabled, then this character is
                        taken to be the terminal's <b>stop</b> character.  The initial value for the stop character
                        is taken to be the terminal's <b>stop</b> character.

                <b>susp</b>    If <b>telnet</b> is in <b>localchars</b> mode, or LINEMODE is enabled, and the <b>suspend</b> character
                        is typed, a TELNET SUSP sequence (see <b>send</b> <b>susp</b> above) is sent to the remote host.
                        The initial value for the suspend character is taken to be the terminal's <b>suspend</b>
                        character.

                <b>tracefile</b>
                        This is the file to which the output, caused by <b>netdata</b> or <b>option</b> tracing being
                        TRUE, will be written.  If it is set to ``<b>-</b>'', then tracing information will be
                        written to standard output (the default).

                <b>worderase</b>
                        If <b>telnet</b> is operating in LINEMODE or ``old line by line'' mode, then this character
                        is taken to be the terminal's <b>worderase</b> character.  The initial value for the
                        worderase character is taken to be the terminal's <b>worderase</b> character.

                <b>?</b>       Displays the legal <b>set</b> (<b>unset</b>) commands.

     <b>opie</b> <u>sequence</u> <u>challenge</u>
                The <b>opie</b> command computes a response to the OPIE challenge.

     <b>slc</b> <u>state</u>  The <b>slc</b> command (Set Local Characters) is used to set or change the state of the special
                characters when the TELNET LINEMODE option has been enabled.  Special characters are charac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ters&nbsp;characters</font>
                ters that get mapped to TELNET commands sequences (like <b>ip</b> or <b>quit</b>) or line editing charac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ters&nbsp;characters</font>
                ters (like <b>erase</b> and <b>kill</b>).  By default, the local special characters are exported.

                <b>check</b>       Verify the current settings for the current special characters.  The remote side
                            is requested to send all the current special character settings, and if there
                            are any discrepancies with the local side, the local side will switch to the
                            remote value.

                <b>export</b>      Switch to the local defaults for the special characters.  The local default
                            characters are those of the local terminal at the time when <b>telnet</b> was started.

                <b>import</b>      Switch to the remote defaults for the special characters.  The remote default
                            characters are those of the remote system at the time when the TELNET connection
                            was established.

                <b>?</b>           Prints out help information for the <b>slc</b> command.

     <b>status</b>     Show the current status of <b>telnet</b>.  This includes the peer one is connected to, as well as
                the current mode.

     <b>toggle</b> <u>arguments</u> <u>...</u>
                Toggle (between TRUE and FALSE) various flags that control how <b>telnet</b> responds to events.
                These flags may be set explicitly to TRUE or FALSE using the <b>set</b> and <b>unset</b> commands listed
                above.  More than one argument may be specified.  The state of these flags may be interro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">gated&nbsp;interrogated</font>
                gated with the <b>display</b> command.  Valid arguments are:

                <b>authdebug</b>     Turns on debugging information for the authentication code.

                <b>autoflush</b>     If <b>autoflush</b> and <b>localchars</b> are both TRUE, then when the <b>ao</b>, or <b>quit</b> charac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ters&nbsp;characters</font>
                              ters are recognized (and transformed into TELNET sequences; see <b>set</b> above for
                              details), <b>telnet</b> refuses to display any data on the user's terminal until the
                              remote system acknowledges (via a TELNET TIMING MARK option) that it has pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cessed&nbsp;processed</font>
                              cessed those TELNET sequences.  The initial value for this toggle is TRUE if
                              the terminal user had not done an "stty noflsh", otherwise FALSE (see
                              <a href="stty.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/stty">stty(1)</a>).

                <b>autodecrypt</b>   When the TELNET ENCRYPT option is negotiated, by default the actual encryption
                              (decryption) of the data stream does not start automatically.  The autoencrypt
                              (autodecrypt) command states that encryption of the output (input) stream
                              should be enabled as soon as possible.

                <b>autologin</b>     If the remote side supports the TELNET AUTHENTICATION option <b>telnet</b> attempts
                              to use it to perform automatic authentication.  If the AUTHENTICATION option
                              is not supported, the user's login name are propagated through the TELNET
                              ENVIRON option.  This command is the same as specifying <b>-a</b> option on the <b>open</b>
                              command.

                <b>autosynch</b>     If <b>autosynch</b> and <b>localchars</b> are both TRUE, then when either the <b>intr</b> or <b>quit</b>
                              characters is typed (see <b>set</b> above for descriptions of the <b>intr</b> and <b>quit</b> char-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">acters),&nbsp;characters),</font>
                              acters), the resulting TELNET sequence sent is followed by the TELNET SYNCH
                              sequence.  This procedure <b>should</b> cause the remote system to begin throwing
                              away all previously typed input until both of the TELNET sequences have been
                              read and acted upon.  The initial value of this toggle is FALSE.

                <b>binary</b>        Enable or disable the TELNET BINARY option on both input and output.

                <b>inbinary</b>      Enable or disable the TELNET BINARY option on input.

                <b>outbinary</b>     Enable or disable the TELNET BINARY option on output.

                <b>crlf</b>          If this is TRUE, then carriage returns will be sent as &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.  If this is
                              FALSE, then carriage returns will be send as &lt;CR&gt;&lt;NUL&gt;.  The initial value for
                              this toggle is FALSE.

                <b>crmod</b>         Toggle carriage return mode.  When this mode is enabled, most carriage return
                              characters received from the remote host will be mapped into a carriage return
                              followed by a line feed.  This mode does not affect those characters typed by
                              the user, only those received from the remote host.  This mode is not very
                              useful unless the remote host only sends carriage return, but never line feed.
                              The initial value for this toggle is FALSE.

                <b>debug</b>         Toggles socket level debugging (useful only to the <b>super</b> <b>user</b>).  The initial
                              value for this toggle is FALSE.

                <b>encdebug</b>      Turns on debugging information for the encryption code.

                <b>localchars</b>    If this is TRUE, then the <b>flush</b>, <b>interrupt</b>, <b>quit</b>, <b>erase</b>, and <b>kill</b> characters
                              (see <b>set</b> above) are recognized locally, and transformed into (hopefully)
                              appropriate TELNET control sequences (respectively <b>ao</b>, <b>ip</b>, <b>brk</b>, <b>ec</b>, and <b>el</b>;
                              see <b>send</b> above).  The initial value for this toggle is TRUE in ``old line by
                              line'' mode, and FALSE in ``character at a time'' mode.  When the LINEMODE
                              option is enabled, the value of <b>localchars</b> is ignored, and assumed to always
                              be TRUE.  If LINEMODE has ever been enabled, then <b>quit</b> is sent as <b>abort</b>, and

     <b>z</b>          Suspend <b>telnet</b>.  This command only works when the user is using the <a href="csh.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/csh">csh(1)</a>.

     <b>!</b> [<u>command</u>]
                Execute a single command in a subshell on the local system.  If <u>command</u> is omitted, then an
                interactive subshell is invoked.

     <b>?</b> [<u>command</u>]
                Get help.  With no arguments, <b>telnet</b> prints a help summary.  If <u>command</u> is specified, <b>telnet</b>
                will print the help information for just that command.

<b>ENVIRONMENT</b>

<b>HISTORY</b>
     The <b>telnet</b> command appeared in 4.2BSD.

     IPv6 support was added by WIDE/KAME project.

<b>NOTES</b>
     On some remote systems, echo has to be turned off manually when in ``old line by line'' mode.

     In ``old line by line'' mode or LINEMODE the terminal's <b>eof</b> character is only recognized (and sent to
     the remote system) when it is the first character on a line.
