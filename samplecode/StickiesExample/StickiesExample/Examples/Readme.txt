StickiesExample/Examples Folder

This folder contains the actual Xcode projects for the sample appliations,
specifically SimpleStickies.  These samples have been upgraded to build as
Universal Binaries, but no code changes were made.

Xcode 2.2 and the MacOS10.4u.sdk is required to build these projects.

Refer to the Sync Services Tutorial for step-by-step instructions on using
Syncrospector to debug multiple syncing applications. The tutorial also covers
trickle syncing and refresh syncing. The three folders in this directory show
SimpleStickies during various stages of the Sync Services tutorial. 
SimpleStickies3_Final is the complete version of SimpleStickies.

The tutorial is located on the ADC Reference Library using this path:
ADC Home > Reference Library > Apple Applications > iSync
