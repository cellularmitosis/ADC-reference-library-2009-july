attributes(3pm)                       Perl Programmers Reference Guide                       attributes(3pm)



<b>NAME</b>
       attributes - get/set subroutine or variable attributes

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
         sub foo : method ;
         my ($x,@y,%z) : Bent = 1;
         my $s = sub : method { ... };

         use attributes ();    # optional, to get subroutine declarations
         my @attrlist = attributes::get(\&amp;foo);

         use attributes 'get'; # import the attributes::get subroutine
         my @attrlist = get \&amp;foo;

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       Subroutine declarations and definitions may optionally have attribute lists associated with them.
       (Variable "my" declarations also may, but see the warning below.)  Perl handles these declarations by
       passing some information about the call site and the thing being declared along with the attribute
       list to this module.  In particular, the first example above is equivalent to the following:

           use attributes __PACKAGE__, \&amp;foo, 'method';

       The second example in the synopsis does something equivalent to this:

           use attributes ();
           my ($x,@y,%z);
           attributes::-&gt;import(__PACKAGE__, \$x, 'Bent');
           attributes::-&gt;import(__PACKAGE__, \@y, 'Bent');
           attributes::-&gt;import(__PACKAGE__, \%z, 'Bent');
           ($x,@y,%z) = 1;

       Yes, that's a lot of expansion.

       <b>WARNING</b>: attribute declarations for variables are still evolving.  The semantics and interfaces of
       such declarations could change in future versions.  They are present for purposes of experimentation
       with what the semantics ought to be.  Do not rely on the current implementation of this feature.

       There are only a few attributes currently handled by Perl itself (or directly by this module, depend-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;depending</font>
       ing on how you look at it.)  However, package-specific attributes are allowed by an extension mecha-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nism.&nbsp;mechanism.</font>
       nism.  (See "Package-specific Attribute Handling" below.)

       The setting of subroutine attributes happens at compile time.  Variable attributes in "our" declara-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tions&nbsp;declarations</font>
       tions are also applied at compile time.  However, "my" variables get their attributes applied at
       run-time.  This means that you have to <u>reach</u> the run-time component of the "my" before those
       attributes will get applied.  For example:

           my $x : Bent = 42 if 0;

       will neither assign 42 to $x <u>nor</u> will it apply the "Bent" attribute to the variable.

       An attempt to set an unrecognized attribute is a fatal error.  (The error is trappable, but it still
       stops the compilation within that "eval".)  Setting an attribute with a name that's all lowercase
       letters that's not a built-in attribute (such as "foo") will result in a warning with <b>-w</b> or "use
       warnings 'reserved'".

       <b>Built-in</b> <b>Attributes</b>

       The following are the built-in attributes for subroutines:

       locked
           <b>5.005</b> <b>threads</b> <b>only!</b>  <b>The</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>"locked"</b> <b>attribute</b> <b>currently</b> <b>only</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b>
           <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>deprecated</b> <b>"Perl</b> <b>5.005</b> <b>threads"</b> <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> <b>threads.</b>

           Setting this attribute is only meaningful when the subroutine or method is to be called by multi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ple&nbsp;multiple</font>
           ple threads.  When set on a method subroutine (i.e., one marked with the <b>method</b> attribute below),
           Perl ensures that any invocation of it implicitly locks its first argument before execution.
           When set on a non-method subroutine, Perl ensures that a lock is taken on the subroutine itself
           before execution.  The semantics of the lock are exactly those of one explicitly taken with the
           "lock" operator immediately after the subroutine is entered.

       method
           Indicates that the referenced subroutine is a method.  This has a meaning when taken together
           with the <b>locked</b> attribute, as described there.  It also means that a subroutine so marked will
           not trigger the "Ambiguous call resolved as CORE::%s" warning.

       lvalue
           Indicates that the referenced subroutine is a valid lvalue and can be assigned to. The subroutine
           must return a modifiable value such as a scalar variable, as described in perlsub.

       For global variables there is "unique" attribute: see "our" in perlfunc.

       <b>Available</b> <b>Subroutines</b>

       The following subroutines are available for general use once this module has been loaded:

       get This routine expects a single parameter--a reference to a subroutine or variable.  It returns a
           list of attributes, which may be empty.  If passed invalid arguments, it uses <u>die()</u> (via
           Carp::croak) to raise a fatal exception.  If it can find an appropriate package name for a class
           method lookup, it will include the results from a "FETCH_type_ATTRIBUTES" call in its return
           list, as described in "Package-specific Attribute Handling" below.  Otherwise, only built-in
           attributes will be returned.

       reftype
           This routine expects a single parameter--a reference to a subroutine or variable.  It returns the
           built-in type of the referenced variable, ignoring any package into which it might have been
           blessed.  This can be useful for determining the <u>type</u> value which forms part of the method names
           described in "Package-specific Attribute Handling" below.

       Note that these routines are <u>not</u> exported by default.

       <b>Package-specific</b> <b>Attribute</b> <b>Handling</b>

       <b>WARNING</b>: the mechanisms described here are still experimental.  Do not rely on the current implemen-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tation.&nbsp;implementation.</font>
       tation.  In particular, there is no provision for applying package attributes to 'cloned' copies of
       subroutines used as closures.  (See "Making References" in perlref for information on closures.)
       Package-specific attribute handling may change incompatibly in a future release.

       When an attribute list is present in a declaration, a check is made to see whether an attribute 'mod-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ify'&nbsp;'modify'</font>
       ify' handler is present in the appropriate package (or its @ISA inheritance tree).  Similarly, when
       "attributes::get" is called on a valid reference, a check is made for an appropriate attribute
       'fetch' handler.  See "EXAMPLES" to see how the "appropriate package" determination works.

       The handler names are based on the underlying type of the variable being declared or of the reference
       passed.  Because these attributes are associated with subroutine or variable declarations, this
       deliberately ignores any possibility of being blessed into some package.  Thus, a subroutine declara-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;declaration</font>
       tion uses "CODE" as its <u>type</u>, and even a blessed hash reference uses "HASH" as its <u>type</u>.

       The class methods invoked for modifying and fetching are these:

       FETCH_<u>type</u>_ATTRIBUTES
           This method receives a single argument, which is a reference to the variable or subroutine for
           which package-defined attributes are desired.  The expected return value is a list of associated
           attributes.  This list may be empty.

       MODIFY_<u>type</u>_ATTRIBUTES
           This method is called with two fixed arguments, followed by the list of attributes from the rele-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">vant&nbsp;relevant</font>
           vant declaration.  The two fixed arguments are the relevant package name and a reference to the
           declared subroutine or variable.  The expected return value is a list of attributes which were
           not recognized by this handler.  Note that this allows for a derived class to delegate a call to
           its base class, and then only examine the attributes which the base class didn't already handle
           for it.

           The call to this method is currently made <u>during</u> the processing of the declaration.  In particu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lar,&nbsp;particular,</font>
           lar, this means that a subroutine reference will probably be for an undefined subroutine, even if
           this declaration is actually part of the definition.

       Calling "attributes::get()" from within the scope of a null package declaration "package ;" for an
       unblessed variable reference will not provide any starting package name for the 'fetch' method
       lookup.  Thus, this circumstance will not result in a method call for package-defined attributes.  A
       named subroutine knows to which symbol table entry it belongs (or originally belonged), and it will
       use the corresponding package.  An anonymous subroutine knows the package name into which it was com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">piled&nbsp;compiled</font>
       piled (unless it was also compiled with a null package declaration), and so it will use that package
       name.

       <b>Syntax</b> <b>of</b> <b>Attribute</b> <b>Lists</b>

       An attribute list is a sequence of attribute specifications, separated by whitespace or a colon (with
       optional whitespace).  Each attribute specification is a simple name, optionally followed by a paren-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">thesised&nbsp;parenthesised</font>
       thesised parameter list.  If such a parameter list is present, it is scanned past as for the rules
       for the "q()" operator.  (See "Quote and Quote-like Operators" in perlop.)  The parameter list is
       passed as it was found, however, and not as per "q()".

       Some examples of syntactically valid attribute lists:

           switch(10,foo(7,3))  :  expensive
           Ugly('\(") :Bad
           _5x5
           locked method

       Some examples of syntactically invalid attribute lists (with annotation):

           switch(10,foo()             # ()-string not balanced
           Ugly('(')                   # ()-string not balanced
           5x5                         # "5x5" not a valid identifier
           Y2::north                   # "Y2::north" not a simple identifier
           foo + bar                   # "+" neither a colon nor whitespace

<b>EXPORTS</b>
       <b>Default</b> <b>exports</b>

       None.

       <b>Available</b> <b>exports</b>

       The routines "get" and "reftype" are exportable.

       <b>Export</b> <b>tags</b> <b>defined</b>

       The ":ALL" tag will get all of the above exports.

<b>EXAMPLES</b>
       Here are some samples of syntactically valid declarations, with annotation as to how they resolve
       internally into "use attributes" invocations by perl.  These examples are primarily useful to see how
       the "appropriate package" is found for the possible method lookups for package-defined attributes.

       1.  Code:

               package Canine;
               package Dog;
               my Canine $spot : Watchful ;

           Effect:

               use attributes ();
               attributes::-&gt;import(Canine =&gt; \$spot, "Watchful");

       2.  Code:

               package Felis;
               my $cat : Nervous;

           Effect:

               use attributes ();
               attributes::-&gt;import(Felis =&gt; \$cat, "Nervous");

       3.  Code:

               package X;
               sub foo : locked ;

           Effect:

               use attributes X =&gt; \&amp;foo, "locked";

       4.  Code:

               package X;
               sub Y::x : locked { 1 }

           Effect:

               use attributes Y =&gt; \&amp;Y::x, "locked";

       5.  Code:

               package X;
               sub foo { 1 }

               package Y;
               BEGIN { *bar = \&amp;X::foo; }

               package Z;
               sub Y::bar : locked ;

           Effect:

               use attributes X =&gt; \&amp;X::foo, "locked";

       This last example is purely for purposes of completeness.  You should not be trying to mess with the
       attributes of something in a package that's not your own.
