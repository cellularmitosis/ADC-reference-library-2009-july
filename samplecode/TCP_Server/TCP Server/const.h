/*	TCP Client/Server Queuing Example	Steve Falkenburg, MacDTS, Apple Computer	3/11/92		this client/server sample uses MacTCP to implement a simple "greeting" server.  the server	opens up several listeners on kGreetingPort (1235).  when a client connects, the data entered	in the greeting dialog is sent to the remote connection, and the connection is closed.		connection management is done through the use of Operating System queues to simplify tracking	and usage.*/#include <MacTCPCommonTypes.h>#include <TCPPB.h>#define	kSleepTime					30#define	kNumConnections				10#define kNumBuffers					kNumConnections#define	kMainDialog					128#define	kQuitItem					1#define	kGreetingItem				2#define	kServicedItem				3#define	kFreeItem					4#define	kRunningItem				5#define	kCompletedItem				6#define	kRcvBuffSize				8192#define	kGreetingPort				1235typedef struct MyQElem {	TCPiopb	tcpBlock;	long	savedA5;} MyQElem, *MyQElemPtr;
