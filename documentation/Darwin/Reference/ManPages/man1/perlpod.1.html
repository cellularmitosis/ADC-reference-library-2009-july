<b>NAME</b>
       perlpod - the Plain Old Documentation format

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       Pod is a simple-to-use markup language used for writing documentation for Perl, Perl programs, and
       Perl modules.

       Translators are available for converting Pod to various formats like plain text, HTML, man pages, and
       more.

       Pod markup consists of three basic kinds of paragraphs: ordinary, verbatim, and command.

       <b>Ordinary</b> <b>Paragraph</b>

       Most paragraphs in your documentation will be ordinary blocks of text, like this one.  You can simply
       type in your text without any markup whatsoever, and with just a blank line before and after.  When
       it gets formatted, it will undergo minimal formatting, like being rewrapped, probably put into a pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">portionally&nbsp;proportionally</font>
       portionally spaced font, and maybe even justified.

       You can use formatting codes in ordinary paragraphs, for <b>bold</b>, <u>italic</u>, "code-style", hyperlinks, and
       more.  Such codes are explained in the "Formatting Codes" section, below.

       <b>Verbatim</b> <b>Paragraph</b>

       Verbatim paragraphs are usually used for presenting a codeblock or other text which does not require
       any special parsing or formatting, and which shouldn't be wrapped.

       A verbatim paragraph is distinguished by having its first character be a space or a tab.  (And com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">monly,&nbsp;commonly,</font>
       monly, all its lines begin with spaces and/or tabs.)  It should be reproduced exactly, with tabs
       assumed to be on 8-column boundaries.  There are no special formatting codes, so you can't italicize
       or anything like that.  A \ means \, and nothing else.

       <b>Command</b> <b>Paragraph</b>

       A command paragraph is used for special treatment of whole chunks of text, usually as headings or
       parts of lists.

       All command paragraphs (which are typically only one line long) start with "=", followed by an iden-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tifier,&nbsp;identifier,</font>
       tifier, followed by arbitrary text that the command can use however it pleases.  Currently recognized
       commands are

           =pod
           =head1 Heading Text
           =head2 Heading Text
           =head3 Heading Text
           =head4 Heading Text
           =over indentlevel
           =item stuff
           =back
           =begin format
           =end format
           =for format text...
           =encoding type
           =cut

       To explain them each in detail:

       "=head1 Heading Text"
       "=head2 Heading Text"
       "=head3 Heading Text"
       "=head4 Heading Text"
           Head1 through head4 produce headings, head1 being the highest level.  The text in the rest of
           this paragraph is the content of the heading.  For example:

             =head2 Object Attributes

           The text "Object Attributes" comprises the heading there.  (Note that head3 and head4 are recent
           additions, not supported in older Pod translators.)  The text in these heading commands can use
           formatting codes, as seen here:

             =head2 Possible Values for C&lt;$/&gt;

           Such commands are explained in the "Formatting Codes" section, below.

       "=over indentlevel"
       "=item stuff..."
       "=back"
           Item, over, and back require a little more explanation:  "=over" starts a region specifically for
           the generation of a list using "=item" commands, or for indenting (groups of) normal paragraphs.
           At the end of your list, use "=back" to end it.  The <u>indentlevel</u> option to "=over" indicates how
           far over to indent, generally in ems (where one em is the width of an "M" in the document's base
           font) or roughly comparable units; if there is no <u>indentlevel</u> option, it defaults to four.  (And
           some formatters may just ignore whatever <u>indentlevel</u> you provide.)  In the <u>stuff</u> in "=item
           stuff...", you may use formatting codes, as seen here:

             =item Using C&lt;$|&gt; to Control Buffering

           Such commands are explained in the "Formatting Codes" section, below.

           Note also that there are some basic rules to using "=over" ...  "=back" regions:

           *   Don't use "=item"s outside of an "=over" ... "=back" region.

           *   The first thing after the "=over" command should be an "=item", unless there aren't going to
               be any items at all in this "=over" ... "=back" region.

           *   Don't put "=head<u>n</u>" commands inside an "=over" ... "=back" region.

           *   And perhaps most importantly, keep the items consistent: either use "=item *" for all of
               them, to produce bullets; or use "=item 1.", "=item 2.", etc., to produce numbered lists; or
               use "=item foo", "=item bar", etc. -- namely, things that look nothing like bullets or num-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">bers.&nbsp;numbers.</font>
               bers.

               If you start with bullets or numbers, stick with them, as formatters use the first "=item"
               type to decide how to format the list.

       "=cut"
           To end a Pod block, use a blank line, then a line beginning with "=cut", and a blank line after
           it.  This lets Perl (and the Pod formatter) know that this is where Perl code is resuming.  (The
           blank line before the "=cut" is not technically necessary, but many older Pod processors require
           it.)

       "=pod"
           The "=pod" command by itself doesn't do much of anything, but it signals to Perl (and Pod format-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ters)&nbsp;formatters)</font>
           ters) that a Pod block starts here.  A Pod block starts with <u>any</u> command paragraph, so a "=pod"
           command is usually used just when you want to start a Pod block with an ordinary paragraph or a
           verbatim paragraph.  For example:

             =item stuff()

             This function does stuff.

             =cut

             sub stuff {
               ...
             }

             =pod

             Remember to check its return value, as in:

               stuff() || die "Couldn't do stuff!";

             =cut

       "=begin formatname"
       "=end formatname"
       "=for formatname text..."
           For, begin, and end will let you have regions of text/code/data that are not generally inter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">preted&nbsp;interpreted</font>
           preted as normal Pod text, but are passed directly to particular formatters, or are otherwise
           special.  A formatter that can use that format will use the region, otherwise it will be com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pletely&nbsp;completely</font>
           pletely ignored.

           A command "=begin <u>formatname</u>", some paragraphs, and a command "=end <u>formatname</u>", mean that the
           text/data inbetween is meant for formatters that understand the special format called <u>formatname</u>.
           For example,

             =begin html

             &lt;hr&gt; &lt;img src="thang.png"&gt;
             &lt;p&gt; This is a raw HTML paragraph &lt;/p&gt;

             =end html

           The command "=for <u>formatname</u> <u>text...</u>"  specifies that the remainder of just this paragraph
           (starting right after <u>formatname</u>) is in that special format.

             =for html &lt;hr&gt; &lt;img src="thang.png"&gt;
             &lt;p&gt; This is a raw HTML paragraph &lt;/p&gt;

           This means the same thing as the above "=begin html" ... "=end html" region.

           That is, with "=for", you can have only one paragraph's worth of text (i.e., the text in "=foo
           targetname text..."), but with "=begin targetname" ... "=end targetname", you can have any amount
           of stuff inbetween.  (Note that there still must be a blank line after the "=begin" command and a
           blank line before the "=end" command.

           Here are some examples of how to use these:

             =begin html

             &lt;br&gt;Figure 1.&lt;br&gt;&lt;IMG SRC="figure1.png"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

             =end html

             =begin text

               ---------------<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">|&nbsp;--------------|</font>
               |  foo        |
               |        bar  |
               ---------------<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">^^^^&nbsp;--------------^^^^</font>

             ^^^^ Figure 1. ^^^^

             =end text

           Some format names that formatters currently are known to accept include "roff", "man", "latex",
           "tex", "text", and "html".  (Some formatters will treat some of these as synonyms.)

           A format name of "comment" is common for just making notes (presumably to yourself) that won't
           appear in any formatted version of the Pod document:

             =for comment
             Make sure that all the available options are documented!

           Some <u>formatnames</u> will require a leading colon (as in "=for :formatname", or "=begin :formatname"
           ... "=end :formatname"), to signal that the text is not raw data, but instead <u>is</u> Pod text (i.e.,
           possibly containing formatting codes) that's just not for normal formatting (e.g., may not be a
           normal-use paragraph, but might be for formatting as a footnote).

       "=encoding encodingname"
           This command is used for declaring the encoding of a document.  Most users won't need this; but
           if your encoding isn't US-ASCII or Latin-1, then put a "=encoding encodingname" command early in
           the document so that pod formatters will know how to decode the document.  For <u>encodingname</u>, use
           a name recognized by the Encode::Supported module.  Examples:

             =encoding utf8

             =encoding koi8-r

             =encoding ShiftJIS

             =encoding big5

       And don't forget, when using any command, that the command lasts up until the end of its <u>paragraph</u>,
       not its line.  So in the examples below, you can see that every command needs the blank line after
       it, to end its paragraph.

       Some examples of lists include:

         =over

         =item *

         First item

         =item *

         Second item

         =back

         =over

         =item Foo()

         Description of Foo function

         =item Bar()

         Description of Bar function

         =back

       <b>Formatting</b> <b>Codes</b>

       In ordinary paragraphs and in some command paragraphs, various formatting codes (a.k.a. "interior
       sequences") can be used:

       "I&lt;text&gt;" -- italic text
           Used for emphasis (""be I&lt;careful!&gt;"") and parameters (""redo I&lt;LABEL&gt;"")

       "B&lt;text&gt;" -- bold text
           Used for switches (""perl's B&lt;-n&gt; switch""), programs (""some systems provide a B&lt;chfn&gt; for
           that""), emphasis (""be B&lt;careful!&gt;""), and so on (""and that feature is known as B&lt;autovivifica-
           tion&gt;"").

       "C&lt;code&gt;" -- code text
           Renders code in a typewriter font, or gives some other indication that this represents program
           text (""C&lt;gmtime($^T)&gt;"") or some other form of computerese (""C&lt;drwxr-xr-x&gt;"").

       "L&lt;name&gt;" -- a hyperlink
           There are various syntaxes, listed below.  In the syntaxes given, "text", "name", and "section"
           cannot contain the characters '/' and '|'; and any '&lt;' or '&gt;' should be matched.

           *   "L&lt;name&gt;"

               Link to a Perl manual page (e.g., "L&lt;Net::Ping&gt;").  Note that "name" should not contain spa-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ces.&nbsp;spaces.</font>
               ces.  This syntax is also occasionally used for references to UNIX man pages, as in
               "L&lt;crontab(5)&gt;".

           *   "L&lt;name/"sec"&gt;" or "L&lt;name/sec&gt;"

               Link to a section in other manual page.  E.g., "L&lt;perlsyn/"For Loops"&gt;"

           *   "L&lt;/"sec"&gt;" or "L&lt;/sec&gt;" or "L&lt;"sec"&gt;"

               Link to a section in this manual page.  E.g., "L&lt;/"Object Methods"&gt;"

           A section is started by the named heading or item.  For example, "L&lt;perlvar/$.&gt;" or "L&lt;perl-
           var/"$."&gt;" both link to the section started by ""=item $."" in perlvar.  And "L&lt;perlsyn/For
           Loops&gt;" or "L&lt;perlsyn/"For Loops"&gt;" both link to the section started by ""=head2 For Loops"" in
           perlsyn.

           To control what text is used for display, you use ""L&lt;text|...&gt;"", as in:

           *   "L&lt;text|name&gt;"

               Link this text to that manual page.  E.g., "L&lt;Perl Error Messages|perldiag&gt;"

           *   "L&lt;text|name/"sec"&gt;" or "L&lt;text|name/sec&gt;"

               Link this text to that section in that manual page.  E.g., "L&lt;SWITCH statements|perl-
               syn/"Basic BLOCKs and Switch Statements"&gt;"

           *   "L&lt;text|/"sec"&gt;" or "L&lt;text|/sec&gt;" or "L&lt;text|"sec"&gt;"

               Link this text to that section in this manual page.  E.g., "L&lt;the various attributes|/"Member
               Data"&gt;"

           Or you can link to a web page:

           *   "L&lt;<a href="scheme:..">scheme:..</a>."

               Links to an absolute URL.  For example, "L&lt;<a href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</a>".  But note that there is no
               corresponding "L&lt;text|scheme:...&gt;" syntax, for various reasons.

       "E&lt;escape&gt;" -- a character escape
           Very similar to HTML/XML "&amp;foo;" "entity references":

           *   "E&lt;lt&gt;" -- a literal &lt; (less than)

           *   "E&lt;gt&gt;" -- a literal &gt; (greater than)

           *   "E&lt;verbar&gt;" -- a literal | (<u>ver</u>tical <u>bar</u>)

           *   "E&lt;sol&gt;" = a literal / (<u>sol</u>idus)

               The above four are optional except in other formatting codes, notably "L&lt;...&gt;", and when pre-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ceded&nbsp;preceded</font>
               ceded by a capital letter.

           *   "E&lt;htmlname&gt;"

               Some non-numeric HTML entity name, such as "E&lt;eacute&gt;", meaning the same thing as "&amp;eacute;"
               in HTML -- i.e., a lowercase e with an acute (/-shaped) accent.

           *   "E&lt;number&gt;"

               The ASCII/Latin-1/Unicode character with that number.  A leading "0x" means that <u>number</u> is
               hex, as in "E&lt;0x201E&gt;".  A leading "0" means that <u>number</u> is octal, as in "E&lt;075&gt;".  Otherwise
               <u>number</u> is interpreted as being in decimal, as in "E&lt;181&gt;".

               Note that older Pod formatters might not recognize octal or hex numeric escapes, and that
               many formatters cannot reliably render characters above 255.  (Some formatters may even have
               to use compromised renderings of Latin-1 characters, like rendering "E&lt;eacute&gt;" as just a
               plain "e".)

       "F&lt;filename&gt;" -- used for filenames
           Typically displayed in italics.  Example: ""F&lt;.cshrc&gt;""

       "S&lt;text&gt;" -- text contains non-breaking spaces
           This means that the words in <u>text</u> should not be broken across lines.  Example: "S&lt;$x ? $y : $z&gt;".

       "X&lt;topic name&gt;" -- an index entry
           This is ignored by most formatters, but some may use it for building indexes.  It always renders
           as empty-string.  Example: "X&lt;absolutizing relative URLs&gt;"

       "Z&lt;&gt;" -- a null (zero-effect) formatting code
           This is rarely used.  It's one way to get around using an E&lt;...&gt; code sometimes.  For example,
           instead of ""NE&lt;lt&gt;3"" (for "N&lt;3") you could write ""NZ&lt;&gt;&lt;3"" (the "Z&lt;&gt;" breaks up the "N" and
           the "&lt;" so they can't be considered the part of a (fictitious) "N&lt;...&gt;" code.

       Most of the time, you will need only a single set of angle brackets to delimit the beginning and end
       of formatting codes.  However, sometimes you will want to put a real right angle bracket (a greater-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">than&nbsp;greaterthan</font>
       than sign, '&gt;') inside of a formatting code.  This is particularly common when using a formatting
       code to provide a different font-type for a snippet of code.  As with all things in Perl, there is
       more than one way to do it.  One way is to simply escape the closing bracket using an "E" code:

           C&lt;$a E&lt;lt&gt;=E&lt;gt&gt; $b&gt;

       This will produce: ""$a &lt;=&gt; $b""

       A more readable, and perhaps more "plain" way is to use an alternate set of delimiters that doesn't
       require a single "&gt;" to be escaped.  With the Pod formatters that are standard starting with
       perl5.5.660, doubled angle brackets ("&lt;&lt;" and "&gt;&gt;") may be used <u>if</u> <u>and</u> <u>only</u> <u>if</u> <u>there</u> <u>is</u> <u>whitespace</u>
       <u>right</u> <u>after</u> <u>the</u> <u>opening</u> <u>delimiter</u> <u>and</u> <u>whitespace</u> <u>right</u> <u>before</u> <u>the</u> <u>closing</u> <u>delimiter!</u>  For example,
       the following will do the trick:

           C&lt;&lt; $a &lt;=&gt; $b &gt;&gt;

       In fact, you can use as many repeated angle-brackets as you like so long as you have the same number
       of them in the opening and closing delimiters, and make sure that whitespace immediately follows the
       last '&lt;' of the opening delimiter, and immediately precedes the first '&gt;' of the closing delimiter.
       (The whitespace is ignored.)  So the following will also work:

           C&lt;&lt;&lt; $a &lt;=&gt; $b &gt;&gt;&gt;
           C&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  $a &lt;=&gt; $b     &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

       And they all mean exactly the same as this:

           C&lt;$a E&lt;lt&gt;=E&lt;gt&gt; $b&gt;

       As a further example, this means that if you wanted to put these bits of code in "C" (code) style:

           open(X, "&gt;&gt;thing.dat") || die $!
           $foo-&gt;bar();

       you could do it like so:

           C&lt;&lt;&lt; open(X, "&gt;&gt;thing.dat") || die $! &gt;&gt;&gt;
           C&lt;&lt; $foo-&gt;bar(); &gt;&gt;

       which is presumably easier to read than the old way:

           C&lt;open(X, "E&lt;gt&gt;E&lt;gt&gt;thing.dat") || die $!&gt;
           C&lt;$foo-E&lt;gt&gt;bar();&gt;

       This is currently supported by pod2text (Pod::Text), pod2man (Pod::Man), and any other pod2xxx or
       Pod::Xxxx translators that use Pod::Parser 1.093 or later, or Pod::Tree 1.02 or later.

       <b>The</b> <b>Intent</b>

       The intent is simplicity of use, not power of expression.  Paragraphs look like paragraphs (block
       format), so that they stand out visually, and so that I could run them through "fmt" easily to refor-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mat&nbsp;reformat</font>
       mat them (that's F7 in my version of <b>vi</b>, or Esc Q in my version of <b>emacs</b>).  I wanted the translator
       to always leave the "'" and "`" and """ quotes alone, in verbatim mode, so I could slurp in a working
       program, shift it over four spaces, and have it print out, er, verbatim.  And presumably in a
       monospace font.

       The Pod format is not necessarily sufficient for writing a book.  Pod is just meant to be an idiot-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">proof&nbsp;idiotproof</font>
       proof common source for nroff, HTML, TeX, and other markup languages, as used for online documenta-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion.&nbsp;documentation.</font>
       tion.  Translators exist for <b>pod2text</b>, <b>pod2html</b>, <b>pod2man</b> (that's for <a href="nroff.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/nroff"><u>nroff</u>(1)</a> and <a href="troff.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/troff"><u>troff</u>(1)</a>),
       <b>pod2latex</b>, and <b>pod2fm</b>.  Various others are available in CPAN.

       <b>Embedding</b> <b>Pods</b> <b>in</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>Modules</b>

       You can embed Pod documentation in your Perl modules and scripts.  Start your documentation with an
       empty line, a "=head1" command at the beginning, and end it with a "=cut" command and an empty line.
       Perl will ignore the Pod text.  See any of the supplied library modules for examples.  If you're
       going to put your Pod at the end of the file, and you're using an __END__ or __DATA__ cut mark, make
       sure to put an empty line there before the first Pod command.

         __END__

         =head1 NAME

         Time::Local - efficiently compute time from local and GMT time

       Without that empty line before the "=head1", many translators wouldn't have recognized the "=head1"
       as starting a Pod block.

       <b>Hints</b> <b>for</b> <b>Writing</b> <b>Pod</b>


          The <b>podchecker</b> command is provided for checking Pod syntax for errors and warnings.  For example,
           it checks for completely blank lines in Pod blocks and for unknown commands and formatting codes.
           You should still also pass your document through one or more translators and proofread the
           result, or print out the result and proofread that.  Some of the problems found may be bugs in
           the translators, which you may or may not wish to work around.

          If you're more familiar with writing in HTML than with writing in Pod, you can try your hand at
           writing documentation in simple HTML, and converting it to Pod with the experimental
           Pod::HTML2Pod module, (available in CPAN), and looking at the resulting code.  The experimental
           Pod::PXML module in CPAN might also be useful.

          Many older Pod translators require the lines before every Pod command and after every Pod command
           (including "=cut"!) to be a blank line.  Having something like this:

            # - - - - - - - - - - - -<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">=item&nbsp;-=item</font>
            =item $firecracker-&gt;boom()

            This noisily detonates the firecracker object.
            =cut
            sub boom {
            ...

           ...will make such Pod translators completely fail to see the Pod block at all.

           Instead, have it like this:

            # - - - - - - - - - - - -<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">=item&nbsp;-=item</font>

            =item $firecracker-&gt;boom()

            This noisily detonates the firecracker object.

            =cut

            sub boom {
            ...

          Some older Pod translators require paragraphs (including command paragraphs like "=head2 Func-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tions")&nbsp;Functions")</font>
           tions") to be separated by <u>completely</u> empty lines.  If you have an apparently empty line with
           some spaces on it, this might not count as a separator for those translators, and that could
           cause odd formatting.

          Older translators might add wording around an L&lt;&gt; link, so that "L&lt;Foo::Bar&gt;" may become "the
           Foo::Bar manpage", for example.  So you shouldn't write things like "the L&lt;foo&gt; documentation",
           if you want the translated document to read sensibly -- instead write "the L&lt;Foo::Bar|Foo::Bar&gt;
           documentation" or "L&lt;the Foo::Bar documentation|Foo::Bar&gt;", to control how the link comes out.

          Going past the 70th column in a verbatim block might be ungracefully wrapped by some formatters.
