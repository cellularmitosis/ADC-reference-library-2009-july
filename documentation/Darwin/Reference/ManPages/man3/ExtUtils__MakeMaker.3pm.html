ExtUtils::MakeMaker(3pm)              Perl Programmers Reference Guide              ExtUtils::MakeMaker(3pm)



<b>NAME</b>
       ExtUtils::MakeMaker - Create a module Makefile

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
         use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;

         WriteMakefile( ATTRIBUTE =&gt; VALUE [, ...] );

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       This utility is designed to write a Makefile for an extension module from a Makefile.PL. It is based
       on the Makefile.SH model provided by Andy Dougherty and the perl5-porters.

       It splits the task of generating the Makefile into several subroutines that can be individually over-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ridden.&nbsp;overridden.</font>
       ridden.  Each subroutine returns the text it wishes to have written to the Makefile.

       MakeMaker is object oriented. Each directory below the current directory that contains a Makefile.PL
       is treated as a separate object. This makes it possible to write an unlimited number of Makefiles
       with a single invocation of <u>WriteMakefile()</u>.

       <b>How</b> <b>To</b> <b>Write</b> <b>A</b> <b>Makefile.PL</b>

       See ExtUtils::MakeMaker::Tutorial.

       The long answer is the rest of the manpage :-)

       <b>Default</b> <b>Makefile</b> <b>Behaviour</b>

       The generated Makefile enables the user of the extension to invoke

         perl Makefile.PL # optionally "perl Makefile.PL verbose"
         make
         make test        # optionally set TEST_VERBOSE=1
         make install     # See below

       The Makefile to be produced may be altered by adding arguments of the form "KEY=VALUE". E.g.

         perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~

       Other interesting targets in the generated Makefile are

         make config     # to check if the Makefile is up-to-date
         make clean      # delete local temp files (Makefile gets renamed)
         make realclean  # delete derived files (including ./blib)
         make ci         # check in all the files in the MANIFEST file
         make dist       # see below the Distribution Support section

       <b>make</b> <b>test</b>

       MakeMaker checks for the existence of a file named <u>test.pl</u> in the current directory and if it exists
       it execute the script with the proper set of perl "-I" options.

       MakeMaker also checks for any files matching glob("t/*.t"). It will execute all matching files in
       alphabetical order via the Test::Harness module with the "-I" switches set correctly.

       If you'd like to see the raw output of your tests, set the "TEST_VERBOSE" variable to true.

         make test TEST_VERBOSE=1

       <b>make</b> <b>testdb</b>

       A useful variation of the above is the target "testdb". It runs the test under the Perl debugger (see
       perldebug). If the file <u>test.pl</u> exists in the current directory, it is used for the test.

       If you want to debug some other testfile, set the "TEST_FILE" variable thusly:

         make testdb TEST_FILE=t/mytest.t

       By default the debugger is called using "-d" option to perl. If you want to specify some other
       option, set the "TESTDB_SW" variable:

         make testdb TESTDB_SW=-Dx

       <b>make</b> <b>install</b>

       make alone puts all relevant files into directories that are named by the macros INST_LIB, INST_ARCH-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">LIB,&nbsp;INST_ARCHLIB,</font>
       LIB, INST_SCRIPT, INST_MAN1DIR and INST_MAN3DIR.  All these default to something below ./blib if you
       are <u>not</u> building below the perl source directory. If you <u>are</u> building below the perl source, INST_LIB
       and INST_ARCHLIB default to ../../lib, and INST_SCRIPT is not defined.

       The <u>install</u> target of the generated Makefile copies the files found below each of the INST_* directo-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ries&nbsp;directories</font>
       ries to their INSTALL* counterparts. Which counterparts are chosen depends on the setting of
       INSTALLDIRS according to the following table:

                                        INSTALLDIRS set to
                                  perl        site          vendor

                        PERLPREFIX      SITEPREFIX          VENDORPREFIX
         INST_ARCHLIB   INSTALLARCHLIB  INSTALLSITEARCH     INSTALLVENDORARCH
         INST_LIB       INSTALLPRIVLIB  INSTALLSITELIB      INSTALLVENDORLIB
         INST_BIN       INSTALLBIN      INSTALLSITEBIN      INSTALLVENDORBIN
         INST_SCRIPT    INSTALLSCRIPT   INSTALLSCRIPT       INSTALLSCRIPT
         INST_MAN1DIR   INSTALLMAN1DIR  INSTALLSITEMAN1DIR  INSTALLVENDORMAN1DIR
         INST_MAN3DIR   INSTALLMAN3DIR  INSTALLSITEMAN3DIR  INSTALLVENDORMAN3DIR

       The INSTALL... macros in turn default to their %Config ($Config{installprivlib}, $Config{installarch-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lib},&nbsp;$Config{installarchlib},</font>
       lib}, etc.) counterparts.

       You can check the values of these variables on your system with

           perl '-V:install.*'

       And to check the sequence in which the library directories are searched by perl, run

           perl -le 'print join $/, @INC'

       Sometimes older versions of the module you're installing live in other directories in @INC.  Because
       Perl loads the first version of a module it finds, not the newest, you might accidentally get one of
       these older versions even after installing a brand new version.  To delete <u>all</u> <u>other</u> <u>versions</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u>
       <u>module</u> <u>you're</u> <u>installing</u> (not simply older ones) set the "UNINST" variable.

           make install UNINST=1

       <b>PREFIX</b> <b>and</b> <b>LIB</b> <b>attribute</b>

       PREFIX and LIB can be used to set several INSTALL* attributes in one go. The quickest way to install
       a module in a non-standard place might be

           perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~

       This will install all files in the module under your home directory, with man pages and libraries
       going into an appropriate place (usually ~/man and ~/lib).

       Another way to specify many INSTALL directories with a single parameter is LIB.

           perl Makefile.PL LIB=~/lib

       This will install the module's architecture-independent files into ~/lib, the architecture-dependent
       files into ~/lib/$archname.

       Note, that in both cases the tilde expansion is done by MakeMaker, not by perl by default, nor by
       make.

       Conflicts between parameters LIB, PREFIX and the various INSTALL* arguments are resolved so that:

          setting LIB overrides any setting of INSTALLPRIVLIB, INSTALLARCHLIB, INSTALLSITELIB, INSTALL-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">SITEARCH&nbsp;INSTALLSITEARCH</font>
           SITEARCH (and they are not affected by PREFIX);

          without LIB, setting PREFIX replaces the initial $Config{prefix} part of those INSTALL* argu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ments,&nbsp;arguments,</font>
           ments, even if the latter are explicitly set (but are set to still start with $Config{prefix}).

       If the user has superuser privileges, and is not working on AFS or relatives, then the defaults for
       INSTALLPRIVLIB, INSTALLARCHLIB, INSTALLSCRIPT, etc. will be appropriate, and this incantation will be
       the best:

           perl Makefile.PL;
           make;
           make test
           make install

       make install per default writes some documentation of what has been done into the file "$(INSTAL-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">LARCHLIB)/perllocal.pod".&nbsp;"$(INSTALLARCHLIB)/perllocal.pod".</font>
       LARCHLIB)/perllocal.pod". This feature can be bypassed by calling make pure_install.

       <b>AFS</b> <b>users</b>

       will have to specify the installation directories as these most probably have changed since perl
       itself has been installed. They will have to do this by calling

           perl Makefile.PL INSTALLSITELIB=/afs/here/today \
               INSTALLSCRIPT=/afs/there/now INSTALLMAN3DIR=/afs/for/manpages
           make

       Be careful to repeat this procedure every time you recompile an extension, unless you are sure the
       AFS installation directories are still valid.

       <b>Static</b> <b>Linking</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>Binary</b>

       An extension that is built with the above steps is ready to use on systems supporting dynamic load-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing.&nbsp;loading.</font>
       ing. On systems that do not support dynamic loading, any newly created extension has to be linked
       together with the available resources. MakeMaker supports the linking process by creating appropriate
       targets in the Makefile whenever an extension is built. You can invoke the corresponding section of
       the makefile with

           make perl

       That produces a new perl binary in the current directory with all extensions linked in that can be
       found in INST_ARCHLIB, SITELIBEXP, and PERL_ARCHLIB. To do that, MakeMaker writes a new Makefile, on
       UNIX, this is called Makefile.aperl (may be system dependent). If you want to force the creation of a
       new perl, it is recommended, that you delete this Makefile.aperl, so the directories are searched-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">through&nbsp;searchedthrough</font>
       through for linkable libraries again.

       The binary can be installed into the directory where perl normally resides on your machine with

           make inst_perl

       To produce a perl binary with a different name than "perl", either say

           perl Makefile.PL MAP_TARGET=myperl
           make myperl
           make inst_perl

       or say

           perl Makefile.PL
           make myperl MAP_TARGET=myperl
           make inst_perl MAP_TARGET=myperl

       In any case you will be prompted with the correct invocation of the "inst_perl" target that installs
       the new binary into INSTALLBIN.

       make inst_perl per default writes some documentation of what has been done into the file "$(INSTAL-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">LARCHLIB)/perllocal.pod".&nbsp;"$(INSTALLARCHLIB)/perllocal.pod".</font>
       LARCHLIB)/perllocal.pod". This can be bypassed by calling make pure_inst_perl.

       Warning: the inst_perl: target will most probably overwrite your existing perl binary. Use with care!

       Sometimes you might want to build a statically linked perl although your system supports dynamic
       loading. In this case you may explicitly set the linktype with the invocation of the Makefile.PL or
       make:

           perl Makefile.PL LINKTYPE=static    # recommended

       or

           make LINKTYPE=static                # works on most systems

       <b>Determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>Library</b> <b>and</b> <b>Installation</b> <b>Locations</b>

       MakeMaker needs to know, or to guess, where certain things are located.  Especially INST_LIB and
       INST_ARCHLIB (where to put the files during the <a href="../man1/make.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/make"><u>make</u>(1)</a> run), PERL_LIB and PERL_ARCHLIB (where to
       read existing modules from), and PERL_INC (header files and "libperl*.*").

       Extensions may be built either using the contents of the perl source directory tree or from the
       installed perl library. The recommended way is to build extensions after you have run 'make install'
       on perl itself. You can do that in any directory on your hard disk that is not below the perl source
       tree. The support for extensions below the ext directory of the perl distribution is only good for
       the standard extensions that come with perl.

       If an extension is being built below the "ext/" directory of the perl source then MakeMaker will set
       PERL_SRC automatically (e.g., "../..").  If PERL_SRC is defined and the extension is recognized as a
       standard extension, then other variables default to the following:

         PERL_INC     = PERL_SRC
         PERL_LIB     = PERL_SRC/lib
         PERL_ARCHLIB = PERL_SRC/lib
         INST_LIB     = PERL_LIB
         INST_ARCHLIB = PERL_ARCHLIB

       If an extension is being built away from the perl source then MakeMaker will leave PERL_SRC undefined
       and default to using the installed copy of the perl library. The other variables default to the fol-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lowing:&nbsp;following:</font>
       lowing:

         PERL_INC     = $archlibexp/CORE
         PERL_LIB     = $privlibexp
         PERL_ARCHLIB = $archlibexp
         INST_LIB     = ./blib/lib
         INST_ARCHLIB = ./blib/arch

       If perl has not yet been installed then PERL_SRC can be defined on the command line as shown in the
       previous section.

       <b>Which</b> <b>architecture</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>directory?</b>

       If you don't want to keep the defaults for the INSTALL* macros, MakeMaker helps you to minimize the
       typing needed: the usual relationship between INSTALLPRIVLIB and INSTALLARCHLIB is determined by Con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">figure&nbsp;Configure</font>
       figure at perl compilation time. MakeMaker supports the user who sets INSTALLPRIVLIB. If INSTALL-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">PRIVLIB&nbsp;INSTALLPRIVLIB</font>
       PRIVLIB is set, but INSTALLARCHLIB not, then MakeMaker defaults the latter to be the same subdirec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tory&nbsp;subdirectory</font>
       tory of INSTALLPRIVLIB as Configure decided for the counterparts in %Config , otherwise it defaults
       to INSTALLPRIVLIB. The same relationship holds for INSTALLSITELIB and INSTALLSITEARCH.

       MakeMaker gives you much more freedom than needed to configure internal variables and get different
       results. It is worth to mention, that <a href="../man1/make.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/make"><u>make</u>(1)</a> also lets you configure most of the variables that are
       used in the Makefile. But in the majority of situations this will not be necessary, and should only
       be done if the author of a package recommends it (or you know what you're doing).

       <b>Using</b> <b>Attributes</b> <b>and</b> <b>Parameters</b>

       The following attributes may be specified as arguments to <u>WriteMakefile()</u> or as NAME=VALUE pairs on
       the command line.

       ABSTRACT
         One line description of the module. Will be included in PPD file.

       ABSTRACT_FROM
         Name of the file that contains the package description. MakeMaker looks for a line in the POD
         matching /^($package\s-\s)(.*)/. This is typically the first line in the "=head1 NAME" section. $2
         becomes the abstract.

       AUTHOR
         String containing name (and email address) of package <!-- a -->author(s)<!-- /a -->. Is used in PPD (Perl Package
         Description) files for PPM (Perl Package Manager).

       BINARY_LOCATION
         Used when creating PPD files for binary packages.  It can be set to a full or relative path or URL
         to the binary archive for a particular architecture.  For example:

                 perl Makefile.PL BINARY_LOCATION=x86/Agent.tar.gz

         builds a PPD package that references a binary of the "Agent" package, located in the "x86" direc-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tory&nbsp;directory</font>
         tory relative to the PPD itself.

       C Ref to array of *.c file names. Initialised from a directory scan and the values portion of the XS
         attribute hash. This is not currently used by MakeMaker but may be handy in Makefile.PLs.

       CCFLAGS
         String that will be included in the compiler call command line between the arguments INC and OPTI-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">MIZE.&nbsp;OPTIMIZE.</font>
         MIZE.

       CONFIG
         Arrayref. E.g. [qw(archname manext)] defines ARCHNAME &amp; MANEXT from config.sh. MakeMaker will add
         to CONFIG the following values anyway: ar cc cccdlflags ccdlflags dlext dlsrc ld lddlflags ldflags
         libc lib_ext obj_ext ranlib sitelibexp sitearchexp so

       CONFIGURE
         CODE reference. The subroutine should return a hash reference. The hash may contain further
         attributes, e.g. {LIBS =&gt; ...}, that have to be determined by some evaluation method.

       DEFINE
         Something like "-DHAVE_UNISTD_H"

       DESTDIR
         This is the root directory into which the code will be installed.  It <u>prepends</u> <u>itself</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>normal</u>
         <u>prefix</u>.  For example, if your code would normally go into <u>/usr/local/lib/perl</u> you could set DEST-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">DIR=~/tmp/&nbsp;DESTDIR=~/tmp/</font>
         DIR=~/tmp/ and installation would go into <u>~/tmp/usr/local/lib/perl</u>.

         This is primarily of use for people who repackage Perl modules.

         NOTE: Due to the nature of make, it is important that you put the trailing slash on your DESTDIR.
         <u>~/tmp/</u> not <u>~/tmp</u>.

       DIR
         Ref to array of subdirectories containing Makefile.PLs e.g. [ 'sdbm' ] in ext/SDBM_File

       DISTNAME
         A safe filename for the package.

         Defaults to NAME above but with :: replaced with -.

         For example, Foo::Bar becomes Foo-Bar.

       DISTVNAME
         Your name for distributing the package with the version number included.  This is used by 'make
         dist' to name the resulting archive file.

         Defaults to DISTNAME-VERSION.

         For example, version 1.04 of Foo::Bar becomes Foo-Bar-1.04.

         On some OS's where . has special meaning VERSION_SYM may be used in place of VERSION.

       DL_FUNCS
         Hashref of symbol names for routines to be made available as universal symbols.  Each key/value
         pair consists of the package name and an array of routine names in that package.  Used only under
         AIX, OS/2, VMS and Win32 at present.  The routine names supplied will be expanded in the same way
         as XSUB names are expanded by the <u>XS()</u> macro.  Defaults to

           {"$(NAME)" =&gt; ["boot_$(NAME)" ] }

         e.g.

           {"RPC" =&gt; [qw( boot_rpcb rpcb_gettime getnetconfigent )],
            "NetconfigPtr" =&gt; [ 'DESTROY'] }

         Please see the ExtUtils::Mksymlists documentation for more information about the DL_FUNCS, DL_VARS
         and FUNCLIST attributes.

       DL_VARS
         Array of symbol names for variables to be made available as universal symbols.  Used only under
         AIX, OS/2, VMS and Win32 at present.  Defaults to [].  (e.g. [ qw(Foo_version Foo_numstreams
         Foo_tree ) ])

       EXCLUDE_EXT
         Array of extension names to exclude when doing a static build.  This is ignored if INCLUDE_EXT is
         present.  Consult INCLUDE_EXT for more details.  (e.g.  [ qw( Socket POSIX ) ] )

         This attribute may be most useful when specified as a string on the command line:  perl Makefile.PL
         EXCLUDE_EXT='Socket Safe'

       EXE_FILES
         Ref to array of executable files. The files will be copied to the INST_SCRIPT directory. Make real-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">clean&nbsp;realclean</font>
         clean will delete them from there again.

         If your executables start with something like #!perl or #!/usr/bin/perl MakeMaker will change this
         to the path of the perl 'Makefile.PL' was invoked with so the programs will be sure to run properly
         even if perl is not in /usr/bin/perl.

       FIRST_MAKEFILE
         The name of the Makefile to be produced.  This is used for the second Makefile that will be pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">duced&nbsp;produced</font>
         duced for the MAP_TARGET.

         Defaults to 'Makefile' or 'Descrip.MMS' on VMS.

         (Note: we couldn't use MAKEFILE because dmake uses this for something else).

       FULLPERL
         Perl binary able to run this extension, load XS modules, etc...

       FULLPERLRUN
         Like PERLRUN, except it uses FULLPERL.

       FULLPERLRUNINST
         Like PERLRUNINST, except it uses FULLPERL.

       FUNCLIST
         This provides an alternate means to specify function names to be exported from the extension.  Its
         value is a reference to an array of function names to be exported by the extension.  These names
         are passed through unaltered to the linker options file.

       H Ref to array of *.h file names. Similar to C.

       IMPORTS
         This attribute is used to specify names to be imported into the extension. Takes a hash ref.

         It is only used on OS/2 and Win32.

       INC
         Include file dirs eg: "-I/usr/5include -I/path/to/inc"

       INCLUDE_EXT
         Array of extension names to be included when doing a static build.  MakeMaker will normally build
         with all of the installed extensions when doing a static build, and that is usually the desired
         behavior.  If INCLUDE_EXT is present then MakeMaker will build only with those extensions which are
         explicitly mentioned. (e.g.  [ qw( Socket POSIX ) ])

         It is not necessary to mention DynaLoader or the current extension when filling in INCLUDE_EXT.  If
         the INCLUDE_EXT is mentioned but is empty then only DynaLoader and the current extension will be
         included in the build.

         This attribute may be most useful when specified as a string on the command line:  perl Makefile.PL
         INCLUDE_EXT='POSIX Socket Devel::Peek'

       INSTALLARCHLIB
         Used by 'make install', which copies files from INST_ARCHLIB to this directory if INSTALLDIRS is
         set to perl.

       INSTALLBIN
         Directory to install binary files (e.g. tkperl) into if INSTALLDIRS=perl.

       INSTALLDIRS
         Determines which of the sets of installation directories to choose: perl, site or vendor.  Defaults
         to site.

       INSTALLMAN1DIR
       INSTALLMAN3DIR
         These directories get the man pages at 'make install' time if INSTALLDIRS=perl.  Defaults to $Con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fig{installman*dir}.&nbsp;$Config{installman*dir}.</font>
         fig{installman*dir}.

         If set to 'none', no man pages will be installed.

       INSTALLPRIVLIB
         Used by 'make install', which copies files from INST_LIB to this directory if INSTALLDIRS is set to
         perl.

         Defaults to $Config{installprivlib}.

       INSTALLSCRIPT
         Used by 'make install' which copies files from INST_SCRIPT to this directory.

       INSTALLSITEARCH
         Used by 'make install', which copies files from INST_ARCHLIB to this directory if INSTALLDIRS is
         set to site (default).

       INSTALLSITEBIN
         Used by 'make install', which copies files from INST_BIN to this directory if INSTALLDIRS is set to
         site (default).

       INSTALLSITELIB
         Used by 'make install', which copies files from INST_LIB to this directory if INSTALLDIRS is set to
         site (default).

       INSTALLSITEMAN1DIR
       INSTALLSITEMAN3DIR
         These directories get the man pages at 'make install' time if INSTALLDIRS=site (default).  Defaults
         to $(SITEPREFIX)/man/man$(MAN*EXT).

         If set to 'none', no man pages will be installed.

       INSTALLVENDORARCH
         Used by 'make install', which copies files from INST_ARCHLIB to this directory if INSTALLDIRS is
         set to vendor.

       INSTALLVENDORBIN
         Used by 'make install', which copies files from INST_BIN to this directory if INSTALLDIRS is set to
         vendor.

       INSTALLVENDORLIB
         Used by 'make install', which copies files from INST_LIB to this directory if INSTALLDIRS is set to
         vendor.

       INSTALLVENDORMAN1DIR
       INSTALLVENDORMAN3DIR
         These directories get the man pages at 'make install' time if INSTALLDIRS=vendor.  Defaults to
         $(VENDORPREFIX)/man/man$(MAN*EXT).

         If set to 'none', no man pages will be installed.

       INST_ARCHLIB
         Same as INST_LIB for architecture dependent files.

       INST_BIN
         Directory to put real binary files during 'make'. These will be copied to INSTALLBIN during 'make
         install'

       INST_LIB
         Directory where we put library files of this extension while building it.

       INST_MAN1DIR
         Directory to hold the man pages at 'make' time

       INST_MAN3DIR
         Directory to hold the man pages at 'make' time

       INST_SCRIPT
         Directory, where executable files should be installed during 'make'. Defaults to "./blib/script",
         just to have a dummy location during testing. make install will copy the files in INST_SCRIPT to
         INSTALLSCRIPT.

       LD
         Program to be used to link libraries for dynamic loading.

         Defaults to $Config{ld}.

       LDDLFLAGS
         Any special flags that might need to be passed to ld to create a shared library suitable for
         dynamic loading.  It is up to the makefile to use it.  (See "lddlflags" in Config)

         Defaults to $Config{lddlflags}.

       LDFROM
         Defaults to "$(OBJECT)" and is used in the ld command to specify what files to link/load from (also
         see dynamic_lib below for how to specify ld flags)

       LIB
         LIB should only be set at "perl Makefile.PL" time but is allowed as a MakeMaker argument. It has
         the effect of setting both INSTALLPRIVLIB and INSTALLSITELIB to that value regardless any explicit
         setting of those arguments (or of PREFIX).  INSTALLARCHLIB and INSTALLSITEARCH are set to the cor-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">responding&nbsp;corresponding</font>
         responding architecture subdirectory.

       LIBPERL_A
         The filename of the perllibrary that will be used together with this extension. Defaults to
         libperl.a.

       LIBS
         An anonymous array of alternative library specifications to be searched for (in order) until at
         least one library is found. E.g.

           'LIBS' =&gt; ["-lgdbm", "-ldbm -lfoo", "-L/path -ldbm.nfs"]

         Mind, that any element of the array contains a complete set of arguments for the ld command. So do
         not specify

           'LIBS' =&gt; ["-ltcl", "-ltk", "-lX11"]

         See ODBM_File/Makefile.PL for an example, where an array is needed. If you specify a scalar as in

           'LIBS' =&gt; "-ltcl -ltk -lX11"

         MakeMaker will turn it into an array with one element.

       LINKTYPE
         'static' or 'dynamic' (default unless usedl=undef in config.sh). Should only be used to force
         static linking (also see linkext below).

       MAKEAPERL
         Boolean which tells MakeMaker, that it should include the rules to make a perl. This is handled
         automatically as a switch by MakeMaker. The user normally does not need it.

       MAKEFILE_OLD
         When 'make clean' or similar is run, the $(FIRST_MAKEFILE) will be backed up at this location.

         Defaults to $(FIRST_MAKEFILE).old or $(FIRST_MAKEFILE)_old on VMS.

       MAN1PODS
         Hashref of pod-containing files. MakeMaker will default this to all EXE_FILES files that include
         POD directives. The files listed here will be converted to man pages and installed as was requested
         at Configure time.

       MAN3PODS
         Hashref that assigns to *.pm and *.pod files the files into which the manpages are to be written.
         MakeMaker parses all *.pod and *.pm files for POD directives. Files that contain POD will be the
         default keys of the MAN3PODS hashref. These will then be converted to man pages during "make" and
         will be installed during "make install".

       MAP_TARGET
         If it is intended, that a new perl binary be produced, this variable may hold a name for that
         binary. Defaults to perl

       MYEXTLIB
         If the extension links to a library that it builds set this to the name of the library (see
         SDBM_File)

       NAME
         Perl module name for this extension (DBD::Oracle). This will default to the directory name but
         should be explicitly defined in the Makefile.PL.

       NEEDS_LINKING
         MakeMaker will figure out if an extension contains linkable code anywhere down the directory tree,
         and will set this variable accordingly, but you can speed it up a very little bit if you define
         this boolean variable yourself.

       NOECHO
         Command so make does not print the literal commands its running.

         By setting it to an empty string you can generate a Makefile that prints all commands. Mainly used
         in debugging MakeMaker itself.

         Defaults to "@".

       NORECURS
         Boolean.  Attribute to inhibit descending into subdirectories.

       NO_META
         When true, suppresses the generation and addition to the MANIFEST of the META.yml module meta-data
         file during 'make distdir'.

         Defaults to false.

       NO_VC
         In general, any generated Makefile checks for the current version of MakeMaker and the version the
         Makefile was built under. If NO_VC is set, the version check is neglected. Do not write this into
         your Makefile.PL, use it interactively instead.

       OBJECT
         List of object files, defaults to '$(BASEEXT)$(OBJ_EXT)', but can be a long string containing all
         object files, e.g. "tkpBind.o tkpButton.o tkpCanvas.o"

         (Where BASEEXT is the last component of NAME, and OBJ_EXT is $Config{obj_ext}.)

       OPTIMIZE
         Defaults to "-O". Set it to "-g" to turn debugging on. The flag is passed to subdirectory makes.

       PERL
         Perl binary for tasks that can be done by miniperl

       PERL_CORE
         Set only when MakeMaker is building the extensions of the Perl core distribution.

       PERLMAINCC
         The call to the program that is able to compile perlmain.c. Defaults to $(CC).

       PERL_ARCHLIB
         Same as for PERL_LIB, but for architecture dependent files.

         Used only when MakeMaker is building the extensions of the Perl core distribution (because normally
         $(PERL_ARCHLIB) is automatically in @INC, and adding it would get in the way of PERL5LIB).

       PERL_LIB
         Directory containing the Perl library to use.

         Used only when MakeMaker is building the extensions of the Perl core distribution (because normally
         $(PERL_LIB) is automatically in @INC, and adding it would get in the way of PERL5LIB).

       PERL_MALLOC_OK
         defaults to 0.  Should be set to TRUE if the extension can work with the memory allocation routines
         substituted by the Perl <u>malloc()</u> subsystem.  This should be applicable to most extensions with
         exceptions of those

         *   with bugs in memory allocations which are caught by Perl's <u>malloc()</u>;

         *   which interact with the memory allocator in other ways than via <u>malloc()</u>, <u>realloc()</u>, <u>free()</u>,
             <u>calloc()</u>, <u>sbrk()</u> and <u>brk()</u>;

         *   which rely on special alignment which is not provided by Perl's <u>malloc()</u>.

         <b>NOTE.</b>  Negligence to set this flag in <u>any</u> <u>one</u> of loaded extension nullifies many advantages of
         Perl's <u>malloc()</u>, such as better usage of system resources, error detection, memory usage reporting,
         catchable failure of memory allocations, etc.

       PERLPREFIX
         Directory under which core modules are to be installed.

         Defaults to $Config{installprefixexp} falling back to $Config{installprefix}, $Config{prefixexp} or
         $Config{prefix} should $Config{installprefixexp} not exist.

         Overridden by PREFIX.

       PERLRUN
         Use this instead of $(PERL) when you wish to run perl.  It will set up extra necessary flags for
         you.

       PERLRUNINST
         Use this instead of $(PERL) when you wish to run perl to work with modules.  It will add things
         like -I$(INST_ARCH) and other necessary flags so perl can see the modules you're about to install.

       PERL_SRC
         Directory containing the Perl source code (use of this should be avoided, it may be undefined)

       PERM_RW
         Desired permission for read/writable files. Defaults to 644.  See also "perm_rw" in MM_Unix.

       PERM_RWX
         Desired permission for executable files. Defaults to 755.  See also "perm_rwx" in MM_Unix.

       PL_FILES
         MakeMaker can run programs to generate files for you at build time.  By default any file named *.PL
         (except Makefile.PL and Build.PL) in the top level directory will be assumed to be a Perl program
         and run passing its own basename in as an argument.  For example...

             perl foo.PL foo

         This behavior can be overridden by supplying your own set of files to search.  PL_FILES accepts a
         hash ref, the key being the file to run and the value is passed in as the first argument when the
         PL file is run.

             PL_FILES =&gt; {'bin/foobar.PL' =&gt; 'bin/foobar'}

         Would run bin/foobar.PL like this:

             perl bin/foobar.PL bin/foobar

         If multiple files from one program are desired an array ref can be used.

             PL_FILES =&gt; {'bin/foobar.PL' =&gt; [qw(bin/foobar1 bin/foobar2)]}

         In this case the program will be run multiple times using each target file.

             perl bin/foobar.PL bin/foobar1
             perl bin/foobar.PL bin/foobar2

         PL files are normally run <b>after</b> pm_to_blib and include INST_LIB and INST_ARCH in its @INC so the
         just built modules can be accessed... unless the PL file is making a module (or anything else in
         PM) in which case it is run <b>before</b> pm_to_blib and does not include INST_LIB and INST_ARCH in its
         @INC.  This apparently odd behavior is there for backwards compatibility (and its somewhat DWIM).

       PM
         Hashref of .pm files and *.pl files to be installed.  e.g.

           {'name_of_file.pm' =&gt; '$(INST_LIBDIR)/install_as.pm'}

         By default this will include *.pm and *.pl and the files found in the PMLIBDIRS directories.
         Defining PM in the Makefile.PL will override PMLIBDIRS.

       PMLIBDIRS
         Ref to array of subdirectories containing library files.  Defaults to [ 'lib', $(BASEEXT) ]. The
         directories will be scanned and <u>any</u> files they contain will be installed in the corresponding loca-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;location</font>
         tion in the library.  A <u>libscan()</u> method can be used to alter the behaviour.  Defining PM in the
         Makefile.PL will override PMLIBDIRS.

         (Where BASEEXT is the last component of NAME.)

       PM_FILTER
         A filter program, in the traditional Unix sense (input from stdin, output to stdout) that is passed
         on each .pm file during the build (in the <u>pm</u><b>_</b><u>to</u><b>_</b><u>blib()</u> phase).  It is empty by default, meaning no
         filtering is done.

         Great care is necessary when defining the command if quoting needs to be done.  For instance, you
         would need to say:

           {'PM_FILTER' =&gt; 'grep -v \\"^\\#\\"'}

         to remove all the leading coments on the fly during the build.  The extra \\ are necessary, unfor-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tunately,&nbsp;unfortunately,</font>
         tunately, because this variable is interpolated within the context of a Perl program built on the
         command line, and double quotes are what is used with the -e switch to build that command line.
         The # is escaped for the Makefile, since what is going to be generated will then be:

           PM_FILTER = grep -v \"^\#\"

         Without the \\ before the #, we'd have the start of a Makefile comment, and the macro would be
         incorrectly defined.

       POLLUTE
         Release 5.005 grandfathered old global symbol names by providing preprocessor macros for extension
         source compatibility.  As of release 5.6, these preprocessor definitions are not available by
         default.  The POLLUTE flag specifies that the old names should still be defined:

           perl Makefile.PL POLLUTE=1

         Please inform the module author if this is necessary to successfully install a module under 5.6 or
         later.

       PPM_INSTALL_EXEC
         Name of the executable used to run "PPM_INSTALL_SCRIPT" below. (e.g. perl)

       PPM_INSTALL_SCRIPT
         Name of the script that gets executed by the Perl Package Manager after the installation of a pack-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">age.&nbsp;package.</font>
         age.

       PREFIX
         This overrides all the default install locations.  Man pages, libraries, scripts, etc...  MakeMaker
         will try to make an educated guess about where to place things under the new PREFIX based on your
         Config defaults.  Failing that, it will fall back to a structure which should be sensible for your
         platform.

         If you specify LIB or any INSTALL* variables they will not be effected by the PREFIX.

       PREREQ_FATAL
         Bool. If this parameter is true, failing to have the required modules (or the right versions
         thereof) will be fatal. perl Makefile.PL will die with the proper message.

         Note: see Test::Harness for a shortcut for stopping tests early if you are missing dependencies.

         Do <u>not</u> use this parameter for simple requirements, which could be resolved at a later time, e.g.
         after an unsuccessful <b>make</b> <b>test</b> of your module.

         It is <u>extremely</u> rare to have to use "PREREQ_FATAL" at all!

       PREREQ_PM
         Hashref: Names of modules that need to be available to run this extension (e.g. Fcntl for
         SDBM_File) are the keys of the hash and the desired version is the value. If the required version
         number is 0, we only check if any version is installed already.

       PREREQ_PRINT
         Bool.  If this parameter is true, the prerequisites will be printed to stdout and MakeMaker will
         exit.  The output format is an evalable hash ref.

         $PREREQ_PM = {
                        'A::B' =&gt; Vers1,
                        'C::D' =&gt; Vers2,
                        ...
                      };

       PRINT_PREREQ
         RedHatism for "PREREQ_PRINT".  The output format is different, though:

             perl(A::B)&gt;=Vers1 perl(C::D)&gt;=Vers2 ...

       SITEPREFIX
         Like PERLPREFIX, but only for the site install locations.

         Defaults to $Config{siteprefixexp}.  Perls prior to 5.6.0 didn't have an explicit siteprefix in the
         Config.  In those cases $Config{installprefix} will be used.

         Overridable by PREFIX

       SIGN
         When true, perform the generation and addition to the MANIFEST of the SIGNATURE file in the distdir
         during 'make distdir', via 'cpansign -s'.

         Note that you need to install the Module::Signature module to perform this operation.

         Defaults to false.

       SKIP
         Arrayref. E.g. [qw(name1 name2)] skip (do not write) sections of the Makefile. Caution! Do not use
         the SKIP attribute for the negligible speedup. It may seriously damage the resulting Makefile. Only
         use it if you really need it.

       TYPEMAPS
         Ref to array of typemap file names.  Use this when the typemaps are in some directory other than
         the current directory or when they are not named <b>typemap</b>.  The last typemap in the list takes
         precedence.  A typemap in the current directory has highest precedence, even if it isn't listed in
         TYPEMAPS.  The default system typemap has lowest precedence.

       VENDORPREFIX
         Like PERLPREFIX, but only for the vendor install locations.

         Defaults to $Config{vendorprefixexp}.

         Overridable by PREFIX

       VERBINST
         If true, make install will be verbose

       VERSION
         Your version number for distributing the package.  This defaults to 0.1.

       VERSION_FROM
         Instead of specifying the VERSION in the Makefile.PL you can let MakeMaker parse a file to deter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mine&nbsp;determine</font>
         mine the version number. The parsing routine requires that the file named by VERSION_FROM contains
         one single line to compute the version number. The first line in the file that contains the regular
         expression

             /([\$*])(([\w\:\']*)\bVERSION)\b.*\=/

         will be evaluated with <u>eval()</u> and the value of the named variable <b>after</b> the <u>eval()</u> will be assigned
         to the VERSION attribute of the MakeMaker object. The following lines will be parsed o.k.:

             $VERSION = '1.00';
             *VERSION = \'1.01';
             $VERSION = sprintf "%d.%03d", q$Revision: 4535 $ =~ /(\d+)/g;
             $FOO::VERSION = '1.10';
             *FOO::VERSION = \'1.11';
             our $VERSION = 1.2.3;       # new for perl5.6.0

         but these will fail:

             my $VERSION = '1.01';
             local $VERSION = '1.02';
             local $FOO::VERSION = '1.30';

         (Putting "my" or "local" on the preceding line will work o.k.)

         The file named in VERSION_FROM is not added as a dependency to Makefile. This is not really cor-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rect,&nbsp;correct,</font>
         rect, but it would be a major pain during development to have to rewrite the Makefile for any
         smallish change in that file. If you want to make sure that the Makefile contains the correct VER-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">SION&nbsp;VERSION</font>
         SION macro after any change of the file, you would have to do something like

             depend =&gt; { Makefile =&gt; '$(VERSION_FROM)' }

         See attribute "depend" below.

       VERSION_SYM
         A sanitized VERSION with . replaced by _.  For places where . has special meaning (some filesys-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tems,&nbsp;filesystems,</font>
         tems, RCS labels, etc...)

       XS
         Hashref of .xs files. MakeMaker will default this.  e.g.

           {'name_of_file.xs' =&gt; 'name_of_file.c'}

         The .c files will automatically be included in the list of files deleted by a make clean.

       XSOPT
         String of options to pass to xsubpp.  This might include "-C++" or "-extern".  Do not include
         typemaps here; the TYPEMAP parameter exists for that purpose.

       XSPROTOARG
         May be set to an empty string, which is identical to "-prototypes", or "-noprototypes". See the
         xsubpp documentation for details. MakeMaker defaults to the empty string.

       XS_VERSION
         Your version number for the .xs file of this package.  This defaults to the value of the VERSION
         attribute.

       <b>Additional</b> <b>lowercase</b> <b>attributes</b>

       can be used to pass parameters to the methods which implement that part of the Makefile.  Parameters
       are specified as a hash ref but are passed to the method as a hash.

           {FILES =&gt; "*.xyz foo"}

       depend
           {ANY_TARGET =&gt; ANY_DEPENDECY, ...}

         (ANY_TARGET must not be given a double-colon rule by MakeMaker.)

           {TARFLAGS =&gt; 'cvfF', COMPRESS =&gt; 'gzip', SUFFIX =&gt; '.gz',
           SHAR =&gt; 'shar -m', DIST_CP =&gt; 'ln', ZIP =&gt; '/bin/zip',
           ZIPFLAGS =&gt; '-rl', DIST_DEFAULT =&gt; 'private tardist' }

         If you specify COMPRESS, then SUFFIX should also be altered, as it is needed to tell make the tar-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">get&nbsp;target</font>
         get file of the compression. Setting DIST_CP to ln can be useful, if you need to preserve the time-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">stamps&nbsp;timestamps</font>
         stamps on your files. DIST_CP can take the values 'cp', which copies the file, 'ln', which links
         the file, and 'best' which copies symbolic links and links the rest. Default is 'best'.

         NB: Extensions that have nothing but *.pm files had to say

           {LINKTYPE =&gt; ''}

         with Pre-5.0 MakeMakers. Since version 5.00 of MakeMaker such a line can be deleted safely. Make-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">Maker&nbsp;MakeMaker</font>

       <b>Overriding</b> <b>MakeMaker</b> <b>Methods</b>

       If you cannot achieve the desired Makefile behaviour by specifying attributes you may define private
       subroutines in the Makefile.PL.  Each subroutine returns the text it wishes to have written to the
       Makefile. To override a section of the Makefile you can either say:

               sub MY::c_o { "new literal text" }

       or you can edit the default by saying something like:

               package MY; # so that "SUPER" works right
               sub c_o {
                   my $inherited = shift-&gt;SUPER::c_o(@_);
                   $inherited =~ s/old text/new text/;
                   $inherited;
               }

       If you are running experiments with embedding perl as a library into other applications, you might
       find MakeMaker is not sufficient. You'd better have a look at ExtUtils::Embed which is a collection
       of utilities for embedding.

       If you still need a different solution, try to develop another subroutine that fits your needs and
       submit the diffs to "makemaker@perl.org"

       For a complete description of all MakeMaker methods see ExtUtils::MM_Unix.

       Here is a simple example of how to add a new target to the generated Makefile:

           sub MY::postamble {
               return &lt;&lt;'MAKE_FRAG';
           $(MYEXTLIB): sdbm/Makefile
                   cd sdbm &amp;&amp; $(MAKE) all

           MAKE_FRAG
           }

       <b>The</b> <b>End</b> <b>Of</b> <b>Cargo</b> <b>Cult</b> <b>Programming</b>

       <u>WriteMakefile()</u> now does some basic sanity checks on its parameters to protect against typos and mal-
       formatted values.  This means some things which happened to work in the past will now throw warnings
       and possibly produce internal errors.

       Some of the most common mistakes:

       "MAN3PODS =&gt; ' '"
         This is commonly used to supress the creation of man pages.  MAN3PODS takes a hash ref not a
         string, but the above worked by accident in old versions of MakeMaker.

         The correct code is "MAN3PODS =&gt; { }".

       <b>Hintsfile</b> <b>support</b>

       MakeMaker.pm uses the architecture specific information from Config.pm. In addition it evaluates
       architecture specific hints files in a "hints/" directory. The hints files are expected to be named
       like their counterparts in "PERL_SRC/hints", but with an ".pl" file name extension (eg.
       "next_3_2.pl"). They are simply "eval"ed by MakeMaker within the <u>WriteMakefile()</u> subroutine, and can
       be used to execute commands as well as to include special variables. The rules which hintsfile is
       chosen are the same as in Configure.

       The hintsfile is <u>eval()</u>ed immediately after the arguments given to WriteMakefile are stuffed into a
       hash reference $self but before this reference becomes blessed. So if you want to do the equivalent
       to override or create an attribute you would say something like

           $self-&gt;{LIBS} = ['-ldbm -lucb -lc'];

       <b>Distribution</b> <b>Support</b>

       For authors of extensions MakeMaker provides several Makefile targets. Most of the support comes from
       the ExtUtils::Manifest module, where additional documentation can be found.

       make distcheck
           reports which files are below the build directory but not in the MANIFEST file and vice versa.
           (See <u>ExtUtils::Manifest::fullcheck()</u> for details)

       make skipcheck
           reports which files are skipped due to the entries in the "MANIFEST.SKIP" file (See <u>ExtU</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tils::Manifest::skipcheck()&nbsp;ExtUtils::Manifest::skipcheck()</font>
           <u>tils::Manifest::skipcheck()</u> for details)

       make distclean
           does a realclean first and then the distcheck. Note that this is not needed to build a new dis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tribution&nbsp;distribution</font>
           tribution as long as you are sure that the MANIFEST file is ok.

       make manifest
           rewrites the MANIFEST file, adding all remaining files found (See <u>ExtUtils::Manifest::mkmani</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fest()&nbsp;ExtUtils::Manifest::mkmanifest()</font>
           <u>fest()</u> for details)

       make distdir
           Copies all the files that are in the MANIFEST file to a newly created directory with the name
           "$(DISTNAME)-$(VERSION)". If that directory exists, it will be removed first.

           Additionally, it will create a META.yml module meta-data file in the distdir and add this to the
           distdir's MANFIEST.  You can shut this behavior off with the NO_META flag.

       make disttest
           Makes a distdir first, and runs a "perl Makefile.PL", a make, and a make test in that directory.

       make tardist
           First does a distdir. Then a command $(PREOP) which defaults to a null command, followed by
           $(TOUNIX), which defaults to a null command under UNIX, and will convert files in distribution
           directory to UNIX format otherwise. Next it runs "tar" on that directory into a tarfile and
           deletes the directory. Finishes with a command $(POSTOP) which defaults to a null command.

       make dist
           Defaults to $(DIST_DEFAULT) which in turn defaults to tardist.

       make uutardist
           Runs a tardist first and uuencodes the tarfile.

       make shdist
           First does a distdir. Then a command $(PREOP) which defaults to a null command. Next it runs
           "shar" on that directory into a sharfile and deletes the intermediate directory again. Finishes
           with a command $(POSTOP) which defaults to a null command.  Note: For shdist to work properly a
           "shar" program that can handle directories is mandatory.

       make zipdist
           First does a distdir. Then a command $(PREOP) which defaults to a null command. Runs "$(ZIP)
           $(ZIPFLAGS)" on that directory into a zipfile. Then deletes that directory. Finishes with a com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
           mand $(POSTOP) which defaults to a null command.

       make ci
           Does a $(CI) and a $(RCS_LABEL) on all files in the MANIFEST file.

       Customization of the dist targets can be done by specifying a hash reference to the dist attribute of
       the WriteMakefile call. The following parameters are recognized:

           CI           ('ci -u')
           COMPRESS     ('gzip --best')
           POSTOP       ('@ :')
           PREOP        ('@ :')
           TO_UNIX      (depends on the system)
           RCS_LABEL    ('rcs -q -Nv$(VERSION_SYM):')
           SHAR         ('shar')
           SUFFIX       ('.gz')
           TAR          ('tar')
           TARFLAGS     ('cvf')
           ZIP          ('zip')
           ZIPFLAGS     ('-r')

       An example:

           WriteMakefile( 'dist' =&gt; { COMPRESS=&gt;"bzip2", SUFFIX=&gt;".bz2" })

       <b>Module</b> <b>Meta-Data</b>

       Long plaguing users of MakeMaker based modules has been the problem of getting basic information
       about the module out of the sources <u>without</u> running the <u>Makefile.PL</u> and doing a bunch of messy
       heuristics on the resulting <u>Makefile</u>.  To this end a simple module meta-data file has been intro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">duced,&nbsp;introduced,</font>
       duced, <u>META.yml</u>.

       <u>META.yml</u> is a YAML document (see <a href="http://www.yaml.org)">http://www.yaml.org)</a> containing basic information about the module
       (name, version, prerequisites...)  in an easy to read format.  The format is developed and defined by
       the Module::Build developers (see <a href="http://module-build.sourceforge.net/META-spec.html)">http://module-build.sourceforge.net/META-spec.html)</a>

       MakeMaker will automatically generate a <u>META.yml</u> file for you and add it to your <u>MANIFEST</u> as part of
       the 'distdir' target (and thus the 'dist' target).  This is intended to seamlessly and rapidly popu-
       late CPAN with module meta-data.  If you wish to shut this feature off, set the "NO_META" "WriteMake-
       file()" flag to true.

       <b>Disabling</b> <b>an</b> <b>extension</b>

       If some events detected in <u>Makefile.PL</u> imply that there is no way to create the Module, but this is a
       normal state of things, then you can create a <u>Makefile</u> which does nothing, but succeeds on all the
       "usual" build targets.  To do so, use

          ExtUtils::MakeMaker::WriteEmptyMakefile();

       instead of <u>WriteMakefile()</u>.

       This may be useful if other modules expect this module to be <u>built</u> OK, as opposed to <u>work</u> OK (say,
       this system-dependent module builds in a subdirectory of some other distribution, or is listed as a
       dependency in a CPAN::Bundle, but the functionality is supported by different means on the current
       architecture).

       <b>Other</b> <b>Handy</b> <b>Functions</b>


       prompt
               my $value = prompt($message);
               my $value = prompt($message, $default);

           The "prompt()" function provides an easy way to request user input used to write a makefile.  It
           displays the $message as a prompt for input.  If a $default is provided it will be used as a
           default.  The function returns the $value selected by the user.

           If "prompt()" detects that it is not running interactively and there is nothing on STDIN or if
           the PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT environment variable is set to true, the $default will be used without
           prompting.  This prevents automated processes from blocking on user input.

           If no $default is provided an empty string will be used instead.

<b>ENVIRONMENT</b>
       PERL_MM_OPT
           Command line options used by "MakeMaker-&gt;new()", and thus by "WriteMakefile()".  The string is
           split on whitespace, and the result is processed before any actual command line arguments are
           processed.

       PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT
           If set to a true value then MakeMaker's prompt function will always return the default without
           waiting for user input.

       PERL_CORE
           Same as the PERL_CORE parameter.  The parameter overrides this.
