<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The <b>ca</b> command is a minimal CA application. It can be used to sign certificate requests in a variety
       of forms and generate CRLs it also maintains a text database of issued certificates and their status.

       The options descriptions will be divided into each purpose.

<b>CA</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-config</b> <b>filename</b>
           specifies the configuration file to use.

       <b>-name</b> <b>section</b>
           specifies the configuration file section to use (overrides <b>default_ca</b> in the <b>ca</b> section).

       <b>-in</b> <b>filename</b>
           an input filename containing a single certificate request to be signed by the CA.

       <b>-ss_cert</b> <b>filename</b>
           a single self signed certificate to be signed by the CA.

       <b>-spkac</b> <b>filename</b>
           a file containing a single Netscape signed public key and challenge and additional field values
           to be signed by the CA. See the <b>SPKAC</b> <b>FORMAT</b> section for information on the required format.

       <b>-infiles</b>
           if present this should be the last option, all subsequent arguments are assumed to the the names
           of files containing certificate requests.

       <b>-out</b> <b>filename</b>
           the output file to output certificates to. The default is standard output. The certificate
           details will also be printed out to this file.

       <b>-outdir</b> <b>directory</b>
           the directory to output certificates to. The certificate will be written to a filename consisting
           of the serial number in hex with ".pem" appended.

       <b>-cert</b>
           the CA certificate file.

       <b>-keyfile</b> <b>filename</b>
           the private key to sign requests with.

       <b>-key</b> <b>password</b>
           the password used to encrypt the private key. Since on some systems the command line arguments
           are visible (e.g. Unix with the 'ps' utility) this option should be used with caution.

       <b>-passin</b> <b>arg</b>
           the key password source. For more information about the format of <b>arg</b> see the <b>PASS</b> <b>PHRASE</b>
           <b>ARGUMENTS</b> section in <a href="openssl.1ssl.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/openssl"><u>openssl</u>(1)</a>.

       <b>-verbose</b>
           this prints extra details about the operations being performed.

       <b>-notext</b>
           don't output the text form of a certificate to the output file.

       <b>-startdate</b> <b>date</b>
           this allows the start date to be explicitly set. The format of the date is YYMMDDHHMMSSZ (the
           same as an ASN1 UTCTime structure).

       <b>-enddate</b> <b>date</b>
           this allows the expiry date to be explicitly set. The format of the date is YYMMDDHHMMSSZ (the
           same as an ASN1 UTCTime structure).

       <b>-days</b> <b>arg</b>
           the number of days to certify the certificate for.

       <b>-md</b> <b>alg</b>
           the message digest to use. Possible values include md5, sha1 and mdc2.  This option also applies
           to CRLs.

       <b>-policy</b> <b>arg</b>
           this option defines the CA "policy" to use. This is a section in the configuration file which
           decides which fields should be mandatory or match the CA certificate. Check out the <b>POLICY</b> <b>FORMAT</b>
           section for more information.

       <b>-msie_hack</b>
           this is a legacy option to make <b>ca</b> work with very old versions of the IE certificate enrollment
           control "certenr3". It used UniversalStrings for almost everything. Since the old control has
           various security bugs its use is strongly discouraged. The newer control "Xenroll" does not need
           this option.

       <b>-preserveDN</b>
           Normally the DN order of a certificate is the same as the order of the fields in the relevant
           policy section. When this option is set the order is the same as the request. This is largely for
           compatibility with the older IE enrollment control which would only accept certificates if their
           DNs match the order of the request. This is not needed for Xenroll.

       <b>-noemailDN</b>
           The DN of a certificate can contain the EMAIL field if present in the request DN, however it is
           good policy just having the e-mail set into the altName extension of the certificate. When this
           option is set the EMAIL field is removed from the certificate' subject and set only in the,
           eventually present, extensions. The <b>email_in_dn</b> keyword can be used in the configuration file to
           enable this behaviour.

       <b>-batch</b>
           this sets the batch mode. In this mode no questions will be asked and all certificates will be
           certified automatically.

       <b>-extensions</b> <b>section</b>
           the section of the configuration file containing certificate extensions to be added when a
           certificate is issued (defaults to <b>x509_extensions</b> unless the <b>-extfile</b> option is used). If no
           extension section is present then, a V1 certificate is created. If the extension section is
           present (even if it is empty), then a V3 certificate is created.

       <b>-extfile</b> <b>file</b>
           an additional configuration file to read certificate extensions from (using the default section
           unless the <b>-extensions</b> option is also used).

       <b>-engine</b> <b>id</b>
           specifying an engine (by it's unique <b>id</b> string) will cause <b>req</b> to attempt to obtain a functional
           reference to the specified engine, thus initialising it if needed. The engine will then be set as
           the default for all available algorithms.

<b>CRL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-gencrl</b>
           this option generates a CRL based on information in the index file.

       <b>-crldays</b> <b>num</b>
           the number of days before the next CRL is due. That is the days from now to place in the CRL
           nextUpdate field.

       <b>-crlhours</b> <b>num</b>
           the number of hours before the next CRL is due.

       <b>-revoke</b> <b>filename</b>
           a filename containing a certificate to revoke.

       <b>-crl_reason</b> <b>reason</b>
           revocation reason, where <b>reason</b> is one of: <b>unspecified</b>, <b>keyCompromise</b>, <b>CACompromise</b>,
           <b>affiliationChanged</b>, <b>superseded</b>, <b>cessationOfOperation</b>, <b>certificateHold</b> or <b>removeFromCRL</b>. The
           matching of <b>reason</b> is case insensitive. Setting any revocation reason will make the CRL v2.

           In practive <b>removeFromCRL</b> is not particularly useful because it is only used in delta CRLs which
           are not currently implemented.

       <b>-crl_hold</b> <b>instruction</b>
           This sets the CRL revocation reason code to <b>certificateHold</b> and the hold instruction to
           <b>instruction</b> which must be an OID. Although any OID can be used only <b>holdInstructionNone</b> (the use
           of which is discouraged by RFC2459) <b>holdInstructionCallIssuer</b> or <b>holdInstructionReject</b> will
           normally be used.

       <b>-crl_compromise</b> <b>time</b>
           This sets the revocation reason to <b>keyCompromise</b> and the compromise time to <b>time</b>. <b>time</b> should be
           in GeneralizedTime format that is <b>YYYYMMDDHHMMSSZ</b>.

       <b>-crl_CA_compromise</b> <b>time</b>
           This is the same as <b>crl_compromise</b> except the revocation reason is set to <b>CACompromise</b>.

       <b>-subj</b> <b>arg</b>
           supersedes subject name given in the request.  The arg must be formatted as
           <u>/type0=value0/type1=value1/type2=...</u>, characters may be escaped by \ (backslash), no spaces are
           skipped.

       <b>-crlexts</b> <b>section</b>
           the section of the configuration file containing CRL extensions to include. If no CRL extension
           section is present then a V1 CRL is created, if the CRL extension section is present (even if it
           is empty) then a V2 CRL is created. The CRL extensions specified are CRL extensions and <b>not</b> CRL
           entry extensions.  It should be noted that some software (for example Netscape) can't handle V2
           CRLs.

<b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       The section of the configuration file containing options for <b>ca</b> is found as follows: If the <b>-name</b>
       command line option is used, then it names the section to be used. Otherwise the section to be used
       must be named in the <b>default_ca</b> option of the <b>ca</b> section of the configuration file (or in the default
       section of the configuration file). Besides <b>default_ca</b>, the following options are read directly from
       the <b>ca</b> section:
        RANDFILE
        preserve
        msie_hack With the exception of <b>RANDFILE</b>, this is probably a bug and may change in future releases.

       Many of the configuration file options are identical to command line options. Where the option is
       present in the configuration file and the command line the command line value is used. Where an
       option is described as mandatory then it must be present in the configuration file or the command
       line equivalent (if any) used.

       <b>oid_file</b>
           This specifies a file containing additional <b>OBJECT</b> <b>IDENTIFIERS</b>.  Each line of the file should
           consist of the numerical form of the object identifier followed by white space then the short
           name followed by white space and finally the long name.

       <b>oid_section</b>
           This specifies a section in the configuration file containing extra object identifiers. Each line
           should consist of the short name of the object identifier followed by <b>=</b> and the numerical form.
           The short and long names are the same when this option is used.

       <b>new_certs_dir</b>
           the same as the <b>-outdir</b> command line option. It specifies the directory where new certificates
           will be placed. Mandatory.

       <b>certificate</b>
           the same as <b>-cert</b>. It gives the file containing the CA certificate. Mandatory.

       <b>private_key</b>
           same as the <b>-keyfile</b> option. The file containing the CA private key. Mandatory.

       <b>RANDFILE</b>
           a file used to read and write random number seed information, or an EGD socket (see <a href="../man3/RAND_egd.3ssl.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/RAND_egd"><u>RAND</u><b>_</b><u>egd</u>(3)</a>).

       <b>default_days</b>
           the same as the <b>-days</b> option. The number of days to certify a certificate for.

       <b>default_startdate</b>
           the same as the <b>-startdate</b> option. The start date to certify a certificate for. If not set the
           current time is used.

       <b>default_enddate</b>
           the same as the <b>-enddate</b> option. Either this option or <b>default_days</b> (or the command line
           equivalents) must be present.

       <b>default_crl_hours</b> <b>default_crl_days</b>
           the same as the <b>-crlhours</b> and the <b>-crldays</b> options. These will only be used if neither command
           line option is present. At least one of these must be present to generate a CRL.

       <b>default_md</b>
           the same as the <b>-md</b> option. The message digest to use. Mandatory.

       <b>database</b>
           the text database file to use. Mandatory. This file must be present though initially it will be
           empty.

       <b>serial</b>
           a text file containing the next serial number to use in hex. Mandatory.  This file must be
           present and contain a valid serial number.

       <b>x509_extensions</b>
           the same as <b>-extensions</b>.

       <b>crl_extensions</b>
           the same as <b>-crlexts</b>.

       <b>preserve</b>
           the same as <b>-preserveDN</b>

       <b>email_in_dn</b>
           the same as <b>-noemailDN</b>. If you want the EMAIL field to be removed from the DN of the certificate
           simply set this to 'no'. If not present the default is to allow for the EMAIL filed in the
           certificate's DN.

       <b>msie_hack</b>
           the same as <b>-msie_hack</b>

       <b>policy</b>
           the same as <b>-policy</b>. Mandatory. See the <b>POLICY</b> <b>FORMAT</b> section for more information.

       <b>name_opt</b>, <b>cert_opt</b>
           these options allow the format used to display the certificate details when asking the user to
           confirm signing. All the options supported by the <b>x509</b> utilities <b>-nameopt</b> and <b>-certopt</b> switches
           can be used here, except the <b>no_signame</b> and <b>no_sigdump</b> are permanently set and cannot be disabled
           (this is because the certificate signature cannot be displayed because the certificate has not
           been signed at this point).

           For convenience the values <b>ca_default</b> are accepted by both to produce a reasonable output.

           If neither option is present the format used in earlier versions of OpenSSL is used. Use of the
           old format is <b>strongly</b> discouraged because it only displays fields mentioned in the <b>policy</b>
           section, mishandles multicharacter string types and does not display extensions.

       <b>copy_extensions</b>
           determines how extensions in certificate requests should be handled.  If set to <b>none</b> or this
           option is not present then extensions are ignored and not copied to the certificate. If set to
           <b>copy</b> then any extensions present in the request that are not already present are copied to the
           certificate. If set to <b>copyall</b> then all extensions in the request are copied to the certificate:
           if the extension is already present in the certificate it is deleted first. See the <b>WARNINGS</b>
           section before using this option.

           The main use of this option is to allow a certificate request to supply values for certain
           extensions such as subjectAltName.

<b>POLICY</b> <b>FORMAT</b>
       The policy section consists of a set of variables corresponding to certificate DN fields. If the
       value is "match" then the field value must match the same field in the CA certificate. If the value
       is "supplied" then it must be present. If the value is "optional" then it may be present. Any fields
       not mentioned in the policy section are silently deleted, unless the <b>-preserveDN</b> option is set but
       this can be regarded more of a quirk than intended behaviour.

<b>SPKAC</b> <b>FORMAT</b>
       The input to the <b>-spkac</b> command line option is a Netscape signed public key and challenge. This will
       usually come from the <b>KEYGEN</b> tag in an HTML form to create a new private key.  It is however possible
       to create SPKACs using the <b>spkac</b> utility.

       The file should contain the variable SPKAC set to the value of the SPKAC and also the required DN
       components as name value pairs.  If you need to include the same component twice then it can be
       preceded by a number and a '.'.

<b>EXAMPLES</b>
       Note: these examples assume that the <b>ca</b> directory structure is already set up and the relevant files
       already exist. This usually involves creating a CA certificate and private key with <b>req</b>, a serial
       number file and an empty index file and placing them in the relevant directories.

       To use the sample configuration file below the directories demoCA, demoCA/private and demoCA/newcerts
       would be created. The CA certificate would be copied to demoCA/cacert.pem and its private key to
       demoCA/private/cakey.pem. A file demoCA/serial would be created containing for example "01" and the
       empty index file demoCA/index.txt.

       Sign a certificate request:

        openssl ca -in req.pem -out newcert.pem

       Sign a certificate request, using CA extensions:

        openssl ca -in req.pem -extensions v3_ca -out newcert.pem

       Generate a CRL

        openssl ca -gencrl -out crl.pem

       Sign several requests:

        openssl ca -infiles req1.pem req2.pem req3.pem

       Certify a Netscape SPKAC:

        openssl ca -spkac spkac.txt

       A sample SPKAC file (the SPKAC line has been truncated for clarity):

        SPKAC=MIG0MGAwXDANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAANLADBIAkEAn7PDhCeV/xIxUg8V70YRxK2A5

       A sample configuration file with the relevant sections for <b>ca</b>:

        [ ca ]
        default_ca      = CA_default            # The default ca section

        [ CA_default ]

<b>FILES</b>
       Note: the location of all files can change either by compile time options, configuration file
       entries, environment variables or command line options.  The values below reflect the default values.

        /usr/local/ssl/lib/openssl.cnf - master configuration file
        ./demoCA                       - main CA directory
        ./demoCA/cacert.pem            - CA certificate
        ./demoCA/private/cakey.pem     - CA private key
        ./demoCA/serial                - CA serial number file
        ./demoCA/serial.old            - CA serial number backup file
        ./demoCA/index.txt             - CA text database file
        ./demoCA/index.txt.old         - CA text database backup file
        ./demoCA/certs                 - certificate output file
        ./demoCA/.rnd                  - CA random seed information

<b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b>
       <b>OPENSSL_CONF</b> reflects the location of master configuration file it can be overridden by the <b>-config</b>
       command line option.

<b>RESTRICTIONS</b>
       The text database index file is a critical part of the process and if corrupted it can be difficult
       to fix. It is theoretically possible to rebuild the index file from all the issued certificates and a
       current CRL: however there is no option to do this.

       V2 CRL features like delta CRL support and CRL numbers are not currently supported.

       Although several requests can be input and handled at once it is only possible to include one SPKAC
       or self signed certificate.

<b>BUGS</b>
       The use of an in memory text database can cause problems when large numbers of certificates are
       present because, as the name implies the database has to be kept in memory.

       It is not possible to certify two certificates with the same DN: this is a side effect of how the
       text database is indexed and it cannot easily be fixed without introducing other problems. Some
       S/MIME clients can use two certificates with the same DN for separate signing and encryption keys.

       The <b>ca</b> command really needs rewriting or the required functionality exposed at either a command or
       interface level so a more friendly utility (perl script or GUI) can handle things properly. The
       scripts <b>CA.sh</b> and <b>CA.pl</b> help a little but not very much.

       Any fields in a request that are not present in a policy are silently deleted. This does not happen
       if the <b>-preserveDN</b> option is used. To enforce the absence of the EMAIL field within the DN, as
       suggested by RFCs, regardless the contents of the request' subject the <b>-noemailDN</b> option can be used.
       The behaviour should be more friendly and configurable.

       Cancelling some commands by refusing to certify a certificate can create an empty file.

<b>WARNINGS</b>
       The <b>ca</b> command is quirky and at times downright unfriendly.

       The <b>ca</b> utility was originally meant as an example of how to do things in a CA. It was not supposed to
       be used as a full blown CA itself: nevertheless some people are using it for this purpose.

       The <b>ca</b> command is effectively a single user command: no locking is done on the various files and
       attempts to run more than one <b>ca</b> command on the same database can have unpredictable results.

       The <b>copy_extensions</b> option should be used with caution. If care is not taken then it can be a
       security risk. For example if a certificate request contains a basicConstraints extension with
       CA:TRUE and the <b>copy_extensions</b> value is set to <b>copyall</b> and the user does not spot this when the
       certificate is displayed then this will hand the requestor a valid CA certificate.

       This situation can be avoided by setting <b>copy_extensions</b> to <b>copy</b> and including basicConstraints with
       CA:FALSE in the configuration file.  Then if the request contains a basicConstraints extension it
       will be ignored.

       It is advisable to also include values for other extensions such as <b>keyUsage</b> to prevent a request
       supplying its own values.

       Additional restrictions can be placed on the CA certificate itself.  For example if the CA
       certificate has:

        basicConstraints = CA:TRUE, pathlen:0

       then even if a certificate is issued with CA:TRUE it will not be valid.
