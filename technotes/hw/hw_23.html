Thisfeature enables the Quadra to perform basic floating-point operations muchfaster than a Macintosh platform that employs an MC68881/2 floating-pointcoprocessor working in conjunction with an MC68020/030 microprocessor. ThisNote addresses compatibility and performance issues for Quadra computersexecuting FPU instructions either programmed explicitly in assembly language orgenerated by compilers (<code>-mc68881</code> and <code>-elems881</code> modes for MPWcompilers).</p><p>While all currently available 68040 processors have an onboard FPU, it isimportant to use Gestalt to verify the existence of a floating-pointcoprocessor before attempting to use any FPU instructions. Motorola hasannounced a variant of the 68040 without an FPU unit; this chip has most of thecaching characteristics of the current 68040, but does not support the 68881/2opcode set.</p><p>Unfortunately, the FPU circuitry in the 68040 does not by itself support thefull functionality of the MC68881/2. Motorola has provided a floating-pointsoftware package (FPSP) which emulates all of the MC68881/2 functionality thatis not provided by the 68040. This package resides in the operating system ofthe Quadra. When the 68040 requires emulation services in the course ofexecuting an FPU instruction, it traps to the FPSP via one of several exceptionvectors, depending on the type of emulation that is needed. The combination ofthe 68040 and FPSP enables Quadra computers to run old user code withoutmodification unless the code uses floating-point exception handlers.</p><p>If user code includes floating-point exception handlers, the handlers must bemodified to reflect the <code>FSAVE</code> state frames of the 68040, which differfrom those of the MC68881/2. In addition, vectoring to such handlers for the68040 must be done with care in order that entry to the FPSP not becompromised.</p><p>Whenever the 68040 in a Quadra invokes the FPSP, performance inevitably willsuffer relative to an MC68881/2 platform because the software emulation ofcomplex algorithms involving floating-point calculations and exception statesimply cannot outperform dedicated hardware and microcode. In addition, theinstruction cache must cope with many instructions of emulation code toaccomplish what the MC68881/2 does in a single FPU instruction. Finally, FPSPintervention flushes the FPU pipeline, thus negating any performanceenhancements achievable through overlapping execution of FPUinstructions.</p><a name="Section1"></a><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><h2>FPU Instructions Provided by the 68040</h2><p>The following FPU instructions are supported by the 68040:</p><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=550><TR>	<td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><pre>        FABS            Absolute value        FDABS*        Absolute value rounded to double precision        FSABS*        Absolute value rounded to single precision        FADD            Addition        FDADD*        Addition rounded to double precision        FSADD*        Addition rounded to single precision        FBcc*        Branch on FP condition        FCMP            Comparison (sets FP condition codes)        FDBcc        Test FP condition, decrement D register, and branch        FDIV            Division        FDDIV*        Division rounded to double precision        FSDIV*        Division rounded to single precision        FMOVE        Move FP data or system control register        FDMOVE*        Move to FP data register rounded to double precision        FSMOVE*        Move to FP data register rounded to single precision        FMOVEM        Move multiple FP data registers        FMUL            Multiplication        FDMUL*        Multiplication rounded to double precision        FSMUL*        Multiplication rounded to single precision        FNEG            Negation        FDNEG*        Negation rounded to double precision        FSNEG*        Negation rounded to single precision        FNOP            No operation (flushes FPU pipelines and forces pending                    FP exceptions)        FRESTORE+        Restore internal FPU state saved by FSAVE        FSAVE+        Save internal FPU state        FScc            Set byte integer according to FP condition        FSGLDIV        Single precision division        FSGLMUL        Single precision multiply        FSQRT        Square root        FDSQRT*        Square root rounded to double precision        FSSQRT*        Square root rounded to single precision        FSUB            Subtraction        FDSUB*        Subtraction rounded to double precision        FSSUB*        Subtraction rounded to single precision        FTRAPcc        Trap on FP condition        FTST            Test FP operand and set FP condition codes</pre>	</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><p>* Precision-constraining operation is not provided by MC68881/2; precision of instruction supersedes that set in the FP control register (FPCR).</p><p>+    Privileged instruction</p><p>Processing of these FPU instructions is usually handled entirely by the 68040.The FPSP is invoked if an unsupported data type or format is involved or if anexceptional condition is generated that requires fix-up of FPU state byemulation.</p><a name="Section2"></a><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><h2>FPSP Overview</h2><p>The FPSP provides three basic emulation services for the 68040. First, itemulates many MC68881/2 instructions, including all transcendental functionsand some arithmetic instructions. Second, the FPSP handles instructions thatinvolve certain data classes (unnormalized and denormal floating-point numbers)or the packed decimal data format, which are not supported by the 68040hardware. Finally, the FPSP provides exception handlers for certainfloating-point exception conditions in order to emulate MC68881/2 behavior whenuser traps are either disabled or enabled. In the latter case, after completingits exception processing, the FPSP passes control to the user-providedhandler.</p><p>On Macintosh Quadra platforms executing MC68881/2 instructions, entry to theFPSP occurs automatically by trapping via one of several low-memory exceptionvectors, depending on which emulation service is required. The system installsthe exception vector entries to the FPSP at boot time, and <b>applicationsshould not tamper with these vectors. </b>Because the FPSP preempts theexception vectors for certain user-provided handlers in the MC68881/2 model,compatibility is a problem for old user code that contains floating-pointexception handlers. Later sections will address the issues of compatibility inmore detail.</p><a name="Section3"></a><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><h2>Emulation of Unimplemented FPU Instructions</h2><p>The following MC68881/2 arithmetic instructions are emulated by the FPSP, whichproduces results and exceptions identical to MC68881/2 platforms:</p><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=550><TR>	<td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><pre>    FGETEXP        Extract binary exponent of source    FGETMAN        Extract mantissa (significand) of source    FINT            Round source to integral value, using rounding mode in the                FPCR    FINTRZ        Round source to integral value, using round-to-zero mode    FMOD            Modulo remainder of destination / source with sign and lowest        seven bits of quotient delivered in FP status register (FPSR)                quotient byte    FMOVECR        Move constant ROM to FP data register    FREM            IEEE remainder of destination / source with sign and lowest                seven bits of quotient delivered in FPSR quotient byte    FSCALE        Scale (multiply) destination by 2^((int) source).The following MC68881/2 transcendental functions are emulated by the FPSP:    FACOS        Inverse (arc) cosine (radians)    FASIN        Inverse (arc) sine (radians)    FATAN        Inverse (arc) tangent (radians)    FATANH        Inverse (arc) hyperbolic tangent    FCOS            Cosine of source in radians    FCOSH        Hyperbolic cosine    FETOX        Base e power (e^source)    FETOXM1        e^source - 1.0    FLOG10        Base 10 logarithm    FLOG2        Base 2 logarithm    FLOGN        Base e (natural) logarithm    FLOGNP1        Base e (natural) logarithm of (source + 1.0)    FSIN            Sine of source in radians    FSINCOS        Simultaneous sine and cosine (two destination registers)    FSINH        Hyperbolic sine    FTAN            Tangent of source in radians    FTANH        Hyperbolic tangent    FTENTOX        10.0^source    FTWOTOX        2.0^source</pre>	</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><p>The algorithms used by the FPSP to calculate transcendental functions are bothaccurate and fast. Results will not always agree with those of the MC68881/2.When they disagree, the FPSP is generally more precise. The performance of the68040 FPSP on transcendental functions is roughly equivalent to that of asimilarly clocked MC68030/MC68882 combination.</p><p>When the 68040 in a Quadra attempts to execute any of the unimplementedMC68881/2 instructions, it traps, via vector number 11, the unimplementedF-Line opcode exception vector stored at vector offset (low-memory address)<code>$002C</code> to the FPSP. The corresponding exception handler in the FPSPsaves the FPU state, decodes the instruction, fetches the operand(s), emulatesthe unimplemented instruction, and restores the appropriate state to the FPU.Operands involving unsupported data types or format are processed appropriatelyby this exception handler. To the user, the emulated instructions appear asatomic operations that produce valid results and that signal the properfloating-point exceptions. If an emulated instruction raises an enabledfloating-point exception, program flow will vector to the appropriate userexception handler.</p><p>If the code executing in a Quadra contains an F-Line opcode that is undefinedby the instruction sets of both the 68040 and MC68881/2, trapping to the FPSPvia vector 11 also applies. In this case, the handler recognizes that noemulation is necessary, and it passes control to the system F-Line exceptionhandler via a secondary vector stored in low memory.</p><h3>Compatibility Note</h3><p>If an application, such as a development or debugging environment, needs toinstall its own F-Line exception handler on Quadra platforms, it must notoverwrite vector 11 at offset <code>$002C</code>. If it does, emulation of theunimplemented MC68881/2 instructions will be lost with disastrous effects tothe executing program. Instead, the secondary F-Line exception vector, locatedat address <code>$1FC8</code>, should be used on Quadra platforms. As is the caseon MC68881/2 platforms, the application should save the inherited F-Lineexception vector (secondary vector in the case of Quadra platforms) and restoreit upon termination or context switch.</p><a name="Section4"></a><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><h2>Unimplemented Data Type/Format Support in the FPSP</h2><p>The FPU in the 68040 does not support all of the floating-point data types andformats of the MC68881/2. The following data types require FPSP support:</p><p>    denormalized single (S), double (D), or extended (X) precision operand to anFPU     instruction; and unnormalized X operand to an FPU instruction.</p><p>The following data format requires FPSP support:</p><p>    packed decimal real (P) format as source or destination for an FPUinstruction.</p><p>When the 68040 encounters an unimplemented data type or format in the course ofexecuting a hardware-supported FPU instruction, it traps, via exception vector55, the FP unimplemented data type exception vector stored at vector offset(low-memory address) <code>$00DC</code> to the FPSP. Prior to the release of the68040, this address was unassigned but reserved by Motorola. The unimplementeddata type exception handler in the FPSP takes the appropriate action for theinstruction and the exceptional operand or format.</p><p>For denormal S, denormal D, and all P format source operands, the FPSP convertsthe values to the normalized X equivalents, restores FPU state, and restartsthe operation. If a source operand is an unnormalized X that can be convertedto a normalized X, the instruction is also completed as described. If theinstruction is a move out to P format in memory (<code>FMOVE.PFPn,&lt;ea&gt;</code>), the FPSP emulates the conversion from the extended sourceformat to P format and writes the result to the effective address.</p><p>For denormal X operands or unnormalized X operands that reduce to denormal Xvalues, the FPSP converts such operands to an internal normalized format thatcontains an extra exponent bit, restores state to the FPU, and restarts theoperation if no exponent wrap condition will occur (for example, division of adenormal value by another denormal value). Otherwise, the FPSP emulates theentire instruction.</p><p>Denormalized values resulting from instructions executed by the 68040 hardwaredo not generate the unimplemented data type exception. Instead, a non-maskableunderflow exception occurs which invokes a handler in the FPSP. This handlerrounds the internal result appropriately according to the specified roundingprecision and direction and delivers the result.</p><p>In the case of instructions that are emulated by the FPSP, the processing ofunimplemented data type/format operands is handled within the confines of theemulation process. That is, the 68040 traps to the FPSP's unimplementedinstruction handler, which is capable of recognizing and dealing with suchoperands.</p><p>Instructions, whether emulated or not, that use the P format as either sourceor destination have relatively poor performance because they require emulationof binary-to-decimal or decimal-to-binary conversions.</p><b>Idiosyncrasies</b><p>Binary operations (source and destination operands are both inputs) with Pformat source operands should avoid using FP1 as the destination operandbecause a bug in the FPSP causes spurious results in this case. If anunimplemented data type or format occurs as input to an operation, theexception is posted by the 68040 when the next FPU instruction is attempted.This deferred exception handling may appear not to deliver the correct resultin a debugging environment that installs a breakpoint prior to the second FPUinstruction.</p><a name="Section5"></a><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><h2>FPSP Exception Handlers </h2><p>Certain floating-point exception conditions on the 68040 require interventionby the FPSP in order to fix up results or other state. Some of the FPSPexception handlers are non-maskable in the sense that they are executedregardless of whether or not the exception is trap-enabled by the user. All ofthe FPSP floating-point exception handlers, whether non-maskable or not, arevectored via  Motorola-designated locations in low-memory supervisor addressspace. If a user-enabled exception occurs, the FPSP exception handler isexecuted first before vectoring occurs to the user handler via a secondaryvector maintained by the Macintosh Quadra system. The user code must not modifythe primary floating-point exception vectors to FPSP exception handlers. Alater section will describe installation of user exception handlers.</p><p>The following is a brief description of FPSP exception handlers:</p><h3>Branch/Set on Unordered (BSUN)</h3><p>This maskable handler is invoked only if the user has enabled the BSUNexception. Entry to this handler is via vector number 48 stored at location<code>$00C0</code>. This handler updates the floating-point instruction addressregister (FPIAR) to contain the address of the floating-point branch/setinstruction that generated the exception. It then invokes the user's handlervia  a secondary BSUN vector.</p><h3>Inexact Result (INEX1/INEX2)</h3><p>No FPSP handler is required. When enabled, INEX1 or INEX2 exceptions invoke theuser's handler via vector number 49 at location <code>$00C4</code>.</p><h3>Divide by Zero (DZ)</h3><p>No FPSP handler is required. When enabled, the user's DZ handler is invoked viavector number 50 at location <code>$00C8</code>.</p><h3>Underflow (UNFL)</h3><p>This non-maskable handler is entered via vector number 51 at location<code>$00CC</code>. It determines and stores the properly rounded underflow resultbased upon the value of the intermediate result and the roundingprecision/direction modes stored in the FPCR. If underflow is enabled in theFPCR, the user's handler is invoked via a secondary UNFL vector.</p><h3>Operand Error (OPERR)</h3><p>This non-maskable handler is entered via vector number 52 at location<code>$00D0</code>. It provides compatibility of results with the MC68881/2 for B,W, and L destination formats when the source operand is a NaN (Not-a-Number),infinity, or value too large for the integer format. If the OPERR exception isuser-enabled, the FPSP handler invokes the user's handler via a secondary OPERRvector.</p><h3>Overflow (OVFL)</h3><p>This non-maskable handler is entered via vector number 53 at location<code>$00D4</code>. It determines and stores the properly rounded overflow resultbased on the value of the intermediate result and the rounding modes stored inthe FPCR. If overflow is enabled in the FPCR, the user's handler is invoked viaa secondary OVFL vector.</p><h3>Signaling Not-a-Number (SNAN)</h3><p>This non-maskable handler is entered via vector number 54 at location<code>$00D8</code>. It provides compatibility of results with the MC68881/2 for B,W, and L destination formats. If the SNAN exception is user-enabled, programflow is directed to the user's handler via a secondary vector.</p><p>If a program enables no floating-point exceptions in the FPCR, compatibility isnot an issue. In this case, no user exception handlers need be installed. Theprogram traps to non-maskable FPSP handlers as required for any fix-up ofexceptional results or FPU state and then resumes execution.</p><p>Performance degradation by non-maskable FPSP floating-point exception handlingis minimal in most cases because such intervention is rarely needed. The mostcommon exception, INEX2,  requires no FPSP support. Underflows and overflowsare infrequent when the default extended rounding precision is employed. OPERRoccurrences are also rare, unless many out-of-range conversions occur fromfloating-point to integer formats.</p><a name="Section6"></a><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><h2>User Floating-Point Exception Handlers</h2><p>Users who require floating-point exception handlers in their applicationsrunning on Macintosh Quadra platforms must exercise some care in both thewriting and the installation of such handlers. Moreover, if an application alsotargets Macintosh computers with MC68881/2 coprocessors and intends to resumeprocessing via an <code>RTE</code> in an exception handler, its exception handlersmust query which kind of FPU (MC68881/2 or 68040) is present and then executehardware-specific code based on the query result. The reader is urged toconsult the user manuals for the 68040 and MC68881/2 for details not covered bythis Note.</p><p>Each floating-point exception on the 68040 is reported by either the conversionunit (CU) or normalization unit (NU) pipeline stage of the FPU. Exceptionsreported by the CU are called E1 exceptions; they are detected relatively earlyin the execution of an FPU instruction. Exceptions reported by the NU arecalled E3 exceptions; they are detected late in the execution of FPUinstructions as the NU attempts to normalize and round the intermediate resultfor storage in a destination FP register. E1 exceptions include allfloating-point exception types. The only E3 exceptions are OVFL, UNFL, andINEX2 occurring on opclass 0 (register-to-register) and opclass 2(memory-to-register) instructions. If both E3 and E1 exceptions exist at thesame time, the E3 exception should be handled first, allowing the 68040 tosubsequently trap to handle the pending E1 exception.</p><p>There are two <code>FSAVE</code> stack frames for floating-point exceptions on the68040. E1 exceptions produce the unimplemented instruction FPU state frame, andE3 exceptions produce the busy FPU state frame. Both of these frames begin witha 1-byte version number followed by a 1-byte frame length. The version numberfor Quadra 68040s is $41. For this version of the 68040, the frame length forE1 exceptions is $30, making the unimplemented instruction FPU state frame 52bytes in size (counting the 4-byte header). The busy frame for E3 exceptionshas a frame length of $60 and total size of 100 bytes.</p><p>Both 68040 floating-point exception <code>FSAVE</code> stack frames containinformation that may be of use to the user's exception handler. There are two12-byte fields containing the source and destination operands in extendedprecision. There are two 3-bit tag fields which classify the source anddestination operands as to whether they are normalized, denormalized, zero,infinite, or NaN.There are two bits (E1 and E3) which, if set, indicate whichpipeline stage of the FPU (CU or NU) detected the pending exception(s). Both<code>FSAVE</code> frames encode the command word of the exceptional floating-pointinstruction, albeit in different fields.</p><p>As a minimum, user floating-point exception handlers on 68040 platforms mustissue an <code>FSAVE</code> instruction as the first FPU operation, clear theexception state of the FPU, and resume processing via the <code>RTE</code>instruction. For E3 exceptions, the E3 bit in the <code>FSAVE</code> stack framemust be cleared and the <code>FRESTORE</code> instruction must be issued prior tothe <code>RTE</code> instruction. For E1 exceptions, the minimum requirement is tothrow away the <code>FSAVE</code> stack frame and to resume processing via<code>RTE</code>. Another method of clearing the exception state for E1 exceptionsis to clear the E1 bit in the <code>FSAVE</code> stack frame and issue the<code>FRESTORE</code> prior to the <code>RTE</code>. The E1 and E3 bits are bits 2 and1 (bit position 0 representing the least significant bit), respectively, of thebyte which is located 28 bytes below the high-address end of either<code>FSAVE</code> frame.</p><h3>Minimum Floating-Point Exception Handler for the MC68881/2 and Quadra</h3><p>The following code sequence serves as a minimum handler for all enabledfloating-point exceptions except BSUN on both with MC68881/2 platforms andQuadra computers. This handler simply clears the exceptional condition in theFPU and resumes execution without attempting to modify any other FPU state. Aminimal BSUN handler would require additional intervention (via one of fourmethods outlined in the user manuals for the 68040 and the MC68881/2) toprevent infinite looping on the BSUN trap.</p><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=550><TR>	<td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><pre>; ************************************************************************; Minimum user handler for enabled INEX, DZ, UNFL, OPERR, OVFL,; or SNAN floating-point exception on either MC68881/2 or; Macintosh Quadra platforms.;; NOTE:  For enabled DZ, OPERR, and SNAN exceptions for instructions;        with FP register destinations, no result is delivered at all to the;        destination register.; ************************************************************************HANDLER:        FSAVE        -(SP)        ; save internal FPU state        MOVE.L        D0,-(SP)    ; save D0, STACK:  D0 save &lt; FSAVE frame        MOVEQ        #0,D0        ; zero D0        MOVE.B        4(SP),D0    ; NULL frame?        BEQ.B        @NULL        ; yes, restore D0 and FPU state        CMPI.B        #$41,D0    ; Quadra (68040) ID?        BNE.B        @COPROC    ; no, assume MC68881/2; Quadra FSAVE frame        MOVE.B        5(SP),D0    ; D0 &lt;- frame size        BEQ.B        @NULL        ; restore state if 68040 IDLE frame; Quadra UNIMPLEMENTED INSTRUCTION or BUSY FSAVE frame        SUBI.B        #20,D0        ; D0 &lt;- offset of E1/E3 byte from (SP)        BCLR.B        #1,(SP,D0)    ; test and clear E3 byte        BNE.B        @NULL        ; restore state if E3 was set        BCLR.B        #2,(SP,D0)    ; E1 exception, clear E1 byte; Restore state and resume execution@NULL:    MOVE.L        (SP)+,D0    ; restore D0, STACK:  FSAVE frame        FRESTORE    (SP)+        ; restore FPU state        RTE                ; resume processing; MC68881/2 IDLE FSAVE frame@COPROC:    MOVE.B        5(SP),D0    ; D0 &lt;- IDLE frame size        ADDQ.B        #4,D0        ; compensate for D0 save value on stack        BSET.B        #3,(SP,D0)    ; set bit 27 of BIU        BRA.B        @NULL        ; restore state</pre>	</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER>        <a name="Section7"></a><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><h2>Installation of User Floating-Point Exception Handlers</h2><p>Current MPW language libraries (MPW 2.0.2 or later releases and LanguageSystems FORTRAN version 3.0) provide for the vectoring of user floating-pointexception handlers in a consistent and portable fashion for both Quadra andMC68881/2 Macintosh platforms. The C functions <code>settrapvector</code>and <code>gettrapvector</code>, the Pascal procedures <code>SetTrapVector</code>and <code>GetTrapVector</code>, and the Language Systems FORTRAN subroutines<code>SetTrapVector</code> and <code>GetTrapVector</code> allow users to install andread vectors to their floating-point exception handlers via the use of the<code>TrapVector</code> structure. The relevant interface files for theseoperations are <code>{CIncludes}SANE.h</code>, <code>{PInterfaces}SANE.p</code>, and<code>{FIncludes}SANE.f</code>.</p><p>A <code>TrapVector</code> structure is composed of seven 4-byte fields thatrepresent the entry-point addresses of the user's BSUN, INEX, DZ, UNFL, OPERR,OVFL, and SNAN exception handlers, respectively. <code>GetTrapVector</code>routines read the current floating-point exception vectors into a<code>TrapVector</code> structure. In order to install their own exceptionhandlers, users must first initialize a <code>TrapVector</code> structure withentry points of their handler routines and then invoke a <code>SetTrapVector</code>routine with that structure as the operand.</p><p><code>GetTrapVector</code> and <code>SetTrapVector</code> routines involve privilegedoperations because they access Motorola low-memory vector table locations. ForQuadra platforms, the situation is further complicated by the fact that five ofthe seven user floating-point exception vectors are stored by the system insecondary locations because the FPSP has preempted the original vector tablelocations. <code>GetTrapVector</code> and <code>SetTrapVector</code> implementationscircumvent these difficulties by calling a system utility,<code>PrivTrap</code>, which does all of the work of querying or installingthe user's vectors.</p><h3>The <code>PrivTrap</code> Mechanism</h3><p><code>PrivTrap</code> is implemented as a system trap, <code>$A097</code>. Upon entry, itexpects a selector value in register <code>D0.W</code> and a <code>TrapVector</code>structure address in address register <code>A0</code>. The <code>GetTrapVector</code>operation requires a selector value of 1; in this case, <code>PrivTrap</code> readsthe current floating-point exception vectors into the <code>TrapVector</code>structure at <code>(A0)</code>. The selector value of 2 invokes the<code>SetTrapVector</code> operation; the user's exception vectors in the<code>TrapVector</code> structure at <code>(A0)</code> are installed appropriately inthe system. In either case, registers <code>A0</code> and <code>A1</code> are modifiedupon exit.</p><p>As of the drafting of this Note, only the Quadra and PowerBook 170 platformsrunning system software version 7.0.1 have the <code>PrivTrap</code> mechanismbuilt into their systems. Individual MPW library functions that require<code>PrivTrap</code> functionality first query if <code>PrivTrap</code> is installed.If it is not, the library routines will install and call a version of the trapappropriate for an MC68881/2 platform.</p><h3>Implementation Notes</h3><p>Since MultiFinder under system software version 6.0.x and Finder under currentversions of System 7 do not include user exception vectors among the FPU statethat is saved and restored at context switch, it is the responsibility of anapplication that enables floating-point exceptions to save inherited userexception vectors and to restore them upon termination or context switch. Theinherited vectors may be read using the <code>GetTrapVector</code> operation. Theapplication installs its floating-point exception handlers via the<code>SetTrapVector</code> operation. At context switch or program termination,<code>SetTrapVector</code> should be used to restore the appropriate exceptionvectors. If the above regimen is followed, the application's<code>TrapVector</code> structure may contain arbitrary values for vectorscorresponding to disabled exceptions.</p><a name="Section8"></a><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><h2>Performance Issues</h2><p>In order to extract the maximum floating-point performance on a MacintoshQuadra, an application should avoid invoking emulation by the FPSP wheneverpossible. Unfortunately, FPU instruction sequences that optimize Quadraperformance often degrade performance to some extent on MC68881/2 platforms.Programmers must always weigh the performance requirements of their varioustarget platforms when writing floating-point code.</p><h3>Transcendental Functions</h3><p>Although all FPU transcendental function instructions are emulated by the FPSPon Quadra platforms, performance is comparable to a similarly clocked platformusing the MC68882.</p><h3>Unimplemented Arithmetic Functions</h3><p>If deemed desirable for performance reasons on Quadra platforms, workaroundscan readily be devised for most of the arithmetic FPU instructions that areemulated by the FPSP. The <code>FMOD</code> and <code>FREM</code> instructions are thenotable exceptions since they involve an iterative algorithm in their mostgeneral cases. The functionality of the remaining unimplemented arithmeticinstructions can be emulated as follows:</p><p><code>FGETEXP</code>   If the argument is a NaN or zero, return the argument. Ifthe argument is infinite, return  a NaN and signal OPERR. Otherwise, write thefloating-point argument to stack, extract, and unbias the exponent usinginteger operations, and deliver the result to FPn using <code>FMOVE.L&lt;ea&gt;,FPn</code>.</p><P><code>FGETMAN</code>  If the argument is a NaN or zero, return the argument. Ifthe argument is infinite, return a NaN and signal OPERR. Otherwise, write thefloating-point argument to the stack in extended format, normalize thesignificand (mantissa) if necessary, set the exponent bits to $3FFF, retain theoriginal sign bit, and deliver the result to FPn using <code>FMOVE.X&lt;ea&gt;,FPn</code>.</p><P><code>FINT</code>   If the argument is zero or if the exponent of the argument isgreater than 62, return the argument. If the exponent of the argument is lessthan 31, round the argument to integral value by conversion to integer formatvia <code>FMOVE.L FPn,&lt;ea&gt;</code> followed by conversion back to X format via<code>FMOVE.L &lt;ea&gt;,FPm</code>. Otherwise, decompose the argument into anintegral part (via integer operations on the X format on the stack) and afractional part (via<code> </code>subtraction of the integral part from theargument), convert the fractional part to an integer via <code>FMOVE.LFPn,&lt;ea&gt;</code>, and add the integer to the integral part.</p><p><code>FINTRZ</code>   Using integer operations on the argument stored in extendedformat on the stack, test and zero out the fractional part. Set INEX2 if anyfraction bits were nonzero. The test for inexactness may be omitted if theapplication is indifferent to INEX2 being signaled by this roundingoperation.</p><p><code>FMOVECR</code>   Store desired constant in extended format in the codesegment of program and load it via<code> FMOVE.X &lt;ea&gt;,FPn</code>.</p><p><code>FSCALE</code>   Convert the integral source operand n to a floating-pointfactor 2.0^n on the stack. Obtain the scale result via multiplication of thatfactor with the destination operand.</p><h3>FINTRZ and Floating-Point -&gt; Integer Conversions</h3><p>The most common compiler-generated unimplemented arithmetic FPU instruction is<code>FINTRZ</code> during conversions of floating-point values to various signedinteger formats in C or FORTRAN source code. For example, to convert the valuein <code>FPn</code> to 32-bit integer value at <code>&lt;ea&gt;</code>, a compiler willgenerate the following code sequence:</p><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=550><TR>	<td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><pre>    FINTRZ        FPn,FPm        ; truncate to integral value    FMOVE.L    FPm,&lt;ea&gt;        ; convert to integral format</pre>	</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><p>If the application is running in (IEEE 754) default mode (FPCR = $00000000:  noexceptions are enabled, rounding precision is extended, rounding direction isround-to-nearest), the following code sequence will accomplish the sameconversion with optimal performance on a Quadra and with minimal performancedegradation on an MC68881/2 platform:</p><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=550><TR>	<td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><pre>    FMOVE.L    #$00000010,FPCR    ; set round-to-zero mode    FMOVE.L    FPn,&lt;ea&gt;        ; truncate to integral format    FMOVE.L    #$00000000,FPCR    ; restore default modes</pre>	</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><p>If the user's FPCR setting is not the default, the last sequence must bemodified to save and restore the user's FPCR setting at the cost of severalinstructions and some temporary storage. Throughput for these conversions maybe enhanced if the application requires an array of floating-point values to beconverted, because the FPCR needs to be modified only once before and onceafter all conversions are done via the <code>FMOVE.L FPn,&lt;ea&gt;</code> step.Out-of-range source values result in degraded performance on Quadra computersdue to nonmaskable vectoring to the OPERR handler in the FPSP.</p><p>Workarounds for conversions from floating-point values to the unsigned integerformats of C are more complicated and of necessity slower than those to signedinteger formats.</p><h3>Miscellaneous Performance Tips for Quadra Applications</h3><p>In order to minimize trapping to the FPSP for handling of exceptionalconditions, data types, or data formats, the following hints may proveuseful:</p><p>     Applications should run with extended rounding precision set in theFPCR.</p><p>     Temporary storage for intermediate floating-point results should be inextended format and preferably in FP registers.</p><p>     Applications should avoid the generation of unnormalized extended formatvalues via integer operations with subsequent reliance on the FPU to normalize theresults.</p><p>     Applications should avoid the extensive use of the Motorola packed decimal(P) data format.</p><h3>MPW QR6 Libraries</h3><p>The MPW QR6 folder in the E.T.O. #6 Developers CD contains C and Pascallibraries that have been performance-tuned. In particular, some of the<code>-mc68881</code> mode implementations have been modified to obtain betterperformance on Quadra platforms. Included among the new implementations areconversions from floating-point to the unsigned integer formats of C.Unfortunately, conversions to signed integer formats are generated in-line bythe C compiler and thus still include the <code>FINTRZ</code> instruction, which isemulated by the FPSP in Quadra platforms.</p><a name="Summary"></a><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><h2>Summary</h2><p>FPU operations on Macintosh Quadra platforms are performed by a combination ofcircuitry in the 68040 microprocessor and emulation code in the FPSP. The 68040provides very fast implementations of most of the basic floating-pointarithmetic functions in the MC68881/2 instruction set. The FPSP emulates alltranscendental functions and some arithmetic functions. In addition, the FPSPhandles instructions that involve certain data types/formats that areunsupported by the 68040 hardware and fixes up state when certain exceptionalconditions arise during processing.</p><p>Compatibility of results relative to MC68881/2 platforms holds for all FPUarithmetic instructions, whether or not they are emulated on Quadra computers.Results for transcendental FPU instructions may differ, and they are generallymore precise on the Quadra.</p><p>FPU applications that run with no floating-point exceptions enabled in the FPCRand that do not install an unimplemented F-Line Opcode handler will run withoutmodification on both MC68881/2 and Quadra platforms. User unimplemented F-Lineexception handlers are installed via vector 11 at address <code>$002C</code> onMC68881/2 platforms and via a secondary vector at address <code>$1FC8</code> onQuadra platforms. Similarly, installation of user floating-point exceptionhandlers for enabled exceptions must take care not to overwrite entry points tothe FPSP on Quadra platforms. MPW libraries provide high-level installationprocedures for user floating-point exception handlers. If such handlers are torun on all FPU platforms, they must take into account the differences in<code>FSAVE</code> state frames for Quadra and MC68881/2 platforms.</p><p>Optimizing FPU performance on Quadra computers is largely a matter ofunderstanding the conditions under which the FPSP is invoked and then avoidingsuch conditions via workarounds whenever possible. Code sequences thusoptimized for Quadra computers will often provide less than optimal performanceon MC68881/2 platforms.</p><a name="References"></a><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><h2>References</h2><p>MC68881/MC68882 Floating-Point Coprocessor User's Manual</p><p>MC68040 32-Bit Microprocessor User's Manual</p><p>MC68040 Designer's Manual,  Section 3:  Floating-PointEmulation</p><p>M68000 Family Programmer's Reference Manual</p><p>IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic(ANSI/IEEE Std 754-1985)</p><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><P><A NAME=Downloads></A></P>                  <H2>Downloadables</H2>                  <TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <td width=50 align=left>                  <P ALIGN=center><img src="images/acrobatsmall.gif" width=22 height=23 align=middle alt="Acrobat gif"></P>               </TD>               <td align="left">                  <P>Acrobat version of this Note (84K)</P>               </TD>               <td width=60 align=left>                  <P><A HREF="pdf/hw_23.pdf">Download</A></P>               </TD>            </TR></table><BR><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><!-- end_content --><!-- begin_footer_information -->	<table width="680" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
