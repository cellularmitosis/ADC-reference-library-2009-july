													                  TESTLIB								TestLib is a MPW tool which has been built to test the AppleTalk "libraries" that I have developed :			- Zone Information Protocol		(ZIP.c)			- Name Binding Protocol			(NBP.c)			- AppleTalk Filing Protocol		(AFP.c)These "librairies" can be used to implement AppleTalk functions. They have been tested but they probably contain errors, please inform me through AppleLink (BUTTIN) in order for me to maintain them.This MPW tool :	- displays an AppleShare server time	- lists all the directories of an AppleShare volume with their access rights.The Login on the server is done as guest or with username/password.Using TestLib :    	- Zone names are displayed    	- Enter a zone name if any and validate your answer by the Enter key    	- Server names are displayed	    - Enter a server name and validate your answer by the Enter key	    - Logging as guest is completed	    - Server time as well as volume names are displayed	    - Enter a volume name and validate your answer by the Enter key	    - Volume access rights are displayed in guest mode	    - For each directory accessible as guest, access rights are displayed	AppleTalk libraries :These libraries contain highlevel calls to be used to build an application. All the AppleTalk calls are issued synchronously.The AFP library shows how to use AFP calls to query a server (you need to refer to Inside AppleTalk to get the documentation about AFP calls).The general philosophy is to issue a call providing a buffer to receive the results then to call a utility to extract the information from the buffer previously set.Example :	NBPGetList(buffer)					              to get all the entities in the buffer			           NBPGetAddress(buffer,address)		to extract an AppleTalk address from the buffer			Warning about "permanent" memory :When you register a NBP entity, you must provide a buffer which must be available as long as the entity has not been removed.When you open an AFP session, you must provide a SCBBlock which must be available as long as the session has not been closed.NBP : contains all the Name Binding Protocol functions	  	    InitNBP					          Open the .MPP driver;Turn SelfSend mode on/off  	    CloseNBP				         Turn SelfSend mode on/off	    	SetSelfSend				     Turn SelfSend mode on/off	    	NBPGetList				       Get the list of entities with a specific entity name	    	NBPGetAddress		   	Extract the AppleTalk address of an entity	    	NBPRegisterEntity		Create an entry in the Name Binding Table	    	NBPRemoveEntity			Remove an entity from the Name Binding TableZIP : contains all the Zone Information Protocol functions (for Phase 1 and Phase 2)	    	GetZones						      Get the zones list	    	GetZoneName				    Extract  a zone name from the zones list	    	InitXPP					           Open the .XPP driver	    	XPPGetZoneList			  Get the zones list using Phase 2 calls	    	InitATP					          Open the .ATP driver	    	ATPGetZoneList 			Get the zones list	using Phase 1 callsAFP :	contains AppleTalk Filing Protocol functions and utilities to extract information	    	InitXPP						           Open the .ATP and .XPP drivers	    	GetServerInfo			       Get information about the server (name, UAMs, machine type)	    	LogOnwithName			      Open a session with username/password (no encryption of the password)	    	LogOnAsGuest			         Open a session in guest mode on an AppleShare server	    	GetServerParams 	       Get Server Information (Time and volumes)	    	OpenVolume				          Open an AppleShare volume	    	GetVolumePrivileges		Get volume privileges.	    	GetDirectories			        Get the subdirectories of a directory		    	CloseVolume			         	Close an AppleShare volume	    	LogOut				                 	Stop the sessionUtilities :	    	CheckUAM				             Check if a User Access Method is available	    	GetServerTime			       Calculate the server time in seconds (from 1 January 1904)	    	GetNumberVolumes		   Get the number of volumes of the server	    	ExtractVolumeName 		 Get a volume name	    	GetNumberDirs			        Get the number of subdirectories of a directory	    	ExtractDirInfo			         Extract info regarding a subdirectory : name, dirID, access rights
