With its steadycommercialization have come much greater demands on website developers.Today, it's not uncommon for a website to connect to a database, displaydynamic data, take user input, and offer a reasonable facsimileof a desktop application.</p><p>Typically, each of these features is added by a developerat the behest of the customers or site owner. Dozens of incompatiblemechanisms for solving the same problems exist, and any given siteis a house of cards held together by expensive and frequent programmer intervention.</p><p>Another issue, all to real for many IS (Information Systems)managers, is the need to access data stored in databases from differentvendors. Traditionally, developers have had to include custom codein their applications to be able to communicate efficiently witheach database. Even if an organization standardizes on one database,if the need ever arises to upgrade due to performance or businessreasons, then the custom code used to access the database becomesobsolete, slowing the transition process.</p><p>WebObjects solves all the common problems&#151;dynamic page generation,user input, state management, interface with databases&#151;that usuallyconsume most of a developer's time, instead freeing the developerto spend her time constructing the logic that actually makes theapplication different. </p><p>In this chapter, you</p><ul><li>learn howWebObjects saves you from reinventing the wheel</font></li><li>discover the features of WebObjects that make it a superiorapplication development system</font></li><li>learn about WebObjects's development tools</font></li></ul><br>    <br><a href="../AboutThisBook/iFurther_Reading.html" target="_top"><img src="../Images/previous.gif" border="0" alt="Previous"></a><a href="WebObjects_Features.html" target="_right"><img src="../Images/next.gif" border="0" alt="Next"></a>&nbsp;<hr alt=""><p><font face="Palatino" size="1">&#169; 2001 Apple Computer, Inc.</font></p><!-- start of footer --><!--#include virtual="/includes/framesetfooter" --><!-- end of footer --></body></html>
