<H1>Preface  - About This Book</H1>
 This book, <I>Inside Macintosh: PowerPC System Software,</I> describes the new process execution environment and system software services provided with the first version of the system software for Macintosh on PowerPC computers. It contains information you need to know to write applications and other software that can run on PowerPC processor-based Macintosh computers.<P>
 The first release of the system software for Macintosh on PowerPC computers provides a mixed or hybrid environment: the system software provides the ability to execute both applications that use the native instruction set of the PowerPC microprocessor and applications that use the 680x0 instruction set. It accomplishes this by providing a very efficient 68LC040 Emulator that emulates 680x0 instructions with PowerPC instructions. As a result, virtually all existing 680x0-based Macintosh applications and other software modules that conform to the programming interfaces and techniques documented in the <I>Inside Macintosh</I> suite of books will execute without modification on PowerPC processor-based Macintosh computers.<P>
 To take maximum advantage of the much greater processing speed of the PowerPC microprocessor, however, you'll need to recompile your application's source code into a PowerPC application. Apple Computer, Inc., provides MPW-based C and C++ compilers and other tools that you can use to create native PowerPC applications. In general, if your source code is already compliant with ANSI C standards or the de facto ANSI C++ standards, you should be able, with moderately little effort, to rework your source code so that it can be compiled and built using the Apple-supplied tools into a PowerPC application. This book is intended to provide much of the information you need to port your existing 680x0 application (or other software) to the PowerPC platform.<A NAME=MARKER-2-49></A><A NAME=MARKER-2-44></A><P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Note</B>
<DD>There will also be third-party compilers and development <BR>environments capable of generating PowerPC code.<EM></EM>  <IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "graphics/triangle.gif">
</DL>
 Although the native run-time execution environment of the first version of the system software for PowerPC processor-based Macintosh computers is significantly different from the execution environment of current 680x0-based Macintosh computers, you won't need to worry about those differences unless your existing code relies on specific information about the 680x0 execution environment. For example, if for some reason you directly access information in your application's A5 world, you'll need to rewrite those <BR>parts of code when porting your application to the PowerPC environment. Similarly, you'll need to rewrite any parts of your code that depend on <BR>data being passed in certain 680x0 registers. VBL tasks, for instance, very often depend on the fact that a pointer to the VBL task record is passed in register A0.<P>
 The first chapter in this book, <A HREF=PPCSoftware-11.html#MARKER-9-1>"Introduction to PowerPC System Software,"</A> provides a general overview of the system software that runs on PowerPC processor-based Macintosh computers. It also describes in detail the mixed environment provided by the 68LC040 Emulator and the Mixed Mode Manager, as well as the new run-time environment used for native PowerPC applications. You should read this chapter for general information about porting your existing software to the PowerPC environment. Even if you do not intend to port your existing 680x0 software, you might still want to read this chapter for information about running under the 68LC040 Emulator.<P>
 The remaining chapters in this book provide reference material for the three new system software managers introduced in the first version of the system software for PowerPC processor-based Macintosh computers. You should read these chapters for specific information on using the services provided by those managers. The new system software managers are<P>
<UL>
<LI>the Mixed Mode Manager, which manages the mixed environment of PowerPC processor-based Macintosh computers running 680x0-based code
<LI>the Code Fragment Manager, which loads fragments (blocks of executable PowerPC code and their associated data) into memory and prepares them for execution
<LI>the Exception Manager, which handles exceptions that occur during the execution of PowerPC applications or other software<P>
</UL>
<DL>
<DT><B>IMPORTANT</B>
<DD><A NAME=MARKER-9-4></A>Some of the system software services introduced in the first version of the system software for PowerPC processor-based Macintosh computers might in the future be available on Macintosh computers that are not based on the PowerPC microprocessor. For example, it's possible that the Code Fragment Manager (and the entire run-time environment based on fragments) will be included in future versions of the system software for 680x0-based Macintosh computers. As a result, some of the information in this book might eventually be more generally applicable than the title of this book might suggest.<EM></EM>  <IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "graphics/triangle.gif">

 If you are new to programming for Macintosh computers, you should read the <!--book <I><A HREF="../IMOverview/IMOverview-2.html">Inside Macintosh: Overview</A></I> for an introduction to general concepts <BR>of Macintosh programming. You should also read other --> books in the <I>Inside Macintosh</I> series for specific information about other aspects of the Macintosh Toolbox and the Macintosh Operating System. In particular, to benefit most from this book, you should already be familiar with the run-time environment of 680x0 applications, as described in the two books <I><A HREF="../Processes/Processes-2.html">Inside Macintosh: Processes</A></I> and <I><A HREF="../Memory/Memory-2.html">Inside Macintosh: Memory</A></I>.<P>
