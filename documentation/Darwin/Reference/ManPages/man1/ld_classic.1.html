LD_CLASSIC(1)                                                                                  LD_CLASSIC(1)



<b>NAME</b>
       ld_classic - The old Mach object file link editor

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>ld_classic</b> [ <u>option</u> <u>...</u>  ] [ <u>file</u> <u>...</u>  ]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  <u>ld</u><b>_</b><u>classic</u>  command  combines several Mach-O (Mach object) files into one by combining like sec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tions&nbsp;sections</font>
       tions in like segments from all the  object  files,  resolving  external  references,  and  searching
       libraries.   In  the simplest case several object <u>files</u> are given, and <u>ld</u><b>_</b><u>classic</u> combines them, pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ducing&nbsp;producing</font>
       ducing an object file which can either be executed or become the input for a further <u>ld</u><b>_</b><u>classic</u>  run.
       (In  the latter case, the <b>-r</b> option must be given to preserve the relocation information.)  Unless an
       output file is specified, <u>ld</u><b>_</b><u>classic</u> produces a file named <b>a.out</b>.  This file is made executable  only
       if no errors occurred during the link editing and there are no undefined symbols.

<b>UNIVERSAL</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>SUPPORT</b>
       The  link  editor  accepts  ``universal''  (multiple-architecture)  input files, but always creates a
       ``thin'' (single-architecture), standard Mach-O output file.  The architecture is specified using the
       <b>-arch</b>   <u>arch</u><b>_</b><u>type</u> option.  If this option is not used, <u>ld</u><b>_</b><u>classic</u>(1) attempts to determine the output
       architecture by examining the first object file encountered on the command line.  If it is a ``thin''
       file,  its  architecture  determines that of the output file.  If the first input file is a ``univer-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sal''&nbsp;``universal''</font>
       sal'' file, the ``best'' architecture for the host is  used.   (See  the  explanation  of  the  <b>-arch</b>
       option, below.)

       The  compiler  driver  <a href="cc.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/cc"><u>cc</u>(1)</a> handles creating universal executables by calling <u>ld</u><b>_</b><u>classic</u>(1) multiple
       times and using <a href="lipo.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/lipo"><u>lipo</u>(1)</a> to create a ``universal'' file from the results of the  <u>ld</u><b>_</b><u>classic</u>(1)  execu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tions.&nbsp;executions.</font>
       tions.

<b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>LAYOUT</b>
       The  object  files are loaded in the order in which they are specified on the command line.  The seg-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ments&nbsp;segments</font>
       ments and the sections in those segments will appear in the output file in the order they are encoun-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tered&nbsp;encountered</font>
       tered  in  the object files being linked.  All zero fill sections will appear after all non-zero fill
       sections in their segments.

       Sections created from files with the <b>-sectcreate</b> option will appear in the output file last.  Section
       names for sections created from files are not allowed to overlap with a section name in the same seg-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment&nbsp;segment</font>
       ment as a section coming from an object file.  Sections created from files may be in a segment  which
       has  sections from object files and if so will be loaded at the end of the non-zero fill sections for
       that segment.

       If the option <b>-seglinkedit</b> is specified, the segment it creates is the last  segment  in  the  output
       file.

       The  address  of  each  segment  can be specified with <b>-segaddr,</b> which takes the segment's name as an
       argument.  The address of the first segment can alternatively be specified using <b>-seg1addr,</b> in  which
       case  a  segment  name  is  not used.  Segments that do not have a specified address will be assigned
       addresses in the order in which they appear in the output file.  A segment's address will be assigned
       based  on  the  ending  address of the previous segment.  If the address of the first segment has not
       been specified by name, its assigned address will be the specified (via <b>-seg1addr</b>) or  default  first
       segment address.  If neither flag is used to specify the first segment's address, its default address
       is zero for all formats except the demand-paged executable format (MH_EXECUTE),  in  which  case  the
       default first address is the value of the segment alignment.

       For demand-paged executable format (MH_EXECUTE) output files, if none of the segments' addresses cov-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ers&nbsp;covers</font>
       ers address zero through the value of the segment alignment, a segment with no access protection will
       be  created  to  cover  those  addresses.  This segment, named ``__PAGEZERO'', is created so that any
       attempt to dereference a NULL pointer will cause a memory exception.

       The entry point of the output file is the beginning of the first section in the first segment (unless
       the <b>-e</b> option is specified).

<b>STATIC</b> <b>ARCHIVE</b> <b>LIBRARIES</b>
       <u>ld</u><b>_</b><u>classic</u>  supports  two  types of libraries: static archive libraries and dynamic shared libraries.
       Searching for undefined symbols is performed differently for dynamic shared libraries than it is  for
       static archive libraries.  The searching of dynamic shared libraries is described later.

       When a static archive library is specified as an argument to <u>ld</u><b>_</b><u>classic</u>, it is searched exactly once,
       at the point it is encountered in the argument list.   Only  those  members  defining  an  unresolved
       external  reference,  as  defined  by the static archive library's table of contents, are loaded.  To
       produce the table of contents, all static archive libraries must be processed by <a href="ranlib.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ranlib"><u>ranlib</u>(1)</a>.

       Generally, a static archive library does not have multiple members that define the same symbol.   For
       these  types of libraries, the order of the members is not important, so the table of contents can be
       sorted for faster link editing using the <b>-s</b> option to <a href="ranlib.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ranlib"><u>ranlib</u>(1)</a>.  The first member of the static  ar-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">chive&nbsp;archive</font>
       chive library is named ``__.SYMDEF SORTED'', which is understood to be a sorted table of contents.

       If  the  static  archive library does have multiple members that define the same symbol, the table of
       contents that <a href="ranlib.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ranlib"><u>ranlib</u>(1)</a> produces can't be sorted.  Instead, it follows the order in which the members
       appear  in  the  static archive library.  The link editor searches the table of contents iteratively,
       loading members until no further references are satisfied.  In the unsorted case, the first member of
       the  static  archive library is named ``__.SYMDEF'', which is understood to be a table of contents in
       the order of the archive members.

       Static archive library members can also be loaded in response to the <b>-ObjC</b> and <b>-all_load</b>  flags.  See
       their descriptions below.


<b>DYNAMIC</b> <b>SHARED</b> <b>LIBRARIES</b>
       When  a  dynamic shared library or an object file that was linked against a dynamic shared library is
       specified as an argument to <u>ld</u><b>_</b><u>classic</u>, that library is placed in the dynamic shared  library  search
       list.  The  order  of  the search list is always the same order the libraries were encountered on the
       command line. When linking -flat_namespace, all dynamic libraries  that  the  dynamic  libraries  are
       dependent upon are added to the end of the search list.

       Once  the search list is constructed, the static link editor checks for undefined symbols by simulat-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;simulating</font>
       ing the way the dynamic linker will search for undefined symbols at runtime. For each undefined  sym-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">bol,&nbsp;symbol,</font>
       bol,  the  static  link  editor searches each library in the search list until it finds a module that
       defines the symbol.  With each undefined symbol, the search starts with  the  first  library  in  the
       list.   This  is  different than for static archive libraries, where each library is searched exactly
       once for all undefined symbols.

       The static link editor simulates dynamic linking as if all the undefined symbols are to be  bound  at
       program launch time. The dynamic linker actually binds undefined symbols as they are encountered dur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;during</font>
       ing execution instead of at program launch. However, the static link editor always produces the  same
       linking as the dynamic linker as long as none of the dynamic shared libraries define the same symbol.
       Different linking can occur only when there is more than one definition of a symbol and  the  library
       modules  that  contain  the  definitions for that symbol do not define and reference exactly the same
       symbols.  In this case, even different executions of the same program can produce  different  linking
       because  the  dynamic linker binds undefined functions as they are called, and this affects the order
       in which undefined symbols are bound.  Because  it  can  produce  different  dynamic  linking,  using
       dynamic shared libraries that define the same symbols in the same program is strongly discouraged.

       If  a  static  archive library appears after a dynamic shared library on the command line, the static
       library is placed in the dynamic library search list and is searched as a dynamic library.   In  this
       way,  when  a  dynamic  library  has  undefined symbols, it will cause the appropriate members of the
       static libraries to be loaded into the output.  Searching static libraries as dynamic  libraries  can
       cause problems if the dynamic library later changes to reference symbols from the static library that
       it did not previously reference. In this case when the program runs, the dynamic linker  will  report
       these symbols as undefined because the members for these symbols were not loaded into the output.


<b>TWO-LEVEL</b> <b>AND</b> <b>FLAT</b> <b>NAMESPACES</b>
       Two-level and flat namespaces refer to how references to symbols in dynamic libraries are resolved to
       a definition in specific dynamic library.  For two-level namespace that resolution is done at  static
       link  time  when  each  image (program, bundle and shared library) is built.  When a program is using
       images built with two-level namespace there may be different global symbols with the same name  being
       used  by different images in the program (this is now the default).  When a program is using all flat
       namespace images then only one global symbol for each global symbol name is used by all images of the
       program (this was the default in MacOS X 10.0).

       When  creating  an  output file with the static link editor that links against dynamic libraries, the
       references to symbols in those libraries can be recorded at static link time to bind  to  a  specific
       library  definition  (two-level namespace) or left to be bound at execution time to the first library
       in the search order of the program (flat namespace).  A program, its dynamic libraries and  its  bun-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dles&nbsp;bundles</font>
       dles  may each be either two-level or flat namespace images.  The dynamic linker will bind each image
       according to how it was built.

       When creating an output file with the static link editor when <b>-twolevel_namespace</b> is in  effect  (now
       the  default)  all  undefined  references  must be satisfied at static link time.  The flags to allow
       undefined references, <b>-U</b><u>symbol</u><b>_</b><u>name,</u> <b>-undefined</b> <u>warning</u> and <b>-undefined</b> <u>suppress</u> can't be used.   When
       the  environment  variable  <b>MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET</b>  is  set  to  <b>10.3</b>  or  higher  then  <b>-undefined</b>
       <u>dynamic</u><b>_</b><u>lookup</u> can also be used.  The specific library definition recorded for each reference is  the
       first  library  that  has  a  definition  as  listed on the link line.  Listing an umbrella framework
       implies all of its sub-frameworks, sub-umbrellas and sub-libraries.  For any reference to  a  defini-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;definition</font>
       tion  found in an umbrella framework's sub-framework, sub-umbrella or sub-library will be recorded as
       coming from the umbrella framework.  Then at execution time  the  dynamic  linker  will  search  that
       umbrella framework's sub-frameworks, sub-umbrellas and sub-libraries for those references.  Also when
       two-level namespace is in effect only those frameworks listed on the link line  (and  sub-frameworks,
       sub-umbrellas  and  sub-libraries  of  umbrella  frameworks) are searched.  Other dependent libraries
       which are not sub-frameworks, sub-umbrellas or sub-libraries of umbrella frameworks are not searched.

              When creating bundles (MH_BUNDLE outputs) with the static link editor when two-level namespace
              is in effect (now the default) and the bundle has references to symbols expected to be defined
              in the program loading the bundle, then the <b>-bundle_loader</b> <u>executable</u> must be used.

              When  creating  an  output  file with the static link editor when <b>-flat_namespace</b> is in effect
              (the MacOS X 10.0 default) all undefined references must be satisfied at static link time when
              <b>-undefined</b>  <u>error</u>  (the  default) is used.  The static link editor checks the undefined refer-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ences&nbsp;references</font>
              ences by searching all the libraries listed on the link line  then  all  dependent  libraries.
              The  undefined symbols in the created output file are left to be resolved at execution time by
              the dynamic link editor in the dynamic libraries in the search order of the program.


<b>MULTIPLY</b> <b>DEFINED</b> <b>SYMBOLS</b>
       If there are multiply defined symbols in the object files being linked into  the  output  file  being
       created this always results in a multiply defined symbol error.

       When  the  static link editor links symbols in from a dynamic library that result in multiply defined
       symbols the handling depends on the type of name space of output file being created and possibly  the
       type of name space of the dynamic library.

       When the static link editor is creating a two-level namespace image and a there is a multiply defined
       symbol from dynamic library then that generates a multiply defined symbol warning (by default), where
       the treatment of this warning can be changed with the <b>-multiply_defined</b> flag.

       When the static link editor is creating a flat namespace image and a there is a multiply defined sym-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">bol&nbsp;symbol</font>
       bol from dynamic library, if the library is a flat namespace image then  that  generates  a  multiply
       defined  symbol  error.  If the library is a two-level namespace image then that generates a multiply
       defined symbol warning (by default), where the treatment of this warning  can  be  changed  with  the
       <b>-multiply_defined</b> flag.


<b>USING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>DYNAMIC</b> <b>LINK</b> <b>EDITOR</b> <b>AND</b> <b>DYNAMIC</b> <b>SHARED</b> <b>LIBRARIES</b>
       The  option  <b>-dynamic</b> must be specified in order to use dynamic shared libraries (and any of the fea-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tures&nbsp;features</font>
       tures used to implement them) and/or the dynamic link editor.  To make sure that the  output  is  not
       using  any  features  that  would require the dynamic link editor, the flag <b>-static</b> can be specified.
       Only one of these flags can be specified.


<b>LINK</b> <b>EDITOR</b> <b>DEFINED</b> <b>SYMBOLS</b>
       There is a group of link editor defined symbols for the  MH_EXECUTE,  MH_DYLIB  and  MH_PRELOAD  file
       types  (see  the header file &lt;mach-o/ldsyms.h&gt;).  Link editor symbols are reserved; it is an error if
       an input object file defines such a symbol.  Only those link editor symbols that  are  referenced  by
       the object file appear in the output file's symbol table.

       The link editor defined symbol `__mh_execute_header' (`_mh_execute_header' in C) is reserved when the
       output file format is MH_EXECUTE.  This symbol is the address of the Mach header  in  a  Mach-O  exe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cutable&nbsp;executable</font>
       cutable  (a  file  of type MH_EXECUTE).  It does not appear in any other Mach-O file type.  It can be
       used to get to the addresses and sizes of all the segments and sections in the executable.  This  can
       be done by parsing the headers and load commands (see <a href="../man5/Mach-O.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/Mach-O"><u>Mach-O</u>(5)</a>).

       The  link  editor  defined  symbol `__mh_dylib_header' (`_mh_dylib_header' in C) is reserved when the
       output file format is MH_DYLIB.  This symbol is the address of the Mach header in  a  Mach-O  dynamic
       shared library (a file of type MH_DYLIB) and is a private external symbol.  It does not appear in any
       other Mach-O file type.  It can be used to get to the addresses and sizes of  all  the  segments  and
       sections   in   a   dynamic   shared   library.    The   addresses,  however,  must  have  the  value
       <!-- a --><b>_</b><u>dyld</u><b>_</b><u>get</u><b>_</b><u>image</u><b>_</b><u>vmaddr</u><b>_</b><u>slide</u>(3)<!-- /a --> added to them.

       The MH_PRELOAD file type has link editor defined symbols for the beginning and ending  of  each  seg-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment,&nbsp;segment,</font>
       ment,  and  for  the beginning and ending of each section within a segment.  These names are provided
       for use in a Mach-O preloaded file, since it does not have its headers loaded as part  of  the  first
       segment.   The names of the symbols for a segment's beginning and end have the form: __SEGNAME__begin
       and __SEGNAME__end, where __SEGNAME is the name of the segment.  Similarly, the symbols for a section
       have  the form: __SEGNAME__sectname__begin and __SEGNAME__sectname__end, where __sectname is the name
       of the section in the segment __SEGNAME.  These symbols' types are those  of  the  section  that  the
       names refer to.  (A symbol that refers to the end of a section actually has, as its value, the begin-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ning&nbsp;beginning</font>
       ning address of the next section, but the symbol's type is still that of the section mentioned in the
       symbol's name.)

<b>OPTIONS</b>
       <u>Ld</u>  understands  several  options.   Filenames  and  options  that refer to libraries (such as <b>-l</b> and
       <b>-framework</b>), as well as options that create symbols (such as <b>-u</b> and <b>-i</b>), are position-dependent: They
       define  the  load  order and affect what gets loaded from libraries.  Some <u>ld</u><b>_</b><u>classic</u> options overlap
       with compiler options.  If the compiler driver <a href="cc.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/cc"><u>cc</u>(1)</a> is used to invoke <u>ld</u><b>_</b><u>classic</u> <u>,</u> it  maybe  neces-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sary&nbsp;necessary</font>
       sary to pass the <u>ld</u><b>_</b><u>classic</u>(1) options to <a href="cc.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/cc"><u>cc</u>(1)</a> using <b>-Wl,-option,argument1,argument2</b>.

       In  this  release  of  the  static  link  editor,  64-bit  code is processed by a the new link editor
       /usr/bin/ld.  And it is an error to pass -arch ppc64 or -arch x86_64 to <u>ld</u><b>_</b><u>classic</u>(1).

       The most common option is:

       <b>-o</b> <u>name</u>
              The output file is named <u>name</u>, instead of <b>a.out</b>.


       The following flags are related to architectures:

       <b>-arch</b> <u>arch</u><b>_</b><u>type</u>
              Specifies the architecture, <u>arch</u><b>_</b><u>type,</u> for the output file. ``Universal'' input files that  do
              not  contain  this specified architecture are ignored.  Only one <b>-arch</b> <u>arch</u><b>_</b><u>type</u> can be speci-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fied.&nbsp;specified.</font>
              fied.  See <a href="../man3/arch.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/arch"><u>arch</u>(3)</a> for the currently known <u>arch</u><b>_</b><u>type</u>s.  If    <u>arch</u><b>_</b><u>type</u>  specifies  a  certain
              implementation  of an architecture (such as <b>-arch</b> <u>m68040</u> or <b>-arch</b> <u>i486</u> ), the resulting object
              file has that specific CPU subtype, and it is an error if any input file  has  a  CPU  subtype
              that will not combine to the CPU subtype for  <u>arch</u><b>_</b><u>type</u>.

              The  default output file architecture is determined by the first object file to be linked.  If
              it is a ``thin'' (standard Mach-O) file, or a ``universal'' file that contains only one archi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tecture,&nbsp;architecture,</font>
              tecture, the output file will have the same architecture.  Otherwise, if it is a ``universal''
              file containing an architecture that would execute on the host, then the ``best'' architecture
              is used, as defined by what the kernel <!-- a -->exec(2)<!-- /a --> would select.  Otherwise, it is an error, and a
              <b>-arch</b> <u>arch</u><b>_</b><u>type</u> must be specified.  For family architectures (like ppc and i386) the CPU  sub-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">type&nbsp;subtype</font>
              type  of  the  linked  output  is  the ALL cpusubtype.  For specific CPU subtypes (ppc7400 vs.
              ppc970), the resulting CPU subtype of the linked output is to 'combine' the CPU subtypes.  The
              combining  is  CPU specific and generally results in the minimum CPU subtype needed to support
              all the combined CPU subtypes.

       <b>-arch_multiple</b>
              This flag is used by the <a href="cc.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/cc"><u>cc</u>(1)</a> driver program when it is run  with  multiple  <b>-arch</b>  <u>arch</u><b>_</b><u>type</u>
              flags.   It instructs programs like <u>ld</u><b>_</b><u>classic</u>(1) to precede any displayed message with a line
              stating the program name, in this case  <u>ld</u><b>_</b><u>classic</u>,  and  the  architecture  (from  the  <b>-arch</b>
              <u>arch</u><b>_</b><u>type</u> flag).  This helps distinguish which architecture the error messages refer to.

       <b>-force_cpusubtype_ALL</b>
              The <b>-force_cpusubtype_ALL</b> flag causes the CPU subtype to remain the ALL CPU subtype and not to
              be combined or changed.  This flag has precedence over any <b>-arch</b> <u>arch</u><b>_</b><u>type</u> flag for a specific
              implementation.  This is the default for all x86 architectures.

       The following flags are related to using the dynamic link editor and/or dynamic shared libraries (and
       any of the features used to implement them):

       <b>-dynamic</b>
              Allows use of the features associated with dynamic link editor.  The default is <b>-dynamic.</b>

       <b>-static</b>
              Causes those features associated with dynamic link editor to be  treated  as  an  error.  (The
              description  for  the  options  that  will  cause an error if you use them in conjunction with
              <b>-static</b> are marked with the statement "when <b>-dynamic</b>
               is used").

       <b>-read_only_relocs</b> <u>treatment</u>
              Specifies how relocation entries in read-only sections are to  be  treated  when  <b>-dynamic</b>  is
              used.  To get the best possible sharing, the read-only sections should not have any relocation
              entries.  If they do, the dynamic linker will write on the section.  Having relocation entries
              appear  in  read-only sections is normally avoided by compiling with the option <b>-dynamic.</b>  But
              in such cases non-converted assembly code or objects not  compiled  with  <b>-dynamic</b>  relocation
              entries will appear in read-only sections.  The <u>treatment</u> can be: <u>error,</u> <u>warning,</u> or <u>suppress.</u>
              Which cause the treatment of relocation entries in read-only sections as either, errors, warn-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ings,&nbsp;warnings,</font>
              ings, or suppressed messages.  The default is to treat these as errors.

       <b>-sect_diff_relocs</b> <u>treatment</u>
              Specifies  how  section difference relocation enries are to be treated when <b>-dynamic</b> and <b>-exe</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cute&nbsp;-execute</font>
              <b>cute</b> are used.  To get the best possible code generation the compiler should not generate code
              for  executables  (MH_EXECUTE  format  outputs)  that  have  any section difference relocation
              entries.  The <a href="gcc.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/gcc"><u>gcc</u>(1)</a> compiler has the <b>-mdynamic-no-pic</b> flag for generating code  for  executa-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">bles.&nbsp;executables.</font>
              bles.   The  default treatment is <u>suppress,</u> where no message is printed.  The other treatments
              are <u>error</u> or <u>warning.</u>  This option can also be specified by setting the  environment  variable
              LD_SECT_DIFF_RELOCS to the treatment values.

       <b>-weak_reference_mismatches</b> <u>treatment</u>
              Specifies  how  to treat mismatches of symbol references in the the object files being linked.
              Normally the all the undefined symbol references of the object files being  linked  should  be
              consistent  for each undefined symbol.  That is all undefined symbols should either be weak or
              non-weak references. The default treatment is <u>error,</u> where the link fails with an  error  mes-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sage.&nbsp;message.</font>
              sage.  The other treatments are <u>weak</u> or <u>non-weak,</u> which makes mismatched undefined symbol ref-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">erences&nbsp;references</font>
              erences either weak or non-weak in the output, respectively.  Care must be  taken  when  using
              the  treatment  <u>weak</u>  as the use of the non-weak symbol references in an object file may cause
              the program to crash when the symbol is not present at execution time.

       <b>-prebind</b>
              Have the static linker, <u>ld</u><b>_</b><u>classic</u>(1), prebind an executable's  or  dynamic  shared  library's
              undefined  symbols  to  the  addresses of the dynamic libraries it is being linked with.  This
              optimization can only be done if the libraries don't overlap and no  symbols  are  overridden.
              When  the  resulting program is run and the same libraries are used to run the program as when
              the program was linked, the dynamic linker can  use  the  prebound  addresses.   If  not,  the
              dynamic linker undoes the prebinding and binds normally.  This option can also be specified by
              setting the environment variable LD_PREBIND.  If the environment variable  LD_FORCE_NO_PREBIND
              is  set  both the option <b>-prebind</b> LD_PREBIND environment variable are ignore and the output is
              not prebound.  Or if the environment variable  <b>MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET</b>  is  set  to  10.4  or
              greater and the output is not a split a dynamic library the output is not prebound.

       <b>-noprebind</b>
              Do  not  have  the static linker, <u>ld</u><b>_</b><u>classic</u>(1), prebind the output.  If this is specified the
              environment variable LD_PREBIND is ignored.

       <b>-prebind_allow_overlap</b>
              Have the static linker, <u>ld</u><b>_</b><u>classic</u>(1), prebind the output even if the addresses of the dynamic
              libraries it uses overlap.  The resulting output can then have <a href="redo_prebinding.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/redo_prebinding"><u>redo</u><b>_</b><u>prebinding</u>(1)</a> run on it to
              fix up the prebinding after the overlapping dynamic libraries have been rebuilt.  This  option
              can also be specified by setting the environment variable LD_PREBIND_ALLOW_OVERLAP.

       <b>-prebind_all_twolevel_modules</b>
              Have  the  static  linker,  <u>ld</u><b>_</b><u>classic</u>(1),  mark all modules from prebound two-level namespace
              dynamic libraries as used by the program even if they are not statically referenced.  This can
              provide  improved  launch  time  for programs like Objective-C programs that use symbols indi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rectly&nbsp;indirectly</font>
              rectly through NIB files. This option can also be specified by setting the  environment  vari-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able&nbsp;variable</font>
              able LD_PREBIND_ALL_TWOLEVEL_MODULES.

       <b>-noprebind_all_twolevel_modules</b>
              Don't  have  the static linker, <u>ld</u><b>_</b><u>classic</u>(1), mark all modules from prebound two-level names-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pace&nbsp;namespace</font>
              pace dynamic libraries as used by the program.  This flag overrides the setting of  the  envi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ronment&nbsp;environment</font>
              ronment variable LD_PREBIND_ALL_TWOLEVEL_MODULES.

       <b>-nofixprebinding</b>
              Have  the  static  linker,  <u>ld</u><b>_</b><u>classic</u>(1), mark the executable so that the dynamic linker will
              never notify the prebinding agent if this launched and its prebinding is out of date.  This is
              used when building the prebinding agent itself.

       The following flags are related to libraries:

       <b>-l</b><u>x</u>    This  option  is  an  abbreviation  for  the  library  name `lib<u>x</u>.a', where <u>x</u> is a string.  If
              <b>-dynamic</b> is specified the abbreviation for the library name is first  search  as  `lib<u>x</u>.dylib'
              and then `lib<u>x</u>.a' is searched for.  <u>ld</u><b>_</b><u>classic</u> searches for libraries first in any directories
              specified with <b>-L</b> options, then in any directories specified in the  colon  separated  set  of
              paths  in  the  environment  variable  LD_LIBRARY_PATH,  then  the  standard directories <b>/lib</b>,
              <b>/usr/lib</b>, and <b>/usr/local/lib</b>.  A library is searched when its  name  is  encountered,  so  the
              placement  of  the  <b>-l</b> flag is significant.  If string <u>x</u> is of the form <u>x</u>.o, then that file is
              searched for in the same places, but without prepending `lib' or appending `.a' or `.dylib' to
              the filename.

       <b>-weak-l</b><u>x</u>
              This  is  the  same as the <b>-l</b><u>x</u> but forces the library and all references to it to be marked as
              weak imports.  Care must be taken when using this as the use of the non-weak symbol references
              in  an object file may cause the program to crash when the symbol or library is not present at
              execution time.

       <b>-weak_library</b> <u>file</u><b>_</b><u>name</u><b>_</b><u>path</u><b>_</b><u>to</u><b>_</b><u>library</u>
              This is the same as listing a file name path to a library on the  link  line  except  that  it
              forces  the library and all references to it to be marked as weak imports.  Care must be taken
              when using this as the use of the non-weak symbol references in an object file may  cause  the
              program to crash when the symbol or library is not present at execution time.

       <b>-L</b><u>dir</u>  Add  <u>dir</u>  to  the list of directories in which to search for libraries.  Directories specified
              with <b>-L</b> are searched before the standard directories.

       <b>-Z</b>     Do not search the standard directories when searching for libraries.

       <b>-syslibroot</b> <u>rootdir</u>
              Prepend <u>rootdir</u> to the standard directories when searching for libraries or frameworks.

       <b>-search_paths_first</b>
              By default when the <b>-dynamic</b> flag is in effect, the <b>-l</b><u>x</u> and <b>-weak-l</b><u>x</u> options first search  for
              a  file  of the form `lib<u>x</u>.dylib' in each directory in the library search path, then a file of
              the form `lib<u>x</u>.a' is searched for in the library search paths.  This option changes it so that
              in  each  path  `lib<u>x</u>.dylib' is searched for then `lib<u>x</u>.a' before the next path in the library
              search path is searched.

       <b>-framework</b> <u>name[,suffix]</u>
              Specifies a framework to link against. Frameworks are dynamic shared libraries, but  they  are
              stored  in  different  locations,  and  therefore  must be searched for differently. When this
              option is specified, <u>ld</u><b>_</b><u>classic</u> searches for  framework  `<u>name</u>.framework/<u>name</u>'  first  in  any
              directories  specified  with  the  <b>-F</b>  option,  then  in  the  standard  framework directories
              <b>/Library/Frameworks</b>, <b>/Network/Library/Frameworks</b>, and <b>/System/Library/Frameworks</b>.  The  place-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment&nbsp;placement</font>
              ment  of  the <b>-framework</b> option is significant, as it determines when and how the framework is
              searched.  If the optional suffix is specified the framework is first searched  for  the  name
              with the suffix and then without.

       <b>-weak_framework</b> <u>name[,suffix]</u>
              This  is  the same as the <b>-framework</b> <u>name[,suffix]</u> but forces the framework and all references
              to it to be marked as weak imports.  Care must be taken when using this as the use of the non-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">weak&nbsp;nonweak</font>
              weak  symbol  references  in  an object file may cause the program to crash when the symbol or
              framework is not present at execution time.

       <b>-F</b><u>dir</u>  Add <u>dir</u> to the list of directories in which to search for frameworks.   Directories  specified
              with <b>-F</b> are searched before the standard framework directories.

       <b>-ObjC</b>  Loads  all members of static archive libraries that define an Objective C class or a category.
              This option does not apply to dynamic shared libraries.

       <b>-all_load</b>
              Loads all members of static archive libraries.  This option does not apply to  dynamic  shared
              libraries.

       <b>-dylib_file</b> <u>install</u><b>_</b><u>name:file</u><b>_</b><u>name</u>
              Specifies that a dynamic shared library is in a different location than its standard location.
              Use this option when you link with a library that is dependent on a dynamic library,  and  the
              dynamic  library is in a location other than its default location.  <u>install</u><b>_</b><u>name</u> specifies the
              path where the library normally resides.  <u>file</u><b>_</b><u>name</u> specifies the path of the library you want
              to  use  instead.  For example, if you link to a library that depends upon the dynamic library
              libsys and you have libsys installed in a nondefault location,  you  would  use  this  option:
              <b>-dylib_file</b> <b>/lib/libsys_s.A.dylib:/me/lib/libsys_s.A.dylib</b>.

       <b>-executable_path</b> <u>path</u><b>_</b><u>name</u>
              Specifies that <u>path</u><b>_</b><u>name</u> is used to replace <u>@executable</u><b>_</b><u>path</u> for dependent libraries.


       The following options specify the output file format (the file type):

       <b>-execute</b>
              Produce  a  Mach-O  demand-paged  executable format file.  The headers are placed in the first
              segment, and all segments are padded to the segment  alignment.   This  has  a  file  type  of
              MH_EXECUTE.   This is the default.  If no segment address is specified at address zero, a seg-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment&nbsp;segment</font>
              ment with no protection (no read, write, or execute permission) is created  at  address  zero.
              This  segment,  whose  size  is  that of the segment alignment, is named ``__PAGEZERO''.  This
              option was previously named <b>-Mach</b>, which will continue to be recognized.

       <b>-object</b>
              Produce a Mach-O file in the relocatable object file format that is  intended  for  execution.
              This  differs from using the <b>-r</b> option in that it defines common symbols, does not allow unde-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fined&nbsp;undefined</font>
              fined symbols and does not preserve relocation entries.  This has a file  type  of  MH_OBJECT.
              In  this  format  all  sections  are placed in one unnamed segment with all protections (read,
              write, execute) allowed on that segment.  This is intended for extremely small  programs  that
              would  otherwise be large due to segment padding.  In this format, and all non-MH_EXECUTE for-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mats,&nbsp;formats,</font>
              mats, the link editor defined symbol ``__mh_execute_header'' is not defined since the  headers
              are not part of the segment.  This format file can't be used with the dynamic linker.

       <b>-preload</b>
              Produce a Mach-O preloaded executable format file.  The headers are not placed in any segment.
              All sections are placed in their proper segments and they are padded to the segment alignment.
              This  has a file type of MH_PRELOAD.  This option was previously <b>-p</b>, which will continue to be
              recognized.

       <b>-dylib</b> Produce a Mach-O dynamically linked shared library format file.  The headers are placed in the
              first  segment.   All  sections are placed in their proper segments and they are padded to the
              segment alignment.  This has a file type of MH_DYLIB.  This option is used by <a href="libtool.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/libtool"><u>libtool</u>(1)</a>  when
              its <b>-dynamic</b> option is specified.

       <b>-bundle</b>
              Produce  a  Mach-O bundle format file.  The headers are placed in the first segment.  All sec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tions&nbsp;sections</font>
              tions are placed in their proper segments and they are padded to the segment alignment.   This
              has a file type of MH_BUNDLE.

       <b>-dylinker</b>
              Produces  a  Mach-O dynamic link editor format file.  The headers are placed in the first seg-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment.&nbsp;segment.</font>
              ment.  All sections are placed in their proper segments, and they are padded  to  the  segment
              alignment.  This has a file type of MH_DYLINKER.

       <b>-fvmlib</b>
              Produce  a  Mach-O  fixed  VM shared library format file.  The headers are placed in the first
              segment but the first section in that segment will be placed on  the  next  segment  alignment
              boundary  in  that  segment.   All  sections  are placed in their proper segments and they are
              padded to the segment alignment.  This has a file type of MH_FVMLIB.


       The following flags affect the contents of the output file:

       <b>-r</b>     Save the relocation information in the output file so that it can be the  subject  of  another
              <u>ld</u><b>_</b><u>classic</u>  run.  The resulting file type is a Mach-O relocatable file (MH_OBJECT) if not oth-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">erwise&nbsp;otherwise</font>
              erwise specified.  This flag also prevents final definitions from being given to  common  sym-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">bols,&nbsp;symbols,</font>
              bols, and suppresses the `undefined symbol' diagnostics.

       <b>-d</b>     Force  definition of common storage even if the <b>-r</b> option is present.  This option also forces
              link editor defined symbols to be defined.  This option is assumed when  there  is  a  dynamic
              link editor load command in the input and <b>-r</b> is not specified.


       The following flags support segment specifications:

       <b>-segalign</b> <u>value</u>
              Specifies the segment alignment.  <u>value</u> is a hexadecimal number that must be an integral power
              of 2.  The default is the target pagesize (currently 1000 hex for the PowerPC and i386).

       <b>-seg1addr</b> <u>addr</u>
              Specifies the starting address of the first segment in the output file.  <u>addr</u> is a hexadecimal
              number  and must be a multiple of the segment alignment.  This option can also be specified as
              <b>-image_base.</b>

       <b>-segaddr</b> <u>name</u> <u>addr</u>
              Specifies the starting address of the segment named <u>name</u> to be <u>addr.</u>  The address  must  be  a
              hexadecimal number that is a multiple of the segment alignment.

       <b>-segs_read_only_addr</b> <u>addr</u>
              Specifies  the  starting  address of the read-only segments in a dynamic shared library.  When
              this option is used the dynamic shared library is built such that the read-only and read-write
              segments  are  split  into  separate  address  ranges.  By default the read-write segments are
              256meg (0x10000000) after the read-only segments.  <u>addr</u> is a hexadecimal number and must be  a
              multiple of the segment alignment.

       <b>-segs_read_write_addr</b> <u>addr</u>
              Specifies  the  starting address of the read-write segments in a dynamic shared library.  When
              this option is used the <b>-segs_read_only_addr</b> must also be used (see above).  <u>addr</u> is  a  hexa-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">decimal&nbsp;hexadecimal</font>
              decimal number and must be a multiple of the segment alignment.

       <b>-seg_addr_table</b> <u>filename</u>
              For   dynamic  shared  libraries  the  <b>-seg1addr</b>  or  the  pair  of  <b>-segs_read_only_addr</b>  and
              <b>-segs_read_write_addr</b> are specified by an entry in the segment address table in <u>filename</u>  that
              matches the install name of the library.  The entries in the table are lines containing either
              a single hex address and an install name or two hex addresses and an  install  name.   In  the
              first  form  the  single  hex address is used as the <b>-seg1addr</b> <b>.</b>  In the second form the first
              address is used as the <b>-segs_read_only_addr</b> address and the second  address  is  used  as  the
              <b>-segs_read_write_addr</b>  address.   This option can also be specified by setting the environment
              variable  LD_SEG_ADDR_TABLE.   If  the  environment  variable  is  set  then  any   <b>-seg1addr</b>,
              <b>-segs_read_only_addr</b>,  <b>-segs_read_write_addr</b>  and  <b>-seg_addr_table</b>  options  are ignored and a
              warning is printed.

       <b>-seg_addr_table_filename</b> <u>pathname</u>
              Use <b>pathname</b> instead of the install name of the library for matching an entry in  the  segment
              address table.

       <b>-segprot</b> <u>name</u> <u>max</u> <u>init</u>
              Specifies  the maximum and initial virtual memory protection of the named segment, <u>name,</u> to be
              <u>max</u> and <u>init</u> ,respectively.  The values for <u>max</u> and <u>init</u> are any combination of the characters
              `r'  (for read), `w' (for write), `x' (for execute) and '-' (no access).  The default is `rwx'
              for the maximum protection for all segments for PowerPC architecures  and  `rw`  for  the  all
              Intel  architecures.   The  default for the initial protection for all segments is `rw' unless
              the segment contains a section which contains some machine instructions,  in  which  case  the
              default for the initial protection is `rwx' (and for Intel architecures it also sets the maxi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mum&nbsp;maximum</font>
              mum protection to `rwx' in this case).   The  default  for  the  initial  protection  for  the
              ``__TEXT'' segment is `rx' (not writable).

       <b>-seglinkedit</b>
              Create  the  link edit segment, named ``__LINKEDIT'' (this is the default).  This segment con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tains&nbsp;contains</font>
              tains all the link edit information (relocation information, symbol table, string table, etc.)
              in  the object file.  If the segment protection for this segment is not specified, the initial
              protection is not writable.  This can only be specified when  the  output  file  type  is  not
              MH_OBJECT  and MH_PRELOAD output file types.  To get at the contents of this section, the Mach
              header and load commands must be parsed from the link editor defined symbols  like  `__mh_exe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cute_header'&nbsp;`__mh_execute_header'</font>
              cute_header' (see <a href="../man5/Mach-O.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/Mach-O"><u>Mach-O</u>(5)</a>).

       <b>-noseglinkedit</b>
              Do not create the link edit segment (see <b>-seglinkedit</b> above).

       <b>-pagezero_size</b> <u>value</u>
              Specifies  the  segment  size  of __PAGEZERO to be of size <u>value</u>, where <u>value</u> is a hexadecimal
              number rounded to the segment alignment.  The default is the target pagesize (currently,  1000
              hexadecimal for the PowerPC and for i386).

       <b>-stack_addr</b> <u>value</u>
              Specifies  the initial address of the stack pointer <u>value</u>, where <u>value</u> is a hexadecimal number
              rounded to the segment alignment.  The default segment alignment is the target pagesize  (cur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rently,&nbsp;(currently,</font>
              rently,  1000  hexadecimal  for  the  PowerPC  and for i386).  If <b>-stack_size</b> is specified and
              <b>-stack_addr</b> is not, a default stack address specific for the architecture being linked will be
              used  and  its  value printed as a warning message.  This creates a segment named __UNIXSTACK.
              Note that the initial stack address will be either at the high address of the segment  or  the
              low  address  of the segment depending on which direction the stack grows for the architecture
              being linked.

       <b>-stack_size</b> <u>value</u>
              Specifies the size of the stack segment <u>value</u>, where <u>value</u> is a hexadecimal number rounded  to
              the  segment alignment.  The default segment alignment is the target pagesize (currently, 1000
              hexadecimal for the PowerPC and for i386).  If <b>-stack_addr</b> is  specified  and  <b>-stack_size</b>  is
              not,  a  default  stack  size  specific for the architecture being linked will be used and its
              value printed as a warning message.  This creates a segment named __UNIXSTACK .

       <b>-allow_stack_execute</b>
              Marks executable so that all stacks in the task will be given stack execution privilege.  This
              includes pthread stacks.


       The following flags support section specifications:

       <b>-sectcreate</b> <u>segname</u> <u>sectname</u> <u>file</u>
              The  section <u>sectname</u> in the segment <u>segname</u> is created from the contents of <u>file.</u>  The combi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nation&nbsp;combination</font>
              nation of <u>segname</u> and <u>sectname</u> must be  unique;  there  cannot  already  be  a  section  <u>(seg</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">name,sectname)&nbsp;(segname,sectname)</font>
              <u>name,sectname)</u>  in any input object file.  This option was previously called <b>-segcreate</b>, which
              will continue to be recognized.

       <b>-sectalign</b> <u>segname</u> <u>sectname</u> <u>value</u>
              The section named <u>sectname</u> in the segment <u>segname</u> will have its alignment set to <u>value</u>,  where
              <u>value</u>  is  a  hexadecimal number that must be an integral power of 2.  This can be used to set
              the alignment of a section created from a file, or to increase the alignment of a section from
              an object file, or to set the maximum alignment of the (__DATA,__common) section, where common
              symbols are defined by the link editor.  Setting the alignment of a literal section causes the
              individual literals to be aligned on that boundary.  If the section alignment is not specified
              by a section header in an object file or on the command line, it defaults to 10  (hex),  indi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cating&nbsp;indicating</font>
              cating 16-byte alignment.

       <b>-sectorder</b> <u>segname</u> <u>sectname</u> <u>orderfile</u>
              The  section  <u>sectname</u> in the segment <u>segname</u> of the input files will be broken up into blocks
              associated with symbols in the section.  The output section will be created  by  ordering  the
              blocks  as  specified  by  the lines in the <u>orderfile.</u>  These blocks are aligned to the output
              file's section alignment for this section.  Any section can be  ordered  in  the  output  file
              except symbol pointer and symbol stub sections.

              For  non-literal  sections,  each  line  of the <u>orderfile</u> contains an object name and a symbol
              name, separated by a single colon (':').  Lines that start with # are ignored and  treated  as
              comments.   If the object file is in an archive, the archive name, followed by a single colon,
              must precede the object file name.  The object file names and archive names should be  exactly
              the  names  as  seen  by the link editor, but if not, the link editor attempts to match up the
              names the best it can.  For non-literal sections, the easiest way to generate an order file is
              with the ``<b>-jonls</b> <b>+</b><u>segname</u> <u>sectname</u>'' options to <a href="nm.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/nm"><u>nm</u>(1)</a>.

              The  format of the <u>orderfile</u> for literal sections is specific to each type of literal section.
              For C string literal sections, each line of the order file  contains  one  literal  C  string,
              which  may  include  ANSI  C escape sequences.  For four-byte literal sections, the order file
              format is one 32-bit hex number with a leading 0x per line, with the rest of the line  treated
              as  a comment.  For eight-byte literal sections, the order file has two 32-bit hex numbers per
              line; each number has a leading 0x, the two numbers are separated by white space, and the rest
              of  the  line  is  treated as a comment.  For literal pointer sections, the lines in the order
              file represent pointers, one per line.  A literal pointer is represented by the  name  of  the
              segment  that contains the literal being pointed to, followed by the section name, followed by
              the literal. These three strings are separated by colons with no extra white space.   For  all
              the  literal sections, each line in the the order file is simply entered into the literal sec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;section</font>
              tion and will appear in the output file in the same order as in the order file.  There  is  no
              check  to see whether the literal is present in the loaded objects.  For literal sections, the
              easiest way to generate an order file is with the ``<b>-X</b> <b>-v</b> <b>-s</b>  <u>segname</u>  <u>sectname</u>''  options  to
              <a href="otool.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/otool"><u>otool</u>(1)</a>.

       <b>-sectorder_detail</b>
              When  using  the  <b>-sectorder</b> option,  any pairs of object file names and symbol names that are
              found in the loaded objects, but not specified in the <u>orderfile</u>, are placed last in the output
              file's  section.   These pairs are ordered by object file (as the filenames appear on the com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
              mand line), with the different symbols from a given object file being  ordered  by  increasing
              symbol address (that is, the order in which the symbols occurred in the object file, not their
              order in the symbol table).  By default, the link editor displays a summary that simply  shows
              the  number  of  symbol names found in the loaded objects but not in the <u>orderfile</u>, as well as
              the number of symbol names listed in the <u>orderfile</u> but not found in the loaded objects.   (The
              summary is omitted if both values are zero.)  To instead produce a detailed list of these sym-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">bols,&nbsp;symbols,</font>
              bols, use the <b>-sectorder_detail</b> flag.  If an object file-symbol name pair is  listed  multiple
              times, a warning is generated, and the first occurrence is used.

       <b>-sectobjectsymbols</b> <u>segname</u> <u>sectname</u>
              This  causes  the link editor to generate local symbols in the section <u>sectname</u> in the segment
              <u>segname</u>.  Each object file that has one of these sections will have  a  local  symbol  created
              whose  name  is  that of the object file, or of the member of the archive.  The symbol's value
              will be the first address where that object file's section was loaded.   The  symbol  has  the
              type  N_SECT  and its section number is the the same as that of the section <u>(segname,sectname)</u>
              in the output file.  This symbol will be placed in the symbol  table  just  before  all  other
              local  symbols  for  the  object  file.   This  feature is typically used where the section is
              (__TEXT,__text), in order to help the debugger debug object files produced by old versions  of
              the compiler or by non-Apple compilers.


       The following flags are related to name spaces:

       <b>-twolevel_namespace</b>
              Specifies  the  output  to  be  built as a two-level namespace image.  This option can also be
              specified by setting the environment variable LD_TWOLEVEL_NAMESPACE.  This is the default.

       <b>-flat_namespace</b>
              Specifies the output to be built as a flat namespace image.  This is not the default (but  was
              the default in MacOS X 10.0).

       <b>-force_flat_namespace</b>
              Specifies the executable output to be built and executed treating all its dynamic libraries as
              flat namespace images.  This marks the executable so that the dynamic link editor  treats  all
              dynamic libraries as flat namespace images when the program is executed.

       <b>-bundle_loader</b> <u>executable</u>
              This specifies the <u>executable</u> that will be loading the bundle output file being linked.  Unde-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fined&nbsp;Undefined</font>
              fined symbols from the bundle are checked against the specified executable like it was one  of
              the  dynamic  libraries  the  bundle  was  linked  with.   If  the  bundle  being created with
              <b>-twolevel_namespace</b> in effect then the searching of the executable for symbols is based on the
              placement  of  the  <b>-bundle_loader</b>  flag relative to the dynamic libraries.  If the the bundle
              being created with <b>-flat_namespace</b> then the searching of the executable  is  done  before  all
              dynamic libraries.

       <b>-private_bundle</b>
              This  allows  symbols  defined  in  the  output  to also be defined in executable in the <b>-bun</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dle_loader&nbsp;-bundle_loader</font>
              <b>dle_loader</b> argument when <b>-flat_namespace</b> is in effect.  This implies that  the  bundle  output
              file  being  created is going to be loaded by the executable with the <b>NSLINKMODULE_OPTION_PRI</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">VATE&nbsp;NSLINKMODULE_OPTION_PRIVATE</font>
              <b>VATE</b> option to <!-- a --><u>NSLinkModule</u>(3)<!-- /a -->.

       <b>-twolevel_namespace_hints</b>
              Specifies to create the output with the two-level namespace hints table  to  be  used  by  the
              dynamic  linker.   This  is the default except when the <b>-bundle</b> flag is specified.  If this is
              used when the <b>-bundle</b> flag is specified the bundle will fail to load on a MacOS X 10.0  system
              with a malformed object error.

       <b>-multiply_defined</b> <u>treatment</u>
              Specifies  how  multiply  defined  symbols in dynamic libraries when <b>-twolevel_namespace</b> is in
              effect are to be treated.  <u>treatment</u> can be: <u>error,</u> <u>warning,</u> or  <u>suppress.</u>   Which  cause  the
              treatment  of  multiply  defined  symbols in dynamic libraries as either, errors, warnings, or
              suppresses the checking of multiply symbols from dynamic libraries when <b>-twolevel_namespace</b> is
              in  effect.  The default is to treat multiply defined symbols in dynamic libraries as warnings
              when <b>-twolevel_namespace</b> is in effect.

       <b>-multiply_defined_unused</b> <u>treatment</u>
              Specifies how unused multiply defined symbols in dynamic libraries when <b>-twolevel_namespace</b> is
              in  effect  are  to  be treated.  An unused multiply defined symbol is one in which there is a
              symbol defined in the output that is also defined in  the  dynamic  libraries  the  output  is
              linked  with but the symbol in the dynamic library is not used by any reference in the output.
              <u>treatment</u> can be: <u>error,</u> <u>warning,</u> or <u>suppress.</u>  The default for unused multiply  defined  sym-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">bols&nbsp;symbols</font>
              bols is to suppress these messages.

       <b>-nomultidefs</b>
              specifying  this flag marks the umbrella being created such that the dynamic linker is guaran-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">teed&nbsp;guaranteed</font>
              teed that no multiple definitions of symbols in the umbrella's  sub-images  will  ever  exist.
              This  allows the dynamic linker to always use the two-level namespace lookup hints even if the
              timestamps of the sub-images do not match.  This flag implies <b>-multiply_defined</b> <u>error</u><b>.</b>


       The following flags are related to symbols.  These flags' arguments are external symbols whose  names
       have `_' prepended to the C, FORTRAN, or Pascal variable name.

       <b>-y</b><u>sym</u>  Display  each  file in which <u>sym</u> appears, its type, and whether the file defines or references
              it.  Any multiply defined symbols are automatically traced.  Like most of  the  other  symbol-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">related&nbsp;symbolrelated</font>
              related  flags,  <b>-y</b>  takes  only one argument; the flag may be specified more than once in the
              command line to trace more than one symbol.

       <b>-Y</b> <u>number</u>
              For the first <u>number</u> undefined symbols, displays each file in which the  symbol  appears,  its
              type and whether the file defines or references it (that is, the same style of output produced
              by the <b>-y</b> option). To keep the output manageable, this option displays at most  <u>number</u>  refer-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ences.&nbsp;references.</font>
              ences.

       <b>-keep_private_externs</b>
              Don't  turn  private  external  symbols  into static symbols, but rather leave them as private
              external in the resulting output file.

       <b>-m</b>     Don't treat multiply defined symbols from the linked objects as a hard error; instead,  simply
              print  a  warning.   The  first  linked object defining such a symbol is used for linking; its
              value is used for the symbol in the symbol table.  The code and data for all such symbols  are
              copied  into  the  output.  The duplicate symbols other than the first symbol may still end up
              being used in the resulting output file through local references.  This can  still  produce  a
              resulting output file that is in error.  This flag's use is strongly discouraged!

       <b>-whyload</b>
              Indicate  why  each  member  of a library is loaded.  In other words, indicate which currently
              undefined symbol is being resolved, causing that member to be  loaded.   This  in  combination
              with  the above <b>-y</b><u>sym</u> flag can help determine exactly why a link edit is failing due to multi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ply&nbsp;multiply</font>
              ply defined symbols.

       <b>-u</b> <u>sym</u> Enter the argument <u>sym</u> into the symbol table as an undefined symbol.  This is useful for load-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;loading</font>
              ing  wholly from a library, since initially the symbol table is empty and an unresolved refer-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ence&nbsp;reference</font>
              ence is needed to force the loading of the first object file.

       <b>-e</b> <u>sym</u> The argument <u>sym</u> is taken to be the symbol name of the entry point of the resulting file.   By
              default, the entry point is the address of the first section in the first segment.

       <b>-i</b><u>definition:indirect</u>
              Create  an  indirect  symbol for the symbol name <u>definition</u> which is defined to be the same as
              the symbol name <u>indirect</u> (which is taken to be undefined).  When a definition  of  the  symbol
              named <u>indirect</u> is linked, both symbols will take on the defined type and value.

              This  option  overlaps with a compiler option.  If you use the compiler driver <a href="cc.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/cc"><u>cc</u>(1)</a> to invoke
              <u>ld</u><b>_</b><u>classic</u>, invoke this option in this way: <b>-Wl,-i</b><u>definition:indirect.</u>


       <b>-undefined</b> <u>treatment</u>
              Specifies how undefined symbols are to be treated.  <u>treatment</u> can be: <u>error,</u> <u>warning,</u> or  <u>sup</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">press.&nbsp;suppress.</font>
              <u>press.</u>   Which  cause  the treatment of undefined symbols as either, errors, warnings, or sup-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">presses&nbsp;suppresses</font>
              presses the checking of undefined symbols.  The default  is  to  treat  undefined  symbols  as
              errors.   When the environment variable <b>MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET</b> is set to <b>10.3</b> or higher then
              <b>-undefined</b> <u>dynamic</u><b>_</b><u>lookup</u> can also be used to allow any undefined  symbols  to  be  looked  up
              dynamically at runtime.  Use of a binary built with this flag requires a system with a dynamic
              linker from Mac OS X 10.3 or later.  The flag <b>-undefined</b> <u>define</u><b>_</b><u>a</u><b>_</b><u>way</u>  can  also  be  used  to
              cause  the  static linker to create a private definition for all undefined symbols.  This flag
              should only be used if it is known that the undefined symbols are not referenced as any use of
              them may cause a crash.

       <b>-U</b> <u>sym</u> Allow the symbol <u>sym</u> to be undefined, even if the <b>-r</b> flag is not given.  Produce an executable
              file if the only undefined symbols are those specified with <b>-U.</b>

              This option overlaps with a compiler option.  If you use the compiler driver <a href="cc.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/cc"><u>cc</u>(1)</a>  to  invoke
              <u>ld</u><b>_</b><u>classic</u>, invoke this option in this way: <b>-Wl,-U,</b><u>sym.</u>

       <b>-bind_at_load</b>
              Causes  the output file to be marked such that the dynamic linker will bind all undefined ref-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">erences&nbsp;references</font>
              erences when the file is loaded or launched.


       The following flags are related to stripping link edit information.  This  information  can  also  be
       removed  by  <a href="strip.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/strip"><u>strip</u>(1)</a>, which uses the same options.  (The exception is the <b>-s</b> flag below, but this is
       the same as <a href="strip.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/strip"><u>strip</u>(1)</a> with no arguments.)  The following flags  are  listed  in  decreasing  level  of
       stripping.

       <b>-s</b>     Completely strip the output; that is, remove the symbol table and relocation information.

       <b>-x</b>     Strips the non-global symbols; only saves external symbols.

              This  option  overlaps with a compiler option.  If you use the compiler driver <a href="cc.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/cc"><u>cc</u>(1)</a> to invoke
              <u>ld</u><b>_</b><u>classic</u>, invoke this option in this way: <b>-Wl,-x.</b>

       <b>-S</b>     Strip debugging symbols; only save local and global symbols.

       <b>-X</b>     Strip local symbols whose names begin with `L'; save all other  symbols.   (The  compiler  and
              assembler  currently  strip these internally-generated labels by default, so they generally do
              not appear in object files seen by the link editor.)

       <b>-Sp</b>    Strip, edit and add debugging symbols so the debugger can used most of the  debugging  symbols
              from the object files.

       <b>-Si</b>    Strip duplicate debugging symbols from include files.  This is the default.

       <b>-b</b>     Strip  the  base file's symbols from the output file.  (The base file is given as the argument
              to the <b>-A</b> option.)

              This option overlaps with a compiler option.  If you use the compiler driver <a href="cc.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/cc"><u>cc</u>(1)</a>  to  invoke
              <u>ld</u><b>_</b><u>classic</u>, invoke this option in this way: <b>-Wl,-b.</b>

       <b>-Sn</b>    Don't strip any symbols.

       <b>-exported_symbols_list</b> <u>filename</u>
              The  specified  <u>filename</u> contains lists of global symbol names that will remain as global sym-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">bols&nbsp;symbols</font>
              bols in the output file.  All other global symbols will be treated as if they were  marked  as
              <b>__</b><u>private</u><b>_</b><u>extern</u><b>__</b> and will not be global in the output file. The symbol names listed in <u>file</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">name&nbsp;filename</font>
              <u>name</u> must be one per line. Leading and trailing white space are not part of the  symbol  name.
              Lines starting with # are ignored, as are lines with only white space.

       <b>-unexported_symbols_list</b> <u>filename</u>
              The  specified  <u>filename</u>  contains lists of global symbol names that will not remain as global
              symbols in the output file.  The symbols will be treated as if  they  were  marked  as  <b>__</b><u>pri</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">vate_extern__&nbsp;__private_extern__</font>
              <u>vate</u><b>_</b><u>extern</u><b>__</b>  and  will not be global in the output file. The symbol names listed in <u>filename</u>
              must be one per line. Leading and trailing white space are not part of the symbol name.  Lines
              starting with # are ignored, as are lines with only white space.

       <b>-no_uuid</b>
              Do not emit an LC_UUID load command in the linked output file.


       <b>-dead_strip</b>
              Remove blocks of code and data that are unreachable by the entry point or exported symbols.

       <b>-no_dead_strip_inits_and_terms</b>
              When  specified along with <b>-dead_strip</b> cause all constructors and destructors to never be dead
              stripped.


       The remaining options are infrequently used:

       <b>-v</b>     Print the version of the linker.

       <b>-w</b>     Suppresses all warning messages.

       <b>-no_arch_warnings</b>
              Suppresses warning messages about files that have the wrong architecture for the <b>-arch</b> flag.

       <b>-arch_errors_fatal</b>
              Cause the errors having to do with files that have the wrong architecture to be fatal and stop
              the link editor.

       <b>-M</b>     Produce  a  load  map,  listing  all the segments and sections.  The list includes the address
              where each input file's section appears in the output file, as well as the section's size.

              This option overlaps with a compiler option.  If you use the compiler driver <a href="cc.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/cc"><u>cc</u>(1)</a>  to  invoke
              <u>ld</u><b>_</b><u>classic</u>, invoke this option in this way: <b>-Wl,-M.</b>

       <b>-whatsloaded</b>
              Display  a  single line listing each object file that is loaded.  Names of objects in archives
              have the form libfoo.a(bar.o).

       <b>-filelist</b> <u>listfile[,dirname]</u>
              Specifies that the linker should link the files listed in <u>listfile</u> <u>.</u>  This is  an  alternative
              to  listing  the  files  on the command line. The file names are listed one per line separated
              only by newlines. (Spaces and tabs are assumed to be part of the file name.)  If the  optional
              directory name, <u>dirname</u> is specified, it is prepended to each name in the list file.

       <b>-headerpad</b> <u>value</u>
              Specifies  the  minimum  amount  of space ("padding") following the headers for the MH_EXECUTE
              format and all output file types with the dynamic linker.   <u>value</u>  is  a  hexadecimal  number.
              When  a segment's size is rounded up to the segment alignment, there is extra space left over,
              which is placed between the headers and the sections, rather than at the end of  the  segment.
              The  <b>headerpad</b>  option  specifies the minimum size of this padding, which can be useful if the
              headers will be altered later.  The default value is the larger of 2 * sizeof(struct  section)
              so  the program /usr/bin/objcunique can always add two section headers, or if the output is an
              MH_EXECUTE filetype and <b>-prebind</b> is specified 3 times the size of the  LC_PREBOUND_DYLIB  load
              commands.   The  actual  amount  of  pad will be as large as the amount of the first segment's
              round-off.  (That is, take the total size of the first segments' headers and non-zerofill sec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tions,&nbsp;sections,</font>
              tions, round this size up to the segment alignment, and use the difference between the rounded
              and unrounded sizes as the minimum amount of padding.)

       <b>-headerpad_max_install_names</b>
              Add to the header padding enough space to allow changing  all  dynamic  shared  library  paths
              recorded in the output file to be changed to MAXPATHLEN in length.

       <b>-t</b>     Trace  the  progress of the link editor; display the name of each file that is loaded as it is
              processed in the first and second pass of the link editor.

       <b>-A</b> <u>basefile</u>
              Incremental loading: linking is to be done in a manner that lets the resulting object be  read
              into  an already executing program, the <u>basefile</u>.  <u>basefile</u> is the name of a file whose symbol
              table will be taken as a basis on which to define additional symbols.  Only newly linked mate-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rial&nbsp;material</font>
              rial  will  be entered into the <b>a.out</b> file, but the new symbol table will reflect every symbol
              defined in the base file and the newly linked files.  <!-- a -->Option(s)<!-- /a --> to specify  the  addresses  of
              the  segments are typically needed, since the default addresses tend to overlap with the <u>base</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">file.&nbsp;basefile.</font>
              <u>file.</u>  The default format of the object file is MH_OBJECT.  Note: It is  strongly  recommended
              that  this  option NOT be used, because the dyld package described in <a href="../man3/dyld.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/dyld"><u>dyld</u>(3)</a> is a much easier
              alternative.

       <b>-dylib_install_name</b> <u>name</u>
              For dynamic shared library files, specifies the name of the file the library will be installed
              in  for  programs  that  use  it.  If this is not specified, the name specified in the <b>-o</b> <u>name</u>
              option will be used.  This option is used as the <a href="libtool.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/libtool"><u>libtool</u>(1)</a> <b>-install_name</b> <u>name</u> option when its
              <b>-dynamic</b> option is specified.

       <b>-umbrella</b> <u>framework</u><b>_</b><u>name</u>
              Specifies  this  is  a subframework where <u>framework</u><b>_</b><u>name</u> is the name of the umbrella framework
              this subframework is a part of.  Where <u>framework</u><b>_</b><u>name</u> is the  same  as  the  argument  to  the
              <b>-framework</b> <u>framework</u><b>_</b><u>name</u> option.  This subframework can then only be linked into the umbrella
              framework with the same <u>framework</u><b>_</b><u>name</u> or another subframework with the same  umbrella  frame-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">work&nbsp;framework</font>
              work  name.  Any other attempt to statically link this subframework directly will result in an
              error stating to link with the umbrella framework instead.  When building the umbrella  frame-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">work&nbsp;framework</font>
              work that uses this subframework no additional options are required.  However the install name
              of the umbrella framework, required to be specified with <b>-dylib_install_name</b>,  must  have  the
              proper format for an install name of a framework for the <u>framework</u><b>_</b><u>name</u> of the umbrella frame-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">work&nbsp;framework</font>
              work to be determined.

       <b>-allowable_client</b> <u>client</u><b>_</b><u>name</u>
              Specifies that for this subframework the <u>client</u><b>_</b><u>name</u> can link with this  subframework  without
              error  even though it is not part of the umbrella framework that this subframework is part of.
              The <u>client</u><b>_</b><u>name</u> can be another framework name or a name used by bundles (see the  <b>-client_name</b>
              <u>client</u><b>_</b><u>name</u> option below).

       <b>-client_name</b> <u>client</u><b>_</b><u>name</u>
              Specifies  the <u>client</u><b>_</b><u>name</u> of a bundle for checking of allowable clients of subframeworks (see
              the <b>-allowable_client</b> <u>client</u><b>_</b><u>name</u> option above).

       <b>-sub_umbrella</b> <u>framework</u><b>_</b><u>name</u>
              Specifies that the <u>framework</u><b>_</b><u>name</u> being linked by a dynamic library is to be treated as one of
              the subframeworks with respect to twolevel namespace.

       <b>-sub_library</b> <u>library</u><b>_</b><u>name</u>
              Specifies  that  the <u>library</u><b>_</b><u>name</u> being linked by a dynamic library is to be treated as one of
              the sublibraries with respect  to  twolevel  namespace.   For  example  the  <u>library</u><b>_</b><u>name</u>  for
              <u>/usr/lib/libobjc</u><b>_</b><u>profile.A.dylib</u> would be <u>libobjc.</u>

       <b>-init</b> <u>sym</u>
              The  argument  <u>sym</u> is taken to be the symbol name of the dynamic shared library initialization
              routine.  If any module is used from the dynamic library the library initialization routine is
              called  before  any  symbol  is  used  from the library including C++ static initializers (and
              #pragma CALL_ON_LOAD routines).

       <b>-run_init_lazily</b>
              This option is obsolete.

       <b>-dylib_compatibility_version</b> <u>number</u>
              For dynamic shared library files, this specifies  the  compatibility  version  number  of  the
              library.  When a library is used by a program, the compatibility version is checked and if the
              program's version is greater that the library's version, it is an error.  The format of <u>number</u>
              is  <u>X[.Y[.Z]]</u>  where  <u>X</u> must be a positive non-zero number less than or equal to 65535, and <u>.Y</u>
              and <u>.Z</u> are optional and if present must be non-negative numbers less than or equal to 255.  If
              the compatibility version number is not specified, it has a value of 0 and no checking is done
              when the library is used.  This option is used as the <a href="libtool.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/libtool"><u>libtool</u>(1)</a> <b>-compatibility_version</b> <u>number</u>
              option when its <b>-dynamic</b> option is set.

       <b>-dylib_current_version</b> <u>number</u>
              For  dynamic  shared  library files, specifies the current version number of the library.  The
              current version of the library can be obtained programmatically by the user of the library  so
              it  can  determine  exactly which version of the library it is using.  The format of <u>number</u> is
              <u>X[.Y[.Z]]</u> where <u>X</u> must be a positive non-zero number less than or equal to 65535, and  <u>.Y</u>  and
              <u>.Z</u> are optional and if present must be non-negative numbers less than or equal to 255.  If the
              version number is not specified, it has a value of 0.  This option is used as  the  <a href="libtool.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/libtool"><u>libtool</u>(1)</a>
              <b>-current_version</b> <u>number</u> option when its <b>-dynamic</b> option is set.

       <b>-single_module</b>
              When building a dynamic library build the library so that it contains only one module.

       <b>-multi_module</b>
              When  building  a  dynamic  library  build the library so that it contains one module for each
              object file linked in.  This is the default.

       <b>-dylinker_install_name</b> <u>name</u>
              For dynamic link editor files, specifies the name of the file the dynamic link editor will  be
              installed in for programs that use it.

       <b>-macosx_version_min</b> <u>version</u>
              This  overrides  the  <b>MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET</b> environment variable (see below).  Unlike other
              linker options, this one may be specified multiple times; only the last occurrence  is  effec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tive.&nbsp;effective.</font>
              tive.

       The  following environment variable is used to control the use of incompatible features in the output
       with respect to Mac OS X releases.

       <b>MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET</b>
              This is set to indicate the oldest Mac OS X version that that the output is  to  be  used  on.
              When  this is set to a release that is older than the current release features that are incom-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">patible&nbsp;incompatible</font>
              patible with that release will be disabled.  If a feature is seen in the input that  can't  be
              in  the output due to this setting a warning is issued.  The current allowable values for this
              are <b>10.1,</b> <b>10.2</b> <b>10.3,</b> and <b>10.4</b> with the default being <b>10.4</b> for the i386 architecture  and  <b>10.1</b>
              for all other architectures.

       The following environment variables are used by Apple's Build and Integration team:

       <b>LD_TRACE_ARCHIVES</b>
              When  this  is  set  it  causes a message of the form ``[Logging for XBS] Used static archive:
              <u>filename''</u> for each static archive that has members linked into the output.

       <b>LD_TRACE_DYLIBS</b>
              When this is set it causes a message of the form ``[Logging for  XBS]  Used  dynamic  library:
              <u>filename''</u> for each dynamic library linked into the output.

       <b>RC_TRACE_PREBINDING_DISABLED</b>
              When  this  is  set it causes a message of the form ``[Logging for XBS prebinding disabled for
              <u>filename</u> because <u>reason''.</u>  Where <u>filename</u> is the value of the <b>-final_output</b> argument if spec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ified&nbsp;specified</font>
              ified or the value of the <b>-o</b> argument.

       <b>-final_output</b> <u>filename</u>
              The argument <u>filename</u> is used in the above message when RC_TRACE_PREBINDING_DISABLED is set.

       <b>LD_TRACE_FILE</b>
              When  this  is  set,  messages  displayed due to the <b>LD_TRACE_ARCHIVES</b> , <b>LD_TRACE_DYLIBS</b> , and
              <b>LD_TRACE_PREBINDING_DISABLED</b> environment variables are printed to the file whose path is spec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ified&nbsp;specified</font>
              ified by this variable instead of stdout.

       <b>LD_SPLITSEGS_NEW_LIBRARIES</b>
              When  set  and  <b>MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET</b> is set to 10.4 or greater and the output is a dynamic
              library, and if the install name of the library is not listed the segment address  table,  and
              if  the  environment  variable  <b>LD_UNPREBOUND_LIBRARIES</b> is set with a file name with a list of
              library install names and the install name is not listed, then this is built as a split shared
              library.


       Options available in early versions of the Mach-O link editor may no longer be supported.
