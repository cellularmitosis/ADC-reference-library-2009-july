GCC(1)                                               GNU                                              <!-- a -->GCC(1)<!-- /a -->



<b>NAME</b>
       gcc - GNU project C and C++ compiler

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       gcc [<b>-c</b>|<b>-S</b>|<b>-E</b>] [<b>-std=</b><u>standard</u>]
           [<b>-g</b>] [<b>-pg</b>] [<b>-O</b><u>level</u>]
           [<b>-W</b><u>warn</u>...] [<b>-pedantic</b>]
           [<b>-I</b><u>dir</u>...] [<b>-L</b><u>dir</u>...]
           [<b>-D</b><u>macro</u>[=<u>defn</u>]...] [<b>-U</b><u>macro</u>]
           [<b>-f</b><u>option</u>...] [<b>-m</b><u>machine-option</u>...]
           [<b>-o</b> <u>outfile</u>] <u>infile</u>...

       Only the most useful options are listed here; see below for the remainder.  <b>g++</b> accepts mostly the
       same options as <b>gcc</b>.

       In Apple's version of GCC, both <b>cc</b> and <b>gcc</b> are actually symbolic links to a compiler named like
       gcc-<u>version</u>; which compiler is linked to may be changed using the command <b>gcc_select</b>.  Similarly, <b>c++</b>
       and <b>g++</b> are links to a compiler named like g++-<u>version</u>.

       Note that Apple's GCC includes a number of extensions to standard GCC (flagged below with ``APPLE
       ONLY''), and that not all generic GCC options are available or supported on Darwin / Mac OS X.  In
       particular, Apple does not currently support the compilation of Fortran, Ada, or Java, although there
       are third parties who have made these work.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       When you invoke GCC, it normally does preprocessing, compilation, assembly and linking.  The
       ``overall options'' allow you to stop this process at an intermediate stage.  For example, the <b>-c</b>
       option says not to run the linker.  Then the output consists of object files output by the assembler.

       Other options are passed on to one stage of processing.  Some options control the preprocessor and
       others the compiler itself.  Yet other options control the assembler and linker; most of these are
       not documented here, since you rarely need to use any of them.

       Most of the command line options that you can use with GCC are useful for C programs; when an option
       is only useful with another language (usually C++), the explanation says so explicitly.  If the
       description for a particular option does not mention a source language, you can use that option with
       all supported languages.

       The <b>gcc</b> program accepts options and file names as operands.  Many options have multi-letter names;
       therefore multiple single-letter options may <u>not</u> be grouped: <b>-dr</b> is very different from <b>-d</b> <b>-r</b>.

       You can mix options and other arguments.  For the most part, the order you use doesn't matter.  Order
       does matter when you use several options of the same kind; for example, if you specify <b>-L</b> more than
       once, the directories are searched in the order specified.

       Many options have long names starting with <b>-f</b> or with <b>-W</b>---for example, <b>-fforce-mem</b>,
       <b>-fstrength-reduce</b>, <b>-Wformat</b> and so on.  Most of these have both positive and negative forms; the
       negative form of <b>-ffoo</b> would be <b>-fno-foo</b>.  This manual documents only one of these two forms,
       whichever one is not the default.

       <b>Options</b> <b>Controlling</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>Output</b>

       Compilation can involve up to four stages: preprocessing, compilation proper, assembly and linking,
       always in that order.  GCC is capable of preprocessing and compiling several files either into
       several assembler input files, or into one assembler input file; then each assembler input file
       produces an object file, and linking combines all the object files (those newly compiled, and those
       specified as input) into an executable file.

       For any given input file, the file name suffix determines what kind of compilation is done:

       <u>file</u><b>.c</b>
           C source code which must be preprocessed.

       <u>file</u><b>.i</b>
           C source code which should not be preprocessed.

       <u>file</u><b>.ii</b>
           C++ source code which should not be preprocessed.

       <u>file</u><b>.m</b>
           Objective-C source code.  Note that you must link with the <u>libobjc</u> library to make an Objective-C
           program work.

       <u>file</u><b>.mi</b>
           Objective-C source code which should not be preprocessed.

       <u>file</u><b>.mm</b>
       <u>file</u><b>.M</b>
           Objective-C++ source code.  Note that you must link with the <u>libobjc</u> library to make an
           Objective-C++ program work.  Note that <b>.M</b> refers to a literal capital M.

       <u>file</u><b>.mii</b>
           Objective-C++ source code which should not be preprocessed.

       <u>file</u><b>.h</b>
           C, C++, Objective-C or Objective-C++ header file to be turned into a precompiled header.

       <u>file</u><b>.cc</b>
       <u>file</u><b>.cp</b>
       <u>file</u><b>.cxx</b>
       <u>file</u><b>.cpp</b>
       <u>file</u><b>.CPP</b>
       <u>file</u><b>.c++</b>
       <u>file</u><b>.C</b>
           C++ source code which must be preprocessed.  Note that in <b>.cxx</b>, the last two letters must both be
           literally <b>x</b>.  Likewise, <b>.C</b> refers to a literal capital C.

       <u>file</u><b>.mm</b>
       <u>file</u><b>.M</b>
           Objective-C++ source code which must be preprocessed.  (APPLE ONLY)

       <u>file</u><b>.mii</b>
           Objective-C++ source code which should not be preprocessed.  (APPLE ONLY)

       <u>file</u><b>.hh</b>
       <u>file</u><b>.H</b>
           C++ header file to be turned into a precompiled header.

       <u>file</u><b>.f</b>
       <u>file</u><b>.for</b>
       <u>file</u><b>.FOR</b>
           Fortran source code which should not be preprocessed.

       <u>file</u><b>.F</b>
       <u>file</u><b>.fpp</b>
       <u>file</u><b>.FPP</b>
           Fortran source code which must be preprocessed (with the traditional preprocessor).

       <u>file</u><b>.r</b>
           Fortran source code which must be preprocessed with a RATFOR preprocessor (not included with
           GCC).

       <u>file</u><b>.f90</b>
       <u>file</u><b>.f95</b>
           Fortran 90/95 source code which should not be preprocessed.

       <u>file</u><b>.ads</b>
           Ada source code file which contains a library unit declaration (a declaration of a package,
           subprogram, or generic, or a generic instantiation), or a library unit renaming declaration (a
           package, generic, or subprogram renaming declaration).  Such files are also called <u>specs</u>.

       <u>file</u><b>.adb</b>
           Ada source code file containing a library unit body (a subprogram or package body).  Such files
           are also called <u>bodies</u>.

       <u>file</u><b>.s</b>
           Assembler code.  Apple's version of GCC runs the preprocessor on these files as well as those
           ending in <b>.S</b>.

       <u>file</u><b>.S</b>
           Assembler code which must be preprocessed.

       <u>other</u>
           An object file to be fed straight into linking.  Any file name with no recognized suffix is
           treated this way.

       You can specify the input language explicitly with the <b>-x</b> option:

       <b>-x</b> <u>language</u>
           Specify explicitly the <u>language</u> for the following input files (rather than letting the compiler
           choose a default based on the file name suffix).  This option applies to all following input
           files until the next <b>-x</b> option.  Possible values for <u>language</u> are:

                   c  c-header  c-cpp-output
                   c++  c++-header  c++-cpp-output
                   objective-c  objective-c-header  objective-c-cpp-output
                   objective-c++ objective-c++-header objective-c++-cpp-output
                   assembler  assembler-with-cpp
                   ada
                   f77  f77-cpp-input  ratfor
                   f95
                   java
                   treelang

       <b>-x</b> <b>none</b>
           Turn off any specification of a language, so that subsequent files are handled according to their
           file name suffixes (as they are if <b>-x</b> has not been used at all).

       <b>-ObjC</b>
       <b>-ObjC++</b>
           These are similar in effect to <b>-x</b> <b>objective-c</b> and <b>-x</b> <b>objective-c++</b>, but affect only the choice of
           compiler for files already identified as source files.  (APPLE ONLY)

       <b>-arch</b> <u>arch</u>
           Compile for the specified target architecture <u>arch</u>.  The allowable values are <b>i386</b>, <b>ppc</b> and
           <b>ppc64</b>.  Multiple options work, and direct the compiler to produce ``universal'' binaries
           including object code for each architecture specified with <b>-arch</b>.  This option only works if
           assembler and libraries are available for each architecture specified.  (APPLE ONLY)

       <b>-fsave-repository=</b><u>file</u>
           Save debug info in separate object file.  This is available only while building PCH in -gfull
           mode.

       <b>-pass-exit-codes</b>
           Normally the <b>gcc</b> program will exit with the code of 1 if any phase of the compiler returns a non-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">success&nbsp;nonsuccess</font>
           success return code.  If you specify <b>-pass-exit-codes</b>, the <b>gcc</b> program will instead return with
           numerically highest error produced by any phase that returned an error indication.

       If you only want some of the stages of compilation, you can use <b>-x</b> (or filename suffixes) to tell <b>gcc</b>
       where to start, and one of the options <b>-c</b>, <b>-S</b>, or <b>-E</b> to say where <b>gcc</b> is to stop.  Note that some
       combinations (for example, <b>-x</b> <b>cpp-output</b> <b>-E</b>) instruct <b>gcc</b> to do nothing at all.

       <b>-c</b>  Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link.  The linking stage simply is not done.
           The ultimate output is in the form of an object file for each source file.

           By default, the object file name for a source file is made by replacing the suffix <b>.c</b>, <b>.i</b>, <b>.s</b>,
           etc., with <b>.o</b>.

           Unrecognized input files, not requiring compilation or assembly, are ignored.

       <b>-S</b>  Stop after the stage of compilation proper; do not assemble.  The output is in the form of an
           assembler code file for each non-assembler input file specified.

           By default, the assembler file name for a source file is made by replacing the suffix <b>.c</b>, <b>.i</b>,
           etc., with <b>.s</b>.

           Input files that don't require compilation are ignored.

       <b>-E</b>  Stop after the preprocessing stage; do not run the compiler proper.  The output is in the form of
           preprocessed source code, which is sent to the standard output.

           Input files which don't require preprocessing are ignored.

       <b>-o</b> <u>file</u>
           Place output in file <u>file</u>.  This applies regardless to whatever sort of output is being produced,
           whether it be an executable file, an object file, an assembler file or preprocessed C code.

           If <b>-o</b> is not specified, the default is to put an executable file in <u>a.out</u>, the object file for
           <u>source.suffix</u> in <u>source.o</u>, its assembler file in <u>source.s</u>, a precompiled header file in
           <u>source.suffix.gch</u>, and all preprocessed C source on standard output.

       <b>-v</b>  Print (on standard error output) the commands executed to run the stages of compilation.  Also
           print the version number of the compiler driver program and of the preprocessor and the compiler
           proper.

       <b>-###</b>
           Like <b>-v</b> except the commands are not executed and all command arguments are quoted.  This is
           useful for shell scripts to capture the driver-generated command lines.

       <b>-pipe</b>
           Use pipes rather than temporary files for communication between the various stages of
           compilation.  This fails to work on some systems where the assembler is unable to read from a
           pipe; but the GNU assembler has no trouble.

       <b>-combine</b>
           If you are compiling multiple source files, this option tells the driver to pass all the source
           files to the compiler at once (for those languages for which the compiler can handle this).  This
           will allow intermodule analysis (IMA) to be performed by the compiler.  Currently the only
           language for which this is supported is C.  If you pass source files for multiple languages to
           the driver, using this option, the driver will invoke the <!-- a -->compiler(s)<!-- /a --> that support IMA once each,
           passing each compiler all the source files appropriate for it.  For those languages that do not
           support IMA this option will be ignored, and the compiler will be invoked once for each source
           file in that language.  If you use this option in conjunction with <b>-save-temps</b>, the compiler will
           generate multiple pre-processed files (one for each source file), but only one (combined) <u>.o</u> or
           <u>.s</u> file.

       <b>--help</b>
           Print (on the standard output) a description of the command line options understood by <b>gcc</b>.  If
           the <b>-v</b> option is also specified then <b>--help</b> will also be passed on to the various processes
           invoked by <b>gcc</b>, so that they can display the command line options they accept.  If the <b>-Wextra</b>
           option is also specified then command line options which have no documentation associated with
           them will also be displayed.

       <b>--target-help</b>
           Print (on the standard output) a description of target specific command line options for each
           tool.

       <b>--version</b>
           Display the version number and copyrights of the invoked GCC.

       <b>Compiling</b> <b>C++</b> <b>Programs</b>

       C++ source files conventionally use one of the suffixes <b>.C</b>, <b>.cc</b>, <b>.cpp</b>, <b>.CPP</b>, <b>.c++</b>, <b>.cp</b>, or <b>.cxx</b>; C++
       header files often use <b>.hh</b> or <b>.H</b>; and preprocessed C++ files use the suffix <b>.ii</b>.  GCC recognizes
       files with these names and compiles them as C++ programs even if you call the compiler the same way
       as for compiling C programs (usually with the name <b>gcc</b>).

       However, the use of <b>gcc</b> does not add the C++ library.  <b>g++</b> is a program that calls GCC and treats <b>.c</b>,
       <b>.h</b> and <b>.i</b> files as C++ source files instead of C source files unless <b>-x</b> is used, and automatically
       specifies linking against the C++ library.  This is also useful when precompiling a C header file
       with a <b>.h</b> extension for use in C++ compilations.  On many systems, <b>g++</b> is also installed with the
       name <b>c++</b>.

       When you compile C++ programs, you may specify many of the same command-line options that you use for
       compiling programs in any language; or command-line options meaningful for C and related languages;
       or options that are meaningful only for C++ programs.

       <b>Options</b> <b>Controlling</b> <b>C</b> <b>Dialect</b>

       The following options control the dialect of C (or languages derived from C, such as C++, Objective-C
       and Objective-C++) that the compiler accepts:

       <b>-ansi</b>
           In C mode, support all ISO C90 programs.  In C++ mode, remove GNU extensions that conflict with
           ISO C++.

           This turns off certain features of GCC that are incompatible with ISO C90 (when compiling C
           code), or of standard C++ (when compiling C++ code), such as the "asm" and "typeof" keywords, and
           predefined macros such as "unix" and "vax" that identify the type of system you are using.  It
           also enables the undesirable and rarely used ISO trigraph feature.  For the C compiler, it
           disables recognition of C++ style <b>//</b> comments as well as the "inline" keyword.

           The alternate keywords "__asm__", "__extension__", "__inline__" and "__typeof__" continue to work
           despite <b>-ansi</b>.  You would not want to use them in an ISO C program, of course, but it is useful
           to put them in header files that might be included in compilations done with <b>-ansi</b>.  Alternate
           predefined macros such as "__unix__" and "__vax__" are also available, with or without <b>-ansi</b>.

           The <b>-ansi</b> option does not cause non-ISO programs to be rejected gratuitously.  For that,
           <b>-pedantic</b> is required in addition to <b>-ansi</b>.

           The macro "__STRICT_ANSI__" is predefined when the <b>-ansi</b> option is used.  Some header files may
           notice this macro and refrain from declaring certain functions or defining certain macros that
           the ISO standard doesn't call for; this is to avoid interfering with any programs that might use
           these names for other things.

           Functions which would normally be built in but do not have semantics defined by ISO C (such as
           "alloca" and "ffs") are not built-in functions with <b>-ansi</b> is used.

       <b>-std=</b>
           Determine the language standard.  This option is currently only supported when compiling C or
           C++.  A value for this option must be provided; possible values are

           <b>c89</b>
           <b>iso9899:1990</b>
               ISO C90 (same as <b>-ansi</b>).

           <b>iso9899:199409</b>
               ISO C90 as modified in amendment 1.

           <b>c99</b>
           <b>c9x</b>
           <b>iso9899:1999</b>
           <b>iso9899:199x</b>
               ISO C99.  Note that this standard is not yet fully supported; see
               &lt;<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.0/c99status.html"><b>http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.0/c99status.html</b></a><b></b> for more information.  The names <b>c9x</b> and
               <b>iso9899:199x</b> are deprecated.

           <b>gnu89</b>
               Default, ISO C90 plus GNU extensions (including some C99 features).

           <b>gnu99</b>
           <b>gnu9x</b>
               ISO C99 plus GNU extensions.  When ISO C99 is fully implemented in GCC, this will become the
               default.  The name <b>gnu9x</b> is deprecated.

           <b>c++98</b>
               The 1998 ISO C++ standard plus amendments.

           <b>gnu++98</b>
               The same as <b>-std=c++98</b> plus GNU extensions.  This is the default for C++ code.

           Even when this option is not specified, you can still use some of the features of newer standards
           in so far as they do not conflict with previous C standards.  For example, you may use
           "__restrict__" even when <b>-std=c99</b> is not specified.

           The <b>-std</b> options specifying some version of ISO C have the same effects as <b>-ansi</b>, except that
           features that were not in ISO C90 but are in the specified version (for example, <b>//</b> comments and
           the "inline" keyword in ISO C99) are not disabled.

       <b>-aux-info</b> <u>filename</u>
           Output to the given filename prototyped declarations for all functions declared and/or defined in
           a translation unit, including those in header files.  This option is silently ignored in any
           language other than C.

           Besides declarations, the file indicates, in comments, the origin of each declaration (source
           file and line), whether the declaration was implicit, prototyped or unprototyped (<b>I</b>, <b>N</b> for new or
           <b>O</b> for old, respectively, in the first character after the line number and the colon), and whether
           it came from a declaration or a definition (<b>C</b> or <b>F</b>, respectively, in the following character).
           In the case of function definitions, a K&amp;R-style list of arguments followed by their declarations
           is also provided, inside comments, after the declaration.

       <b>-faltivec</b>
           This flag is provided for compatibility with Metrowerks CodeWarrior and MrC compilers as well as
           previous Apple versions of GCC.  It causes the <b>-mpim-altivec</b> option to be turned on.

       <b>-fasm-blocks</b>
           Enable the use of blocks and entire functions of assembly code within a C or C++ file.  The
           syntax follows that used in CodeWarrior. (APPLE ONLY)

       <b>-fno-asm</b>
           Do not recognize "asm", "inline" or "typeof" as a keyword, so that code can use these words as
           identifiers.  You can use the keywords "__asm__", "__inline__" and "__typeof__" instead.  <b>-ansi</b>
           implies <b>-fno-asm</b>.

           In C++, this switch only affects the "typeof" keyword, since "asm" and "inline" are standard
           keywords.  You may want to use the <b>-fno-gnu-keywords</b> flag instead, which has the same effect.  In
           C99 mode (<b>-std=c99</b> or <b>-std=gnu99</b>), this switch only affects the "asm" and "typeof" keywords,
           since "inline" is a standard keyword in ISO C99.

       <b>-fno-builtin</b>
       <b>-fno-builtin-</b><u>function</u>
           Don't recognize built-in functions that do not begin with <b>__builtin_</b> as prefix.

           GCC normally generates special code to handle certain built-in functions more efficiently; for
           instance, calls to "alloca" may become single instructions that adjust the stack directly, and
           calls to "memcpy" may become inline copy loops.  The resulting code is often both smaller and
           faster, but since the function calls no longer appear as such, you cannot set a breakpoint on
           those calls, nor can you change the behavior of the functions by linking with a different
           library.  In addition, when a function is recognized as a built-in function, GCC may use
           information about that function to warn about problems with calls to that function, or to
           generate more efficient code, even if the resulting code still contains calls to that function.
           For example, warnings are given with <b>-Wformat</b> for bad calls to "printf", when "printf" is built
           in, and "strlen" is known not to modify global memory.

           With the <b>-fno-builtin-</b><u>function</u> option only the built-in function <u>function</u> is disabled.  <u>function</u>
           must not begin with <b>__builtin_</b>.  If a function is named this is not built-in in this version of
           GCC, this option is ignored.  There is no corresponding <b>-fbuiltin-</b><u>function</u> option; if you wish to
           enable built-in functions selectively when using <b>-fno-builtin</b> or <b>-ffreestanding</b>, you may define
           macros such as:

                   #define <!-- a -->abs(n)<!-- /a -->          __builtin_abs ((n))
                   #define strcpy(d, s)    __builtin_strcpy ((d), (s))

       <b>-fhosted</b>
           Assert that compilation takes place in a hosted environment.  This implies <b>-fbuiltin</b>.  A hosted
           environment is one in which the entire standard library is available, and in which "main" has a
           return type of "int".  Examples are nearly everything except a kernel.  This is equivalent to
           <b>-fno-freestanding</b>.

       <b>-ffreestanding</b>
           Assert that compilation takes place in a freestanding environment.  This implies <b>-fno-builtin</b>.  A
           freestanding environment is one in which the standard library may not exist, and program startup
           may not necessarily be at "main".  The most obvious example is an OS kernel.  This is equivalent
           to <b>-fno-hosted</b>.

       <b>-fms-extensions</b>
           Accept some non-standard constructs used in Microsoft header files.

           Some cases of unnamed fields in structures and unions are only accepted with this option.

       <b>-trigraphs</b>
           Support ISO C trigraphs.  The <b>-ansi</b> option (and <b>-std</b> options for strict ISO C conformance)
           implies <b>-trigraphs</b>.

       <b>-no-integrated-cpp</b>
           Performs a compilation in two passes: preprocessing and compiling.  This option allows a user
           supplied "cc1", "cc1plus", or "cc1obj" via the <b>-B</b> option.  The user supplied compilation step can
           then add in an additional preprocessing step after normal preprocessing but before compiling.
           The default is to use the integrated cpp (internal cpp)

           The semantics of this option will change if "cc1", "cc1plus", and "cc1obj" are merged.

       <b>-traditional</b>
       <b>-traditional-cpp</b>
           Formerly, these options caused GCC to attempt to emulate a pre-standard C compiler.  They are now
           only supported with the <b>-E</b> switch.  The preprocessor continues to support a pre-standard mode.
           See the GNU CPP manual for details.

       <b>-fcond-mismatch</b>
           Allow conditional expressions with mismatched types in the second and third arguments.  The value
           of such an expression is void.  This option is not supported for C++.

       <b>-fno-nested-functions</b>
           Disable nested functions.  This option is not supported for C++ or Objective-C++.  On Darwin,
           nested functions are disabled by default.

       <b>-fpch-preprocess</b>
           Enable PCH processing even when <b>-E</b> or <b>-save-temps</b> is used.

       <b>-fnon-lvalue-assign</b>
           C and C++ forbid the use of casts and conditional expressions as lvalues, e.g.:

                   float *p, q, r;
                   ((int *)p)++;
                   (cond ? q : r) = 3.0;

           As a transitional measure, the Apple version of GCC 4.0 allows casts and conditional expressions
           to be used as lvalues in certain situations.  This is accomplished via the <b>-fnon-lvalue-assign</b>
           switch, which is on by default.  Whenever an lvalue cast or an lvalue conditional expression is
           encountered, the compiler will issue a deprecation warning and then rewrite the expression as
           follows:

                   (type)expr                ---becomes---&gt;      *(type *)&amp;expr
                   cond ? expr1 : expr2      ---becomes---&gt;      *(cond ? &amp;expr1 : &amp;expr2)

           To disallow lvalue casts and lvalue conditional expressions altogether, specify
           <b>-fno-non-lvalue-assign</b>; lvalue casts and lvalue conditional expressions will be disallowed in
           future versions of Apple's GCC.

       <b>-funsigned-char</b>
           Let the type "char" be unsigned, like "unsigned char".

           Each kind of machine has a default for what "char" should be.  It is either like "unsigned char"
           by default or like "signed char" by default.

           Ideally, a portable program should always use "signed char" or "unsigned char" when it depends on
           the signedness of an object.  But many programs have been written to use plain "char" and expect
           it to be signed, or expect it to be unsigned, depending on the machines they were written for.
           This option, and its inverse, let you make such a program work with the opposite default.

           The type "char" is always a distinct type from each of "signed char" or "unsigned char", even
           though its behavior is always just like one of those two.

       <b>-fsigned-char</b>
           Let the type "char" be signed, like "signed char".

           Note that this is equivalent to <b>-fno-unsigned-char</b>, which is the negative form of
           <b>-funsigned-char</b>.  Likewise, the option <b>-fno-signed-char</b> is equivalent to <b>-funsigned-char</b>.

       <b>-fsigned-bitfields</b>
       <b>-funsigned-bitfields</b>
       <b>-fno-signed-bitfields</b>
       <b>-fno-unsigned-bitfields</b>
           These options control whether a bit-field is signed or unsigned, when the declaration does not
           use either "signed" or "unsigned".  By default, such a bit-field is signed, because this is
           consistent: the basic integer types such as "int" are signed types.

       <b>-fconstant-cfstrings</b>
           Enable the automatic creation of a CoreFoundation-type constant string whenever a special builtin
           "__builtin__CFStringMakeConstantString" is called on a literal string.  (APPLE ONLY)

       <b>-fpascal-strings</b>
           Allow Pascal-style string literals to be constructed.  (APPLE ONLY)

       <b>-fwritable-strings</b>
           Store string constants in the writable data segment and don't uniquize them.  This is for
           compatibility with old programs which assume they can write into string constants.

           Writing into string constants is a very bad idea; ``constants'' should be constant.

           This option is deprecated.

       <b>Options</b> <b>Controlling</b> <b>C++</b> <b>Dialect</b>

       This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful for C++ programs; but you
       can also use most of the GNU compiler options regardless of what language your program is in.  For
       example, you might compile a file "firstClass.C" like this:

               g++ -g -frepo -O -c firstClass.C

       In this example, only <b>-frepo</b> is an option meant only for C++ programs; you can use the other options
       with any language supported by GCC.

       Here is a list of options that are <u>only</u> for compiling C++ programs:

       <b>-fabi-version=</b><u>n</u>
           Use version <u>n</u> of the C++ ABI.  Version 2 is the version of the C++ ABI that first appeared in G++
           3.4.  Version 1 is the version of the C++ ABI that first appeared in G++ 3.2.  Version 0 will
           always be the version that conforms most closely to the C++ ABI specification.  Therefore, the
           ABI obtained using version 0 will change as ABI bugs are fixed.

           The default is version 2.

       <b>-fno-access-control</b>
           Turn off all access checking.  This switch is mainly useful for working around bugs in the access
           control code.

       <b>-fcheck-new</b>
           Check that the pointer returned by "operator new" is non-null before attempting to modify the
           storage allocated.  This check is normally unnecessary because the C++ standard specifies that
           "operator new" will only return 0 if it is declared <u></u><b><u>t</u></b><u></u><b><u>r</u></b><u></u><b><u>w</u></b><u></u><b><u>)</u></b>, in which case the compiler will
           always check the return value even without this option.  In all other cases, when "operator new"
           has a non-empty exception specification, memory exhaustion is signalled by throwing
           "std::bad_alloc".  See also <b>new</b> <b>(nothrow)</b>.

       <b>-fconserve-space</b>
           Put uninitialized or runtime-initialized global variables into the common segment, as C does.
           This saves space in the executable at the cost of not diagnosing duplicate definitions.  If you
           compile with this flag and your program mysteriously crashes after "main()" has completed, you
           may have an object that is being destroyed twice because two definitions were merged.

           This option is no longer useful on most targets, now that support has been added for putting
           variables into BSS without making them common.

       <b>-fno-const-strings</b>
           Give string constants type "char *" instead of type "const char *".  By default, G++ uses type
           "const char *" as required by the standard.  Even if you use <b>-fno-const-strings</b>, you cannot
           actually modify the value of a string constant, unless you also use <b>-fwritable-strings</b>.

           This option might be removed in a future release of G++.  For maximum portability, you should
           structure your code so that it works with string constants that have type "const char *".

       <b>-fno-elide-constructors</b>
           The C++ standard allows an implementation to omit creating a temporary which is only used to
           initialize another object of the same type.  Specifying this option disables that optimization,
           and forces G++ to call the copy constructor in all cases.

       <b>-fno-enforce-eh-specs</b>
           Don't check for violation of exception specifications at runtime.  This option violates the C++
           standard, but may be useful for reducing code size in production builds, much like defining
           <b>NDEBUG</b>.  The compiler will still optimize based on the exception specifications.

       <b>-ffor-scope</b>
       <b>-fno-for-scope</b>
           If <b>-ffor-scope</b> is specified, the scope of variables declared in a <u>for-init-statement</u> is limited
           to the <b>for</b> loop itself, as specified by the C++ standard.  If <b>-fno-for-scope</b> is specified, the
           scope of variables declared in a <u>for-init-statement</u> extends to the end of the enclosing scope, as
           was the case in old versions of G++, and other (traditional) implementations of C++.

           The default if neither flag is given to follow the standard, but to allow and give a warning for
           old-style code that would otherwise be invalid, or have different behavior.

       <b>-fno-gnu-keywords</b>
           Do not recognize "typeof" as a keyword, so that code can use this word as an identifier.  You can
           use the keyword "__typeof__" instead.  <b>-ansi</b> implies <b>-fno-gnu-keywords</b>.

       <b>-fno-implicit-templates</b>
           Never emit code for non-inline templates which are instantiated implicitly (i.e. by use); only
           emit code for explicit instantiations.

       <b>-fno-implicit-inline-templates</b>
           Don't emit code for implicit instantiations of inline templates, either.  The default is to
           handle inlines differently so that compiles with and without optimization will need the same set
           of explicit instantiations.

       <b>-fno-implement-inlines</b>
           To save space, do not emit out-of-line copies of inline functions controlled by <b>#pragma</b>
           <b>implementation</b>.  This will cause linker errors if these functions are not inlined everywhere they
           are called.

       <b>-fms-extensions</b>
           Disable pedantic warnings about constructs used in MFC, such as implicit int and getting a
           pointer to member function via non-standard syntax.

       <b>-fno-nonansi-builtins</b>
           Disable built-in declarations of functions that are not mandated by ANSI/ISO C.  These include
           "ffs", "alloca", "_exit", "index", "bzero", "conjf", and other related functions.

       <b>-fno-operator-names</b>
           Do not treat the operator name keywords "and", "bitand", "bitor", "compl", "not", "or" and "xor"
           as synonyms as keywords.

       <b>-fno-optional-diags</b>
           Disable diagnostics that the standard says a compiler does not need to issue.  Currently, the
           only such diagnostic issued by G++ is the one for a name having multiple meanings within a class.

       <b>-fpermissive</b>
           Downgrade some diagnostics about nonconformant code from errors to warnings.  Thus, using
           <b>-fpermissive</b> will allow some nonconforming code to compile.

       <b>-frepo</b>
           Enable automatic template instantiation at link time.  This option also implies
           <b>-fno-implicit-templates</b>.

       <b>-fno-rtti</b>
           Disable generation of information about every class with virtual functions for use by the C++
           runtime type identification features (<b>dynamic_cast</b> and <b>typeid</b>).  If you don't use those parts of
           the language, you can save some space by using this flag.  Note that exception handling uses the
           same information, but it will generate it as needed.

       <b>-fstats</b>
           Emit statistics about front-end processing at the end of the compilation.  This information is
           generally only useful to the G++ development team.

       <b>-ftemplate-depth-</b><u>n</u>
           Set the maximum instantiation depth for template classes to <u>n</u>.  A limit on the template
           instantiation depth is needed to detect endless recursions during template class instantiation.
           ANSI/ISO C++ conforming programs must not rely on a maximum depth greater than 17.

       <b>-fno-threadsafe-statics</b>
           Do not emit the extra code to use the routines specified in the C++ ABI for thread-safe
           initialization of local statics.  You can use this option to reduce code size slightly in code
           that doesn't need to be thread-safe.

       <b>-fuse-cxa-atexit</b>
           Register destructors for objects with static storage duration with the "__cxa_atexit" function
           rather than the "atexit" function.  This option is required for fully standards-compliant
           handling of static destructors, but will only work if your C library supports "__cxa_atexit".

       <b>-fno-use-cxa-get-exception-ptr</b>
           Don't use the "__cxa_get_exception_ptr" runtime routine.  This will cause
           "std::uncaught_exception" to be incorrect, but is necessary if the runtime routine is not
           available.

       <b>-fvisibility-inlines-hidden</b>
           This switch declares that the user does not attempt to compare pointers to inline methods where
           the addresses of the two functions were taken in different shared objects.

           The effect of this is that GCC may, effectively, mark inline methods with "__attribute__
           ((visibility ("hidden")))" so that they do not appear in the export table of a DSO and do not
           require a PLT indirection when used within the DSO.  Enabling this option can have a dramatic
           effect on load and link times of a DSO as it massively reduces the size of the dynamic export
           table when the library makes heavy use of templates.

           The behaviour of this switch is not quite the same as marking the methods as hidden directly.
           Normally if there is a class with default visibility which has a hidden method, the effect of
           this is that the method must be defined in only one shared object.  This switch does not have
           this restriction.

           You may mark a method as having a visibility explicitly to negate the effect of the switch for
           that method.  For example, if you do want to compare pointers to a particular inline method, you
           might mark it as having default visibility.

       <b>-fvisibility-ms-compat</b>
           This flag attempts to use visibility settings to make GCC's C++ linkage model compatible with
           that of Microsoft Visual Studio.

           The flag makes these changes to GCC's linkage model:

           1. It sets the default visibility to 'hidden', like <b>-fvisibility=hidden</b>.  2. Types, but not their
           members, are not hidden by default.  3. The One Definition Rule is relaxed for types without
           explicit visibility specifications which are defined in more than one different shared object:
           those declarations are permitted if they would have been permitted when this option was not used.

           This option is discouraged, rather, it is preferable for types to be explicitly exported as
           desired on a per-class basis.  Unfortunately because Visual Studio can't compare two different
           hidden types as unequal for the purposes of type_info and exception handling, users are able to
           write code that relies upon this behavior.

           Among the consequences of these changes are that static data members of the same type with the
           same name but defined in different shared objects will be different, so changing one will not
           change the other; and that pointers to function members defined in different shared objects will
           not compare equal.  When this flag is given, it is a violation of the ODR to define types with
           the same name differently.

       <b>-fno-weak</b>
           Do not use weak symbol support, even if it is provided by the linker.  By default, G++ will use
           weak symbols if they are available.  This option exists only for testing, and should not be used
           by end-users; it will result in inferior code and has no benefits.  This option may be removed in
           a future release of G++.

       <b>-nostdinc++</b>
           Do not search for header files in the standard directories specific to C++, but do still search
           the other standard directories.  (This option is used when building the C++ library.)

       In addition, these optimization, warning, and code generation options have meanings only for C++
       programs:

       <b>-fno-default-inline</b>
           Do not assume <b>inline</b> for functions defined inside a class scope.
             Note that these functions will have linkage like inline functions; they just won't be inlined
           by default.

       <b>-Wabi</b> (C++ only)
           Warn when G++ generates code that is probably not compatible with the vendor-neutral C++ ABI.
           Although an effort has been made to warn about all such cases, there are probably some cases that
           are not warned about, even though G++ is generating incompatible code.  There may also be cases
           where warnings are emitted even though the code that is generated will be compatible.

           You should rewrite your code to avoid these warnings if you are concerned about the fact that
           code generated by G++ may not be binary compatible with code generated by other compilers.

           The known incompatibilities at this point include:

              Incorrect handling of tail-padding for bit-fields.  G++ may attempt to pack data into the
               same byte as a base class.  For example:

                       struct A { virtual void f(); int f1 : 1; };
                       struct B : public A { int f2 : 1; };

               In this case, G++ will place "B::f2" into the same byte as"A::f1"; other compilers will not.
               You can avoid this problem by explicitly padding "A" so that its size is a multiple of the
               byte size on your platform; that will cause G++ and other compilers to layout "B"
               identically.

              Incorrect handling of tail-padding for virtual bases.  G++ does not use tail padding when
               laying out virtual bases.  For example:

                       struct A { virtual void f(); char c1; };
                       struct B { B(); char c2; };
                       struct C : public A, public virtual B {};

               In this case, G++ will not place "B" into the tail-padding for "A"; other compilers will.
               You can avoid this problem by explicitly padding "A" so that its size is a multiple of its
               alignment (ignoring virtual base classes); that will cause G++ and other compilers to layout
               "C" identically.

              Incorrect handling of bit-fields with declared widths greater than that of their underlying
               types, when the bit-fields appear in a union.  For example:

                       union U { int i : 4096; };

               Assuming that an "int" does not have 4096 bits, G++ will make the union too small by the
               number of bits in an "int".

              Empty classes can be placed at incorrect offsets.  For example:

                       struct A {};

                       struct B {
                         A a;
                         virtual void f ();
                       };

                       struct C : public B, public A {};

               G++ will place the "A" base class of "C" at a nonzero offset; it should be placed at offset
               zero.  G++ mistakenly believes that the "A" data member of "B" is already at offset zero.

              Names of template functions whose types involve "typename" or template template parameters
               can be mangled incorrectly.

                       template &lt;typename Q&gt;
                       void f(typename Q::X) {}

                       template &lt;template &lt;typename&gt; class Q&gt;
                       void f(typename Q&lt;int&gt;::X) {}

               Instantiations of these templates may be mangled incorrectly.

       <b>-Wctor-dtor-privacy</b> (C++ only)
           Warn when a class seems unusable because all the constructors or destructors in that class are
           private, and it has neither friends nor public static member functions.

       <b>-Wnon-virtual-dtor</b> (C++ only)
           Warn when a class appears to be polymorphic, thereby requiring a virtual destructor, yet it
           declares a non-virtual one.  This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wreorder</b> (C++ only)
           Warn when the order of member initializers given in the code does not match the order in which
           they must be executed.  For instance:

                   struct A {
                     int i;
                     int j;
                     A(): j (0), i (1) { }
                   };

           The compiler will rearrange the member initializers for <b>i</b> and <b>j</b> to match the declaration order of
           the members, emitting a warning to that effect.  This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       The following <b>-W...</b> options are not affected by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Weffc++</b> (C++ only)
           Warn about violations of the following style guidelines from Scott Meyers' <u>Effective</u> <u>C++</u> book:

              Item 11:  Define a copy constructor and an assignment operator for classes with dynamically
               allocated memory.

              Item 12:  Prefer initialization to assignment in constructors.

              Item 14:  Make destructors virtual in base classes.

              Item 15:  Have "operator=" return a reference to *this.

              Item 23:  Don't try to return a reference when you must return an object.

           Also warn about violations of the following style guidelines from Scott Meyers' <u>More</u> <u>Effective</u>
           <u>C++</u> book:

              Item 6:  Distinguish between prefix and postfix forms of increment and decrement operators.

              Item 7:  Never overload "&amp;&amp;", "||", or ",".

           When selecting this option, be aware that the standard library headers do not obey all of these
           guidelines; use <b>grep</b> <b>-v</b> to filter out those warnings.

       <b>-Wno-deprecated</b> (C++ only)
           Do not warn about usage of deprecated features.

       <b>-Wstrict-null-sentinel</b> (C++ only)
           Warn also about the use of an uncasted "NULL" as sentinel.  When compiling only with GCC this is
           a valid sentinel, as "NULL" is defined to "__null".  Although it is a null pointer constant not a
           null pointer, it is guaranteed to of the same size as a pointer.  But this use is not portable
           across different compilers.

       <b>-Wno-non-template-friend</b> (C++ only)
           Disable warnings when non-templatized friend functions are declared within a template.  Since the
           advent of explicit template specification support in G++, if the name of the friend is an
           unqualified-id (i.e., <b>friend</b> <b>foo(int)</b>), the C++ language specification demands that the friend
           declare or define an ordinary, nontemplate function.  (Section 14.5.3).  Before G++ implemented
           explicit specification, unqualified-ids could be interpreted as a particular specialization of a
           templatized function.  Because this non-conforming behavior is no longer the default behavior for
           G++, <b>-Wnon-template-friend</b> allows the compiler to check existing code for potential trouble spots
           and is on by default.  This new compiler behavior can be turned off with <b>-Wno-non-template-friend</b>
           which keeps the conformant compiler code but disables the helpful warning.

       <b>-Wold-style-cast</b> (C++ only)
           Warn if an old-style (C-style) cast to a non-void type is used within a C++ program.  The new-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">style&nbsp;newstyle</font>
           style casts (<b>static_cast</b>, <b>reinterpret_cast</b>, and <b>const_cast</b>) are less vulnerable to unintended
           effects and much easier to search for.

       <b>-Woverloaded-virtual</b> (C++ only)
           Warn when a function declaration hides virtual functions from a base class.  For example, in:

                   struct A {
                     virtual void f();
                   };

                   struct B: public A {
                     void f(int);
                   };

           the "A" class version of "f" is hidden in "B", and code like:

                   B* b;
                   b-&gt;f();

           will fail to compile.

       <b>-Wno-pmf-conversions</b> (C++ only)
           Disable the diagnostic for converting a bound pointer to member function to a plain pointer.

       <b>-Wsign-promo</b> (C++ only)
           Warn when overload resolution chooses a promotion from unsigned or enumerated type to a signed
           type, over a conversion to an unsigned type of the same size.  Previous versions of G++ would try
           to preserve unsignedness, but the standard mandates the current behavior.

                   struct A {
                     operator int ();
                     A&amp; operator = (int);
                   };

                   main ()
                   {
                     A a,b;
                     a = b;
                   }

           In this example, G++ will synthesize a default <b>A&amp;</b> <b>operator</b> <b>=</b> <b>(const</b> <b>A&amp;);</b>, while cfront will use
           the user-defined <b>operator</b> <b>=</b>.

       <b>Options</b> <b>Controlling</b> <b>Objective-C</b> <b>and</b> <b>Objective-C++</b> <b>Dialects</b>

       (NOTE: This manual does not describe the Objective-C and Objective-C++ languages themselves.  See

       This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful for Objective-C and
       Objective-C++ programs, but you can also use most of the language-independent GNU compiler options.
       For example, you might compile a file "some_class.m" like this:

               gcc -g -fgnu-runtime -O -c some_class.m

       In this example, <b>-fgnu-runtime</b> is an option meant only for Objective-C and Objective-C++ programs;
       you can use the other options with any language supported by GCC.

       Note that since Objective-C is an extension of the C language, Objective-C compilations may also use
       options specific to the C front-end (e.g., <b>-Wtraditional</b>).  Similarly, Objective-C++ compilations may
       use C++-specific options (e.g., <b>-Wabi</b>).

       Here is a list of options that are <u>only</u> for compiling Objective-C and Objective-C++ programs:

       <b>-fconstant-string-class=</b><u>class-name</u>
           Use <u>class-name</u> as the name of the class to instantiate for each literal string specified with the
           syntax "@"..."".  The default class name is "NXConstantString" if the GNU runtime is being used,
           and "NSConstantString" if the NeXT runtime is being used (see below).  The <b>-fconstant-cfstrings</b>
           option, if also present, will override the <b>-fconstant-string-class</b> setting and cause "@"...""
           literals to be laid out as constant CoreFoundation strings.

       <b>-fgnu-runtime</b>
           Generate object code compatible with the standard GNU Objective-C runtime.  This is the default
           for most types of systems.

       <b>-fnext-runtime</b>
           Generate output compatible with the NeXT runtime.  This is the default for NeXT-based systems,
           including Darwin and Mac OS X.  The macro "__NEXT_RUNTIME__" is predefined if (and only if) this
           option is used.

       <b>-fno-nil-receivers</b>
           Assume that all Objective-C message dispatches (e.g., "[receiver message:arg]") in this
           translation unit ensure that the receiver is not "nil".  This allows for more efficient entry
           points in the runtime to be used.  Currently, this option is only available in conjunction with
           the NeXT runtime on Mac OS X 10.3 and later.

       <b>-fobjc-call-cxx-cdtors</b>
           For each Objective-C class, check if any of its instance variables is a C++ object with a non-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">trivial&nbsp;nontrivial</font>
           trivial default constructor.  If so, synthesize a special "- (id) .cxx_construct" instance method
           that will run non-trivial default constructors on any such instance variables, in order, and then
           return "self".  Similarly, check if any instance variable is a C++ object with a non-trivial
           destructor, and if so, synthesize a special "- (void) .cxx_destruct" method that will run all
           such default destructors, in reverse order.

           The "- (id) .cxx_construct" and/or "- (void) .cxx_destruct" methods thusly generated will only
           operate on instance variables declared in the current Objective-C class, and not those inherited
           from superclasses.  It is the responsibility of the Objective-C runtime to invoke all such
           methods in an object's inheritance hierarchy.  The "- (id) .cxx_construct" methods will be
           invoked by the runtime immediately after a new object instance is allocated; the "- (void)
           .cxx_destruct" methods will be invoked immediately before the runtime deallocates an object
           instance.

           As of this writing, only the NeXT runtime on Mac OS X 10.4 and later has support for invoking the
           "- (id) .cxx_construct" and "- (void) .cxx_destruct" methods.

       <b>-fobjc-sjlj-exceptions</b>
           Enable syntactic support for structured exception handling in Objective-C, similar to what is
           offered by C++ and Java.  This option is available in conjunction with the NeXT setjmp base
           exceptions on Mac OS X 10.3 and later.  This option is on by default with the NeXT runtime.

                     @try {
                       ...
                          @throw expr;
                       ...
                     }
                     @catch (AnObjCClass *exc) {
                       ...
                         @throw expr;
                       ...
                         @throw;
                       ...
                     }
                     @catch (AnotherClass *exc) {
                       ...
                     }
                     @catch (id allOthers) {
                       ...
                     }
                     @finally {
                       ...
                         @throw expr;
                       ...
                     }

           The @throw statement may appear anywhere in an Objective-C or Objective-C++ program; when used
           inside of a @catch block, the @throw may appear without an argument (as shown above), in which
           case the object caught by the @catch will be rethrown.

           Note that only (pointers to) Objective-C objects may be thrown and caught using this scheme.
           When an object is thrown, it will be caught by the nearest @catch clause capable of handling
           objects of that type, analogously to how "catch" blocks work in C++ and Java.  A "@catch(id ...)"
           clause (as shown above) may also be provided to catch any and all Objective-C exceptions not
           caught by previous @catch clauses (if any).

           The @finally clause, if present, will be executed upon exit from the immediately preceding "@try
           ... @catch" section.  This will happen regardless of whether any exceptions are thrown, caught or
           rethrown inside the "@try ... @catch" section, analogously to the behavior of the "finally"
           clause in Java.

           There are several caveats to using the new exception mechanism:

              Although currently designed to be binary compatible with "NS_HANDLER"-style idioms provided
               by the "NSException" class, the new exceptions can only be used on Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther)
               and later systems, due to additional functionality needed in the (NeXT) Objective-C runtime.

              As mentioned above, the new exceptions do not support handling types other than Objective-C
               objects.   Furthermore, when used from Objective-C++, the Objective-C exception model does
               not interoperate with C++ exceptions at this time.  This means you cannot @throw an exception
               from Objective-C and "catch" it in C++, or vice versa (i.e., "throw ... @catch").

           The <b>-fobjc-sjlj-exceptions</b> switch also enables the use of synchronization blocks for thread-safe
           execution:

                     @synchronized (ObjCClass *guard) {
                       ...
                     }

           Upon entering the @synchronized block, a thread of execution shall first check whether a lock has
           been placed on the corresponding "guard" object by another thread.  If it has, the current thread
           shall wait until the other thread relinquishes its lock.  Once "guard" becomes available, the
           current thread will place its own lock on it, execute the code contained in the @synchronized
           block, and finally relinquish the lock (thereby making "guard" available to other threads).

           Unlike Java, Objective-C does not allow for entire methods to be marked @synchronized.  Note that
           throwing exceptions out of @synchronized blocks is allowed, and will cause the guarding object to
           be unlocked properly.

       <b>-fobjc-gc</b>
           Enable garbage collection (GC) for Objective-C objects.  The resulting binary requires additional
           runtime support which is not present in any released version of Mac OS X.

           When the <b>-fobjc-gc</b> switch is specified, the compiler will replace assignments to instance
           variables (ivars) and to certain kinds of pointers to Objective-C object instances with calls to
           interceptor functions provided by the runtime garbage collector.  Two type qualifiers, "__strong"
           and "__weak", also become available.  The "__strong" qualifier may be used to indicate that
           assignments to variables of this type should generate a GC interceptor call, e.g.:

                     __strong void *p;  // assignments to 'p' will have interceptor calls
                     int *q;            // assignments to 'q' ordinarly will not
                       ...
                     (__strong int *)q = 0;   // this assignment will call an interceptor

           Conversely, the "__weak" type qualifier may be used to suppress interceptor call generation:

                     __weak id q;      // assignments to 'q' will not have interceptor calls
                     id p;             // assignments to 'p' will have interceptor calls
                       ...
                     (__weak id)p = 0;   // suppress interceptor call for this assignment

       <b>-fobjc-gc-only</b>
           Use this option to indicate that the Objective-C program supports garbage collection (GC) only -<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">that&nbsp;onlythat</font>
           that is, it does not contain retain/release logic.  This flag implies <b>-fobjc-gc</b> as well. With
           this flag, framework is marked as not honoring retain/release.

       <b>-freplace-objc-classes</b>
           Emit a special marker instructing <!-- a --><u></u><b><u>l</u></b><b>(1)</b><!-- /a --><b></b> not to statically link in the resulting object file, and
           allow <!-- a --><u></u><b><u>d</u></b><u></u><b><u>l</u></b><b>(1)</b><!-- /a --><b></b> to load it in at run time instead.  This is used in conjunction with the Fix-and-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">Continue&nbsp;Fix-andContinue</font>
           Continue debugging mode, where the object file in question may be recompiled and dynamically
           reloaded in the course of program execution, without the need to restart the program itself.
           Currently, Fix-and-Continue functionality is only available in conjunction with the NeXT runtime
           on Mac OS X 10.3 and later.

       <b>-fzero-link</b>
           When compiling for the NeXT runtime, the compiler ordinarily replaces calls to
           "objc_getClass("...")" (when the name of the class is known at compile time) with static class
           references that get initialized at load time, which improves run-time performance.  Specifying
           the <b>-fzero-link</b> flag suppresses this behavior and causes calls to "objc_getClass("...")"  to be
           retained.  This is useful in Zero-Link debugging mode, since it allows for individual class
           implementations to be modified during program execution.

       <b>-gen-decls</b>
           Dump interface declarations for all classes seen in the source file to a file named
           <u>sourcename.decl</u>.

       <b>-Wno-protocol</b>
           If a class is declared to implement a protocol, a warning is issued for every method in the
           protocol that is not implemented by the class.  The default behavior is to issue a warning for
           every method not explicitly implemented in the class, even if a method implementation is
           inherited from the superclass.  If you use the <b>-Wno-protocol</b> option, then methods inherited from
           the superclass are considered to be implemented, and no warning is issued for them.

       <b>-Wselector</b>
           Warn if multiple methods of different types for the same selector are found during compilation.
           The check is performed on the list of methods in the final stage of compilation.  Additionally, a
           check is performed for each selector appearing in a "@selector(...)"  expression, and a
           corresponding method for that selector has been found during compilation.  Because these checks
           scan the method table only at the end of compilation, these warnings are not produced if the
           final stage of compilation is not reached, for example because an error is found during
           compilation, or because the <b>-fsyntax-only</b> option is being used.

       <b>-Wstrict-selector-match</b>
           Warn if multiple methods with differing argument and/or return types are found for a given
           selector when attempting to send a message using this selector to a receiver of type "id" or
           "Class".  When this flag is off (which is the default behavior), the compiler will omit such
           warnings if any differences found are confined to types which share the same size and alignment.

       <b>-Wundeclared-selector</b>
           Warn if a "@selector(...)" expression referring to an undeclared selector is found.  A selector
           is considered undeclared if no method with that name has been declared before the
           "@selector(...)" expression, either explicitly in an @interface or @protocol declaration, or
           implicitly in an @implementation section.  This option always performs its checks as soon as a
           "@selector(...)" expression is found, while <b>-Wselector</b> only performs its checks in the final
           stage of compilation.  This also enforces the coding style convention that methods and selectors
           must be declared before being used.

       <b>-print-objc-runtime-info</b>
           Generate C header describing the largest structure that is passed by value, if any.

       <b>Options</b> <b>to</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>Messages</b> <b>Formatting</b>

       Traditionally, diagnostic messages have been formatted irrespective of the output device's aspect
       (e.g. its width, ...).  The options described below can be used to control the diagnostic messages
       formatting algorithm, e.g. how many characters per line, how often source location information should
       be reported.  Right now, only the C++ front end can honor these options.  However it is expected, in
       the near future, that the remaining front ends would be able to digest them correctly.

       <b>-fmessage-length=</b><u>n</u>
           Try to format error messages so that they fit on lines of about <u>n</u> characters.  The default is 72
           characters for <b>g++</b> and 0 for the rest of the front ends supported by GCC.  If <u>n</u> is zero, then no
           line-wrapping will be done; each error message will appear on a single line.

       <b>-fdiagnostics-show-location=once</b>
           Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode.  Instructs the diagnostic messages reporter to emit <u>once</u>
           source location information; that is, in case the message is too long to fit on a single physical
           line and has to be wrapped, the source location won't be emitted (as prefix) again, over and
           over, in subsequent continuation lines.  This is the default behavior.

       <b>-fdiagnostics-show-location=every-line</b>
           Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode.  Instructs the diagnostic messages reporter to emit the
           same source location information (as prefix) for physical lines that result from the process of
           breaking a message which is too long to fit on a single line.

       <b>Options</b> <b>to</b> <b>Request</b> <b>or</b> <b>Suppress</b> <b>Warnings</b>

       Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions which are not inherently erroneous but
       which are risky or suggest there may have been an error.

       You can request many specific warnings with options beginning <b>-W</b>, for example <b>-Wimplicit</b> to request
       warnings on implicit declarations.  Each of these specific warning options also has a negative form
       beginning <b>-Wno-</b> to turn off warnings; for example, <b>-Wno-implicit</b>.  This manual lists only one of the
       two forms, whichever is not the default.

       The following options control the amount and kinds of warnings produced by GCC; for further,
       language-specific options also refer to <b>C++</b> <b>Dialect</b> <b>Options</b> and <b>Objective-C</b> <b>and</b> <b>Objective-C++</b> <b>Dialect</b>
       <b>Options</b>.

       <b>-fsyntax-only</b>
           Check the code for syntax errors, but don't do anything beyond that.

       <b>-pedantic</b>
           Issue all the warnings demanded by strict ISO C and ISO C++; reject all programs that use
           forbidden extensions, and some other programs that do not follow ISO C and ISO C++.  For ISO C,
           follows the version of the ISO C standard specified by any <b>-std</b> option used.

           Valid ISO C and ISO C++ programs should compile properly with or without this option (though a
           rare few will require <b>-ansi</b> or a <b>-std</b> option specifying the required version of ISO C).  However,
           without this option, certain GNU extensions and traditional C and C++ features are supported as
           well.  With this option, they are rejected.

           <b>-pedantic</b> does not cause warning messages for use of the alternate keywords whose names begin and
           end with <b>__</b>.  Pedantic warnings are also disabled in the expression that follows "__extension__".
           However, only system header files should use these escape routes; application programs should
           avoid them.

           Some users try to use <b>-pedantic</b> to check programs for strict ISO C conformance.  They soon find
           that it does not do quite what they want: it finds some non-ISO practices, but not all---only
           those for which ISO C <u>requires</u> a diagnostic, and some others for which diagnostics have been
           added.

           A feature to report any failure to conform to ISO C might be useful in some instances, but would
           require considerable additional work and would be quite different from <b>-pedantic</b>.  We don't have
           plans to support such a feature in the near future.

           Where the standard specified with <b>-std</b> represents a GNU extended dialect of C, such as <b>gnu89</b> or
           <b>gnu99</b>, there is a corresponding <u>base</u> <u>standard</u>, the version of ISO C on which the GNU extended
           dialect is based.  Warnings from <b>-pedantic</b> are given where they are required by the base
           standard.  (It would not make sense for such warnings to be given only for features not in the
           specified GNU C dialect, since by definition the GNU dialects of C include all features the
           compiler supports with the given option, and there would be nothing to warn about.)

       <b>-pedantic-errors</b>
           Like <b>-pedantic</b>, except that errors are produced rather than warnings.

       <b>-w</b>  Inhibit all warning messages.

       <b>-Wno-import</b>
           Inhibit warning messages about the use of <b>#import</b>.

       <b>-Wno-#warnings</b>
           Inhibit warning messages issued by <b>#warning</b>.

       <b>-Wextra-tokens</b>
           Warn about extra tokens at the end of prepreprocessor directives.  (APPLE ONLY)

       <b>-Wnewline-eof</b>
           Warn about files missing a newline at the end of the file.  (APPLE ONLY)

       <b>-Wno-altivec-long-deprecated</b>
           Do not warn about the use of the deprecated 'long' keyword in AltiVec data types.  (APPLE ONLY)

       <b>-Wchar-subscripts</b>
           Warn if an array subscript has type "char".  This is a common cause of error, as programmers
           often forget that this type is signed on some machines.  This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wcomment</b>
           Warn whenever a comment-start sequence <b>/*</b> appears in a <b>/*</b> comment, or whenever a Backslash-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">Newline&nbsp;BackslashNewline</font>
           Newline appears in a <b>//</b> comment.  This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wfatal-errors</b>
           This option causes the compiler to abort compilation on the first error occurred rather than
           trying to keep going and printing further error messages.

       <b>-Wformat</b>
           Check calls to "printf" and "scanf", etc., to make sure that the arguments supplied have types
           appropriate to the format string specified, and that the conversions specified in the format
           string make sense.  This includes standard functions, and others specified by format attributes,
           in the "printf", "scanf", "strftime" and "strfmon" (an X/Open extension, not in the C standard)
           families (or other target-specific families).  Which functions are checked without format
           attributes having been specified depends on the standard version selected, and such checks of
           functions without the attribute specified are disabled by <b>-ffreestanding</b> or <b>-fno-builtin</b>.

           The formats are checked against the format features supported by GNU libc version 2.2.  These
           include all ISO C90 and C99 features, as well as features from the Single Unix Specification and
           some BSD and GNU extensions.  Other library implementations may not support all these features;
           GCC does not support warning about features that go beyond a particular library's limitations.
           However, if <b>-pedantic</b> is used with <b>-Wformat</b>, warnings will be given about format features not in
           the selected standard version (but not for "strfmon" formats, since those are not in any version
           of the C standard).

           Since <b>-Wformat</b> also checks for null format arguments for several functions, <b>-Wformat</b> also implies
           <b>-Wnonnull</b>.

           <b>-Wformat</b> is included in <b>-Wall</b>.  For more control over some aspects of format checking, the
           options <b>-Wformat-y2k</b>, <b>-Wno-format-extra-args</b>, <b>-Wno-format-zero-length</b>, <b>-Wformat-nonliteral</b>,
           <b>-Wformat-security</b>, and <b>-Wformat=2</b> are available, but are not included in <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wformat-y2k</b>
           If <b>-Wformat</b> is specified, also warn about "strftime" formats which may yield only a two-digit
           year.

       <b>-Wno-format-extra-args</b>
           If <b>-Wformat</b> is specified, do not warn about excess arguments to a "printf" or "scanf" format
           function.  The C standard specifies that such arguments are ignored.

           Where the unused arguments lie between used arguments that are specified with <b>$</b> operand number
           specifications, normally warnings are still given, since the implementation could not know what
           type to pass to "va_arg" to skip the unused arguments.  However, in the case of "scanf" formats,
           this option will suppress the warning if the unused arguments are all pointers, since the Single
           Unix Specification says that such unused arguments are allowed.

       <b>-Wno-format-zero-length</b>
           If <b>-Wformat</b> is specified, do not warn about zero-length formats.  The C standard specifies that
           zero-length formats are allowed.

       <b>-Wformat-nonliteral</b>
           If <b>-Wformat</b> is specified, also warn if the format string is not a string literal and so cannot be
           checked, unless the format function takes its format arguments as a "va_list".

       <b>-Wformat-security</b>
           If <b>-Wformat</b> is specified, also warn about uses of format functions that represent possible
           security problems.  At present, this warns about calls to "printf" and "scanf" functions where
           the format string is not a string literal and there are no format arguments, as in "printf
           (foo);".  This may be a security hole if the format string came from untrusted input and contains
           <b>%n</b>.  (This is currently a subset of what <b>-Wformat-nonliteral</b> warns about, but in future warnings
           may be added to <b>-Wformat-security</b> that are not included in <b>-Wformat-nonliteral</b>.)

       <b>-Wformat=2</b>
           Enable <b>-Wformat</b> plus format checks not included in <b>-Wformat</b>.  Currently equivalent to <b>-Wformat</b>
           <b>-Wformat-nonliteral</b> <b>-Wformat-security</b> <b>-Wformat-y2k</b>.

       <b>-Wnonnull</b>
           Warn about passing a null pointer for arguments marked as requiring a non-null value by the
           "nonnull" function attribute.

           <b>-Wnonnull</b> is included in <b>-Wall</b> and <b>-Wformat</b>.  It can be disabled with the <b>-Wno-nonnull</b> option.

       <b>-Winit-self</b> (C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn about uninitialized variables which are initialized with themselves.  Note this option can
           only be used with the <b>-Wuninitialized</b> option, which in turn only works with <b>-O1</b> and above.

           For example, GCC will warn about "i" being uninitialized in the following snippet only when
           <b>-Winit-self</b> has been specified:

                   int f()
                   {
                     int i = i;
                     return i;
                   }

       <b>-Wimplicit-int</b>
           Warn when a declaration does not specify a type.  This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wimplicit-function-declaration</b>
       <b>-Werror-implicit-function-declaration</b>
           Give a warning (or error) whenever a function is used before being declared.  The form
           <b>-Wno-error-implicit-function-declaration</b> is not supported.  This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b> (as
           a warning, not an error).

       <b>-Wimplicit</b>
           Same as <b>-Wimplicit-int</b> and <b>-Wimplicit-function-declaration</b>.  This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wmain</b>
           Warn if the type of <b>main</b> is suspicious.  <b>main</b> should be a function with external linkage,
           returning int, taking either zero arguments, two, or three arguments of appropriate types.  This
           warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wmissing-braces</b>
           Warn if an aggregate or union initializer is not fully bracketed.  In the following example, the
           initializer for <b>a</b> is not fully bracketed, but that for <b>b</b> is fully bracketed.

                   int a[2][2] = { 0, 1, 2, 3 };
                   int b[2][2] = { { 0, 1 }, { 2, 3 } };

           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wmissing-include-dirs</b> (C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn if a user-supplied include directory does not exist.

       <b>-Wparentheses</b>
           Warn if parentheses are omitted in certain contexts, such as when there is an assignment in a
           context where a truth value is expected, or when operators are nested whose precedence people
           often get confused about.  Only the warning for an assignment used as a truth value is supported
           when compiling C++; the other warnings are only supported when compiling C.

           Also warn if a comparison like <b>x&lt;=y&lt;=z</b> appears; this is equivalent to <b>(x&lt;=y</b> <b>?</b> <b>1</b> <b>:</b> <b>0)</b> <b>&lt;=</b> <b>z</b>, which
           is a different interpretation from that of ordinary mathematical notation.

           Also warn about constructions where there may be confusion to which "if" statement an "else"
           branch belongs.  Here is an example of such a case:

                   {
                     if (a)
                       if (b)
                         foo ();
                     else
                       bar ();
                   }

           In C, every "else" branch belongs to the innermost possible "if" statement, which in this example
           is "if (b)".  This is often not what the programmer expected, as illustrated in the above example
           by indentation the programmer chose.  When there is the potential for this confusion, GCC will
           issue a warning when this flag is specified.  To eliminate the warning, add explicit braces
           around the innermost "if" statement so there is no way the "else" could belong to the enclosing
           "if".  The resulting code would look like this:

                   {
                     if (a)
                       {
                         if (b)
                           foo ();
                         else
                           bar ();
                       }
                   }

           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wsequence-point</b>
           Warn about code that may have undefined semantics because of violations of sequence point rules
           in the C standard.

           The C standard defines the order in which expressions in a C program are evaluated in terms of
           <u>sequence</u> <u>points</u>, which represent a partial ordering between the execution of parts of the
           program: those executed before the sequence point, and those executed after it.  These occur
           after the evaluation of a full expression (one which is not part of a larger expression), after
           the evaluation of the first operand of a "&amp;&amp;", "||", "? :" or "," (comma) operator, before a
           function is called (but after the evaluation of its arguments and the expression denoting the
           called function), and in certain other places.  Other than as expressed by the sequence point
           rules, the order of evaluation of subexpressions of an expression is not specified.  All these
           rules describe only a partial order rather than a total order, since, for example, if two
           functions are called within one expression with no sequence point between them, the order in
           which the functions are called is not specified.  However, the standards committee have ruled
           that function calls do not overlap.

           It is not specified when between sequence points modifications to the values of objects take
           effect.  Programs whose behavior depends on this have undefined behavior; the C standard
           specifies that ``Between the previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored
           value modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression.  Furthermore, the prior value
           shall be read only to determine the value to be stored.''.  If a program breaks these rules, the
           results on any particular implementation are entirely unpredictable.

           Examples of code with undefined behavior are "a = a++;", "a[n] = b[n++]" and "a[i++] = i;".  Some
           more complicated cases are not diagnosed by this option, and it may give an occasional false
           positive result, but in general it has been found fairly effective at detecting this sort of
           problem in programs.

           The present implementation of this option only works for C programs.  A future implementation may
           also work for C++ programs.

           The C standard is worded confusingly, therefore there is some debate over the precise meaning of
           the sequence point rules in subtle cases.  Links to discussions of the problem, including
           proposed formal definitions, may be found on the GCC readings page, at
           &lt;<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html"><b>http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html</b></a><b></b>.

           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wreturn-type</b>
           Warn whenever a function is defined with a return-type that defaults to "int".  Also warn about
           any "return" statement with no return-value in a function whose return-type is not "void".

           For C, also warn if the return type of a function has a type qualifier such as "const".  Such a
           type qualifier has no effect, since the value returned by a function is not an lvalue.  ISO C
           prohibits qualified "void" return types on function definitions, so such return types always
           receive a warning even without this option.

           For C++, a function without return type always produces a diagnostic message, even when
           <b>-Wno-return-type</b> is specified.  The only exceptions are <b>main</b> and functions defined in system
           headers.

           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wswitch</b>
           Warn whenever a "switch" statement has an index of enumerated type and lacks a "case" for one or
           more of the named codes of that enumeration.  (The presence of a "default" label prevents this
           warning.)  "case" labels outside the enumeration range also provoke warnings when this option is
           used.  This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wswitch-default</b>
           Warn whenever a "switch" statement does not have a "default" case.

       <b>-Wswitch-enum</b>
           Warn whenever a "switch" statement has an index of enumerated type and lacks a "case" for one or
           more of the named codes of that enumeration.  "case" labels outside the enumeration range also
           provoke warnings when this option is used.

       <b>-Wtrigraphs</b>
           Warn if any trigraphs are encountered that might change the meaning of the program (trigraphs
           within comments are not warned about).  This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wunused-function</b>
           Warn whenever a static function is declared but not defined or a non\-inline static function is
           unused.  This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wunused-label</b>
           Warn whenever a label is declared but not used.  This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

           To suppress this warning use the <b>unused</b> attribute.

       <b>-Wunused-parameter</b>
           Warn whenever a function parameter is unused aside from its declaration.

           To suppress this warning use the <b>unused</b> attribute.

       <b>-Wunused-variable</b>
           Warn whenever a local variable or non-constant static variable is unused aside from its
           declaration This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

           To suppress this warning use the <b>unused</b> attribute.

       <b>-Wunused-value</b>
           Warn whenever a statement computes a result that is explicitly not used.  This warning is enabled
           by <b>-Wall</b>.

           To suppress this warning cast the expression to <b>void</b>.

       <b>-Wunused</b>
           All the above <b>-Wunused</b> options combined.

           In order to get a warning about an unused function parameter, you must either specify <b>-Wextra</b>
           <b>-Wunused</b> (note that <b>-Wall</b> implies <b>-Wunused</b>), or separately specify <b>-Wunused-parameter</b>.

       <b>-Wuninitialized</b>
           Warn if an automatic variable is used without first being initialized or if a variable may be
           clobbered by a "setjmp" call.

           These warnings are possible only in optimizing compilation, because they require data flow
           information that is computed only when optimizing.  If you don't specify <b>-O</b>, you simply won't get
           these warnings.

           If you want to warn about code which uses the uninitialized value of the variable in its own
           initializer, use the <b>-Winit-self</b> option.

           These warnings occur for individual uninitialized or clobbered elements of structure, union or
           array variables as well as for variables which are uninitialized or clobbered as a whole.  They
           do not occur for variables or elements declared "volatile".  Because these warnings depend on
           optimization, the exact variables or elements for which there are warnings will depend on the
           precise optimization options and version of GCC used.

           Note that there may be no warning about a variable that is used only to compute a value that
           itself is never used, because such computations may be deleted by data flow analysis before the
           warnings are printed.

           These warnings are made optional because GCC is not smart enough to see all the reasons why the
           code might be correct despite appearing to have an error.  Here is one example of how this can
           happen:

                   {
                     int x;
                     switch (y)
                       {
                       case 1: x = 1;
                         break;
                       case 2: x = 4;
                         break;
                       case 3: x = 5;
                       }
                     foo (x);
                   }

           If the value of "y" is always 1, 2 or 3, then "x" is always initialized, but GCC doesn't know
           this.  Here is another common case:

                   {
                     int save_y;
                     if (change_y) save_y = y, y = new_y;
                     ...
                     if (change_y) y = save_y;
                   }

           This has no bug because "save_y" is used only if it is set.

           This option also warns when a non-volatile automatic variable might be changed by a call to
           "longjmp".  These warnings as well are possible only in optimizing compilation.

           The compiler sees only the calls to "setjmp".  It cannot know where "longjmp" will be called; in
           fact, a signal handler could call it at any point in the code.  As a result, you may get a
           warning even when there is in fact no problem because "longjmp" cannot in fact be called at the
           place which would cause a problem.

           Some spurious warnings can be avoided if you declare all the functions you use that never return
           as "noreturn".

           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wunknown-pragmas</b>
           Warn when a #pragma directive is encountered which is not understood by GCC.  If this command
           line option is used, warnings will even be issued for unknown pragmas in system header files.
           This is not the case if the warnings were only enabled by the <b>-Wall</b> command line option.

       <b>-Wstrict-aliasing</b>
           This option is only active when <b>-fstrict-aliasing</b> is active.  It warns about code which might
           break the strict aliasing rules that the compiler is using for optimization.  The warning does
           not catch all cases, but does attempt to catch the more common pitfalls.  It is included in
           <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wstrict-aliasing=2</b>
           This option is only active when <b>-fstrict-aliasing</b> is active.  It warns about all code which might
           break the strict aliasing rules that the compiler is using for optimization.  This warning
           catches all cases, but it will also give a warning for some ambiguous cases that are safe.

       <b>-Wall</b>
           All of the above <b>-W</b> options combined.  This enables all the warnings about constructions that
           some users consider questionable, and that are easy to avoid (or modify to prevent the warning),
           even in conjunction with macros.  This also enables some language-specific warnings described in
           <b>C++</b> <b>Dialect</b> <b>Options</b> and <b>Objective-C</b> <b>and</b> <b>Objective-C++</b> <b>Dialect</b> <b>Options</b>.

       <b>-Wmost</b>
           This is equivalent to -Wall -Wno-parentheses.  (APPLE ONLY)

       The following <b>-W...</b> options are not implied by <b>-Wall</b>.  Some of them warn about constructions that
       users generally do not consider questionable, but which occasionally you might wish to check for;
       others warn about constructions that are necessary or hard to avoid in some cases, and there is no
       simple way to modify the code to suppress the warning.

       <b>-Wextra</b>
           (This option used to be called <b>-W</b>.  The older name is still supported, but the newer name is more
           descriptive.)  Print extra warning messages for these events:

              A function can return either with or without a value.  (Falling off the end of the function
               body is considered returning without a value.)  For example, this function would evoke such a
               warning:

                       foo (a)
                       {
                         if (a &gt; 0)
                           return a;
                       }

              An expression-statement or the left-hand side of a comma expression contains no side effects.
               To suppress the warning, cast the unused expression to void.  For example, an expression such
               as <b>x[i,j]</b> will cause a warning, but <b>x[(void)i,j]</b> will not.

              An unsigned value is compared against zero with <b>&lt;</b> or <b>&gt;=</b>.

              Storage-class specifiers like "static" are not the first things in a declaration.  According
               to the C Standard, this usage is obsolescent.

              If <b>-Wall</b> or <b>-Wunused</b> is also specified, warn about unused arguments.

              A comparison between signed and unsigned values could produce an incorrect result when the
               signed value is converted to unsigned.  (But don't warn if <b>-Wno-sign-compare</b> is also
               specified.)

              An aggregate has an initializer which does not initialize all members.  This warning can be
               independently controlled by <b>-Wmissing-field-initializers</b>.

              A function parameter is declared without a type specifier in K&amp;R-style functions:

                       void foo(bar) { }

              An empty body occurs in an <b>if</b> or <b>else</b> statement.

              A pointer is compared against integer zero with <b>&lt;</b>, <b>&lt;=</b>, <b>&gt;</b>, or <b>&gt;=</b>.

              A variable might be changed by <b>longjmp</b> or <b>vfork</b>.

              Any of several floating-point events that often indicate errors, such as overflow, underflow,
               loss of precision, etc.

              *&lt;(C++ only)&gt;

               An enumerator and a non-enumerator both appear in a conditional expression.

              *&lt;(C++ only)&gt;

               A non-static reference or non-static <b>const</b> member appears in a class without constructors.

              *&lt;(C++ only)&gt;

               Ambiguous virtual bases.

              *&lt;(C++ only)&gt;

               Subscripting an array which has been declared <b>register</b>.

               Taking the address of a variable which has been declared <b>register</b>.

              *&lt;(C++ only)&gt;

               A base class is not initialized in a derived class' copy constructor.

       <b>-Wno-div-by-zero</b>
           Do not warn about compile-time integer division by zero.  Floating point division by zero is not
           warned about, as it can be a legitimate way of obtaining infinities and NaNs.

       <b>-Wsystem-headers</b>
           Print warning messages for constructs found in system header files.  Warnings from system headers
           are normally suppressed, on the assumption that they usually do not indicate real problems and
           would only make the compiler output harder to read.  Using this command line option tells GCC to
           emit warnings from system headers as if they occurred in user code.  However, note that using
           <b>-Wall</b> in conjunction with this option will <u>not</u> warn about unknown pragmas in system headers---for
           that, <b>-Wunknown-pragmas</b> must also be used.

       <b>-Wfloat-equal</b>
           Warn if floating point values are used in equality comparisons.

           The idea behind this is that sometimes it is convenient (for the programmer) to consider
           floating-point values as approximations to infinitely precise real numbers.  If you are doing
           this, then you need to compute (by analyzing the code, or in some other way) the maximum or
           likely maximum error that the computation introduces, and allow for it when performing
           comparisons (and when producing output, but that's a different problem).  In particular, instead
           of testing for equality, you would check to see whether the two values have ranges that overlap;
           and this is done with the relational operators, so equality comparisons are probably mistaken.

       <b>-Wfour-char-constants</b>
           Warn about four char constants, e.g. OSType 'APPL'.  This warning is disabled by default.

       <b>-Wtraditional</b> (C only)
           Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in traditional and ISO C.  Also warn about
           ISO C constructs that have no traditional C equivalent, and/or problematic constructs which
           should be avoided.

              Macro parameters that appear within string literals in the macro body.  In traditional C
               macro replacement takes place within string literals, but does not in ISO C.

              In traditional C, some preprocessor directives did not exist.  Traditional preprocessors
               would only consider a line to be a directive if the <b>#</b> appeared in column 1 on the line.
               Therefore <b>-Wtraditional</b> warns about directives that traditional C understands but would
               ignore because the <b>#</b> does not appear as the first character on the line.  It also suggests
               you hide directives like <b>#pragma</b> not understood by traditional C by indenting them.  Some
               traditional implementations would not recognize <b>#elif</b>, so it suggests avoiding it altogether.

              A function-like macro that appears without arguments.

              The unary plus operator.

              The <b>U</b> integer constant suffix, or the <b>F</b> or <b>L</b> floating point constant suffixes.  (Traditional
               C does support the <b>L</b> suffix on integer constants.)  Note, these suffixes appear in macros
               defined in the system headers of most modern systems, e.g. the <b>_MIN</b>/<b>_MAX</b> macros in
               "&lt;limits.h&gt;".  Use of these macros in user code might normally lead to spurious warnings,
               however GCC's integrated preprocessor has enough context to avoid warning in these cases.

              A function declared external in one block and then used after the end of the block.

              A "switch" statement has an operand of type "long".

              A non-"static" function declaration follows a "static" one.  This construct is not accepted
               by some traditional C compilers.

              The ISO type of an integer constant has a different width or signedness from its traditional
               type.  This warning is only issued if the base of the constant is ten.  I.e. hexadecimal or
               octal values, which typically represent bit patterns, are not warned about.

              Usage of ISO string concatenation is detected.

              Initialization of automatic aggregates.

              Identifier conflicts with labels.  Traditional C lacks a separate namespace for labels.

              Initialization of unions.  If the initializer is zero, the warning is omitted.  This is done
               under the assumption that the zero initializer in user code appears conditioned on e.g.
               "__STDC__" to avoid missing initializer warnings and relies on default initialization to zero
               in the traditional C case.

              Conversions by prototypes between fixed/floating point values and vice versa.  The absence of
               these prototypes when compiling with traditional C would cause serious problems.  This is a
               subset of the possible conversion warnings, for the full set use <b>-Wconversion</b>.

              Use of ISO C style function definitions.  This warning intentionally is <u>not</u> issued for
               prototype declarations or variadic functions because these ISO C features will appear in your
               code when using libiberty's traditional C compatibility macros, "PARAMS" and "VPARAMS".  This
               warning is also bypassed for nested functions because that feature is already a GCC extension
               and thus not relevant to traditional C compatibility.

       <b>-Wdeclaration-after-statement</b> (C only)
           Warn when a declaration is found after a statement in a block.  This construct, known from C++,
           was introduced with ISO C99 and is by default allowed in GCC.  It is not supported by ISO C90 and
           was not supported by GCC versions before GCC 3.0.

       <b>-Wno-discard-qual</b>
           This flag allows user to suppress warning that is issued when qualification is discarded in
           situations like, initialization, assignment and argument passing.

       <b>-Wundef</b>
           Warn if an undefined identifier is evaluated in an <b>#if</b> directive.

       <b>-Wno-endif-labels</b>
           Do not warn whenever an <b>#else</b> or an <b>#endif</b> are followed by text.

       <b>-Wshadow</b>
           Warn whenever a local variable shadows another local variable, parameter or global variable or
           whenever a built-in function is shadowed.

       <b>-Wlarger-than-</b><u>len</u>
           Warn whenever an object of larger than <u>len</u> bytes is defined.

       <b>-Wpointer-arith</b>
           Warn about anything that depends on the ``size of'' a function type or of "void".  GNU C assigns
           these types a size of 1, for convenience in calculations with "void *" pointers and pointers to
           functions.

       <b>-Wbad-function-cast</b> (C only)
           Warn whenever a function call is cast to a non-matching type.  For example, warn if "int
           malloc()" is cast to "anything *".

       <b>-Wcast-qual</b>
           Warn whenever a pointer is cast so as to remove a type qualifier from the target type.  For
           example, warn if a "const char *" is cast to an ordinary "char *".

       <b>-Wcast-align</b>
           Warn whenever a pointer is cast such that the required alignment of the target is increased.  For
           example, warn if a "char *" is cast to an "int *" on machines where integers can only be accessed
           at two- or four-byte boundaries.

       <b>-Wwrite-strings</b>
           When compiling C, give string constants the type "const char[length]" so that copying the address
           of one into a non-"const" "char *" pointer will get a warning; when compiling C++, warn about the
           deprecated conversion from string constants to "char *".  These warnings will help you find at
           compile time code that can try to write into a string constant, but only if you have been very
           careful about using "const" in declarations and prototypes.  Otherwise, it will just be a
           nuisance; this is why we did not make <b>-Wall</b> request these warnings.

       <b>-Wconversion</b>
           Warn if a prototype causes a type conversion that is different from what would happen to the same
           argument in the absence of a prototype.  This includes conversions of fixed point to floating and
           vice versa, and conversions changing the width or signedness of a fixed point argument except
           when the same as the default promotion.

           Also, warn if a negative integer constant expression is implicitly converted to an unsigned type.
           For example, warn about the assignment "x = -1" if "x" is unsigned.  But do not warn about
           explicit casts like "(unsigned) -1".

       <b>-Wshorten-64-to-32</b>
           Warn if a value is implicitly converted from a 64 bit type to a 32 bit type.

       <b>-Wsign-compare</b>
           Warn when a comparison between signed and unsigned values could produce an incorrect result when
           the signed value is converted to unsigned.  This warning is also enabled by <b>-Wextra</b>; to get the
           other warnings of <b>-Wextra</b> without this warning, use <b>-Wextra</b> <b>-Wno-sign-compare</b>.

       <b>-Waggregate-return</b>
           Warn if any functions that return structures or unions are defined or called.  (In languages
           where you can return an array, this also elicits a warning.)

       <b>-Wstrict-prototypes</b> (C only)
           Warn if a function is declared or defined without specifying the argument types.  (An old-style
           function definition is permitted without a warning if preceded by a declaration which specifies
           the argument types.)

       <b>-Wold-style-definition</b> (C only)
           Warn if an old-style function definition is used.  A warning is given even if there is a previous
           prototype.

       <b>-Wmissing-prototypes</b> (C only)
           Warn if a global function is defined without a previous prototype declaration.  This warning is
           issued even if the definition itself provides a prototype.  The aim is to detect global functions
           that fail to be declared in header files.

       <b>-Wmissing-declarations</b> (C only)
           Warn if a global function is defined without a previous declaration.  Do so even if the
           definition itself provides a prototype.  Use this option to detect global functions that are not
           declared in header files.

       <b>-Wmissing-field-initializers</b>
           Warn if a structure's initializer has some fields missing.  For example, the following code would
           cause such a warning, because "x.h" is implicitly zero:

                   struct s { int f, g, h; };
                   struct s x = { 3, 4 };

           This option does not warn about designated initializers, so the following modification would not
           trigger a warning:

                   struct s { int f, g, h; };
                   struct s x = { .f = 3, .g = 4 };

           This warning is included in <b>-Wextra</b>.  To get other <b>-Wextra</b> warnings without this one, use <b>-Wextra</b>
           <b>-Wno-missing-field-initializers</b>.

       <b>-Wmissing-noreturn</b>
           Warn about functions which might be candidates for attribute "noreturn".  Note these are only
           possible candidates, not absolute ones.  Care should be taken to manually verify functions
           actually do not ever return before adding the "noreturn" attribute, otherwise subtle code
           generation bugs could be introduced.  You will not get a warning for "main" in hosted C
           environments.

       <b>-Wmissing-format-attribute</b>
           If <b>-Wformat</b> is enabled, also warn about functions which might be candidates for "format"
           attributes.  Note these are only possible candidates, not absolute ones.  GCC will guess that
           "format" attributes might be appropriate for any function that calls a function like "vprintf" or
           "vscanf", but this might not always be the case, and some functions for which "format" attributes
           are appropriate may not be detected.  This option has no effect unless <b>-Wformat</b> is enabled
           (possibly by <b>-Wall</b>).

       <b>-Wno-multichar</b>
           Do not warn if a multicharacter constant (<b>'FOO'</b>) is used.  Usually they indicate a typo in the
           user's code, as they have implementation-defined values, and should not be used in portable code.
           This flag does not control warning for a constant with four characters, use -Wfour-char-constants
           instead.

       <b>-Wnormalized=&lt;none|id|nfc|nfkc&gt;</b>
           In ISO C and ISO C++, two identifiers are different if they are different sequences of
           characters.  However, sometimes when characters outside the basic ASCII character set are used,
           you can have two different character sequences that look the same.  To avoid confusion, the ISO
           10646 standard sets out some <u>normalization</u> <u>rules</u> which when applied ensure that two sequences
           that look the same are turned into the same sequence.  GCC can warn you if you are using
           identifiers which have not been normalized; this option controls that warning.

           There are four levels of warning that GCC supports.  The default is <b>-Wnormalized=nfc</b>, which warns
           about any identifier which is not in the ISO 10646 ``C'' normalized form, <u>NFC</u>.  NFC is the
           recommended form for most uses.

           Unfortunately, there are some characters which ISO C and ISO C++ allow in identifiers that when
           turned into NFC aren't allowable as identifiers.  That is, there's no way to use these symbols in
           portable ISO C or C++ and have all your identifiers in NFC.  <b>-Wnormalized=id</b> suppresses the
           warning for these characters.  It is hoped that future versions of the standards involved will
           correct this, which is why this option is not the default.

           You can switch the warning off for all characters by writing <b>-Wnormalized=none</b>.  You would only
           want to do this if you were using some other normalization scheme (like ``D''), because otherwise
           you can easily create bugs that are literally impossible to see.

           Some characters in ISO 10646 have distinct meanings but look identical in some fonts or display
           methodologies, especially once formatting has been applied.  For instance "\u207F", ``SUPERSCRIPT
           LATIN SMALL LETTER N'', will display just like a regular "n" which has been placed in a
           superscript.  ISO 10646 defines the <u>NFKC</u> normalisation scheme to convert all these into a
           standard form as well, and GCC will warn if your code is not in NFKC if you use
           <b>-Wnormalized=nfkc</b>.  This warning is comparable to warning about every identifier that contains
           the letter O because it might be confused with the digit 0, and so is not the default, but may be
           useful as a local coding convention if the programming environment is unable to be fixed to
           display these characters distinctly.

       <b>-Wno-deprecated-declarations</b>
           Do not warn about uses of functions, variables, and types marked as deprecated by using the
           "deprecated" attribute.

       <b>-Wpacked</b>
           Warn if a structure is given the packed attribute, but the packed attribute has no effect on the
           layout or size of the structure.  Such structures may be mis-aligned for little benefit.  For
           instance, in this code, the variable "f.x" in "struct bar" will be misaligned even though "struct
           bar" does not itself have the packed attribute:

                   struct foo {
                     int x;
                     char a, b, c, d;
                   } __attribute__((packed));
                   struct bar {
                     char z;
                     struct foo f;
                   };

       <b>-Wpadded</b>
           Warn if padding is included in a structure, either to align an element of the structure or to
           align the whole structure.  Sometimes when this happens it is possible to rearrange the fields of
           the structure to reduce the padding and so make the structure smaller.

       <b>-Wredundant-decls</b>
           Warn if anything is declared more than once in the same scope, even in cases where multiple
           declaration is valid and changes nothing.

       <b>-Wnested-externs</b> (C only)
           Warn if an "extern" declaration is encountered within a function.

       <b>-Wunreachable-code</b>
           Warn if the compiler detects that code will never be executed.

           This option is intended to warn when the compiler detects that at least a whole line of source
           code will never be executed, because some condition is never satisfied or because it is after a
           procedure that never returns.

           It is possible for this option to produce a warning even though there are circumstances under
           which part of the affected line can be executed, so care should be taken when removing
           apparently-unreachable code.

           For instance, when a function is inlined, a warning may mean that the line is unreachable in only
           one inlined copy of the function.

           This option is not made part of <b>-Wall</b> because in a debugging version of a program there is often
           substantial code which checks correct functioning of the program and is, hopefully, unreachable
           because the program does work.  Another common use of unreachable code is to provide behavior
           which is selectable at compile-time.

       <b>-Winline</b>
           Warn if a function can not be inlined and it was declared as inline.  Even with this option, the
           compiler will not warn about failures to inline functions declared in system headers.

           The compiler uses a variety of heuristics to determine whether or not to inline a function.  For
           example, the compiler takes into account the size of the function being inlined and the amount of
           inlining that has already been done in the current function.  Therefore, seemingly insignificant
           changes in the source program can cause the warnings produced by <b>-Winline</b> to appear or disappear.

       <b>-Wno-invalid-offsetof</b> (C++ only)
           Suppress warnings from applying the <b>offsetof</b> macro to a non-POD type.  According to the 1998 ISO
           C++ standard, applying <b>offsetof</b> to a non-POD type is undefined.  In existing C++ implementations,
           however, <b>offsetof</b> typically gives meaningful results even when applied to certain kinds of non-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">POD&nbsp;nonPOD</font>
           POD types. (Such as a simple <b>struct</b> that fails to be a POD type only by virtue of having a
           constructor.)  This flag is for users who are aware that they are writing nonportable code and
           who have deliberately chosen to ignore the warning about it.

           The restrictions on <b>offsetof</b> may be relaxed in a future version of the C++ standard.

       <b>-Wno-int-to-pointer-cast</b> (C only)
           Suppress warnings from casts to pointer type of an integer of a different size.

       <b>-Wno-pointer-to-int-cast</b> (C only)
           Suppress warnings from casts from a pointer to an integer type of a different size.

       <b>-Winvalid-pch</b>
           Warn if a precompiled header is found in the search path but can't be used.

       <b>-Wlong-long</b>
           Warn if <b>long</b> <b>long</b> type is used.  This is default.  To inhibit the warning messages, use
           <b>-Wno-long-long</b>.  Flags <b>-Wlong-long</b> and <b>-Wno-long-long</b> are taken into account only when <b>-pedantic</b>
           flag is used.

       <b>-Wvariadic-macros</b>
           Warn if variadic macros are used in pedantic ISO C90 mode, or the GNU alternate syntax when in
           pedantic ISO C99 mode.  This is default.  To inhibit the warning messages, use
           <b>-Wno-variadic-macros</b>.

       <b>-Wdisabled-optimization</b>
           Warn if a requested optimization pass is disabled.  This warning does not generally indicate that
           there is anything wrong with your code; it merely indicates that GCC's optimizers were unable to
           handle the code effectively.  Often, the problem is that your code is too big or too complex; GCC
           will refuse to optimize programs when the optimization itself is likely to take inordinate
           amounts of time.

       <b>-Wno-pointer-sign</b>
           Don't warn for pointer argument passing or assignment with different signedness.  Only useful in
           the negative form since this warning is enabled by default.  This option is only supported for C
           and Objective-C.

       <b>-Wstack-protector</b>
           This option is only active when <b>-fstack-protector</b> is active.  It warns about functions that will
           not be protected against stack smashing.

       <b>-Werror</b>
           Make all warnings into errors.

       <b>Options</b> <b>for</b> <b>Debugging</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Program</b> <b>or</b> <b>GCC</b>

       GCC has various special options that are used for debugging either your program or GCC:

       <b>-g</b>  Produce debugging information in the operating system's native format (stabs, COFF, XCOFF, or
           DWARF 2).  GDB can work with this debugging information.

           On most systems that use stabs format, <b>-g</b> enables use of extra debugging information that only
           GDB can use; this extra information makes debugging work better in GDB but will probably make
           other debuggers crash or refuse to read the program.  If you want to control for certain whether
           to generate the extra information, use <b>-gstabs+</b> or <b>-gstabs</b> (see below).

           GCC allows you to use <b>-g</b> with <b>-O</b>.  The shortcuts taken by optimized code may occasionally produce
           surprising results: some variables you declared may not exist at all; flow of control may briefly
           move where you did not expect it; some statements may not be executed because they compute
           constant results or their values were already at hand; some statements may execute in different
           places because they were moved out of loops.

           Nevertheless it proves possible to debug optimized output.  This makes it reasonable to use the
           optimizer for programs that might have bugs.

           The following options are useful when GCC is generated with the capability for more than one
           debugging format.

       <b>-ggdb</b>
           Produce debugging information for use by GDB.  This means to use the most expressive format
           available (DWARF 2, stabs, or the native format if neither of those are supported), including GDB
           extensions if at all possible.

       <b>-gstabs</b>
           Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported), without GDB extensions.
           This is the format used by DBX on most BSD systems.  On MIPS, Alpha and System V Release 4
           systems this option produces stabs debugging output which is not understood by DBX or SDB.  On
           System V Release 4 systems this option requires the GNU assembler.

       <b>-flimit-debug-info</b>
           Limit debug information produced to reduce size of debug binary.

       <b>-feliminate-unused-debug-symbols</b>
           Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported), for only symbols that are
           actually used.

       <b>-gstabs+</b>
           Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported), using GNU extensions
           understood only by the GNU debugger (GDB).  The use of these extensions is likely to make other
           debuggers crash or refuse to read the program.

       <b>-gdwarf-2</b>
           Produce debugging information in DWARF version 2 format (if that is supported).  This is the
           format used by DBX on IRIX 6.  With this option, GCC uses features of DWARF version 3 when they
           are useful; version 3 is upward compatible with version 2, but may still cause problems for older
           debuggers.

           (Other debug formats, such as <b>-gcoff</b>, are not supported in Darwin or Mac OS X.)

       <b>-g</b><u>level</u>
       <b>-ggdb</b><u>level</u>
       <b>-gstabs</b><u>level</u>
           Request debugging information and also use <u>level</u> to specify how much information.  The default
           level is 2.

           Level 0 produces no debug information at all.  Thus, <b>-g0</b> negates <b>-g</b>.

           Level 1 produces minimal information, enough for making backtraces in parts of the program that
           you don't plan to debug.  This includes descriptions of functions and external variables, but no
           information about local variables and no line numbers.

           Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the macro definitions present in the program.
           Some debuggers support macro expansion when you use <b>-g3</b>.

           <b>-gdwarf-2</b> does not accept a concatenated debug level, because GCC used to support an option
           <b>-gdwarf</b> that meant to generate debug information in version 1 of the DWARF format (which is very
           different from version 2), and it would have been too confusing.  That debug format is long
           obsolete, but the option cannot be changed now.  Instead use an additional <b>-g</b><u>level</u> option to
           change the debug level for DWARF2.

       <b>-feliminate-dwarf2-dups</b>
           Compress DWARF2 debugging information by eliminating duplicated information about each symbol.
           This option only makes sense when generating DWARF2 debugging information with <b>-gdwarf-2</b>.

       <b>-p</b>  Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the analysis program <b>prof</b>.  You
           must use this option when compiling the source files you want data about, and you must also use
           it when linking.

       <b>-pg</b> Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the analysis program <b>gprof</b>.  You
           must use this option when compiling the source files you want data about, and you must also use
           it when linking.

       <b>-Q</b>  Makes the compiler print out each function name as it is compiled, and print some statistics
           about each pass when it finishes.

       <b>-ftime-report</b>
           Makes the compiler print some statistics about the time consumed by each pass when it finishes.

       <b>-fmem-report</b>
           Makes the compiler print some statistics about permanent memory allocation when it finishes.

       <b>-fopt-diary</b>
           Enable optimization diary entries using DWARF encoding. This option does nothing unless <b>gdwarf-2</b>
           is specified.

       <b>-fprofile-arcs</b>
           Add code so that program flow <u>arcs</u> are instrumented.  During execution the program records how
           many times each branch and call is executed and how many times it is taken or returns.  When the
           compiled program exits it saves this data to a file called <u>auxname.gcda</u> for each source file.
           The data may be used for profile-directed optimizations (<b>-fbranch-probabilities</b>), or for test
           coverage analysis (<b>-ftest-coverage</b>).  Each object file's <u>auxname</u> is generated from the name of
           the output file, if explicitly specified and it is not the final executable, otherwise it is the
           basename of the source file.  In both cases any suffix is removed (e.g. <u>foo.gcda</u> for input file
           <u>dir/foo.c</u>, or <u>dir/foo.gcda</u> for output file specified as <b>-o</b> <b>dir/foo.o</b>).

           @bullet
               Compile the source files with <b>-fprofile-arcs</b> plus optimization and code generation options.
               For test coverage analysis, use the additional <b>-ftest-coverage</b> option.  You do not need to
               profile every source file in a program.

           @cvmmfu
               Link your object files with <b>-lgcov</b> or <b>-fprofile-arcs</b> (the latter implies the former).

           @dwnngv
               Run the program on a representative workload to generate the arc profile information.  This
               may be repeated any number of times.  You can run concurrent instances of your program, and
               provided that the file system supports locking, the data files will be correctly updated.
               Also "fork" calls are detected and correctly handled (double counting will not happen).

           @exoohw
               For profile-directed optimizations, compile the source files again with the same optimization
               and code generation options plus <b>-fbranch-probabilities</b>.

           @fyppix
               For test coverage analysis, use <b>gcov</b> to produce human readable information from the <u>.gcno</u> and
               <u>.gcda</u> files.  Refer to the <b>gcov</b> documentation for further information.

           With <b>-fprofile-arcs</b>, for each function of your program GCC creates a program flow graph, then
           finds a spanning tree for the graph.  Only arcs that are not on the spanning tree have to be
           instrumented: the compiler adds code to count the number of times that these arcs are executed.
           When an arc is the only exit or only entrance to a block, the instrumentation code can be added
           to the block; otherwise, a new basic block must be created to hold the instrumentation code.

       <b>-ftree-based-profiling</b>
           This option is used in addition to <b>-fprofile-arcs</b> or <b>-fbranch-probabilities</b> to control whether
           those optimizations are performed on a tree-based or rtl-based internal representation.  If you
           use this option when compiling with <b>-fprofile-arcs</b>, you must also use it when compiling later
           with <b>-fbranch-probabilities</b>.  Currently the tree-based optimization is in an early stage of
           development, and this option is recommended only for those people working on improving it.

       <b>-ftest-coverage</b>
           Produce a notes file that the <b>gcov</b> code-coverage utility can use to show program coverage.  Each
           source file's note file is called <u>auxname.gcno</u>.  Refer to the <b>-fprofile-arcs</b> option above for a
           description of <u>auxname</u> and instructions on how to generate test coverage data.  Coverage data
           will match the source files more closely, if you do not optimize.

       <b>-d</b><u>letters</u>
       <b>-fdump-rtl-</b><u>pass</u>
           Says to make debugging dumps during compilation at times specified by <u>letters</u>.    This is used
           for debugging the RTL-based passes of the compiler.  The file names for most of the dumps are
           made by appending a pass number and a word to the <u>dumpname</u>.  <u>dumpname</u> is generated from the name
           of the output file, if explicitly specified and it is not an executable, otherwise it is the
           basename of the source file.

           Most debug dumps can be enabled either passing a letter to the <b>-d</b> option, or with a long
           <b>-fdump-rtl</b> switch; here are the possible letters for use in <u>letters</u> and <u>pass</u>, and their meanings:

           <b>-dA</b> Annotate the assembler output with miscellaneous debugging information.

       <b>-fdump-unnumbered</b>
           When doing debugging dumps (see <b>-d</b> option above), suppress instruction numbers and line number

           with different options, in particular with and without <b>-g</b>.

       <b>-fdump-translation-unit</b> (C and C++ only)
       <b>-fdump-translation-unit-</b><u>options</u> (C and C++ only)
           Dump a representation of the tree structure for the entire translation unit to a file.  The file
           name is made by appending <u>.tu</u> to the source file name.  If the <b>-</b><u>options</u> form is used, <u>options</u>
           controls the details of the dump as described for the <b>-fdump-tree</b> options.

       <b>-fdump-class-hierarchy-</b><u>options</u> (C++ only)
           Dump a representation of each class's hierarchy and virtual function table layout to a file.  The
           file name is made by appending <u>.class</u> to the source file name.  If the <b>-</b><u>options</u> form is used,
           <u>options</u> controls the details of the dump as described for the <b>-fdump-tree</b> options.

       <b>-fdump-ipa-</b><u>switch</u>
           Control the dumping at various stages of inter-procedural analysis language tree to a file.  The
           file name is generated by appending a switch specific suffix to the source file name.  The
           following dumps are possible:

           <b>all</b> Enables all inter-procedural analysis dumps; currently the only produced dump is the <b>cgraph</b>
               dump.

           <b>cgraph</b>
               Dumps information about call-graph optimization, unused function removal, and inlining
               decisions.

       <b>-fdump-tree-</b><u>switch</u> (C and C++ only)
       <b>-fdump-tree-</b><u>switch</u><b>-</b><u>options</u> (C and C++ only)
           Control the dumping at various stages of processing the intermediate language tree to a file.
           The file name is generated by appending a switch specific suffix to the source file name.  If the
           <b>-</b><u>options</u> form is used, <u>options</u> is a list of <b>-</b> separated options that control the details of the
           dump.  Not all options are applicable to all dumps, those which are not meaningful will be
           ignored.  The following options are available

           <b>address</b>
               Print the address of each node.  Usually this is not meaningful as it changes according to
               the environment and source file.  Its primary use is for tying up a dump file with a debug
               environment.

           <b>slim</b>
               Inhibit dumping of members of a scope or body of a function merely because that scope has
               been reached.  Only dump such items when they are directly reachable by some other path.
               When dumping pretty-printed trees, this option inhibits dumping the bodies of control
               structures.

           <b>raw</b> Print a raw representation of the tree.  By default, trees are pretty-printed into a C-like
               representation.

           <b>details</b>
               Enable more detailed dumps (not honored by every dump option).

           <b>stats</b>
               Enable dumping various statistics about the pass (not honored by every dump option).

           <b>blocks</b>
               Enable showing basic block boundaries (disabled in raw dumps).

           <b>vops</b>
               Enable showing virtual operands for every statement.

           <b>lineno</b>
               Enable showing line numbers for statements.

           <b>uid</b> Enable showing the unique ID ("DECL_UID") for each variable.

           <b>all</b> Turn on all options, except <b>raw</b>, <b>slim</b> and <b>lineno</b>.

           The following tree dumps are possible:

           <b>original</b>
               Dump before any tree based optimization, to <u>file.original</u>.

           <b>optimized</b>
               Dump after all tree based optimization, to <u>file.optimized</u>.

               Dump after function inlining, to <u>file.inlined</u>.

           <b>gimple</b>
               Dump each function before and after the gimplification pass to a file.  The file name is made

           <b>cfg</b> Dump the control flow graph of each function to a file.  The file name is made by appending
               <u>.cfg</u> to the source file name.

           <b>vcg</b> Dump the control flow graph of each function to a file in VCG format.  The file name is made
               by appending <u>.vcg</u> to the source file name.  Note that if the file contains more than one
               function, the generated file cannot be used directly by VCG.  You will need to cut and paste
               each function's graph into its own separate file first.

           <b>ch</b>  Dump each function after copying loop headers.  The file name is made by appending <u>.ch</u> to the
               source file name.

           <b>ssa</b> Dump SSA related information to a file.  The file name is made by appending <u>.ssa</u> to the

               Dump each function after optimizing PHI nodes into straightline code.  The file name is made
               by appending <u>.phiopt</u> to the source file name.

           <b>forwprop</b>
               Dump each function after forward propagating single use variables.  The file name is made by
               appending <u>.forwprop</u> to the source file name.

           <b>copyrename</b>
               Dump each function after applying the copy rename optimization.  The file name is made by
               appending <u>.copyrename</u> to the source file name.

           <b>nrv</b> Dump each function after applying the named return value optimization on generic trees.  The
               file name is made by appending <u>.nrv</u> to the source file name.

           <b>loop</b>

           <b>vect</b>
               Dump each function after applying vectorization of loops.  The file name is made by appending
               <u>.vect</u> to the source file name.

           <b>all</b> Enable all the available tree dumps with the flags provided in this option.

       <b>-ftree-vectorizer-verbose=</b><u>n</u>
           This option controls the amount of debugging output the vectorizer prints.  This information is
           written to standard error, unless <b>-fdump-tree-all</b> or <b>-fdump-tree-vect</b> is specified, in which case
           it is output to the usual dump listing file, <u>.vect</u>.

       <b>-frandom-seed=</b><u>string</u>
           This option provides a seed that GCC uses when it would otherwise use random numbers.  It is used
           to generate certain symbol names that have to be different in every compiled file.  It is also
           used to place unique stamps in coverage data files and the object files that produce them.  You
           can use the <b>-frandom-seed</b> option to produce reproducibly identical object files.

           The <u>string</u> should be different for every file you compile.

       <b>-fsched-verbose=</b><u>n</u>
           On targets that use instruction scheduling, this option controls the amount of debugging output
           the scheduler prints.  This information is written to standard error, unless <b>-dS</b> or <b>-dR</b> is
           specified, in which case it is output to the usual dump listing file, <u>.sched</u> or <u>.sched2</u>
           respectively.  However for <u>n</u> greater than nine, the output is always printed to standard error.

           For <u>n</u> greater than zero, <b>-fsched-verbose</b> outputs the same information as <b>-dRS</b>.  For <u>n</u> greater
           than one, it also output basic block probabilities, detailed ready list information and unit/insn
           info.  For <u>n</u> greater than two, it includes RTL at abort point, control-flow and regions info.
           And for <u>n</u> over four, <b>-fsched-verbose</b> also includes dependence info.

       <b>-save-temps</b>
           Store the usual ``temporary'' intermediate files permanently; place them in the current directory
           and name them based on the source file.  Thus, compiling <u>foo.c</u> with <b>-c</b> <b>-save-temps</b> would produce
           files <u>foo.i</u> and <u>foo.s</u>, as well as <u>foo.o</u>.  This creates a preprocessed <u>foo.i</u> output file even
           though the compiler now normally uses an integrated preprocessor.

           When used in combination with the <b>-x</b> command line option, <b>-save-temps</b> is sensible enough to avoid
           over writing an input source file with the same extension as an intermediate file.  The
           corresponding intermediate file may be obtained by renaming the source file before using
           <b>-save-temps</b>.

       <b>-time</b>
           Report the CPU time taken by each subprocess in the compilation sequence.  For C source files,
           this is the compiler proper and assembler (plus the linker if linking is done).  The output looks
           like this:

                   # cc1 0.12 0.01
                   # as 0.00 0.01

           The first number on each line is the ``user time'', that is time spent executing the program
           itself.  The second number is ``system time'', time spent executing operating system routines on
           behalf of the program.  Both numbers are in seconds.

       <b>-fvar-tracking</b>
           Run variable tracking pass.  It computes where variables are stored at each position in code.
           Better debugging information is then generated (if the debugging information format supports this
           information).

           It is enabled by default when compiling with optimization (<b>-Os</b>, <b>-O</b>, <b>-O2</b>, <b>-Oz</b> (APPLE ONLY), ...),
           debugging information (<b>-g</b>) and the debug info format supports it.

       <b>-print-file-name=</b><u>library</u>
           Print the full absolute name of the library file <u>library</u> that would be used when linking---and
           don't do anything else.  With this option, GCC does not compile or link anything; it just prints
           the file name.

       <b>-print-multi-directory</b>
           Print the directory name corresponding to the multilib selected by any other switches present in
           the command line.  This directory is supposed to exist in <b>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</b>.

       <b>-print-multi-lib</b>
           Print the mapping from multilib directory names to compiler switches that enable them.  The
           directory name is separated from the switches by <b>;</b>, and each switch starts with an <b>@}</b> <b>instead</b> <b>of</b>
           <b>the</b> <b>@samp{-</b>, without spaces between multiple switches.  This is supposed to ease shell-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">processing.&nbsp;shellprocessing.</font>
           processing.

       <b>-print-prog-name=</b><u>program</u>
           Like <b>-print-file-name</b>, but searches for a program such as <b>cpp</b>.

       <b>-print-libgcc-file-name</b>
           Same as <b>-print-file-name=libgcc.a</b>.

           This is useful when you use <b>-nostdlib</b> or <b>-nodefaultlibs</b> but you do want to link with <u>libgcc.a</u>.
           You can do

                   gcc -nostdlib &lt;files&gt;... `gcc -print-libgcc-file-name`

       <b>-print-search-dirs</b>
           Print the name of the configured installation directory and a list of program and library
           directories <b>gcc</b> will search---and don't do anything else.

           This is useful when <b>gcc</b> prints the error message <b>installation</b> <b>problem,</b> <b>cannot</b> <b>exec</b> <b>cpp0:</b> <b>No</b> <b>such</b>
           <b>file</b> <b>or</b> <b>directory</b>.  To resolve this you either need to put <u>cpp0</u> and the other compiler components
           where <b>gcc</b> expects to find them, or you can set the environment variable <b>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</b> to the
           directory where you installed them.  Don't forget the trailing <b>/</b>.

       <b>-dumpmachine</b>
           Print the compiler's target machine (for example, <b>i686-pc-linux-gnu</b>)---and don't do anything
           else.

       <b>-dumpversion</b>
           Print the compiler version (for example, <b>3.0</b>)---and don't do anything else.

       <b>-dumpspecs</b>
           Print the compiler's built-in specs---and don't do anything else.  (This is used when GCC itself
           is being built.)

       <b>-feliminate-unused-debug-types</b>
           Normally, when producing DWARF2 output, GCC will emit debugging information for all types
           declared in a compilation unit, regardless of whether or not they are actually used in that
           compilation unit.  Sometimes this is useful, such as if, in the debugger, you want to cast a
           value to a type that is not actually used in your program (but is declared).  More often,
           however, this results in a significant amount of wasted space.  With this option, GCC will avoid
           producing debug symbol output for types that are nowhere used in the source file being compiled.

       <b>Options</b> <b>That</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Optimization</b>

       These options control various sorts of optimizations.

       Without any optimization option, the compiler's goal is to reduce the cost of compilation and to make
       debugging produce the expected results.  Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a
       breakpoint between statements, you can then assign a new value to any variable or change the program
       counter to any other statement in the function and get exactly the results you would expect from the
       source code.

       Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt to improve the performance and/or code size
       at the expense of compilation time and possibly the ability to debug the program.

       The compiler performs optimization based on the knowledge it has of the program.  Optimization levels
       <b>-O2</b> and above, in particular, enable <u>unit-at-a-time</u> mode, which allows the compiler to consider
       information gained from later functions in the file when compiling a function.  Compiling multiple
       files at once to a single output file in <u>unit-at-a-time</u> mode allows the compiler to use information
       gained from all of the files when compiling each of them.

       Not all optimizations are controlled directly by a flag.  Only optimizations that have a flag are
       listed.

       <b>-O</b>
       <b>-O1</b> Optimize.  Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time, and a lot more memory for a large
           function.

           With <b>-O</b>, the compiler tries to reduce code size and execution time, without performing any
           optimizations that take a great deal of compilation time.

           <b>-O</b> turns on the following optimization flags: <b>-fdefer-pop</b> <b>-fdelayed-branch</b>
           <b>-fguess-branch-probability</b> <b>-fcprop-registers</b> <b>-floop-optimize</b> <b>-fif-conversion</b> <b>-fif-conversion2</b>
           <b>-ftree-ccp</b> <b>-ftree-dce</b> <b>-ftree-dominator-opts</b> <b>-ftree-dse</b> <b>-ftree-ter</b> <b>-ftree-lrs</b> <b>-ftree-sra</b>
           <b>-ftree-copyrename</b> <b>-ftree-fre</b> <b>-ftree-ch</b> <b>-fmerge-constants</b>

           <b>-O</b> also turns on <b>-fomit-frame-pointer</b> on machines where doing so does not interfere with
           debugging.

           <b>-O</b> doesn't turn on <b>-ftree-sra</b> for the Ada compiler.  This option must be explicitly specified on
           the command line to be enabled for the Ada compiler.

       <b>-O2</b> Optimize even more.  GCC performs nearly all supported optimizations that do not involve a space-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">speed&nbsp;spacespeed</font>
           speed tradeoff.  The compiler does not perform loop unrolling or function inlining when you
           specify <b>-O2</b>.  As compared to <b>-O</b>, this option increases both compilation time and the performance
           of the generated code.

           <b>-O2</b> turns on all optimization flags specified by <b>-O</b>.  It also turns on the following optimization
           flags: <b>-fthread-jumps</b> <b>-fcrossjumping</b> <b>-foptimize-sibling-calls</b> <b>-fcse-follow-jumps</b>
           <b>-fcse-skip-blocks</b> <b>-fgcse</b>  <b>-fgcse-lm</b> <b>-fexpensive-optimizations</b> <b>-fstrength-reduce</b>
           <b>-frerun-cse-after-loop</b>  <b>-frerun-loop-opt</b> <b>-fcaller-saves</b> <b>-fforce-mem</b> <b>-fpeephole2</b> <b>-fschedule-insns</b>
           <b>-fschedule-insns2</b> <b>-fsched-interblock</b>  <b>-fsched-spec</b> <b>-fregmove</b> <b>-fstrict-aliasing</b>
           <b>-fdelete-null-pointer-checks</b> <b>-freorder-blocks</b>  <b>-freorder-functions</b> <b>-funit-at-a-time</b>
           <b>-falign-functions</b>  <b>-falign-jumps</b> <b>-falign-loops</b>  <b>-falign-labels</b> <b>-ftree-pre</b>

           Please note the warning under <b>-fgcse</b> about invoking <b>-O2</b> on programs that use computed gotos.

           In Apple's version of GCC, <b>-fstrict-aliasing</b>, <b>-freorder-blocks</b>, and <b>-fsched-interblock</b> are
           disabled by default when optimizing.

       <b>-O3</b> Optimize yet more.  <b>-O3</b> turns on all optimizations specified by <b>-O2</b> and also turns on the
           <b>-finline-functions</b>, <b>-funswitch-loops</b> and <b>-fgcse-after-reload</b> options.

       <b>-O0</b> Do not optimize.  This is the default.

       <b>-fast</b>
           Optimize for maximum performance. <b>-fast</b> changes the overall optimization strategy of GCC in order
           to produce the fastest possible running code for PPC7450 and G5 architectures. By default, <b>-fast</b>
           optimizes for G5. Programs optimized for G5 will not run on PPC7450. To optimize for PPC7450, add
           <b>-mcpu=7450</b> on command line.

           <b>-fast</b> currently enables the following optimization flags (for G5 and PPC7450).  These flags may
           change in the future.  You cannot override any of these options if you use <b>-fast</b> except by
           setting <b>-mcpu=7450</b> (or <b>-fPIC</b>, see below).

           <b>-O3</b> <b>-falign-loops-max-skip=15</b> <b>-falign-jumps-max-skip=15</b> <b>-falign-loops=16</b> <b>-falign-jumps=16</b>
           <b>-falign-functions=16</b> <b>-malign-natural</b> <b>(except</b> <b>when</b> <b>-fastf</b> <b>is</b> <b>specified)</b> <b>-ffast-math</b>
           <b>-fstrict-aliasing</b> <b>-funroll-loops</b> <b>-ftree-loop-linear</b> <b>-ftree-loop-memset</b> <b>-mcpu=G5</b> <b>-mpowerpc-gpopt</b>
           <b>-mtune=G5</b>  <b>(unless</b> <b>-mtune=G4</b> <b>is</b> <b>specified).</b>  <b>-fsched-interblock</b> <b>-fgcse-sm</b> <b>-mpowerpc64</b>

           To build shared libraries with <b>-fast</b>, specify <b>-fPIC</b> on the command line as <b>-fast</b> turns on
           <b>-mdynamic-no-pic</b> otherwise.

           Important notes: <b>-ffast-math</b> results in code that is not necessarily IEEE-compliant.
           <b>-fstrict-aliasing</b> is highly likely to break non-standard-compliant programs.  <b>-malign-natural</b>
           only works properly if the entire program is compiled with it, and none of the standard
           headers/libraries contain any code that changes alignment when this option is used.

           On Intel target, <b>-fast</b> currently enables the following optimization flags:

           <b>-O3</b> <b>-fomit-frame-pointer</b> <b>-fstrict-aliasing</b> <b>-momit-leaf-frame-pointer</b> <b>-fno-tree-pre</b> <b>-falign-loops</b>

           All choices of flags enabled by <b>-fast</b> are subject to change without notice.

       <b>-Os</b> Optimize for size, but not at the expense of speed.  <b>-Os</b> enables all <b>-O2</b> optimizations that do
           not typically increase code size.  However, instructions are chosen for best performance,
           regardless of size.  To optimize solely for size on Darwin, use <b>-Oz</b> (APPLE ONLY).

           The following options are set for <b>-O2</b>, but are disabled under <b>-Os</b>: <b>-falign-functions</b>
           <b>-falign-jumps</b>  <b>-falign-loops</b> <b>-falign-labels</b>  <b>-freorder-blocks</b>  <b>-freorder-blocks-and-partition</b>
           <b>-fprefetch-loop-arrays</b>

           When optimizing with <b>-Os</b> or <b>-Oz</b> (APPLE ONLY) on Darwin, any function up to 30 ``estimated insns''
           in size will be considered for inlining.  When compiling C and Objective-C sourcefiles with <b>-Os</b>
           or <b>-Oz</b> on Darwin, functions explictly marked with the "inline" keyword up to 450 ``estimated
           insns'' in size will be considered for inlining.  When compiling for Apple POWERPC targets, <b>-Os</b>
           and <b>-Oz</b> (APPLE ONLY) disable use of the string instructions even though they would usually be
           smaller, because the kernel can't emulate them correctly in some rare cases.  This behavior is
           not portable to any other gcc environment, and will not affect most programs at all.  If you
           really want the string instructions, use -mstring.

       <b>-Oz</b> (APPLE ONLY) Optimize for size, regardless of performance.  <b>-Oz</b> enables the same optimization
           flags that <b>-Os</b> uses, but <b>-Oz</b> also enables other optimizations intended solely to reduce code
           size.  In particular, instructions that encode into fewer bytes are preferred over longer
           instructions that execute in fewer cycles.  <b>-Oz</b> on Darwin is very similar to <b>-Os</b> in FSF
           distributions of GCC.  <b>-Oz</b> employs the same inlining limits and avoids string instructions just
           like <b>-Os</b>.

           If you use multiple <b>-O</b> options, with or without level numbers, the last such option is the one
           that is effective.

       Options of the form <b>-f</b><u>flag</u> specify machine-independent flags.  Most flags have both positive and
       negative forms; the negative form of <b>-ffoo</b> would be <b>-fno-foo</b>.  In the table below, only one of the
       forms is listed---the one you typically will use.  You can figure out the other form by either
       removing <b>no-</b> or adding it.

       The following options control specific optimizations.  They are either activated by <b>-O</b> options or are
       related to ones that are.  You can use the following flags in the rare cases when ``fine-tuning'' of
       optimizations to be performed is desired.

       <b>-fno-default-inline</b>
           Do not make member functions inline by default merely because they are defined inside the class
           scope (C++ only).  Otherwise, when you specify <b>-O</b>, member functions defined inside class scope
           are compiled inline by default; i.e., you don't need to add <b>inline</b> in front of the member
           function name.

       <b>-fno-defer-pop</b>
           Always pop the arguments to each function call as soon as that function returns.  For machines
           which must pop arguments after a function call, the compiler normally lets arguments accumulate
           on the stack for several function calls and pops them all at once.

           Disabled at levels <b>-O</b>, <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>, <b>-Oz</b> (APPLE ONLY).

       <b>-fforce-mem</b>
           Force memory operands to be copied into registers before doing arithmetic on them.  This produces
           better code by making all memory references potential common subexpressions.  When they are not
           common subexpressions, instruction combination should eliminate the separate register-load.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>, <b>-Oz</b> (APPLE ONLY).

       <b>-fforce-addr</b>
           Force memory address constants to be copied into registers before doing arithmetic on them.  This
           may produce better code just as <b>-fforce-mem</b> may.

       <b>-fomit-frame-pointer</b>
           Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for functions that don't need one.  This avoids the
           instructions to save, set up and restore frame pointers; it also makes an extra register
           available in many functions.  <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>makes</b> <b>debugging</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>machines.</b>

           On some machines, such as the VAX, this flag has no effect, because the standard calling sequence
           automatically handles the frame pointer and nothing is saved by pretending it doesn't exist.  The
           machine-description macro "FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED" controls whether a target machine supports
           this flag.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O</b>, <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>, <b>-Oz</b> (APPLE ONLY).

       <b>-foptimize-sibling-calls</b>
           Optimize sibling and tail recursive calls.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>, <b>-Oz</b> (APPLE ONLY).

       <b>-fno-inline</b>
           Don't pay attention to the "inline" keyword.  Normally this option is used to keep the compiler
           from expanding any functions inline.  Note that if you are not optimizing, no functions can be
           expanded inline.

       <b>-finline-functions</b>
           Integrate all simple functions into their callers.  The compiler heuristically decides which
           functions are simple enough to be worth integrating in this way.

           If all calls to a given function are integrated, and the function is declared "static", then the
           function is normally not output as assembler code in its own right.

           Enabled at level <b>-O3</b>.

       <b>-finline-limit=</b><u>n</u>
           By default, GCC limits the size of functions that can be inlined.  This flag allows the control
           of this limit for functions that are explicitly marked as inline (i.e., marked with the inline
           keyword or defined within the class definition in c++).  <u>n</u> is the size of functions that can be
           inlined in number of pseudo instructions (not counting parameter handling).  The default value of
           <u>n</u> is 600.  Increasing this value can result in more inlined code at the cost of compilation time
           and memory consumption.  Decreasing usually makes the compilation faster and less code will be
           inlined (which presumably means slower programs).  This option is particularly useful for
           programs that use inlining heavily such as those based on recursive templates with C++.

           Inlining is actually controlled by a number of parameters, which may be specified individually by
           using <b>--param</b> <u>name</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>.  The <b>-finline-limit=</b><u>n</u> option sets some of these parameters as follows:

            @item max-inline-insns-single
             is set to I&lt;n&gt;/2.
            @item max-inline-insns-auto
             is set to I&lt;n&gt;/2.
            @item min-inline-insns
             is set to 130 or I&lt;n&gt;/4, whichever is smaller.
            @item max-inline-insns-rtl
             is set to I&lt;n&gt;.

           See below for a documentation of the individual parameters controlling inlining.

           <u>Note:</u> pseudo instruction represents, in this particular context, an abstract measurement of
           function's size.  In no way, it represents a count of assembly instructions and as such its exact
           meaning might change from one release to an another.

       <b>-fkeep-inline-functions</b>
           In C, emit "static" functions that are declared "inline" into the object file, even if the
           function has been inlined into all of its callers.  This switch does not affect functions using
           the "extern inline" extension in GNU C.  In C++, emit any and all inline functions into the
           object file.

       <b>-fkeep-static-consts</b>
           Emit variables declared "static const" when optimization isn't turned on, even if the variables
           aren't referenced.

           GCC enables this option by default.  If you want to force the compiler to check if the variable
           was referenced, regardless of whether or not optimization is turned on, use the
           <b>-fno-keep-static-consts</b> option.

       <b>-fmerge-constants</b>
           Attempt to merge identical constants (string constants and floating point constants) across
           compilation units.

           This option is the default for optimized compilation if the assembler and linker support it.  Use
           <b>-fno-merge-constants</b> to inhibit this behavior.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O</b>, <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>, <b>-Oz</b> (APPLE ONLY).

       <b>-fmerge-all-constants</b>
           Attempt to merge identical constants and identical variables.

           This option implies <b>-fmerge-constants</b>.  In addition to <b>-fmerge-constants</b> this considers e.g. even
           constant initialized arrays or initialized constant variables with integral or floating point
           types.  Languages like C or C++ require each non-automatic variable to have distinct location, so
           using this option will result in non-conforming behavior.

       <b>-fmodulo-sched</b>
           Perform swing modulo scheduling immediately before the first scheduling pass.  This pass looks at
           innermost loops and reorders their instructions by overlapping different iterations.

       <b>-fno-branch-count-reg</b>
           Do not use ``decrement and branch'' instructions on a count register, but instead generate a
           sequence of instructions that decrement a register, compare it against zero, then branch based
           upon the result.  This option is only meaningful on architectures that support such instructions,
           which include x86, PowerPC, IA-64 and S/390.

           The default is <b>-fbranch-count-reg</b>, enabled when <b>-fstrength-reduce</b> is enabled.

       <b>-fno-function-cse</b>
           Do not put function addresses in registers; make each instruction that calls a constant function
           contain the function's address explicitly.

           This option results in less efficient code, but some strange hacks that alter the assembler
           output may be confused by the optimizations performed when this option is not used.

           The default is <b>-ffunction-cse</b>

       <b>-fno-zero-initialized-in-bss</b>
           If the target supports a BSS section, GCC by default puts variables that are initialized to zero
           into BSS.  This can save space in the resulting code.

           This option turns off this behavior because some programs explicitly rely on variables going to
           the data section.  E.g., so that the resulting executable can find the beginning of that section
           and/or make assumptions based on that.

           The default is <b>-fzero-initialized-in-bss</b>.

       <b>-fbounds-check</b>
           For front-ends that support it, generate additional code to check that indices used to access
           arrays are within the declared range.  This is currently only supported by the Java and Fortran
           front-ends, where this option defaults to true and false respectively.

       <b>-fmudflap</b> <b>-fmudflapth</b> <b>-fmudflapir</b>
           For front-ends that support it (C and C++), instrument all risky pointer/array dereferencing
           operations, some standard library string/heap functions, and some other associated constructs
           with range/validity tests.  Modules so instrumented should be immune to buffer overflows, invalid
           heap use, and some other classes of C/C++ programming errors.  The instrumentation relies on a
           separate runtime library (<u>libmudflap</u>), which will be linked into a program if <b>-fmudflap</b> is given
           at link time.  Run-time behavior of the instrumented program is controlled by the <b>MUDFLAP_OPTIONS</b>
           environment variable.  See "env MUDFLAP_OPTIONS=-help a.out" for its options.

           Use <b>-fmudflapth</b> instead of <b>-fmudflap</b> to compile and to link if your program is multi-threaded.
           Use <b>-fmudflapir</b>, in addition to <b>-fmudflap</b> or <b>-fmudflapth</b>, if instrumentation should ignore
           pointer reads.  This produces less instrumentation (and therefore faster execution) and still
           provides some protection against outright memory corrupting writes, but allows erroneously read
           data to propagate within a program.

       <b>-fstrength-reduce</b>
           Perform the optimizations of loop strength reduction and elimination of iteration variables.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>, <b>-Oz</b> (APPLE ONLY).

       <b>-fthread-jumps</b>
           Perform optimizations where we check to see if a jump branches to a location where another
           comparison subsumed by the first is found.  If so, the first branch is redirected to either the
           destination of the second branch or a point immediately following it, depending on whether the
           condition is known to be true or false.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>, <b>-Oz</b> (APPLE ONLY).

       <b>-fcse-follow-jumps</b>
           In common subexpression elimination, scan through jump instructions when the target of the jump
           is not reached by any other path.  For example, when CSE encounters an "if" statement with an
           "else" clause, CSE will follow the jump when the condition tested is false.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>, <b>-Oz</b> (APPLE ONLY).

       <b>-fcse-skip-blocks</b>
           This is similar to <b>-fcse-follow-jumps</b>, but causes CSE to follow jumps which conditionally skip
           over blocks.  When CSE encounters a simple "if" statement with no else clause, <b>-fcse-skip-blocks</b>
           causes CSE to follow the jump around the body of the "if".

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>, <b>-Oz</b> (APPLE ONLY).

       <b>-frerun-cse-after-loop</b>
           Re-run common subexpression elimination after loop optimizations has been performed.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>, <b>-Oz</b> (APPLE ONLY).

       <b>-frerun-loop-opt</b>
           Run the loop optimizer twice.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>, <b>-Oz</b> (APPLE ONLY).

       <b>-fgcse</b>
           Perform a global common subexpression elimination pass.  This pass also performs global constant
           and copy propagation.

           <u>Note:</u> When compiling a program using computed gotos, a GCC extension, you may get better runtime
           performance if you disable the global common subexpression elimination pass by adding <b>-fno-gcse</b>
           to the command line.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>, <b>-Oz</b> (APPLE ONLY).

       <b>-fgcse-lm</b>
           When <b>-fgcse-lm</b> is enabled, global common subexpression elimination will attempt to move loads
           which are only killed by stores into themselves.  This allows a loop containing a load/store
           sequence to be changed to a load outside the loop, and a copy/store within the loop.

           Enabled by default when gcse is enabled.

       <b>-fgcse-sm</b>
           When <b>-fgcse-sm</b> is enabled, a store motion pass is run after global common subexpression
           elimination.  This pass will attempt to move stores out of loops.  When used in conjunction with
           <b>-fgcse-lm</b>, loops containing a load/store sequence can be changed to a load before the loop and a
           store after the loop.

           Not enabled at any optimization level.

       <b>-fgcse-las</b>
           When <b>-fgcse-las</b> is enabled, the global common subexpression elimination pass eliminates redundant
           loads that come after stores to the same memory location (both partial and full redundancies).

           Not enabled at any optimization level.

       <b>-fgcse-after-reload</b>
           When <b>-fgcse-after-reload</b> is enabled, a redundant load elimination pass is performed after reload.
           The purpose of this pass is to cleanup redundant spilling.

       <b>-floop-optimize</b>
           Perform loop optimizations: move constant expressions out of loops, simplify exit test conditions
           and optionally do strength-reduction as well.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O</b>, <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>, <b>-Oz</b> (APPLE ONLY).

       <b>-floop-optimize2</b>
           Perform loop optimizations using the new loop optimizer.  The optimizations (loop unrolling,
           peeling and unswitching, loop invariant motion) are enabled by separate flags.

       <b>-fcrossjumping</b>
           Perform cross-jumping transformation.  This transformation unifies equivalent code and save code
           size.  The resulting code may or may not perform better than without cross-jumping.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>, <b>-Oz</b> (APPLE ONLY).

       <b>-fif-conversion</b>
           Attempt to transform conditional jumps into branch-less equivalents.  This include use of
           conditional moves, min, max, set flags and abs instructions, and some tricks doable by standard
           arithmetics.  The use of conditional execution on chips where it is available is controlled by
           "if-conversion2".

           Enabled at levels <b>-O</b>, <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>, <b>-Oz</b> (APPLE ONLY).

       <b>-fif-conversion2</b>
           Use conditional execution (where available) to transform conditional jumps into branch-less
           equivalents.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O</b>, <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>, <b>-Oz</b> (APPLE ONLY).

       <b>-fdelete-null-pointer-checks</b>
           Use global dataflow analysis to identify and eliminate useless checks for null pointers.  The
           compiler assumes that dereferencing a null pointer would have halted the program.  If a pointer
           is checked after it has already been dereferenced, it cannot be null.

           In some environments, this assumption is not true, and programs can safely dereference null
           pointers.  Use <b>-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks</b> to disable this optimization for programs which
           depend on that behavior.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>, <b>-Oz</b> (APPLE ONLY).

       <b>-fexpensive-optimizations</b>
           Perform a number of minor optimizations that are relatively expensive.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>, <b>-Oz</b> (APPLE ONLY).

       <b>-foptimize-register-move</b>
       <b>-fregmove</b>
           Attempt to reassign register numbers in move instructions and as operands of other simple
           instructions in order to maximize the amount of register tying.  This is especially helpful on
           machines with two-operand instructions.

           Note <b>-fregmove</b> and <b>-foptimize-register-move</b> are the same optimization.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>, <b>-Oz</b> (APPLE ONLY).

       <b>-fdelayed-branch</b>
           If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder instructions to exploit instruction slots
           available after delayed branch instructions.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O</b>, <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>, <b>-Oz</b> (APPLE ONLY).

       <b>-fschedule-insns</b>
           If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder instructions to eliminate execution
           stalls due to required data being unavailable.  This helps machines that have slow floating point
           or memory load instructions by allowing other instructions to be issued until the result of the
           load or floating point instruction is required.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>, <b>-Oz</b> (APPLE ONLY).

       <b>-fschedule-insns2</b>
           Similar to <b>-fschedule-insns</b>, but requests an additional pass of instruction scheduling after
           register allocation has been done.  This is especially useful on machines with a relatively small
           number of registers and where memory load instructions take more than one cycle.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>, <b>-Oz</b> (APPLE ONLY).

       <b>-fno-sched-interblock</b>
           Don't schedule instructions across basic blocks.  This is normally enabled by default when
           scheduling before register allocation, i.e.  with <b>-fschedule-insns</b> or at <b>-O2</b> or higher.

       <b>-fno-sched-spec</b>
           Don't allow speculative motion of non-load instructions.  This is normally enabled by default
           when scheduling before register allocation, i.e.  with <b>-fschedule-insns</b> or at <b>-O2</b> or higher.

       <b>-fsched-spec-load</b>
           Allow speculative motion of some load instructions.  This only makes sense when scheduling before
           register allocation, i.e. with <b>-fschedule-insns</b> or at <b>-O2</b> or higher.

       <b>-fsched-spec-load-dangerous</b>
           Allow speculative motion of more load instructions.  This only makes sense when scheduling before
           register allocation, i.e. with <b>-fschedule-insns</b> or at <b>-O2</b> or higher.

       <b>-fsched-stalled-insns=</b><u>n</u>
           Define how many insns (if any) can be moved prematurely from the queue of stalled insns into the
           ready list, during the second scheduling pass.

       <b>-fsched-stalled-insns-dep=</b><u>n</u>
           Define how many insn groups (cycles) will be examined for a dependency on a stalled insn that is
           candidate for premature removal from the queue of stalled insns.  Has an effect only during the
           second scheduling pass, and only if <b>-fsched-stalled-insns</b> is used and its value is not zero.

       <b>-fsched2-use-superblocks</b>
           When scheduling after register allocation, do use superblock scheduling algorithm.  Superblock
           scheduling allows motion across basic block boundaries resulting on faster schedules.  This
           option is experimental, as not all machine descriptions used by GCC model the CPU closely enough
           to avoid unreliable results from the algorithm.

           This only makes sense when scheduling after register allocation, i.e. with <b>-fschedule-insns2</b> or
           at <b>-O2</b> or higher.

       <b>-fsched2-use-traces</b>
           Use <b>-fsched2-use-superblocks</b> algorithm when scheduling after register allocation and additionally
           perform code duplication in order to increase the size of superblocks using tracer pass.  See
           <b>-ftracer</b> for details on trace formation.

           This mode should produce faster but significantly longer programs.  Also without
           <b>-fbranch-probabilities</b> the traces constructed may not match the reality and hurt the performance.
           This only makes sense when scheduling after register allocation, i.e. with <b>-fschedule-insns2</b> or
           at <b>-O2</b> or higher.

       <b>-freschedule-modulo-scheduled-loops</b>
           The modulo scheduling comes before the traditional scheduling, if a loop was modulo scheduled we
           may want to prevent the later scheduling passes from changing its schedule, we use this option to
           control that.

       <b>-fcaller-saves</b>
           Enable values to be allocated in registers that will be clobbered by function calls, by emitting
           extra instructions to save and restore the registers around such calls.  Such allocation is done
           only when it seems to result in better code than would otherwise be produced.

           This option is always enabled by default on certain machines, usually those which have no call-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">preserved&nbsp;callpreserved</font>
           preserved registers to use instead.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>, <b>-Oz</b> (APPLE ONLY).

       <b>-ftree-pre</b>
           Perform Partial Redundancy Elimination (PRE) on trees.  This flag is enabled by default at <b>-O2</b>
           and <b>-O3</b>.

       <b>-ftree-fre</b>
           Perform Full Redundancy Elimination (FRE) on trees.  The difference between FRE and PRE is that
           FRE only considers expressions that are computed on all paths leading to the redundant
           computation.  This analysis faster than PRE, though it exposes fewer redundancies.  This flag is
           enabled by default at <b>-O</b> and higher.

       <b>-ftree-ccp</b>
           Perform sparse conditional constant propagation (CCP) on trees.  This flag is enabled by default
           at <b>-O</b> and higher.

       <b>-ftree-dce</b>
           Perform dead code elimination (DCE) on trees.  This flag is enabled by default at <b>-O</b> and higher.

       <b>-ftree-dominator-opts</b>
           Perform dead code elimination (DCE) on trees.  This flag is enabled by default at <b>-O</b> and higher.

       <b>-ftree-ch</b>
           Perform loop header copying on trees.  This is beneficial since it increases effectiveness of
           code motion optimizations.  It also saves one jump.  This flag is enabled by default at <b>-O</b> and
           higher.  It is not enabled for <b>-Os</b> or <b>-Oz</b> (APPLE ONLY), since it usually increases code size.

       <b>-ftree-elim-checks</b>
           Perform elimination of checks based on scalar evolution informations.  This flag is disabled by
           default.

       <b>-ftree-loop-optimize</b>
           Perform loop optimizations on trees.  This flag is enabled by default at <b>-O</b> and higher.

       <b>-ftree-loop-linear</b>
           Perform linear loop transformations on tree.  This flag can improve cache performance and allow
           further loop optimizations to take place.  This flag is known to have bugs that cause incorrect
           code to be generated in some rare cases. Note this flag is included in -fast.

       <b>-ftree-loop-im</b>
           Perform loop invariant motion on trees.  This pass moves only invariants that would be hard to
           handle at RTL level (function calls, operations that expand to nontrivial sequences of insns).
           With <b>-funswitch-loops</b> it also moves operands of conditions that are invariant out of the loop, so
           that we can use just trivial invariantness analysis in loop unswitching.  The pass also includes
           store motion.

       <b>-ftree-loop-ivcanon</b>
           Create a canonical counter for number of iterations in the loop for that determining number of
           iterations requires complicated analysis.  Later optimizations then may determine the number
           easily.  Useful especially in connection with unrolling.

       <b>-fivopts</b>
           Perform induction variable optimizations (strength reduction, induction variable merging and
           induction variable elimination) on trees.

       <b>-ftree-sra</b>
           Perform scalar replacement of aggregates.  This pass replaces structure references with scalars
           to prevent committing structures to memory too early.  This flag is enabled by default at <b>-O</b> and
           higher.

       <b>-ftree-copyrename</b>
           Perform copy renaming on trees.  This pass attempts to rename compiler temporaries to other
           variables at copy locations, usually resulting in variable names which more closely resemble the
           original variables.  This flag is enabled by default at <b>-O</b> and higher.

       <b>-ftree-ter</b>
           Perform temporary expression replacement during the SSA-&gt;normal phase.  Single use/single def
           temporaries are replaced at their use location with their defining expression.  This results in
           non-GIMPLE code, but gives the expanders much more complex trees to work on resulting in better
           RTL generation.  This is enabled by default at <b>-O</b> and higher.

       <b>-ftree-lrs</b>
           Perform live range splitting during the SSA-&gt;normal phase.  Distinct live ranges of a variable
           are split into unique variables, allowing for better optimization later.  This is enabled by
           default at <b>-O</b> and higher.

       <b>-ftree-vectorize</b>
           Perform loop vectorization on trees.

           In Apple's version of GCC, <b>-fstrict-aliasing</b> is enabled by default when loop vectorization is
           enabled. See <b>-fstrict-aliasing</b> document for more information.

       <b>-ftracer</b>
           Perform tail duplication to enlarge superblock size.  This transformation simplifies the control
           flow of the function allowing other optimizations to do better job.

       <b>-funroll-loops</b>
           Unroll loops whose number of iterations can be determined at compile time or upon entry to the
           loop.  <b>-funroll-loops</b> implies both <b>-fstrength-reduce</b> and <b>-frerun-cse-after-loop</b>.  This option
           makes code larger, and may or may not make it run faster.

       <b>-funroll-all-loops</b>
           Unroll all loops, even if their number of iterations is uncertain when the loop is entered.  This
           usually makes programs run more slowly.  <b>-funroll-all-loops</b> implies the same options as
           <b>-funroll-loops</b>,

       <b>-fsplit-ivs-in-unroller</b>
           Enables expressing of values of induction variables in later iterations of the unrolled loop
           using the value in the first iteration.  This breaks long dependency chains, thus improving
           efficiency of the scheduling passes.

           Combination of <b>-fweb</b> and CSE is often sufficient to obtain the same effect.  However in cases the
           loop body is more complicated than a single basic block, this is not reliable.  It also does not
           work at all on some of the architectures due to restrictions in the CSE pass.

           This optimization is enabled by default.

       <b>-fvariable-expansion-in-unroller</b>
           With this option, the compiler will create multiple copies of some local variables when unrolling
           a loop which can result in superior code.

       <b>-fprefetch-loop-arrays</b>
           If supported by the target machine, generate instructions to prefetch memory to improve the
           performance of loops that access large arrays.

           These options may generate better or worse code; results are highly dependent on the structure of
           loops within the source code.

       <b>-fno-peephole</b>
       <b>-fno-peephole2</b>
           Disable any machine-specific peephole optimizations.  The difference between <b>-fno-peephole</b> and
           <b>-fno-peephole2</b> is in how they are implemented in the compiler; some targets use one, some use the
           other, a few use both.

           <b>-fpeephole</b> is enabled by default.  <b>-fpeephole2</b> enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>, <b>-Oz</b> (APPLE ONLY).

       <b>-fno-guess-branch-probability</b>
           Do not guess branch probabilities using heuristics.

           GCC will use heuristics to guess branch probabilities if they are not provided by profiling
           feedback (<b>-fprofile-arcs</b>).  These heuristics are based on the control flow graph.  If some branch
           probabilities are specified by <b>__builtin_expect</b>, then the heuristics will be used to guess branch
           probabilities for the rest of the control flow graph, taking the <b>__builtin_expect</b> info into
           account.  The interactions between the heuristics and <b>__builtin_expect</b> can be complex, and in
           some cases, it may be useful to disable the heuristics so that the effects of <b>__builtin_expect</b>
           are easier to understand.

           The default is <b>-fguess-branch-probability</b> at levels <b>-O</b>, <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>, <b>-Oz</b> (APPLE ONLY).

       <b>-freorder-blocks</b>
           Reorder basic blocks in the compiled function in order to reduce number of taken branches and
           improve code locality.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>.

       <b>-freorder-blocks-and-partition</b>
           In addition to reordering basic blocks in the compiled function, in order to reduce number of
           taken branches, partitions hot and cold basic blocks into separate sections of the assembly and
           .o files, to improve paging and cache locality performance.

           This optimization is automatically turned off in the presence of exception handling, for linkonce
           sections, for functions with a user-defined section attribute and on any architecture that does
           not support named sections.

       <b>-freorder-functions</b>
           Reorder functions in the object file in order to improve code locality.  This is implemented by
           using special subsections ".text.hot" for most frequently executed functions and ".text.unlikely"
           for unlikely executed functions.  Reordering is done by the linker so object file format must
           support named sections and linker must place them in a reasonable way.

           Also profile feedback must be available in to make this option effective.  See <b>-fprofile-arcs</b> for
           details.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>, <b>-Oz</b> (APPLE ONLY).

       <b>-fstrict-aliasing</b>
           Allows the compiler to assume the strictest aliasing rules applicable to the language being
           compiled.  For C (and C++), this activates optimizations based on the type of expressions.  In
           particular, an object of one type is assumed never to reside at the same address as an object of
           a different type, unless the types are almost the same.  For example, an "unsigned int" can alias
           an "int", but not a "void*" or a "double".  A character type may alias any other type.

           Pay special attention to code like this:

                   union a_union {
                     int i;
                     double d;
                   };

                   int f() {
                     a_union t;
                     t.d = 3.0;
                     return t.i;
                   }

           The practice of reading from a different union member than the one most recently written to
           (called ``type-punning'') is common.  Even with <b>-fstrict-aliasing</b>, type-punning is allowed,
           provided the memory is accessed through the union type.  So, the code above will work as
           expected.  However, this code might not:

                   int f() {
                     a_union t;
                     int* ip;
                     t.d = 3.0;
                     ip = &amp;t.i;
                     return *ip;
                   }

           Every language that wishes to perform language-specific alias analysis should define a function
           that computes, given an "tree" node, an alias set for the node.  Nodes in different alias sets
           are not allowed to alias.  For an example, see the C front-end function "c_get_alias_set".

       <b>-falign-functions</b>
       <b>-falign-functions=</b><u>n</u>
           Align the start of functions to the next power-of-two greater than <u>n</u>, skipping up to <u>n</u> bytes.
           For instance, <b>-falign-functions=32</b> aligns functions to the next 32-byte boundary, but
           <b>-falign-functions=24</b> would align to the next 32-byte boundary only if this can be done by
           skipping 23 bytes or less.

           <b>-fno-align-functions</b> and <b>-falign-functions=1</b> are equivalent and mean that functions will not be
           aligned.

           Some assemblers only support this flag when <u>n</u> is a power of two; in that case, it is rounded up.

           If <u>n</u> is not specified or is zero, use a machine-dependent default.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>.

       <b>-falign-labels</b>
       <b>-falign-labels=</b><u>n</u>
           Align all branch targets to a power-of-two boundary, skipping up to <u>n</u> bytes like
           <b>-falign-functions</b>.  This option can easily make code slower, because it must insert dummy
           operations for when the branch target is reached in the usual flow of the code.

           <b>-fno-align-labels</b> and <b>-falign-labels=1</b> are equivalent and mean that labels will not be aligned.

           If <b>-falign-loops</b> or <b>-falign-jumps</b> are applicable and are greater than this value, then their
           values are used instead.

           If <u>n</u> is not specified or is zero, use a machine-dependent default which is very likely to be <b>1</b>,
           meaning no alignment.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>.

       <b>-falign-loops-max-skip</b>
       <b>-falign-loops-max-skip=</b><u>n</u>
           Align loops to a power-of-two boundary, but do not skip more than <u>n</u> bytes to do so.

       <b>-falign-loops</b>
       <b>-falign-loops=</b><u>n</u>
           Align loops to a power-of-two boundary, skipping up to <u>n</u> bytes like <b>-falign-functions</b>.  The hope
           is that the loop will be executed many times, which will make up for any execution of the dummy
           operations.

           <b>-fno-align-loops</b> and <b>-falign-loops=1</b> are equivalent and mean that loops will not be aligned.

           If <u>n</u> is not specified or is zero, use a machine-dependent default.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>.

       <b>-falign-jumps</b>
       <b>-falign-jumps=</b><u>n</u>
           Align branch targets to a power-of-two boundary, for branch targets where the targets can only be
           reached by jumping, skipping up to <u>n</u> bytes like <b>-falign-functions</b>.  In this case, no dummy
           operations need be executed.

       <b>-falign-jumps-max-skip</b>
       <b>-falign-jumps-max-skip=</b><u>n</u>
           Align branch targets to a power-of-two boundary, but do not skip more than <u>n</u> bytes to do so.

           <b>-fno-align-jumps</b> and <b>-falign-jumps=1</b> are equivalent and mean that loops will not be aligned.

       <b>-funit-at-a-time</b>
           Parse the whole compilation unit before starting to produce code.  This allows some extra
           optimizations to take place but consumes more memory (in general).  There are some compatibility
           issues with <u>unit-at-at-time</u> mode:

              enabling <u>unit-at-a-time</u> mode may change the order in which functions, variables, and top-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">level&nbsp;toplevel</font>
               level "asm" statements are emitted, and will likely break code relying on some particular
               ordering.  The majority of such top-level "asm" statements, though, can be replaced by
               "section" attributes.

              <u>unit-at-a-time</u> mode removes unreferenced static variables and functions are removed.  This
               may result in undefined references when an "asm" statement refers directly to variables or
               functions that are otherwise unused.  In that case either the variable/function shall be
               listed as an operand of the "asm" statement operand or, in the case of top-level "asm"
               statements the attribute "used" shall be used on the declaration.

              Static functions now can use non-standard passing conventions that may break "asm" statements
               calling functions directly.  Again, attribute "used" will prevent this behavior.

           As a temporary workaround, <b>-fno-unit-at-a-time</b> can be used, but this scheme may not be supported
           by future releases of GCC.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>.

       <b>-fweb</b>
           Constructs webs as commonly used for register allocation purposes and assign each web individual
           pseudo register.  This allows the register allocation pass to operate on pseudos directly, but
           also strengthens several other optimization passes, such as CSE, loop optimizer and trivial dead
           code remover.  It can, however, make debugging impossible, since variables will no longer stay in
           a ``home register''.

           Enabled by default with <b>-funroll-loops</b>.

       <b>-fno-cprop-registers</b>
           After register allocation and post-register allocation instruction splitting, we perform a copy-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">propagation&nbsp;copypropagation</font>
           propagation pass to try to reduce scheduling dependencies and occasionally eliminate the copy.

           Disabled at levels <b>-O</b>, <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>, <b>-Oz</b> (APPLE ONLY).

       <b>-fprofile-generate</b>
           Enable options usually used for instrumenting application to produce profile useful for later
           recompilation with profile feedback based optimization.  You must use <b>-fprofile-generate</b> both
           when compiling and when linking your program.

           The following options are enabled: "-fprofile-arcs", "-fprofile-values", "-fvpt".

       <b>-fprofile-use</b>
           Enable profile feedback directed optimizations, and optimizations generally profitable only with
           profile feedback available.

           The following options are enabled: "-fbranch-probabilities", "-fvpt", "-funroll-loops",
           "-fpeel-loops", "-ftracer".

       The following options control compiler behavior regarding floating point arithmetic.  These options
       trade off between speed and correctness.  All must be specifically enabled.

       <b>-ffloat-store</b>
           Do not store floating point variables in registers, and inhibit other options that might change
           whether a floating point value is taken from a register or memory.

           This option prevents undesirable excess precision on machines such as the 68000 where the
           floating registers (of the 68881) keep more precision than a "double" is supposed to have.
           Similarly for the x86 architecture.  For most programs, the excess precision does only good, but
           a few programs rely on the precise definition of IEEE floating point.  Use <b>-ffloat-store</b> for such
           programs, after modifying them to store all pertinent intermediate computations into variables.

       <b>-ffast-math</b>
           Sets <b>-fno-math-errno</b>, <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations</b>, <b>-fno-trapping-math</b>, <b>-ffinite-math-only</b>,
           <b>-fno-rounding-math</b>, <b>-fno-signaling-nans</b> and <b>fcx-limited-range</b>.

           This option causes the preprocessor macro "__FAST_MATH__" to be defined.

           This option should never be turned on by any <b>-O</b> option since it can result in incorrect output
           for programs which depend on an exact implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications for math
           functions.

       <b>-fno-math-errno</b>
           Do not set ERRNO after calling math functions that are executed with a single instruction, e.g.,
           sqrt.  A program that relies on IEEE exceptions for math error handling may want to use this flag
           for speed while maintaining IEEE arithmetic compatibility.

           (APPLE ONLY) The Darwin math libraries never set errno, so there is no point in having the
           compiler generate code that assumes they might.  Therefore, the default is <b>-fno-math-errno</b> on
           Darwin.

       <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations</b>
           Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that (a) assume that arguments and results are
           valid and (b) may violate IEEE or ANSI standards.  When used at link-time, it may include
           libraries or startup files that change the default FPU control word or other similar
           optimizations.

           This option should never be turned on by any <b>-O</b> option since it can result in incorrect output
           for programs which depend on an exact implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications for math
           functions.

           The default is <b>-fno-unsafe-math-optimizations</b>.

       <b>-ffinite-math-only</b>
           Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that assume that arguments and results are not
           NaNs or +-Infs.

           This option should never be turned on by any <b>-O</b> option since it can result in incorrect output
           for programs which depend on an exact implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications.

           The default is <b>-fno-finite-math-only</b>.

       <b>-fno-trapping-math</b>
           Compile code assuming that floating-point operations cannot generate user-visible traps.  These
           traps include division by zero, overflow, underflow, inexact result and invalid operation.  This
           option implies <b>-fno-signaling-nans</b>.  Setting this option may allow faster code if one relies on
           ``non-stop'' IEEE arithmetic, for example.

           This option should never be turned on by any <b>-O</b> option since it can result in incorrect output
           for programs which depend on an exact implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications for math
           functions.

           The default is <b>-ftrapping-math</b>.

       <b>-frounding-math</b>
           Disable transformations and optimizations that assume default floating point rounding behavior.
           This is round-to-zero for all floating point to integer conversions, and round-to-nearest for all
           other arithmetic truncations.  This option should be specified for programs that change the FP
           rounding mode dynamically, or that may be executed with a non-default rounding mode.  This option
           disables constant folding of floating point expressions at compile-time (which may be affected by
           rounding mode) and arithmetic transformations that are unsafe in the presence of sign-dependent
           rounding modes.

           The default is <b>-fno-rounding-math</b>.

           This option is experimental and does not currently guarantee to disable all GCC optimizations
           that are affected by rounding mode.  Future versions of GCC may provide finer control of this
           setting using C99's "FENV_ACCESS" pragma.  This command line option will be used to specify the
           default state for "FENV_ACCESS".

       <b>-fsignaling-nans</b>
           Compile code assuming that IEEE signaling NaNs may generate user-visible traps during floating-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">point&nbsp;floatingpoint</font>
           point operations.  Setting this option disables optimizations that may change the number of
           exceptions visible with signaling NaNs.  This option implies <b>-ftrapping-math</b>.

           This option causes the preprocessor macro "__SUPPORT_SNAN__" to be defined.

           The default is <b>-fno-signaling-nans</b>.

           This option is experimental and does not currently guarantee to disable all GCC optimizations
           that affect signaling NaN behavior.

       <b>-fsingle-precision-constant</b>
           Treat floating point constant as single precision constant instead of implicitly converting it to
           double precision constant.

       <b>-fcx-limited-range</b>
       <b>-fno-cx-limited-range</b>
           When enabled, this option states that a range reduction step is not needed when performing
           complex division.  The default is <b>-fno-cx-limited-range</b>, but is enabled by <b>-ffast-math</b>.

           This option controls the default setting of the ISO C99 "CX_LIMITED_RANGE" pragma.  Nevertheless,
           the option applies to all languages.

       The following options control optimizations that may improve performance, but are not enabled by any
       <b>-O</b> options.  This section includes experimental options that may produce broken code.

       <b>-fbranch-probabilities</b>
           After running a program compiled with <b>-fprofile-arcs</b>, you can compile it a second time using
           <b>-fbranch-probabilities</b>, to improve optimizations based on the number of times each branch was
           taken.  When the program compiled with <b>-fprofile-arcs</b> exits it saves arc execution counts to a
           file called <u>sourcename.gcda</u> for each source file  The information in this data file is very
           dependent on the structure of the generated code, so you must use the same source code and the
           same optimization options for both compilations.

           With <b>-fbranch-probabilities</b>, GCC puts a <b>REG_BR_PROB</b> note on each <b>JUMP_INSN</b> and <b>CALL_INSN</b>.  These
           can be used to improve optimization.  Currently, they are only used in one place: in <u>reorg.c</u>,
           instead of guessing which path a branch is mostly to take, the <b>REG_BR_PROB</b> values are used to
           exactly determine which path is taken more often.

       <b>-fprofile-values</b>
           If combined with <b>-fprofile-arcs</b>, it adds code so that some data about values of expressions in
           the program is gathered.

           With <b>-fbranch-probabilities</b>, it reads back the data gathered from profiling values of expressions
           and adds <b>REG_VALUE_PROFILE</b> notes to instructions for their later usage in optimizations.

           Enabled with <b>-fprofile-generate</b> and <b>-fprofile-use</b>.

       <b>-fvpt</b>
           If combined with <b>-fprofile-arcs</b>, it instructs the compiler to add a code to gather information
           about values of expressions.

           With <b>-fbranch-probabilities</b>, it reads back the data gathered and actually performs the
           optimizations based on them.  Currently the optimizations include specialization of division
           operation using the knowledge about the value of the denominator.

       <b>-fspeculative-prefetching</b>
           If combined with <b>-fprofile-arcs</b>, it instructs the compiler to add a code to gather information
           about addresses of memory references in the program.

           With <b>-fbranch-probabilities</b>, it reads back the data gathered and issues prefetch instructions
           according to them.  In addition to the opportunities noticed by <b>-fprefetch-loop-arrays</b>, it also
           notices more complicated memory access patterns---for example accesses to the data stored in
           linked list whose elements are usually allocated sequentially.

           In order to prevent issuing double prefetches, usage of <b>-fspeculative-prefetching</b> implies
           <b>-fno-prefetch-loop-arrays</b>.

           Enabled with <b>-fprofile-generate</b> and <b>-fprofile-use</b>.

       <b>-frename-registers</b>
           Attempt to avoid false dependencies in scheduled code by making use of registers left over after
           register allocation.  This optimization will most benefit processors with lots of registers.
           Depending on the debug information format adopted by the target, however, it can make debugging
           impossible, since variables will no longer stay in a ``home register''.

           Not enabled by default at any level because it has known bugs.

       <b>-ftracer</b>
           Perform tail duplication to enlarge superblock size.  This transformation simplifies the control
           flow of the function allowing other optimizations to do better job.

           Enabled with <b>-fprofile-use</b>.

       <b>-funroll-loops</b>
           Unroll loops whose number of iterations can be determined at compile time or upon entry to the
           loop.  <b>-funroll-loops</b> implies <b>-frerun-cse-after-loop</b> and <b>-fweb</b>.  It also turns on complete loop
           peeling (i.e. complete removal of loops with small constant number of iterations).  This option
           makes code larger, and may or may not make it run faster.

           Enabled with <b>-fprofile-use</b>.

       <b>-funroll-all-loops</b>
           Unroll all loops, even if their number of iterations is uncertain when the loop is entered.  This
           usually makes programs run more slowly.  <b>-funroll-all-loops</b> implies the same options as
           <b>-funroll-loops</b>.

       <b>-fpeel-loops</b>
           Peels the loops for that there is enough information that they do not roll much (from profile
           feedback).  It also turns on complete loop peeling (i.e. complete removal of loops with small
           constant number of iterations).

           Enabled with <b>-fprofile-use</b>.

       <b>-fmove-loop-invariants</b>
           Enables the loop invariant motion pass in the new loop optimizer.  Enabled at level <b>-O1</b>

       <b>-funswitch-loops</b>
           Move branches with loop invariant conditions out of the loop, with duplicates of the loop on both
           branches (modified according to result of the condition).

       <b>-fprefetch-loop-arrays</b>
           If supported by the target machine, generate instructions to prefetch memory to improve the
           performance of loops that access large arrays.

           Disabled at levels <b>-Os</b> and <b>-Oz</b> (APPLE ONLY).

       <b>-ffunction-sections</b>
       <b>-fdata-sections</b>
           Place each function or data item into its own section in the output file if the target supports
           arbitrary sections.  The name of the function or the name of the data item determines the
           section's name in the output file.

           Use these options on systems where the linker can perform optimizations to improve locality of
           reference in the instruction space.  Most systems using the ELF object format and SPARC
           processors running Solaris 2 have linkers with such optimizations.  AIX may have these
           optimizations in the future.

           Only use these options when there are significant benefits from doing so.  When you specify these
           options, the assembler and linker will create larger object and executable files and will also be
           slower.  You will not be able to use "gprof" on all systems if you specify this option and you
           may have problems with debugging if you specify both this option and <b>-g</b>.

       <b>-fbranch-target-load-optimize</b>
           Perform branch target register load optimization before prologue / epilogue threading.  The use
           of target registers can typically be exposed only during reload, thus hoisting loads out of loops
           and doing inter-block scheduling needs a separate optimization pass.

       <b>-fbranch-target-load-optimize2</b>
           Perform branch target register load optimization after prologue / epilogue threading.

       <b>-fbtr-bb-exclusive</b>
           When performing branch target register load optimization, don't reuse branch target registers in
           within any basic block.

       <b>-fstack-protector</b>
           Emit extra code to check for buffer overflows, such as stack smashing attacks.  This is done by
           adding a guard variable to functions with vulnerable objects.  This includes functions that call
           alloca, and functions with buffers larger than 8 bytes.  The guards are initialized when a
           function is entered and then checked when the function exits.  If a guard check fails, an error
           message is printed and the program exits.

       <b>-fstack-protector-all</b>
           Like <b>-fstack-protector</b> except that all functions are protected.

       <b>--param</b> <u>name</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>
           In some places, GCC uses various constants to control the amount of optimization that is done.
           For example, GCC will not inline functions that contain more that a certain number of
           instructions.  You can control some of these constants on the command-line using the <b>--param</b>
           option.

           The names of specific parameters, and the meaning of the values, are tied to the internals of the
           compiler, and are subject to change without notice in future releases.

           In each case, the <u>value</u> is an integer.  The allowable choices for <u>name</u> are given in the following
           table:

           <b>sra-max-structure-size</b>
               The maximum structure size, in bytes, at which the scalar replacement of aggregates (SRA)
               optimization will perform block copies.  The default value, 0, implies that GCC will select
               the most appropriate size itself.

           <b>sra-field-structure-ratio</b>
               The threshold ratio (as a percentage) between instantiated fields and the complete structure
               size.  We say that if the ratio of the number of bytes in instantiated fields to the number
               of bytes in the complete structure exceeds this parameter, then block copies are not used.
               The default is 75.

           <b>max-crossjump-edges</b>
               The maximum number of incoming edges to consider for crossjumping.  The algorithm used by
               <b>-fcrossjumping</b> is O(N^2) in the number of edges incoming to each block.  Increasing values
               mean more aggressive optimization, making the compile time increase with probably small
               improvement in executable size.

           <b>min-crossjump-insns</b>
               The minimum number of instructions which must be matched at the end of two blocks before
               crossjumping will be performed on them.  This value is ignored in the case where all
               instructions in the block being crossjumped from are matched.  The default value is 5.

           <b>max-goto-duplication-insns</b>
               The maximum number of instructions to duplicate to a block that jumps to a computed goto.  To
               avoid O(N^2) behavior in a number of passes, GCC factors computed gotos early in the
               compilation process, and unfactors them as late as possible.  Only computed jumps at the end
               of a basic blocks with no more than max-goto-duplication-insns are unfactored.  The default
               value is 8.

           <b>max-delay-slot-insn-search</b>
               The maximum number of instructions to consider when looking for an instruction to fill a
               delay slot.  If more than this arbitrary number of instructions is searched, the time savings
               from filling the delay slot will be minimal so stop searching.  Increasing values mean more
               aggressive optimization, making the compile time increase with probably small improvement in
               executable run time.

           <b>max-delay-slot-live-search</b>
               When trying to fill delay slots, the maximum number of instructions to consider when
               searching for a block with valid live register information.  Increasing this arbitrarily
               chosen value means more aggressive optimization, increasing the compile time.  This parameter
               should be removed when the delay slot code is rewritten to maintain the control-flow graph.

           <b>max-gcse-memory</b>
               The approximate maximum amount of memory that will be allocated in order to perform the
               global common subexpression elimination optimization.  If more memory than specified is
               required, the optimization will not be done.

           <b>max-gcse-passes</b>
               The maximum number of passes of GCSE to run.  The default is 1.

           <b>max-pending-list-length</b>
               The maximum number of pending dependencies scheduling will allow before flushing the current
               state and starting over.  Large functions with few branches or calls can create excessively
               large lists which needlessly consume memory and resources.

           <b>max-inline-insns-single</b>
               Several parameters control the tree inliner used in gcc.  This number sets the maximum number
               of instructions (counted in GCC's internal representation) in a single function that the tree
               inliner will consider for inlining.  This only affects functions declared inline and methods
               implemented in a class declaration (C++).  The default value is 450.

           <b>max-inline-insns-auto</b>
               When you use <b>-finline-functions</b> (included in <b>-O3</b>), a lot of functions that would otherwise
               not be considered for inlining by the compiler will be investigated.  To those functions, a
               different (more restrictive) limit compared to functions declared inline can be applied.  The
               default value is 90.

           <b>large-function-insns</b>
               The limit specifying really large functions.  For functions larger than this limit after
               inlining inlining is constrained by <b>--param</b> <b>large-function-growth</b>.  This parameter is useful
               primarily to avoid extreme compilation time caused by non-linear algorithms used by the
               backend.  This parameter is ignored when <b>-funit-at-a-time</b> is not used.  The default value is
               2700.

           <b>large-function-growth</b>
               Specifies maximal growth of large function caused by inlining in percents.  This parameter is
               ignored when <b>-funit-at-a-time</b> is not used.  The default value is 100 which limits large
               function growth to 2.0 times the original size.

           <b>inline-unit-growth</b>
               Specifies maximal overall growth of the compilation unit caused by inlining.  This parameter
               is ignored when <b>-funit-at-a-time</b> is not used.  The default value is 50 which limits unit
               growth to 1.5 times the original size.

           <b>max-inline-insns-recursive</b>
           <b>max-inline-insns-recursive-auto</b>
               Specifies maximum number of instructions out-of-line copy of self recursive inline function
               can grow into by performing recursive inlining.

               For functions declared inline <b>--param</b> <b>max-inline-insns-recursive</b> is taken into acount.  For
               function not declared inline, recursive inlining happens only when <b>-finline-functions</b>
               (included in <b>-O3</b>) is enabled and <b>--param</b> <b>max-inline-insns-recursive-auto</b> is used.  The
               default value is 450.

           <b>max-inline-recursive-depth</b>
           <b>max-inline-recursive-depth-auto</b>
               Specifies maximum recursion depth used by the recursive inlining.

               For functions declared inline <b>--param</b> <b>max-inline-recursive-depth</b> is taken into acount.  For
               function not declared inline, recursive inlining happens only when <b>-finline-functions</b>
               (included in <b>-O3</b>) is enabled and <b>--param</b> <b>max-inline-recursive-depth-auto</b> is used.  The
               default value is 450.

           <b>inline-call-cost</b>
               Specify cost of call instruction relative to simple arithmetics operations (having cost of
               1).  Increasing this cost disqualify inlinining of non-leaf functions and at same time
               increase size of leaf function that is believed to reduce function size by being inlined.  In
               effect it increase amount of inlining for code having large abstraction penalty (many
               functions that just pass the argumetns to other functions) and decrease inlining for code
               with low abstraction penalty.  Default value is 16.

           <b>max-unrolled-insns</b>
               The maximum number of instructions that a loop should have if that loop is unrolled, and if
               the loop is unrolled, it determines how many times the loop code is unrolled.

           <b>max-average-unrolled-insns</b>
               The maximum number of instructions biased by probabilities of their execution that a loop
               should have if that loop is unrolled, and if the loop is unrolled, it determines how many
               times the loop code is unrolled.

           <b>max-unroll-times</b>
               The maximum number of unrollings of a single loop.

           <b>max-peeled-insns</b>
               The maximum number of instructions that a loop should have if that loop is peeled, and if the
               loop is peeled, it determines how many times the loop code is peeled.

           <b>max-peel-times</b>
               The maximum number of peelings of a single loop.

           <b>max-completely-peeled-insns</b>
               The maximum number of insns of a completely peeled loop.

           <b>max-completely-peel-times</b>
               The maximum number of iterations of a loop to be suitable for complete peeling.

           <b>max-unswitch-insns</b>
               The maximum number of insns of an unswitched loop.

           <b>max-unswitch-level</b>
               The maximum number of branches unswitched in a single loop.

           <b>lim-expensive</b>
               The minimum cost of an expensive expression in the loop invariant motion.

           <b>iv-consider-all-candidates-bound</b>
               Bound on number of candidates for induction variables below that all candidates are
               considered for each use in induction variable optimizations.  Only the most relevant
               candidates are considered if there are more candidates, to avoid quadratic time complexity.

           <b>iv-max-considered-uses</b>
               The induction variable optimizations give up on loops that contain more induction variable
               uses.

           <b>iv-always-prune-cand-set-bound</b>
               If number of candidates in the set is smaller than this value, we always try to remove
               unnecessary ivs from the set during its optimization when a new iv is added to the set.

           <b>scev-max-expr-size</b>
               Bound on size of expressions used in the scalar evolutions analyzer.  Large expressions slow
               the analyzer.

           <b>max-iterations-to-track</b>
               The maximum number of iterations of a loop the brute force algorithm for analysis of # of
               iterations of the loop tries to evaluate.

           <b>hot-bb-count-fraction</b>
               Select fraction of the maximal count of repetitions of basic block in program given basic
               block needs to have to be considered hot.

           <b>hot-bb-frequency-fraction</b>
               Select fraction of the maximal frequency of executions of basic block in function given basic
               block needs to have to be considered hot

           <b>tracer-dynamic-coverage</b>
           <b>tracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback</b>
               This value is used to limit superblock formation once the given percentage of executed
               instructions is covered.  This limits unnecessary code size expansion.

               The <b>tracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback</b> is used only when profile feedback is available.  The
               real profiles (as opposed to statically estimated ones) are much less balanced allowing the
               threshold to be larger value.

           <b>tracer-max-code-growth</b>
               Stop tail duplication once code growth has reached given percentage.  This is rather hokey
               argument, as most of the duplicates will be eliminated later in cross jumping, so it may be
               set to much higher values than is the desired code growth.

           <b>tracer-min-branch-ratio</b>
               Stop reverse growth when the reverse probability of best edge is less than this threshold (in
               percent).

           <b>tracer-min-branch-ratio</b>
           <b>tracer-min-branch-ratio-feedback</b>
               Stop forward growth if the best edge do have probability lower than this threshold.

               Similarly to <b>tracer-dynamic-coverage</b> two values are present, one for compilation for profile
               feedback and one for compilation without.  The value for compilation with profile feedback
               needs to be more conservative (higher) in order to make tracer effective.

           <b>max-cse-path-length</b>
               Maximum number of basic blocks on path that cse considers.  The default is 10.

           <b>global-var-threshold</b>
               Counts the number of function calls (<u>n</u>) and the number of call-clobbered variables (<u>v</u>).  If
               <u>n</u>x<u>v</u> is larger than this limit, a single artificial variable will be created to represent all
               the call-clobbered variables at function call sites.  This artificial variable will then be
               made to alias every call-clobbered variable.  (done as "int * size_t" on the host machine;
               beware overflow).

           <b>max-aliased-vops</b>
               Maximum number of virtual operands allowed to represent aliases before triggering the alias
               grouping heuristic.  Alias grouping reduces compile times and memory consumption needed for
               aliasing at the expense of precision loss in alias information.

           <b>ggc-min-expand</b>
               GCC uses a garbage collector to manage its own memory allocation.  This parameter specifies
               the minimum percentage by which the garbage collector's heap should be allowed to expand
               between collections.  Tuning this may improve compilation speed; it has no effect on code
               generation.

               The default is 30% + 70% * (RAM/1GB) with an upper bound of 100% when RAM &gt;= 1GB.  If
               "getrlimit" is available, the notion of "RAM" is the smallest of actual RAM and "RLIMIT_DATA"
               or "RLIMIT_AS".  If GCC is not able to calculate RAM on a particular platform, the lower
               bound of 30% is used.  Setting this parameter and <b>ggc-min-heapsize</b> to zero causes a full
               collection to occur at every opportunity.  This is extremely slow, but can be useful for
               debugging.

           <b>ggc-min-heapsize</b>
               Minimum size of the garbage collector's heap before it begins bothering to collect garbage.
               The first collection occurs after the heap expands by <b>ggc-min-expand</b>% beyond <b>ggc-min</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">heapsize.&nbsp;ggc-minheapsize.</font>
               <b>heapsize</b>.  Again, tuning this may improve compilation speed, and has no effect on code
               generation.

               The default is the smaller of RAM/8, RLIMIT_RSS, or a limit which tries to ensure that
               RLIMIT_DATA or RLIMIT_AS are not exceeded, but with a lower bound of 4096 (four megabytes)
               and an upper bound of 131072 (128 megabytes).  If GCC is not able to calculate RAM on a
               particular platform, the lower bound is used.  Setting this parameter very large effectively
               disables garbage collection.  Setting this parameter and <b>ggc-min-expand</b> to zero causes a full
               collection to occur at every opportunity.

           <b>max-reload-search-insns</b>
               The maximum number of instruction reload should look backward for equivalent register.
               Increasing values mean more aggressive optimization, making the compile time increase with
               probably slightly better performance.  The default value is 100.

           <b>max-cselib-memory-location</b>
               The maximum number of memory locations cselib should take into acount.  Increasing values
               mean more aggressive optimization, making the compile time increase with probably slightly
               better performance.  The default value is 500.

           <b>reorder-blocks-duplicate</b>
           <b>reorder-blocks-duplicate-feedback</b>
               Used by basic block reordering pass to decide whether to use unconditional branch or
               duplicate the code on its destination.  Code is duplicated when its estimated size is smaller
               than this value multiplied by the estimated size of unconditional jump in the hot spots of
               the program.

               The <b>reorder-block-duplicate-feedback</b> is used only when profile feedback is available and may
               be set to higher values than <b>reorder-block-duplicate</b> since information about the hot spots is
               more accurate.

           <b>max-sched-region-blocks</b>
               The maximum number of blocks in a region to be considered for interblock scheduling.  The
               default value is 10.

           <b>max-sched-region-insns</b>
               The maximum number of insns in a region to be considered for interblock scheduling.  The
               default value is 100.

           <b>max-last-value-rtl</b>
               The maximum size measured as number of RTLs that can be recorded in an expression in combiner
               for a pseudo register as last known value of that register.  The default is 10000.

           <b>integer-share-limit</b>
               Small integer constants can use a shared data structure, reducing the compiler's memory usage
               and increasing its speed.  This sets the maximum value of a shared integer constant's.  The
               default value is 256.

           <b>ssp-buffer-size</b>
               The minimum size of buffers (i.e. arrays) that will receive stack smashing protection when
               <b>-fstack-protection</b> is used.

       <b>Options</b> <b>Controlling</b> <b>the</b> <b>Preprocessor</b>

       These options control the C preprocessor, which is run on each C source file before actual
       compilation.

       If you use the <b>-E</b> option, nothing is done except preprocessing.  Some of these options make sense
       only together with <b>-E</b> because they cause the preprocessor output to be unsuitable for actual
       compilation.

           You can use <b>-Wp,</b><u>option</u> to bypass the compiler driver and pass <u>option</u> directly through to the
           preprocessor.  If <u>option</u> contains commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.
           However, many options are modified, translated or interpreted by the compiler driver before being
           passed to the preprocessor, and <b>-Wp</b> forcibly bypasses this phase.  The preprocessor's direct
           interface is undocumented and subject to change, so whenever possible you should avoid using <b>-Wp</b>
           and let the driver handle the options instead.

           <b>-Xpreprocessor</b> <u>option</u>

           Pass <u>option</u> as an option to the preprocessor.  You can use this to supply system-specific
           preprocessor options which GCC does not know how to recognize.

           If you want to pass an option that takes an argument, you must use <b>-Xpreprocessor</b> twice, once for
           the option and once for the argument.

       <b>-D</b> <u>name</u>
           Predefine <u>name</u> as a macro, with definition 1.

       <b>-D</b> <u>name</u><b>=</b><u>definition</u>
           The contents of <u>definition</u> are tokenized and processed as if they appeared during translation
           phase three in a <b>#define</b> directive.  In particular, the definition will be truncated by embedded
           newline characters.

           If you are invoking the preprocessor from a shell or shell-like program you may need to use the
           shell's quoting syntax to protect characters such as spaces that have a meaning in the shell
           syntax.

           If you wish to define a function-like macro on the command line, write its argument list with
           surrounding parentheses before the equals sign (if any).  Parentheses are meaningful to most
           shells, so you will need to quote the option.  With <b>sh</b> and <b>csh</b>, <b>-D'</b><u>name</u><b>(</b><u>args...</u><b>)=</b><u>definition</u><b>'</b>
           works.

           <b>-D</b> and <b>-U</b> options are processed in the order they are given on the command line.  All <b>-imacros</b>
           <u>file</u> and <b>-include</b> <u>file</u> options are processed after all <b>-D</b> and <b>-U</b> options.

       <b>-U</b> <u>name</u>
           Cancel any previous definition of <u>name</u>, either built in or provided with a <b>-D</b> option.

       <b>-undef</b>
           Do not predefine any system-specific or GCC-specific macros.  The standard predefined macros
           remain defined.

       <b>-I</b> <u>dir</u>
           Add the directory <u>dir</u> to the list of directories to be searched for header files.  Directories
           named by <b>-I</b> are searched before the standard system include directories.  If the directory <u>dir</u> is
           a standard system include directory, the option is ignored to ensure that the default search
           order for system directories and the special treatment of system headers are not defeated .

       <b>-o</b> <u>file</u>
           Write output to <u>file</u>.  This is the same as specifying <u>file</u> as the second non-option argument to
           <b>cpp</b>.  <b>gcc</b> has a different interpretation of a second non-option argument, so you must use <b>-o</b> to
           specify the output file.

       <b>-Wall</b>
           Turns on all optional warnings which are desirable for normal code.  At present this is
           <b>-Wcomment</b>, <b>-Wtrigraphs</b>, <b>-Wmultichar</b> and a warning about integer promotion causing a change of
           sign in "#if" expressions.  Note that many of the preprocessor's warnings are on by default and
           have no options to control them.

       <b>-Wcomment</b>
       <b>-Wcomments</b>
           Warn whenever a comment-start sequence <b>/*</b> appears in a <b>/*</b> comment, or whenever a backslash-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">newline&nbsp;backslashnewline</font>
           newline appears in a <b>//</b> comment.  (Both forms have the same effect.)

       <b>-Wtrigraphs</b>
           @anchor{Wtrigraphs} Most trigraphs in comments cannot affect the meaning of the program.
           However, a trigraph that would form an escaped newline (<b>??/</b> at the end of a line) can, by
           changing where the comment begins or ends.  Therefore, only trigraphs that would form escaped
           newlines produce warnings inside a comment.

           This option is implied by <b>-Wall</b>.  If <b>-Wall</b> is not given, this option is still enabled unless
           trigraphs are enabled.  To get trigraph conversion without warnings, but get the other <b>-Wall</b>
           warnings, use <b>-trigraphs</b> <b>-Wall</b> <b>-Wno-trigraphs</b>.

       <b>-Wtraditional</b>
           Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in traditional and ISO C.  Also warn about
           ISO C constructs that have no traditional C equivalent, and problematic constructs which should
           be avoided.

       <b>-Wimport</b>
           Warn the first time <b>#import</b> is used.

       <b>-Wundef</b>
           Warn whenever an identifier which is not a macro is encountered in an <b>#if</b> directive, outside of
           <b>defined</b>.  Such identifiers are replaced with zero.

       <b>-Wunused-macros</b>
           Warn about macros defined in the main file that are unused.  A macro is <u>used</u> if it is expanded or
           tested for existence at least once.  The preprocessor will also warn if the macro has not been
           used at the time it is redefined or undefined.

           Built-in macros, macros defined on the command line, and macros defined in include files are not
           warned about.

           <u>Note:</u> If a macro is actually used, but only used in skipped conditional blocks, then CPP will
           report it as unused.  To avoid the warning in such a case, you might improve the scope of the
           macro's definition by, for example, moving it into the first skipped block.  Alternatively, you
           could provide a dummy use with something like:

                   #if defined the_macro_causing_the_warning
                   #endif

       <b>-Wendif-labels</b>
           Warn whenever an <b>#else</b> or an <b>#endif</b> are followed by text.  This usually happens in code of the
           form

                   #if FOO
                   ...
                   #else FOO
                   ...
                   #endif FOO

           The second and third "FOO" should be in comments, but often are not in older programs.  This
           warning is on by default.

       <b>-Werror</b>
           Make all warnings into hard errors.  Source code which triggers warnings will be rejected.

       <b>-Wsystem-headers</b>
           Issue warnings for code in system headers.  These are normally unhelpful in finding bugs in your
           own code, therefore suppressed.  If you are responsible for the system library, you may want to
           see them.

       <b>-w</b>  Suppress all warnings, including those which GNU CPP issues by default.

       <b>-pedantic</b>
           Issue all the mandatory diagnostics listed in the C standard.  Some of them are left out by
           default, since they trigger frequently on harmless code.

       <b>-pedantic-errors</b>
           Issue all the mandatory diagnostics, and make all mandatory diagnostics into errors.  This
           includes mandatory diagnostics that GCC issues without <b>-pedantic</b> but treats as warnings.

       <b>-M</b>  Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a rule suitable for <b>make</b> describing the
           dependencies of the main source file.  The preprocessor outputs one <b>make</b> rule containing the
           object file name for that source file, a colon, and the names of all the included files,
           including those coming from <b>-include</b> or <b>-imacros</b> command line options.

           Unless specified explicitly (with <b>-MT</b> or <b>-MQ</b>), the object file name consists of the basename of
           the source file with any suffix replaced with object file suffix.  If there are many included
           files then the rule is split into several lines using <b>\</b>-newline.  The rule has no commands.

           This option does not suppress the preprocessor's debug output, such as <b>-dM</b>.  To avoid mixing such
           debug output with the dependency rules you should explicitly specify the dependency output file
           with <b>-MF</b>, or use an environment variable like <b>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</b>.  Debug output will still be
           sent to the regular output stream as normal.

           Passing <b>-M</b> to the driver implies <b>-E</b>, and suppresses warnings with an implicit <b>-w</b>.

       <b>-MM</b> Like <b>-M</b> but do not mention header files that are found in system header directories, nor header
           files that are included, directly or indirectly, from such a header.

           This implies that the choice of angle brackets or double quotes in an <b>#include</b> directive does not
           in itself determine whether that header will appear in <b>-MM</b> dependency output.  This is a slight
           change in semantics from GCC versions 3.0 and earlier.

           @anchor{dashMF}

       <b>-MF</b> <u>file</u>
           When used with <b>-M</b> or <b>-MM</b>, specifies a file to write the dependencies to.  If no <b>-MF</b> switch is
           given the preprocessor sends the rules to the same place it would have sent preprocessed output.

           When used with the driver options <b>-MD</b> or <b>-MMD</b>, <b>-MF</b> overrides the default dependency output file.

       <b>-dependency-file</b>
           Like <b>-MF</b>. (APPLE ONLY)

       <b>-MG</b> In conjunction with an option such as <b>-M</b> requesting dependency generation, <b>-MG</b> assumes missing
           header files are generated files and adds them to the dependency list without raising an error.
           The dependency filename is taken directly from the "#include" directive without prepending any
           path.  <b>-MG</b> also suppresses preprocessed output, as a missing header file renders this useless.

           This feature is used in automatic updating of makefiles.

       <b>-MP</b> This option instructs CPP to add a phony target for each dependency other than the main file,
           causing each to depend on nothing.  These dummy rules work around errors <b>make</b> gives if you remove
           header files without updating the <u>Makefile</u> to match.

           This is typical output:

                   test.o: test.c test.h

                   test.h:

       <b>-MT</b> <u>target</u>
           Change the target of the rule emitted by dependency generation.  By default CPP takes the name of
           the main input file, including any path, deletes any file suffix such as <b>.c</b>, and appends the
           platform's usual object suffix.  The result is the target.

           An <b>-MT</b> option will set the target to be exactly the string you specify.  If you want multiple
           targets, you can specify them as a single argument to <b>-MT</b>, or use multiple <b>-MT</b> options.

           For example, <b>-MT</b> <b>'$(objpfx)foo.o'</b> might give

                   $(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c

       <b>-MQ</b> <u>target</u>
           Same as <b>-MT</b>, but it quotes any characters which are special to Make.  <b>-MQ</b> <b>'$(objpfx)foo.o'</b> gives

                   $$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c

           The default target is automatically quoted, as if it were given with <b>-MQ</b>.

       <b>-MD</b> <b>-MD</b> is equivalent to <b>-M</b> <b>-MF</b> <u>file</u>, except that <b>-E</b> is not implied.  The driver determines <u>file</u>
           based on whether an <b>-o</b> option is given.  If it is, the driver uses its argument but with a suffix
           of <u>.d</u>, otherwise it take the basename of the input file and applies a <u>.d</u> suffix.

           If <b>-MD</b> is used in conjunction with <b>-E</b>, any <b>-o</b> switch is understood to specify the dependency
           output file, but if used without <b>-E</b>, each <b>-o</b> is understood to specify a target object file.

           Since <b>-E</b> is not implied, <b>-MD</b> can be used to generate a dependency output file as a side-effect of
           the compilation process.

       <b>-MMD</b>
           Like <b>-MD</b> except mention only user header files, not system header files.

       <b>-fpch-deps</b>
           When using precompiled headers, this flag will cause the dependency-output flags to also list the
           files from the precompiled header's dependencies.  If not specified only the precompiled header
           would be listed and not the files that were used to create it because those files are not
           consulted when a precompiled header is used.

       <b>-fpch-preprocess</b>
           This option allows use of a precompiled header together with <b>-E</b>.  It inserts a special "#pragma",
           "#pragma GCC pch_preprocess "&lt;filename&gt;"" in the output to mark the place where the precompiled
           header was found, and its filename.  When <b>-fpreprocessed</b> is in use, GCC recognizes this "#pragma"
           and loads the PCH.

           This option is off by default, because the resulting preprocessed output is only really suitable
           as input to GCC.  It is switched on by <b>-save-temps</b>.

           You should not write this "#pragma" in your own code, but it is safe to edit the filename if the
           PCH file is available in a different location.  The filename may be absolute or it may be
           relative to GCC's current directory.

       <b>-x</b> <b>c</b>
       <b>-x</b> <b>c++</b>
       <b>-x</b> <b>objective-c</b>
       <b>-x</b> <b>objective-c++</b>
       <b>-x</b> <b>assembler-with-cpp</b>
           Specify the source language: C, C++, Objective-C, Objective-C++, or assembly.  This has nothing
           to do with standards conformance or extensions; it merely selects which base syntax to expect.
           If you give none of these options, cpp will deduce the language from the extension of the source
           file: <b>.c</b>, <b>.cc</b>, <b>.m</b>, <b>.mm</b>, or <b>.S</b>.  Some other common extensions for C++ and assembly are also
           recognized.  If cpp does not recognize the extension, it will treat the file as C; this is the
           most generic mode.

           <u>Note:</u> Previous versions of cpp accepted a <b>-lang</b> option which selected both the language and the
           standards conformance level.  This option has been removed, because it conflicts with the <b>-l</b>
           option.

       <b>-std=</b><u>standard</u>
       <b>-ansi</b>
           Specify the standard to which the code should conform.  Currently CPP knows about C and C++
           standards; others may be added in the future.

           <u>standard</u> may be one of:

           "iso9899:1990"
           "c89"
               The ISO C standard from 1990.  <b>c89</b> is the customary shorthand for this version of the
               standard.

               The <b>-ansi</b> option is equivalent to <b>-std=c89</b>.

           "iso9899:199409"
               The 1990 C standard, as amended in 1994.

           "iso9899:1999"
           "c99"
           "iso9899:199x"
           "c9x"
               The revised ISO C standard, published in December 1999.  Before publication, this was known
               as C9X.

           "gnu89"
               The 1990 C standard plus GNU extensions.  This is the default.

           "gnu99"
           "gnu9x"
               The 1999 C standard plus GNU extensions.

           "c++98"
               The 1998 ISO C++ standard plus amendments.

           "gnu++98"
               The same as <b>-std=c++98</b> plus GNU extensions.  This is the default for C++ code.

       <b>-I-</b> Split the include path.  Any directories specified with <b>-I</b> options before <b>-I-</b> are searched only
           for headers requested with "#include "file""; they are not searched for "#include &lt;file&gt;".  If
           additional directories are specified with <b>-I</b> options after the <b>-I-</b>, those directories are
           searched for all <b>#include</b> directives.

           In addition, <b>-I-</b> inhibits the use of the directory of the current file directory as the first
           search directory for "#include "file"".  This option has been deprecated.

       <b>-nostdinc</b>
           Do not search the standard system directories for header files.  Only the directories you have
           specified with <b>-I</b> options (and the directory of the current file, if appropriate) are searched.

       <b>-nostdinc++</b>
           Do not search for header files in the C++-specific standard directories, but do still search the
           other standard directories.  (This option is used when building the C++ library.)

       <b>-include</b> <u>file</u>
           Process <u>file</u> as if "#include "file"" appeared as the first line of the primary source file.
           However, the first directory searched for <u>file</u> is the preprocessor's working directory <u>instead</u> <u>of</u>
           the directory containing the main source file.  If not found there, it is searched for in the
           remainder of the "#include "..."" search chain as normal.

           If multiple <b>-include</b> options are given, the files are included in the order they appear on the
           command line.

       <b>-imacros</b> <u>file</u>
           Exactly like <b>-include</b>, except that any output produced by scanning <u>file</u> is thrown away.  Macros
           it defines remain defined.  This allows you to acquire all the macros from a header without also
           processing its declarations.

           All files specified by <b>-imacros</b> are processed before all files specified by <b>-include</b>.

       <b>-idirafter</b> <u>dir</u>
           Search <u>dir</u> for header files, but do it <u>after</u> all directories specified with <b>-I</b> and the standard
           system directories have been exhausted.  <u>dir</u> is treated as a system include directory.

       <b>-iprefix</b> <u>prefix</u>
           Specify <u>prefix</u> as the prefix for subsequent <b>-iwithprefix</b> options.  If the prefix represents a
           directory, you should include the final <b>/</b>.

       <b>-iwithprefix</b> <u>dir</u>
       <b>-iwithprefixbefore</b> <u>dir</u>
           Append <u>dir</u> to the prefix specified previously with <b>-iprefix</b>, and add the resulting directory to
           the include search path.  <b>-iwithprefixbefore</b> puts it in the same place <b>-I</b> would; <b>-iwithprefix</b>
           puts it where <b>-idirafter</b> would.

       <b>-isystem</b> <u>dir</u>
           Search <u>dir</u> for header files, after all directories specified by <b>-I</b> but before the standard system
           directories.  Mark it as a system directory, so that it gets the same special treatment as is
           applied to the standard system directories.

       <b>-iquote</b> <u>dir</u>
           Search <u>dir</u> only for header files requested with "#include "file""; they are not searched for
           "#include &lt;file&gt;", before all directories specified by <b>-I</b> and before the standard system
           directories.

       <b>-fdollars-in-identifiers</b>
           @anchor{fdollars-in-identifiers} Accept <b>$</b> in identifiers.

       <b>-fpreprocessed</b>
           Indicate to the preprocessor that the input file has already been preprocessed.  This suppresses
           things like macro expansion, trigraph conversion, escaped newline splicing, and processing of
           most directives.  The preprocessor still recognizes and removes comments, so that you can pass a
           file preprocessed with <b>-C</b> to the compiler without problems.  In this mode the integrated
           preprocessor is little more than a tokenizer for the front ends.

           <b>-fpreprocessed</b> is implicit if the input file has one of the extensions <b>.i</b>, <b>.ii</b> or <b>.mi</b>.  These are
           the extensions that GCC uses for preprocessed files created by <b>-save-temps</b>.

       <b>-ftabstop=</b><u>width</u>
           Set the distance between tab stops.  This helps the preprocessor report correct column numbers in
           warnings or errors, even if tabs appear on the line.  If the value is less than 1 or greater than
           100, the option is ignored.  The default is 8.

       <b>-fexec-charset=</b><u>charset</u>
           Set the execution character set, used for string and character constants.  The default is UTF-8.
           <u>charset</u> can be any encoding supported by the system's "iconv" library routine.

       <b>-fwide-exec-charset=</b><u>charset</u>
           Set the wide execution character set, used for wide string and character constants.  The default
           is UTF-32 or UTF-16, whichever corresponds to the width of "wchar_t".  As with <b>-fexec-charset</b>,
           <u>charset</u> can be any encoding supported by the system's "iconv" library routine; however, you will
           have problems with encodings that do not fit exactly in "wchar_t".

       <b>-finput-charset=</b><u>charset</u>
           Set the input character set, used for translation from the character set of the input file to the
           source character set used by GCC.  If the locale does not specify, or GCC cannot get this
           information from the locale, the default is UTF-8.  This can be overridden by either the locale
           or this command line option.  Currently the command line option takes precedence if there's a
           conflict.  <u>charset</u> can be any encoding supported by the system's "iconv" library routine.

       <b>-fworking-directory</b>
           Enable generation of linemarkers in the preprocessor output that will let the compiler know the
           current working directory at the time of preprocessing.  When this option is enabled, the
           preprocessor will emit, after the initial linemarker, a second linemarker with the current
           working directory followed by two slashes.  GCC will use this directory, when it's present in the
           preprocessed input, as the directory emitted as the current working directory in some debugging
           information formats.  This option is implicitly enabled if debugging information is enabled, but
           this can be inhibited with the negated form <b>-fno-working-directory</b>.  If the <b>-P</b> flag is present in
           the command line, this option has no effect, since no "#line" directives are emitted whatsoever.

       <b>-fno-show-column</b>
           Do not print column numbers in diagnostics.  This may be necessary if diagnostics are being
           scanned by a program that does not understand the column numbers, such as <b>dejagnu</b>.

       <b>-A</b> <u>predicate</u><b>=</b><u>answer</u>
           Make an assertion with the predicate <u>predicate</u> and answer <u>answer</u>.  This form is preferred to the
           older form <b>-A</b> <u>predicate</u><b>(</b><u>answer</u><b>)</b>, which is still supported, because it does not use shell special
           characters.

       <b>-A</b> <b>-</b><u>predicate</u><b>=</b><u>answer</u>
           Cancel an assertion with the predicate <u>predicate</u> and answer <u>answer</u>.

       <b>-dCHARS</b>
           <u>CHARS</u> is a sequence of one or more of the following characters, and must not be preceded by a
           space.  Other characters are interpreted by the compiler proper, or reserved for future versions
           of GCC, and so are silently ignored.  If you specify characters whose behavior conflicts, the
           result is undefined.

           <b>M</b>   Instead of the normal output, generate a list of <b>#define</b> directives for all the macros
               defined during the execution of the preprocessor, including predefined macros.  This gives
               you a way of finding out what is predefined in your version of the preprocessor.  Assuming
               you have no file <u>foo.h</u>, the command

                       touch foo.h; cpp -dM foo.h

               will show all the predefined macros.

           <b>D</b>   Like <b>M</b> except in two respects: it does <u>not</u> include the predefined macros, and it outputs <u>both</u>
               the <b>#define</b> directives and the result of preprocessing.  Both kinds of output go to the
               standard output file.

           <b>N</b>   Like <b>D</b>, but emit only the macro names, not their expansions.

           <b>I</b>   Output <b>#include</b> directives in addition to the result of preprocessing.

       <b>-P</b>  Inhibit generation of linemarkers in the output from the preprocessor.  This might be useful when
           running the preprocessor on something that is not C code, and will be sent to a program which
           might be confused by the linemarkers.

       <b>-C</b>  Do not discard comments.  All comments are passed through to the output file, except for comments
           in processed directives, which are deleted along with the directive.

           You should be prepared for side effects when using <b>-C</b>; it causes the preprocessor to treat
           comments as tokens in their own right.  For example, comments appearing at the start of what
           would be a directive line have the effect of turning that line into an ordinary source line,
           since the first token on the line is no longer a <b>#</b>.

       <b>-CC</b> Do not discard comments, including during macro expansion.  This is like <b>-C</b>, except that comments
           contained within macros are also passed through to the output file where the macro is expanded.

           In addition to the side-effects of the <b>-C</b> option, the <b>-CC</b> option causes all C++-style comments
           inside a macro to be converted to C-style comments.  This is to prevent later use of that macro
           from inadvertently commenting out the remainder of the source line.

           The <b>-CC</b> option is generally used to support lint comments.

       <b>-traditional-cpp</b>
           Try to imitate the behavior of old-fashioned C preprocessors, as opposed to ISO C preprocessors.

       <b>-trigraphs</b>
           Process trigraph sequences.  These are three-character sequences, all starting with <b>??</b>, that are
           defined by ISO C to stand for single characters.  For example, <b>??/</b> stands for <b>\</b>, so <b>'??/n'</b> is a
           character constant for a newline.  By default, GCC ignores trigraphs, but in standard-conforming
           modes it converts them.  See the <b>-std</b> and <b>-ansi</b> options.

           The nine trigraphs and their replacements are

                   Trigraph:       ??(  ??)  ??&lt;  ??&gt;  ??=  ??/  ??'  ??!  ??-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">Replacement:&nbsp;??Replacement:</font>
                   Replacement:      [    ]    {    }    #    \    ^    |    ~

       <b>-remap</b>
           Enable special code to work around file systems which only permit very short file names, such as
           MS-DOS.

       <b>--help</b>
       <b>--target-help</b>
           Print text describing all the command line options instead of preprocessing anything.

       <b>-v</b>  Verbose mode.  Print out GNU CPP's version number at the beginning of execution, and report the
           final form of the include path.

       <b>-H</b>  Print the name of each header file used, in addition to other normal activities.  Each name is
           indented to show how deep in the <b>#include</b> stack it is.  Precompiled header files are also
           printed, even if they are found to be invalid; an invalid precompiled header file is printed with
           <b>...x</b> and a valid one with <b>...!</b> .

       <b>-version</b>
       <b>--version</b>
           Print out GNU CPP's version number.  With one dash, proceed to preprocess as normal.  With two
           dashes, exit immediately.

       <b>Passing</b> <b>Options</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Assembler</b>

       You can pass options to the assembler.

       <b>-Wa,</b><u>option</u>
           Pass <u>option</u> as an option to the assembler.  If <u>option</u> contains commas, it is split into multiple
           options at the commas.

       <b>-Xassembler</b> <u>option</u>
           Pass <u>option</u> as an option to the assembler.  You can use this to supply system-specific assembler
           options which GCC does not know how to recognize.

           If you want to pass an option that takes an argument, you must use <b>-Xassembler</b> twice, once for
           the option and once for the argument.

       <b>Options</b> <b>for</b> <b>Linking</b>

       These options come into play when the compiler links object files into an executable output file.
       They are meaningless if the compiler is not doing a link step.

       In addition to the options listed below, Apple's GCC also accepts and passes nearly all of the
       options defined by the linker <b>ld</b> and by the library tool <b>libtool</b>.  Common options include <b>-framework</b>,
       <b>-dynamic</b>, <b>-bundle</b>, <b>-flat_namespace</b>, and so forth.  See the ld and libtool man pages for further
       details.

       <u>object-file-name</u>
           A file name that does not end in a special recognized suffix is considered to name an object file
           or library.  (Object files are distinguished from libraries by the linker according to the file
           contents.)  If linking is done, these object files are used as input to the linker.

       <b>-c</b>
       <b>-S</b>
       <b>-E</b>  If any of these options is used, then the linker is not run, and object file names should not be
           used as arguments.

       <b>-l</b><u>library</u>
       <b>-l</b> <u>library</u>
           Search the library named <u>library</u> when linking.  (The second alternative with the library as a
           separate argument is only for POSIX compliance and is not recommended.)

           It makes a difference where in the command you write this option; the linker searches and
           processes libraries and object files in the order they are specified.  Thus, <b>foo.o</b> <b>-lz</b> <b>bar.o</b>
           searches library <b>z</b> after file <u>foo.o</u> but before <u>bar.o</u>.  If <u>bar.o</u> refers to functions in <b>z</b>, those
           functions may not be loaded.

           The linker searches a standard list of directories for the library, which is actually a file
           named <u>liblibrary.a</u>.  The linker then uses this file as if it had been specified precisely by
           name.

           The directories searched include several standard system directories plus any that you specify
           with <b>-L</b>.

           Normally the files found this way are library files---archive files whose members are object
           files.  The linker handles an archive file by scanning through it for members which define
           symbols that have so far been referenced but not defined.  But if the file that is found is an
           ordinary object file, it is linked in the usual fashion.  The only difference between using an <b>-l</b>
           option and specifying a file name is that <b>-l</b> surrounds <u>library</u> with <b>lib</b> and <b>.a</b> and searches
           several directories.

       <b>-lobjc</b>
           You need this special case of the <b>-l</b> option in order to link an Objective-C or Objective-C++
           program.

       <b>-nostartfiles</b>
           Do not use the standard system startup files when linking.  The standard system libraries are
           used normally, unless <b>-nostdlib</b> or <b>-nodefaultlibs</b> is used.

       <b>-nodefaultlibs</b>
           Do not use the standard system libraries when linking.  Only the libraries you specify will be
           passed to the linker.  The standard startup files are used normally, unless <b>-nostartfiles</b> is
           used.  The compiler may generate calls to "memcmp", "memset", "memcpy" and "memmove".  These
           entries are usually resolved by entries in libc.  These entry points should be supplied through
           some other mechanism when this option is specified.

       <b>-nostdlib</b>
           Do not use the standard system startup files or libraries when linking.  No startup files and
           only the libraries you specify will be passed to the linker.  The compiler may generate calls to
           "memcmp", "memset", "memcpy" and "memmove".  These entries are usually resolved by entries in
           libc.  These entry points should be supplied through some other mechanism when this option is
           specified.

           One of the standard libraries bypassed by <b>-nostdlib</b> and <b>-nodefaultlibs</b> is <u>libgcc.a</u>, a library of
           internal subroutines that GCC uses to overcome shortcomings of particular machines, or special
           needs for some languages.

           In most cases, you need <u>libgcc.a</u> even when you want to avoid other standard libraries.  In other
           words, when you specify <b>-nostdlib</b> or <b>-nodefaultlibs</b> you should usually specify <b>-lgcc</b> as well.
           This ensures that you have no unresolved references to internal GCC library subroutines.  (For
           example, <b>__main</b>, used to ensure C++ constructors will be called.)

       <b>-pie</b>
           Produce a position independent executable on targets which support it.  For predictable results,
           you must also specify the same set of options that were used to generate code (<b>-fpie</b>, <b>-fPIE</b>, or
           model suboptions) when you specify this option.

       <b>-s</b>  Remove all symbol table and relocation information from the executable.

       <b>-static</b>
           On systems that support dynamic linking, this prevents linking with the shared libraries.  On
           other systems, this option has no effect.

           This option will not work on Mac OS X unless all libraries (including <u>libgcc.a</u>) have also been
           compiled with <b>-static</b>.  Since neither a static version of libSystem.dylib nor crt0.o are
           provided, this option is not useful to most people.

       <b>-shared</b>
           Produce a shared object which can then be linked with other objects to form an executable.  Not
           all systems support this option.  For predictable results, you must also specify the same set of
           options that were used to generate code (<b>-fpic</b>, <b>-fPIC</b>, or model suboptions) when you specify this
           option.[1]

           This option is not supported on Mac OS X.

       <b>-shared-libgcc</b>
       <b>-static-libgcc</b>
           On systems that provide <u>libgcc</u> as a shared library, these options force the use of either the
           shared or static version respectively.  If no shared version of <u>libgcc</u> was built when the
           compiler was configured, these options have no effect.

           There are several situations in which an application should use the shared <u>libgcc</u> instead of the
           static version.  The most common of these is when the application wishes to throw and catch
           exceptions across different shared libraries.  In that case, each of the libraries as well as the
           application itself should use the shared <u>libgcc</u>.

           Therefore, the G++ and GCJ drivers automatically add <b>-shared-libgcc</b> whenever you build a shared
           library or a main executable, because C++ and Java programs typically use exceptions, so this is
           the right thing to do.

           If, instead, you use the GCC driver to create shared libraries, you may find that they will not
           always be linked with the shared <u>libgcc</u>.  If GCC finds, at its configuration time, that you have
           a non-GNU linker or a GNU linker that does not support option <b>--eh-frame-hdr</b>, it will link the
           shared version of <u>libgcc</u> into shared libraries by default.  Otherwise, it will take advantage of
           the linker and optimize away the linking with the shared version of <u>libgcc</u>, linking with the
           static version of libgcc by default.  This allows exceptions to propagate through such shared
           libraries, without incurring relocation costs at library load time.

           However, if a library or main executable is supposed to throw or catch exceptions, you must link
           it using the G++ or GCJ driver, as appropriate for the languages used in the program, or using
           the option <b>-shared-libgcc</b>, such that it is linked with the shared <u>libgcc</u>.

       <b>-symbolic</b>
           Bind references to global symbols when building a shared object.  Warn about any unresolved
           references (unless overridden by the link editor option <b>-Xlinker</b> <b>-z</b> <b>-Xlinker</b> <b>defs</b>).  Only a few
           systems support this option.

       <b>-Xlinker</b> <u>option</u>
           Pass <u>option</u> as an option to the linker.  You can use this to supply system-specific linker
           options which GCC does not know how to recognize.

           If you want to pass an option that takes an argument, you must use <b>-Xlinker</b> twice, once for the
           option and once for the argument.  For example, to pass <b>-assert</b> <b>definitions</b>, you must write
           <b>-Xlinker</b> <b>-assert</b> <b>-Xlinker</b> <b>definitions</b>.  It does not work to write <b>-Xlinker</b> <b>"-assert</b> <b>definitions"</b>,
           because this passes the entire string as a single argument, which is not what the linker expects.

       <b>-Wl,</b><u>option</u>
           Pass <u>option</u> as an option to the linker.  If <u>option</u> contains commas, it is split into multiple
           options at the commas.

       <b>-u</b> <u>symbol</u>
           Pretend the symbol <u>symbol</u> is undefined, to force linking of library modules to define it.  You
           can use <b>-u</b> multiple times with different symbols to force loading of additional library modules.

       <b>Options</b> <b>for</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Search</b>

       These options specify directories to search for header files, for libraries and for parts of the
       compiler:

       <b>-I</b><u>dir</u>
           Add the directory <u>dir</u> to the head of the list of directories to be searched for header files.
           This can be used to override a system header file, substituting your own version, since these
           directories are searched before the system header file directories.  However, you should not use
           this option to add directories that contain vendor-supplied system header files (use <b>-isystem</b> for
           that).  If you use more than one <b>-I</b> option, the directories are scanned in left-to-right order;
           the standard system directories come after.

           If a standard system include directory, or a directory specified with <b>-isystem</b>, is also specified
           with <b>-I</b>, the <b>-I</b> option will be ignored.  The directory will still be searched but as a system
           directory at its normal position in the system include chain.  This is to ensure that GCC's
           procedure to fix buggy system headers and the ordering for the include_next directive are not
           inadvertently changed.  If you really need to change the search order for system directories, use
           the <b>-nostdinc</b> and/or <b>-isystem</b> options.

       <b>-iquote</b><u>dir</u>
           Add the directory <u>dir</u> to the head of the list of directories to be searched for header files only
           for the case of <b>#include</b> <b>"</b><u>file</u><b>"</b>; they are not searched for <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;</b><u>file</u><b>&gt;</b>, otherwise just like
           <b>-I</b>.

       <b>-L</b><u>dir</u>
           Add directory <u>dir</u> to the list of directories to be searched for <b>-l</b>.

       <b>-B</b><u>prefix</u>
           This option specifies where to find the executables, libraries, include files, and data files of
           the compiler itself.

           The compiler driver program runs one or more of the subprograms <u>cpp</u>, <u>cc1</u>, <u>as</u> and <u>ld</u>.  It tries
           <u>prefix</u> as a prefix for each program it tries to run, both with and without <u>machine</u><b>/</b><u>version</u><b>/</b>.

           For each subprogram to be run, the compiler driver first tries the <b>-B</b> prefix, if any.  If that
           name is not found, or if <b>-B</b> was not specified, the driver tries two standard prefixes, which are
           <u>/usr/lib/gcc/</u> and <u>/usr/local/lib/gcc/</u>.  If neither of those results in a file name that is found,
           the unmodified program name is searched for using the directories specified in your <b>PATH</b>
           environment variable.

           The compiler will check to see if the path provided by the <b>-B</b> refers to a directory, and if
           necessary it will add a directory separator character at the end of the path.

           <b>-B</b> prefixes that effectively specify directory names also apply to libraries in the linker,
           because the compiler translates these options into <b>-L</b> options for the linker.  They also apply to
           includes files in the preprocessor, because the compiler translates these options into <b>-isystem</b>
           options for the preprocessor.  In this case, the compiler appends <b>include</b> to the prefix.

           The run-time support file <u>libgcc.a</u> can also be searched for using the <b>-B</b> prefix, if needed.  If
           it is not found there, the two standard prefixes above are tried, and that is all.  The file is
           left out of the link if it is not found by those means.

           Another way to specify a prefix much like the <b>-B</b> prefix is to use the environment variable
           <b>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</b>.

           As a special kludge, if the path provided by <b>-B</b> is <u>[dir/]stageN/</u>, where <u>N</u> is a number in the
           range 0 to 9, then it will be replaced by <u>[dir/]include</u>.  This is to help with boot-strapping the
           compiler.

       <b>-specs=</b><u>file</u>
           Process <u>file</u> after the compiler reads in the standard <u>specs</u> file, in order to override the
           defaults that the <u>gcc</u> driver program uses when determining what switches to pass to <u>cc1</u>, <u>cc1plus</u>,
           <u>as</u>, <u>ld</u>, etc.  More than one <b>-specs=</b><u>file</u> can be specified on the command line, and they are
           processed in order, from left to right.

       <b>-I-</b> This option has been deprecated.  Please use <b>-iquote</b> instead for <b>-I</b> directories before the <b>-I</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">and&nbsp;-Iand</font>
           and remove the <b>-I-</b>.  Any directories you specify with <b>-I</b> options before the <b>-I-</b> option are
           searched only for the case of <b>#include</b> <b>"</b><u>file</u><b>"</b>; they are not searched for <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;</b><u>file</u><b>&gt;</b>.

           If additional directories are specified with <b>-I</b> options after the <b>-I-</b>, these directories are
           searched for all <b>#include</b> directives.  (Ordinarily <u>all</u> <b>-I</b> directories are used this way.)

           In addition, the <b>-I-</b> option inhibits the use of the current directory (where the current input
           file came from) as the first search directory for <b>#include</b> <b>"</b><u>file</u><b>"</b>.  There is no way to override
           this effect of <b>-I-</b>.  With <b>-I.</b> you can specify searching the directory which was current when the
           compiler was invoked.  That is not exactly the same as what the preprocessor does by default, but
           it is often satisfactory.

           <b>-I-</b> does not inhibit the use of the standard system directories for header files.  Thus, <b>-I-</b> and
           <b>-nostdinc</b> are independent.

       <b>Specifying</b> <b>Target</b> <b>Machine</b> <b>and</b> <b>Compiler</b> <b>Version</b>

       The usual way to run GCC is to run the executable called <u>gcc</u>, or <u>&lt;machine&gt;-gcc</u> when cross-compiling,
       or <u>&lt;machine&gt;-gcc-&lt;version&gt;</u> to run a version other than the one that was installed last.  Sometimes
       this is inconvenient, so GCC provides options that will switch to another cross-compiler or version.

       <b>-b</b> <u>machine</u>
           The argument <u>machine</u> specifies the target machine for compilation.

           The value to use for <u>machine</u> is the same as was specified as the machine type when configuring
           GCC as a cross-compiler.  For example, if a cross-compiler was configured with <b>configure</b> <b>i386v</b>,
           meaning to compile for an 80386 running System V, then you would specify <b>-b</b> <b>i386v</b> to run that
           cross compiler.

       <b>-V</b> <u>version</u>
           The argument <u>version</u> specifies which version of GCC to run.  This is useful when multiple
           versions are installed.  For example, <u>version</u> might be <b>2.0</b>, meaning to run GCC version 2.0.

       The <b>-V</b> and <b>-b</b> options work by running the <u>&lt;machine&gt;-gcc-&lt;version&gt;</u> executable, so there's no real
       reason to use them if you can just run that directly.

       <b>Hardware</b> <b>Models</b> <b>and</b> <b>Configurations</b>

       Earlier we discussed the standard option <b>-b</b> which chooses among different installed compilers for
       completely different target machines, such as VAX vs. 68000 vs. 80386.

       In addition, each of these target machine types can have its own special options, starting with <b>-m</b>,
       to choose among various hardware models or configurations---for example, 68010 vs 68020, floating
       coprocessor or none.  A single installed version of the compiler can compile for any model or
       configuration, according to the options specified.

       Some configurations of the compiler also support additional special options, usually for
       compatibility with other compilers on the same platform.

       These options are defined by the macro "TARGET_SWITCHES" in the machine description.  The default for
       the options is also defined by that macro, which enables you to change the defaults.

       <u>ARM</u> <u>Options</u>

       These <b>-m</b> options are defined for Advanced RISC Machines (ARM) architectures:

       <b>-mabi=</b><u>name</u>
           Generate code for the specified ABI.  Permissible values are: <b>apcs-gnu</b>, <b>atpcs</b>, <b>aapcs</b> and <b>iwmmxt</b>.

       <b>-mapcs-frame</b>
           Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the ARM Procedure Call Standard for all functions,
           even if this is not strictly necessary for correct execution of the code.  Specifying
           <b>-fomit-frame-pointer</b> with this option will cause the stack frames not to be generated for leaf
           functions.  The default is <b>-mno-apcs-frame</b>.

       <b>-mapcs</b>
           This is a synonym for <b>-mapcs-frame</b>.

       <b>-mthumb-interwork</b>
           Generate code which supports calling between the ARM and Thumb instruction sets.  Without this
           option the two instruction sets cannot be reliably used inside one program.  The default is
           <b>-mno-thumb-interwork</b>, since slightly larger code is generated when <b>-mthumb-interwork</b> is
           specified.

       <b>-mno-sched-prolog</b>
           Prevent the reordering of instructions in the function prolog, or the merging of those
           instruction with the instructions in the function's body.  This means that all functions will
           start with a recognizable set of instructions (or in fact one of a choice from a small set of
           different function prologues), and this information can be used to locate the start if functions
           inside an executable piece of code.  The default is <b>-msched-prolog</b>.

       <b>-mhard-float</b>
           Generate output containing floating point instructions.  This is the default.

       <b>-msoft-float</b>
           Generate output containing library calls for floating point.  <b>Warning:</b> the requisite libraries
           are not available for all ARM targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler
           are used, but this cannot be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make your own
           arrangements to provide suitable library functions for cross-compilation.

           <b>-msoft-float</b> changes the calling convention in the output file; therefore, it is only useful if
           you compile <u>all</u> of a program with this option.  In particular, you need to compile <u>libgcc.a</u>, the
           library that comes with GCC, with <b>-msoft-float</b> in order for this to work.

       <b>-mfloat-abi=</b><u>name</u>
           Specifies which ABI to use for floating point values.  Permissible values are: <b>soft</b>, <b>softfp</b> and
           <b>hard</b>.

           <b>soft</b> and <b>hard</b> are equivalent to <b>-msoft-float</b> and <b>-mhard-float</b> respectively.  <b>softfp</b> allows the
           generation of floating point instructions, but still uses the soft-float calling conventions.

       <b>-mlittle-endian</b>
           Generate code for a processor running in little-endian mode.  This is the default for all
           standard configurations.

       <b>-mbig-endian</b>
           Generate code for a processor running in big-endian mode; the default is to compile code for a
           little-endian processor.

       <b>-mwords-little-endian</b>
           This option only applies when generating code for big-endian processors.  Generate code for a
           little-endian word order but a big-endian byte order.  That is, a byte order of the form
           <b>32107654</b>.  Note: this option should only be used if you require compatibility with code for big-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">endian&nbsp;bigendian</font>
           endian ARM processors generated by versions of the compiler prior to 2.8.

       <b>-mcpu=</b><u>name</u>
           This specifies the name of the target ARM processor.  GCC uses this name to determine what kind
           of instructions it can emit when generating assembly code.  Permissible names are: <b>arm2</b>, <b>arm250</b>,
           <b>arm3</b>, <b>arm6</b>, <b>arm60</b>, <b>arm600</b>, <b>arm610</b>, <b>arm620</b>, <b>arm7</b>, <b>arm7m</b>, <b>arm7d</b>, <b>arm7dm</b>, <b>arm7di</b>, <b>arm7dmi</b>, <b>arm70</b>,

       <b>-mtune=</b><u>name</u>
           This option is very similar to the <b>-mcpu=</b> option, except that instead of specifying the actual
           target processor type, and hence restricting which instructions can be used, it specifies that
           GCC should tune the performance of the code as if the target were of the type specified in this
           option, but still choosing the instructions that it will generate based on the cpu specified by a
           <b>-mcpu=</b> option.  For some ARM implementations better performance can be obtained by using this
           option.

       <b>-march=</b><u>name</u>
           This specifies the name of the target ARM architecture.  GCC uses this name to determine what
           kind of instructions it can emit when generating assembly code.  This option can be used in
           conjunction with or instead of the <b>-mcpu=</b> option.  Permissible names are: <b>armv2</b>, <b>armv2a</b>, <b>armv3</b>,
           <b>armv3m</b>, <b>armv4</b>, <b>armv4t</b>, <b>armv5</b>, <b>armv5t</b>, <b>armv5te</b>, <b>armv6</b>, <b>armv6j</b>, <b>iwmmxt</b>, <b>ep9312</b>.

       <b>-mfpu=</b><u>name</u>
       <b>-mfpe=</b><u>number</u>
       <b>-mfp=</b><u>number</u>
           This specifies what floating point hardware (or hardware emulation) is available on the target.
           Permissible names are: <b>fpa</b>, <b>fpe2</b>, <b>fpe3</b>, <b>maverick</b>, <b>vfp</b>.  <b>-mfp</b> and <b>-mfpe</b> are synonyms for
           <b>-mfpu</b>=<b>fpe</b><u>number</u>, for compatibility with older versions of GCC.

           If <b>-msoft-float</b> is specified this specifies the format of floating point values.

       <b>-mstructure-size-boundary=</b><u>n</u>
           The size of all structures and unions will be rounded up to a multiple of the number of bits set
           by this option.  Permissible values are 8, 32 and 64.  The default value varies for different
           toolchains.  For the COFF targeted toolchain the default value is 8.  A value of 64 is only
           allowed if the underlying ABI supports it.

           Specifying the larger number can produce faster, more efficient code, but can also increase the
           size of the program.  Different values are potentially incompatible.  Code compiled with one
           value cannot necessarily expect to work with code or libraries compiled with another value, if
           they exchange information using structures or unions.

       <b>-mabort-on-noreturn</b>
           Generate a call to the function "abort" at the end of a "noreturn" function.  It will be executed
           if the function tries to return.

       <b>-mlong-calls</b>
       <b>-mno-long-calls</b>
           Tells the compiler to perform function calls by first loading the address of the function into a
           register and then performing a subroutine call on this register.  This switch is needed if the
           target function will lie outside of the 64 megabyte addressing range of the offset based version
           of subroutine call instruction.

           Even if this switch is enabled, not all function calls will be turned into long calls.  The
           heuristic is that static functions, functions which have the <b>short-call</b> attribute, functions that
           are inside the scope of a <b>#pragma</b> <b>no_long_calls</b> directive and functions whose definitions have
           already been compiled within the current compilation unit, will not be turned into long calls.
           The exception to this rule is that weak function definitions, functions with the <b>long-call</b>
           attribute or the <b>section</b> attribute, and functions that are within the scope of a <b>#pragma</b>
           <b>long_calls</b> directive, will always be turned into long calls.

           This feature is not enabled by default.  Specifying <b>-mno-long-calls</b> will restore the default
           behavior, as will placing the function calls within the scope of a <b>#pragma</b> <b>long_calls_off</b>
           directive.  Note these switches have no effect on how the compiler generates code to handle
           function calls via function pointers.

       <b>-mnop-fun-dllimport</b>
           Disable support for the "dllimport" attribute.

       <b>-msingle-pic-base</b>
           Treat the register used for PIC addressing as read-only, rather than loading it in the prologue
           for each function.  The run-time system is responsible for initializing this register with an
           appropriate value before execution begins.

       <b>-mpic-register=</b><u>reg</u>
           Specify the register to be used for PIC addressing.  The default is R10 unless stack-checking is
           enabled, when R9 is used.

       <b>-mcirrus-fix-invalid-insns</b>
           Insert NOPs into the instruction stream to in order to work around problems with invalid Maverick
           instruction combinations.  This option is only valid if the <b>-mcpu=ep9312</b> option has been used to
           enable generation of instructions for the Cirrus Maverick floating point co-processor.  This
           option is not enabled by default, since the problem is only present in older Maverick
           implementations.  The default can be re-enabled by use of the <b>-mno-cirrus-fix-invalid-insns</b>
           switch.

       <b>-mpoke-function-name</b>
           Write the name of each function into the text section, directly preceding the function prologue.
           The generated code is similar to this:

                        t0
                            .ascii "arm_poke_function_name", 0
                            .align
                        t1
                            .word 0xff000000 + (t1 - t0)
                        arm_poke_function_name
                            mov     ip, sp
                            stmfd   sp!, {fp, ip, lr, pc}
                            sub     fp, ip, #4

           When performing a stack backtrace, code can inspect the value of "pc" stored at "fp + 0".  If the
           trace function then looks at location "pc - 12" and the top 8 bits are set, then we know that
           there is a function name embedded immediately preceding this location and has length "((pc[-3]) &amp;
           0xff000000)".

       <b>-mthumb</b>
           Generate code for the 16-bit Thumb instruction set.  The default is to use the 32-bit ARM
           instruction set.

       <b>-mtpcs-frame</b>
           Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the Thumb Procedure Call Standard for all non-leaf
           functions.  (A leaf function is one that does not call any other functions.)  The default is
           <b>-mno-tpcs-frame</b>.

       <b>-mtpcs-leaf-frame</b>
           Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the Thumb Procedure Call Standard for all leaf
           functions.  (A leaf function is one that does not call any other functions.)  The default is
           <b>-mno-apcs-leaf-frame</b>.

       <b>-mcallee-super-interworking</b>
           Gives all externally visible functions in the file being compiled an ARM instruction set header
           which switches to Thumb mode before executing the rest of the function.  This allows these
           functions to be called from non-interworking code.

       <b>-mcaller-super-interworking</b>
           Allows calls via function pointers (including virtual functions) to execute correctly regardless
           of whether the target code has been compiled for interworking or not.  There is a small overhead
           in the cost of executing a function pointer if this option is enabled.

       <u>Darwin</u> <u>Options</u>

       These options are defined for all architectures running the Darwin operating system.

       FSF GCC on Darwin does not create ``universal'' object files; it will create an object file for the
       single architecture that it was built to target.  Apple's GCC on Darwin does create ``universal''
       files if multiple <b>-arch</b> options are used; it does so by running the compiler or linker multiple times
       and joining the results together with <u>lipo</u>.

       The subtype of the file created (like <b>ppc7400</b> or <b>ppc970</b> or <b>i686</b>) is determined by the flags that
       specify the ISA that GCC is targetting, like <b>-mcpu</b> or <b>-march</b>.  The <b>-force_cpusubtype_ALL</b> option can
       be used to override this.

       The Darwin tools vary in their behavior when presented with an ISA mismatch.  The assembler, <u>as</u>, will
       only permit instructions to be used that are valid for the subtype of the file it is generating, so
       you cannot put 64-bit instructions in an <b>ppc750</b> object file.  The linker for shared libraries,
       <u>/usr/bin/libtool</u>, will fail and print an error if asked to create a shared library with a less
       restrictive subtype than its input files (for instance, trying to put a <b>ppc970</b> object file in a
       <b>ppc7400</b> library).  The linker for executables, <u>ld</u>, will quietly give the executable the most
       restrictive subtype of any of its input files.

       <b>-F</b><u>dir</u>
           Add the framework directory <u>dir</u> to the head of the list of directories to be searched for header
           files.  These directories are interleaved with those specified by <b>-I</b> options and are scanned in a
           left-to-right order.

           A framework directory is a directory with frameworks in it.  A framework is a directory with a
           <b>"Headers"</b> and/or <b>"PrivateHeaders"</b> directory contained directly in it that ends in <b>".framework"</b>.
           The name of a framework is the name of this directory excluding the <b>".framework"</b>.  Headers
           associated with the framework are found in one of those two directories, with <b>"Headers"</b> being
           searched first.  A subframework is a framework directory that is in a framework's <b>"Frameworks"</b>
           directory.  Includes of subframework headers can only appear in a header of a framework that
           contains the subframework, or in a sibling subframework header.  Two subframeworks are siblings
           if they occur in the same framework.  A subframework should not have the same name as a
           framework, a warning will be issued if this is violated.  Currently a subframework cannot have
           subframeworks, in the future, the mechanism may be extended to support this.  The standard
           frameworks can be found in <b>"/System/Library/Frameworks"</b> and <b>"/Library/Frameworks"</b>.  An example
           include looks like "#include &lt;Framework/header.h&gt;", where <b>Framework</b> denotes the name of the
           framework and header.h is found in the <b>"PrivateHeaders"</b> or <b>"Headers"</b> directory.

       <b>-iframework</b><u>dir</u>
           Like <b>-F</b> except the directory is a treated as a system directory.  The main effect is to not warn
           about constructs contained within header files found via <u>dir</u>.

       <b>-gused</b>
           Emit debugging information for symbols that are used.  For STABS debugging format, this enables
           <b>-feliminate-unused-debug-symbols</b>.  This is by default ON.

       <b>-gfull</b>
           Emit debugging information for all symbols and types.

       <b>-mmacosx-version-min=</b><u>version</u>
           The earliest version of MacOS X that this executable will run on is <u>version</u>.  Typical values of
           <u>version</u> include 10.1, 10.2, and 10.3.9.

           If the compiler was built to use the system's headers by default, then the default for this
           option is the system version on which the compiler is running, otherwise the default is to make
           choices which are compatible with as many systems and code bases as possible.

       <b>-mkernel</b>
           Enable kernel development mode.  The <b>-mkernel</b> option sets <b>-static</b>, <b>-fno-common</b>, <b>-fno-cxa-atexit</b>,
           <b>-fno-exceptions</b>, <b>-fno-non-call-exceptions</b>, <b>-fapple-kext</b>, <b>-fno-weak</b> and <b>-fno-rtti</b> where
           applicable.  This mode also sets <b>-mno-altivec</b>, <b>-msoft-float</b>, <b>-fno-builtin</b> and <b>-mlong-branch</b> for
           PowerPC targets.

       <b>-mone-byte-bool</b>
           Override the defaults for <b>bool</b> so that <b>sizeof(bool)==1</b>.  By default <b>sizeof(bool)</b> is <b>4</b> when
           compiling for Darwin/PowerPC and <b>1</b> when compiling for Darwin/x86, so this option has no effect on
           x86.

           <b>Warning:</b> The <b>-mone-byte-bool</b> switch causes GCC to generate code that is not binary compatible
           with code generated without that switch.  Using this switch may require recompiling all other
           modules in a program, including system libraries.  Use this switch to conform to a non-default
           data model.

       <b>-mfix-and-continue</b>
       <b>-ffix-and-continue</b>
       <b>-findirect-data</b>
           Generate code suitable for fast turn around development.  Needed to enable gdb to dynamically
           load ".o" files into already running programs.  <b>-findirect-data</b> and <b>-ffix-and-continue</b> are
           provided for backwards compatibility.

       <b>-fapple-kext</b>
       <b>-findirect-virtual-calls</b>
       <b>-fterminated-vtables</b>
           Alter vtables, destructors, and other implementation details to more closely resemble the GCC
           2.95 ABI.  This is to make kernel extensions loadable by Darwin kernels, and is required to build
           any Darwin kernel extension.  In addition, virtual calls are not made directly, instead, code is
           generated to always go through the virtual table, as virtual tables can be patched by the kernel
           module loader.  Vtables are altered by adding a zero word at the end of every vtable.
           <b>-fno-exceptions</b> and <b>-static</b> must also be used with this flag.  <b>-findirect-virtual-calls</b> and
           <b>-fterminated-vtables</b> are accepted for backwards compatibility but will be removed in the future.
           On Intel x86-based Apple platforms, the kernel and its extensions run with a four-byte aligned
           stack (<b>-mpreferred-stack-boundary=2</b>); function prologues inside kernel extentions won't keep the
           usual 16-byte alignment required everywhere else in OS X.  (APPLE ONLY)

       <b>-all_load</b>
           Loads all members of static archive libraries.  See man <a href="ld.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ld"><u>ld</u>(1)</a> for more information.

       <b>-arch_errors_fatal</b>
           Cause the errors having to do with files that have the wrong architecture to be fatal.

       <b>-bind_at_load</b>
           Causes the output file to be marked such that the dynamic linker will bind all undefined
           references when the file is loaded or launched.

       <b>-bundle</b>
           Produce a Mach-o bundle format file.  See man <a href="ld.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ld"><u>ld</u>(1)</a> for more information.

       <b>-bundle_loader</b> <u>executable</u>
           This option specifies the <u>executable</u> that will be loading the build output file being linked.
           See man <a href="ld.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ld"><u>ld</u>(1)</a> for more information.

       <b>-dynamiclib</b>
           When passed this option, GCC will produce a dynamic library instead of an executable when
           linking, using the Darwin <u>libtool</u> command.

       <b>-force_cpusubtype_ALL</b>
           This causes GCC's output file to have the <u>ALL</u> subtype, instead of one controlled by the <b>-mcpu</b> or
           <b>-march</b> option.

       <u>Intel</u> <u>386</u> <u>and</u> <u>AMD</u> <u>x86-64</u> <u>Options</u>

       These <b>-m</b> options are defined for the i386 and x86-64 family of computers:

       <b>-mtune=</b><u>cpu-type</u>
           Tune to <u>cpu-type</u> everything applicable about the generated code, except for the ABI and the set
           of available instructions.  The choices for <u>cpu-type</u> are:

           <u>generic</u>
               Produce code optimized for the most common IA32/AMD64/EM64T processors.  If you know the CPU
               on which your code will run, then you should use the corresponding <b>-mtune</b> option instead of
               <b>-mtune=generic</b>.  But, if you do not know exactly what CPU users of your application will
               have, then you should use this option.

               As new processors are deployed in the marketplace, the behavior of this option will change.
               Therefore, if you upgrade to a newer version of GCC, the code generated option will change to
               reflect the processors that were most common when that version of GCC was released.

               There is no <b>-march=generic</b> option because <b>-march</b> indicates the instruction set the compiler
               can use, and there is no generic instruction set applicable to all processors.  In contrast,
               <b>-mtune</b> indicates the processor (or, in this case, collection of processors) for which the
               code is optimized.

           <u>i386</u>
               Original Intel's i386 CPU.

           <u>i486</u>
               Intel's i486 CPU.  (No scheduling is implemented for this chip.)

           <u>i586,</u> <u>pentium</u>
               Intel Pentium CPU with no MMX support.

           <u>pentium-mmx</u>
               Intel PentiumMMX CPU based on Pentium core with MMX instruction set support.

           <u>pentiumpro</u>
               Intel PentiumPro CPU.

           <u>i686</u>
               Same as "generic", but when used as "march" option, PentiumPro instruction set will be used,
               so the code will run on all i686 familly chips.

           <u>pentium2</u>
               Intel Pentium2 CPU based on PentiumPro core with MMX instruction set support.

           <u>pentium3,</u> <u>pentium3m</u>

           <u>winchip2</u>

           <u>c3</u>  Via C3 CPU with MMX and 3dNOW! instruction set support.  (No scheduling is implemented for

           <u>c3-2</u>
               Via C3-2 CPU with MMX and SSE instruction set support.  (No scheduling is implemented for
               this chip.)

           While picking a specific <u>cpu-type</u> will schedule things appropriately for that particular chip,
           the compiler will not generate any code that does not run on the i386 without the <b>-march=</b><u>cpu-type</u>
           option being used.

       <b>-march=</b><u>cpu-type</u>
           Generate instructions for the machine type <u>cpu-type</u>.  The choices for <u>cpu-type</u> are the same as
           for <b>-mtune</b>.  Moreover, specifying <b>-march=</b><u>cpu-type</u> implies <b>-mtune=</b><u>cpu-type</u>.

       <b>-mcpu=</b><u>cpu-type</u>
           A deprecated synonym for <b>-mtune</b>.

       <b>-m386</b>
       <b>-m486</b>
       <b>-mpentium</b>
       <b>-mpentiumpro</b>
           These options are synonyms for <b>-mtune=i386</b>, <b>-mtune=i486</b>, <b>-mtune=pentium</b>, and <b>-mtune=pentiumpro</b>
           respectively.  These synonyms are deprecated.

       <b>-mfpmath=</b><u>unit</u>
           Generate floating point arithmetics for selected unit <u>unit</u>.  The choices for <u>unit</u> are:

           <b>387</b> Use the standard 387 floating point coprocessor present majority of chips and emulated
               otherwise.  Code compiled with this option will run almost everywhere.  The temporary results
               are computed in 80bit precision instead of precision specified by the type resulting in
               slightly different results compared to most of other chips.  See <b>-ffloat-store</b> for more
               detailed description.

               This is the default choice for i386 compiler.

           <b>sse</b> Use scalar floating point instructions present in the SSE instruction set.  This instruction
               set is supported by Pentium3 and newer chips, in the AMD line by Athlon-4, Athlon-xp and
               Athlon-mp chips.  The earlier version of SSE instruction set supports only single precision
               arithmetics, thus the double and extended precision arithmetics is still done using 387.
               Later version, present only in Pentium4 and the future AMD x86-64 chips supports double
               precision arithmetics too.

               For the i386 compiler, you need to use <b>-march=</b><u>cpu-type</u>, <b>-msse</b> or <b>-msse2</b> switches to enable
               SSE extensions and make this option effective.  For the x86-64 compiler, these extensions are
               enabled by default.

               The resulting code should be considerably faster in the majority of cases and avoid the
               numerical instability problems of 387 code, but may break some existing code that expects
               temporaries to be 80bit.

               This is the default choice for the x86-64 compiler.

           <b>sse,387</b>
               Attempt to utilize both instruction sets at once.  This effectively double the amount of
               available registers and on chips with separate execution units for 387 and SSE the execution
               resources too.  Use this option with care, as it is still experimental, because the GCC
               register allocator does not model separate functional units well resulting in instable
               performance.

       <b>-masm=</b><u>dialect</u>
           Output asm instructions using selected <u>dialect</u>.  Supported choices are <b>intel</b> or <b>att</b> (the default
           one).  Darwin does not support <b>intel</b>.

       <b>-mieee-fp</b>
       <b>-mno-ieee-fp</b>
           Control whether or not the compiler uses IEEE floating point comparisons.  These handle correctly
           the case where the result of a comparison is unordered.

       <b>-msoft-float</b>
           Generate output containing library calls for floating point.  <b>Warning:</b> the requisite libraries
           are not part of GCC.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are used, but
           this can't be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make your own arrangements to provide
           suitable library functions for cross-compilation.

           On machines where a function returns floating point results in the 80387 register stack, some
           floating point opcodes may be emitted even if <b>-msoft-float</b> is used.

       <b>-mno-fp-ret-in-387</b>
           Do not use the FPU registers for return values of functions.

           The usual calling convention has functions return values of types "float" and "double" in an FPU
           register, even if there is no FPU.  The idea is that the operating system should emulate an FPU.

           The option <b>-mno-fp-ret-in-387</b> causes such values to be returned in ordinary CPU registers
           instead.

       <b>-mno-fancy-math-387</b>
           Some 387 emulators do not support the "sin", "cos" and "sqrt" instructions for the 387.  Specify
           this option to avoid generating those instructions.  This option is the default on FreeBSD,
           OpenBSD and NetBSD.  This option is overridden when <b>-march</b> indicates that the target cpu will
           always have an FPU and so the instruction will not need emulation.  As of revision 2.6.1, these
           instructions are not generated unless you also use the <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations</b> switch.

       <b>-malign-double</b>
       <b>-mno-align-double</b>
           Control whether GCC aligns "double", "long double", and "long long" variables on a two word
           boundary or a one word boundary.  Aligning "double" variables on a two word boundary will produce
           code that runs somewhat faster on a <b>Pentium</b> at the expense of more memory.

           <b>Warning:</b> if you use the <b>-malign-double</b> switch, structures containing the above types will be
           aligned differently than the published application binary interface specifications for the 386
           and will not be binary compatible with structures in code compiled without that switch.

       <b>-m96bit-long-double</b>
       <b>-m128bit-long-double</b>
           These switches control the size of "long double" type.  The i386 application binary interface
           specifies the size to be 96 bits, so <b>-m96bit-long-double</b> is the default in 32 bit mode.

           Modern architectures (Pentium and newer) would prefer "long double" to be aligned to an 8 or 16
           byte boundary.  In arrays or structures conforming to the ABI, this would not be possible.  So
           specifying a <b>-m128bit-long-double</b> will align "long double" to a 16 byte boundary by padding the
           "long double" with an additional 32 bit zero.

           In the x86-64 compiler, <b>-m128bit-long-double</b> is the default choice as its ABI specifies that
           "long double" is to be aligned on 16 byte boundary.

           Notice that neither of these options enable any extra precision over the x87 standard of 80 bits
           for a "long double".

           <b>Warning:</b> if you override the default value for your target ABI, the structures and arrays
           containing "long double" variables will change their size as well as function calling convention
           for function taking "long double" will be modified.  Hence they will not be binary compatible
           with arrays or structures in code compiled without that switch.

       <b>-msvr3-shlib</b>
       <b>-mno-svr3-shlib</b>
           Control whether GCC places uninitialized local variables into the "bss" or "data" segments.
           <b>-msvr3-shlib</b> places them into "bss".  These options are meaningful only on System V Release 3.

       <b>-mrtd</b>
           Use a different function-calling convention, in which functions that take a fixed number of
           arguments return with the "ret" <u>num</u> instruction, which pops their arguments while returning.
           This saves one instruction in the caller since there is no need to pop the arguments there.

           You can specify that an individual function is called with this calling sequence with the
           function attribute <b>stdcall</b>.  You can also override the <b>-mrtd</b> option by using the function
           attribute <b>cdecl</b>.

           <b>Warning:</b> this calling convention is incompatible with the one normally used on Unix, so you
           cannot use it if you need to call libraries compiled with the Unix compiler.

           Also, you must provide function prototypes for all functions that take variable numbers of
           arguments (including "printf"); otherwise incorrect code will be generated for calls to those
           functions.

           In addition, seriously incorrect code will result if you call a function with too many arguments.
           (Normally, extra arguments are harmlessly ignored.)

       <b>-mregparm=</b><u>num</u>
           Control how many registers are used to pass integer arguments.  By default, no registers are used
           to pass arguments, and at most 3 registers can be used.  You can control this behavior for a
           specific function by using the function attribute <b>regparm</b>.

           <b>Warning:</b> if you use this switch, and <u>num</u> is nonzero, then you must build all modules with the
           same value, including any libraries.  This includes the system libraries and startup modules.

       <b>-mstackrealign</b>
           Realign the stack at entry.  On the Intel x86, the <b>-mstackrealign</b> option will generate an
           alternate prologue/epilogue that realigns the runtime stack.  This supports mixing legacy codes
           that keep a 4-byte aligned stack with modern codes that keep a 16-byte stack for SSE
           compatibility.  The alternate prologue and epilogue are slower and bigger than the regular ones,
           and they require one dedicated register for the entire function.  This also lowers the number of
           registers available if used in conjunction with the "regparm" attribute.  Nested functions
           encountered while <b>-mstackrealign</b> is on will generate warnings, and they will not realign the
           stack when called.

       <b>-mpreferred-stack-boundary=</b><u>num</u>
           Attempt to keep the stack boundary aligned to a 2 raised to <u>num</u> byte boundary.  If
           <b>-mpreferred-stack-boundary</b> is not specified, the default is 4 (16 bytes or 128 bits), except when
           optimizing for code size (<b>-Os</b> or <b>-Oz</b> (APPLE ONLY)), in which case the default is the minimum
           correct alignment (4 bytes for x86, and 8 bytes for x86-64).

           On Pentium and PentiumPro, "double" and "long double" values should be aligned to an 8 byte
           boundary (see <b>-malign-double</b>) or suffer significant run time performance penalties.  On Pentium
           III, the Streaming SIMD Extension (SSE) data type "__m128" suffers similar penalties if it is not
           16 byte aligned.

           To ensure proper alignment of this values on the stack, the stack boundary must be as aligned as
           that required by any value stored on the stack.  Further, every function must be generated such
           that it keeps the stack aligned.  Thus calling a function compiled with a higher preferred stack
           boundary from a function compiled with a lower preferred stack boundary will most likely misalign
           the stack.  It is recommended that libraries that use callbacks always use the default setting.

           This extra alignment does consume extra stack space, and generally increases code size.  Code
           that is sensitive to stack space usage, such as embedded systems and operating system kernels,
           may want to reduce the preferred alignment to <b>-mpreferred-stack-boundary=2</b>.

       <b>-mmmx</b>
       <b>-mno-mmx</b>
       <b>-msse</b>
       <b>-mno-sse</b>
       <b>-msse2</b>
       <b>-mno-sse2</b>
       <b>-msse3</b>
       <b>-mno-sse3</b>
       <b>-mssse3</b>
       <b>-mno-ssse3</b>
       <b>-m3dnow</b>
       <b>-mno-3dnow</b>
           These switches enable or disable the use of built-in functions that allow direct access to the
           MMX, SSE, SSE2, SSE3 and 3Dnow extensions of the instruction set.

           To have SSE/SSE2 instructions generated automatically from floating-point code, see <b>-mfpmath=sse</b>.

       <b>-mpush-args</b>
       <b>-mno-push-args</b>
           Use PUSH operations to store outgoing parameters.  This method is shorter and usually equally
           fast as method using SUB/MOV operations and is enabled by default.  In some cases disabling it
           may improve performance because of improved scheduling and reduced dependencies.

       <b>-maccumulate-outgoing-args</b>
           If enabled, the maximum amount of space required for outgoing arguments will be computed in the
           function prologue.  This is faster on most modern CPUs because of reduced dependencies, improved
           scheduling and reduced stack usage when preferred stack boundary is not equal to 2.  The drawback
           is a notable increase in code size.  This switch implies <b>-mno-push-args</b>.

       <b>-mthreads</b>
           Support thread-safe exception handling on <b>Mingw32</b>.  Code that relies on thread-safe exception
           handling must compile and link all code with the <b>-mthreads</b> option.  When compiling, <b>-mthreads</b>
           defines <b>-D_MT</b>; when linking, it links in a special thread helper library <b>-lmingwthrd</b> which cleans
           up per thread exception handling data.

       <b>-mno-align-stringops</b>
           Do not align destination of inlined string operations.  This switch reduces code size and
           improves performance in case the destination is already aligned, but GCC doesn't know about it.

       <b>-minline-all-stringops</b>
           By default GCC inlines string operations only when destination is known to be aligned at least to
           4 byte boundary.  This enables more inlining, increase code size, but may improve performance of
           code that depends on fast memcpy, strlen and memset for short lengths.

       <b>-momit-leaf-frame-pointer</b>
           Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for leaf functions.  This avoids the instructions to
           save, set up and restore frame pointers and makes an extra register available in leaf functions.
           The option <b>-fomit-frame-pointer</b> removes the frame pointer for all functions which might make
           debugging harder.

       <b>-mtls-direct-seg-refs</b>
       <b>-mno-tls-direct-seg-refs</b>
           Controls whether TLS variables may be accessed with offsets from the TLS segment register (%gs
           for 32-bit, %fs for 64-bit), or whether the thread base pointer must be added.  Whether or not
           this is legal depends on the operating system, and whether it maps the segment to cover the
           entire TLS area.

           For systems that use GNU libc, the default is on.

       These <b>-m</b> switches are supported in addition to the above on AMD x86-64 processors in 64-bit
       environments.

       <b>-m32</b>
       <b>-m64</b>
           Generate code for a 32-bit or 64-bit environment.  The 32-bit environment sets int, long and
           pointer to 32 bits and generates code that runs on any i386 system.  The 64-bit environment sets
           int to 32 bits and long and pointer to 64 bits and generates code for AMD's x86-64 architecture.

       <b>-mno-red-zone</b>
           Do not use a so called red zone for x86-64 code.  The red zone is mandated by the x86-64 ABI, it
           is a 128-byte area beyond the location of the stack pointer that will not be modified by signal
           or interrupt handlers and therefore can be used for temporary data without adjusting the stack
           pointer.  The flag <b>-mno-red-zone</b> disables this red zone.

       <b>-mcmodel=small</b>
           Generate code for the small code model: the program and its symbols must be linked in the lower 2
           GB of the address space.  Pointers are 64 bits.  Programs can be statically or dynamically
           linked.  This is the default code model.

       <b>-mcmodel=kernel</b>
           Generate code for the kernel code model.  The kernel runs in the negative 2 GB of the address
           space.  This model has to be used for Linux kernel code.

       <b>-mcmodel=medium</b>
           Generate code for the medium model: The program is linked in the lower 2 GB of the address space
           but symbols can be located anywhere in the address space.  Programs can be statically or
           dynamically linked, but building of shared libraries are not supported with the medium model.

       <b>-mcmodel=large</b>
           Generate code for the large model: This model makes no assumptions about addresses and sizes of
           sections.  Currently GCC does not implement this model.

       <u>PowerPC</u> <u>Options</u>

       These are listed under

       <u>IBM</u> <u>RS/6000</u> <u>and</u> <u>PowerPC</u> <u>Options</u>

       These <b>-m</b> options are defined for the IBM RS/6000 and PowerPC:

       <b>-mpower</b>
       <b>-mno-power</b>
       <b>-mpower2</b>
       <b>-mno-power2</b>
       <b>-mpowerpc</b>
       <b>-mno-powerpc</b>
       <b>-mpowerpc-gpopt</b>
       <b>-mno-powerpc-gpopt</b>
       <b>-mpowerpc-gfxopt</b>
       <b>-mno-powerpc-gfxopt</b>
       <b>-mpowerpc64</b>
       <b>-mno-powerpc64</b>
           GCC supports two related instruction set architectures for the RS/6000 and PowerPC.  The <u>POWER</u>
           instruction set are those instructions supported by the <b>rios</b> chip set used in the original
           RS/6000 systems and the <u>PowerPC</u> instruction set is the architecture of the Motorola MPC5xx,
           MPC6xx, MPC8xx microprocessors, and the IBM 4xx microprocessors.

           Neither architecture is a subset of the other.  However there is a large common subset of
           instructions supported by both.  An MQ register is included in processors supporting the POWER
           architecture.

           You use these options to specify which instructions are available on the processor you are using.
           The default value of these options is determined when configuring GCC.  Specifying the
           <b>-mcpu=</b><u>cpu</u><b>_</b><u>type</u> overrides the specification of these options.  We recommend you use the
           <b>-mcpu=</b><u>cpu</u><b>_</b><u>type</u> option rather than the options listed above.

           The <b>-mpower</b> option allows GCC to generate instructions that are found only in the POWER
           architecture and to use the MQ register.  Specifying <b>-mpower2</b> implies <b>-power</b> and also allows GCC
           to generate instructions that are present in the POWER2 architecture but not the original POWER
           architecture.

           The <b>-mpowerpc</b> option allows GCC to generate instructions that are found only in the 32-bit subset
           of the PowerPC architecture.  Specifying <b>-mpowerpc-gpopt</b> implies <b>-mpowerpc</b> and also allows GCC to
           use the optional PowerPC architecture instructions in the General Purpose group, including
           floating-point square root.  Specifying <b>-mpowerpc-gfxopt</b> implies <b>-mpowerpc</b> and also allows GCC to
           use the optional PowerPC architecture instructions in the Graphics group, including floating-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">point&nbsp;floatingpoint</font>
           point select.

           The <b>-mpowerpc64</b> option allows GCC to generate the additional 64-bit instructions that are found
           in the full PowerPC64 architecture and to treat GPRs as 64-bit, doubleword quantities.  GCC
           defaults to <b>-mno-powerpc64</b>.

           If you specify both <b>-mno-power</b> and <b>-mno-powerpc</b>, GCC will use only the instructions in the common
           subset of both architectures plus some special AIX common-mode calls, and will not use the MQ
           register.  Specifying both <b>-mpower</b> and <b>-mpowerpc</b> permits GCC to use any instruction from either
           architecture and to allow use of the MQ register; specify this for the Motorola MPC601.

       <b>-mnew-mnemonics</b>
       <b>-mold-mnemonics</b>
           Select which mnemonics to use in the generated assembler code.  With <b>-mnew-mnemonics</b>, GCC uses
           the assembler mnemonics defined for the PowerPC architecture.  With <b>-mold-mnemonics</b> it uses the
           assembler mnemonics defined for the POWER architecture.  Instructions defined in only one
           architecture have only one mnemonic; GCC uses that mnemonic irrespective of which of these
           options is specified.

           GCC defaults to the mnemonics appropriate for the architecture in use.  Specifying <b>-mcpu=</b><u>cpu</u><b>_</b><u>type</u>
           sometimes overrides the value of these option.  Unless you are building a cross-compiler, you
           should normally not specify either <b>-mnew-mnemonics</b> or <b>-mold-mnemonics</b>, but should instead accept
           the default.

       <b>-mcpu=</b><u>cpu</u><b>_</b><u>type</u>
           Set architecture type, register usage, choice of mnemonics, and instruction scheduling parameters
           for machine type <u>cpu</u><b>_</b><u>type</u>.  Supported values for <u>cpu</u><b>_</b><u>type</u> are <b>401</b>, <b>403</b>, <b>405</b>, <b>405fp</b>, <b>440</b>, <b>440fp</b>,
           <b>505</b>, <b>601</b>, <b>602</b>, <b>603</b>, <b>603e</b>, <b>604</b>, <b>604e</b>, <b>620</b>, <b>630</b>, <b>740</b>, <b>7400</b>, <b>7450</b>, <b>750</b>, <b>801</b>, <b>821</b>, <b>823</b>, <b>860</b>, <b>970</b>,
           <b>8540</b>, <b>common</b>, <b>ec603e</b>, <b>G3</b>, <b>G4</b>, <b>G5</b>, <b>power</b>, <b>power2</b>, <b>power3</b>, <b>power4</b>, <b>power5</b>, <b>powerpc</b>, <b>powerpc64</b>,
           <b>rios</b>, <b>rios1</b>, <b>rios2</b>, <b>rsc</b>, and <b>rs64a</b>.

           <b>-mcpu=common</b> selects a completely generic processor.  Code generated under this option will run
           on any POWER or PowerPC processor.  GCC will use only the instructions in the common subset of
           both architectures, and will not use the MQ register.  GCC assumes a generic processor model for
           scheduling purposes.

           <b>-mcpu=power</b>, <b>-mcpu=power2</b>, <b>-mcpu=powerpc</b>, and <b>-mcpu=powerpc64</b> specify generic POWER, POWER2, pure
           32-bit PowerPC (i.e., not MPC601), and 64-bit PowerPC architecture machine types, with an
           appropriate, generic processor model assumed for scheduling purposes.

           The other options specify a specific processor.  Code generated under those options will run best
           on that processor, and may not run at all on others.

           The <b>-mcpu</b> options automatically enable or disable the following options: <b>-maltivec</b>, <b>-mhard-float</b>,
           <b>-mmfcrf</b>, <b>-mmultiple</b>, <b>-mnew-mnemonics</b>, <b>-mpower</b>, <b>-mpower2</b>, <b>-mpowerpc64</b>, <b>-mpowerpc-gpopt</b>,
           <b>-mpowerpc-gfxopt</b>, <b>-mstring</b>.  The particular options set for any particular CPU will vary between
           compiler versions, depending on what setting seems to produce optimal code for that CPU; it
           doesn't necessarily reflect the actual hardware's capabilities.  If you wish to set an individual
           option to a particular value, you may specify it after the <b>-mcpu</b> option, like <b>-mcpu=970</b>
           <b>-mno-altivec</b>.

           On AIX, the <b>-maltivec</b> and <b>-mpowerpc64</b> options are not enabled or disabled by the <b>-mcpu</b> option at
           present, since AIX does not have full support for these options.  You may still enable or disable
           them individually if you're sure it'll work in your environment.

       <b>-mtune=</b><u>cpu</u><b>_</b><u>type</u>
           Set the instruction scheduling parameters for machine type <u>cpu</u><b>_</b><u>type</u>, but do not set the
           architecture type, register usage, or choice of mnemonics, as <b>-mcpu=</b><u>cpu</u><b>_</b><u>type</u> would.  The same
           values for <u>cpu</u><b>_</b><u>type</u> are used for <b>-mtune</b> as for <b>-mcpu</b>.  If both are specified, the code generated
           will use the architecture, registers, and mnemonics set by <b>-mcpu</b>, but the scheduling parameters
           set by <b>-mtune</b>.

       <b>-maltivec</b>
       <b>-mno-altivec</b>
           Generate code that uses (does not use) AltiVec instructions, and also enable the use of built-in
           functions that allow more direct access to the AltiVec instruction set.  You may also need to set
           <b>-mabi=altivec</b> to adjust the current ABI with AltiVec ABI enhancements.

       <b>-mpim-altivec</b>
       <b>-mno-pim-altivec</b>
           Enable (or disable) built-in compiler support for the syntactic extensions as well as operations
           and predicates defined in the Motorola AltiVec Technology Programming Interface Manual (PIM).
           This includes the recognition of "vector" and "pixel" as (context-dependent) keywords, the
           definition of built-in functions such as "vec_add", and the use of parenthesized comma expression
           as AltiVec literals.  Note that unlike the option <b>-maltivec</b>, the extension does not require the
           inclusion of any special header files; if "&lt;altivec.h&gt;" is included, a warning will be issued and
           the contents of the header will be ignored.  The preprocessor shall provide an
           "__APPLE_ALTIVEC__" manifest constant when <b>-mpim-altivec</b> is specified.  (APPLE ONLY)

           In addition, the <b>-mpim-altivec</b> option disables the inlining of functions containing AltiVec
           instructions into functions that do not make use of the vector unit.  Certain other
           optimizations, such as inline vectorization of "memset" and "memcpy" calls, are also disabled.
           These adjustments make it possible to compile programs whose use of AltiVec instructions is
           preceded by a run-time check for the presence of AltiVec functionality, and that can therefore be
           made to run on G3 processors.  Note that all of these optimizations may be re-enabled by
           supplying the <b>-maltivec</b> option, or an <b>-mcpu</b> option specifying a processor that supports AltiVec
           instructions.

       <b>-mabi=spe</b>
           Extend the current ABI with SPE ABI extensions.  This does not change the default ABI, instead it
           adds the SPE ABI extensions to the current ABI.

       <b>-mabi=no-spe</b>
           Disable Booke SPE ABI extensions for the current ABI.

       <b>-misel=</b><u>yes/no</u>
       <b>-misel</b>
           This switch enables or disables the generation of ISEL instructions.

       <b>-mspe=</b><u>yes/no</u>
       <b>-mspe</b>
           This switch enables or disables the generation of SPE simd instructions.

       <b>-mfloat-gprs=</b><u>yes/single/double/no</u>
       <b>-mfloat-gprs</b>
           This switch enables or disables the generation of floating point operations on the general
           purpose registers for architectures that support it.

           The argument <u>yes</u> or <u>single</u> enables the use of single-precision floating point operations.

           The argument <u>double</u> enables the use of single and double-precision floating point operations.

           The argument <u>no</u> disables floating point operations on the general purpose registers.

           This option is currently only available on the MPC854x.

       <b>-m32</b>
       <b>-m64</b>
           Generate code for 32-bit or 64-bit environments of Darwin and SVR4 targets (including GNU/Linux).
           The 32-bit environment sets int, long and pointer to 32 bits and generates code that runs on any
           PowerPC variant.  The 64-bit environment sets int to 32 bits and long and pointer to 64 bits, and
           generates code for PowerPC64, as for <b>-mpowerpc64</b>.

       <b>-mfull-toc</b>
       <b>-mno-fp-in-toc</b>
       <b>-mno-sum-in-toc</b>
       <b>-mminimal-toc</b>
           Modify generation of the TOC (Table Of Contents), which is created for every executable file.
           The <b>-mfull-toc</b> option is selected by default.  In that case, GCC will allocate at least one TOC
           entry for each unique non-automatic variable reference in your program.  GCC will also place
           floating-point constants in the TOC.  However, only 16,384 entries are available in the TOC.

           If you receive a linker error message that saying you have overflowed the available TOC space,
           you can reduce the amount of TOC space used with the <b>-mno-fp-in-toc</b> and <b>-mno-sum-in-toc</b> options.
           <b>-mno-fp-in-toc</b> prevents GCC from putting floating-point constants in the TOC and <b>-mno-sum-in-toc</b>
           forces GCC to generate code to calculate the sum of an address and a constant at run-time instead
           of putting that sum into the TOC.  You may specify one or both of these options.  Each causes GCC
           to produce very slightly slower and larger code at the expense of conserving TOC space.

           If you still run out of space in the TOC even when you specify both of these options, specify
           <b>-mminimal-toc</b> instead.  This option causes GCC to make only one TOC entry for every file.  When
           you specify this option, GCC will produce code that is slower and larger but which uses extremely
           little TOC space.  You may wish to use this option only on files that contain less frequently
           executed code.

       <b>-maix64</b>
       <b>-maix32</b>
           Enable 64-bit AIX ABI and calling convention: 64-bit pointers, 64-bit "long" type, and the
           infrastructure needed to support them.  Specifying <b>-maix64</b> implies <b>-mpowerpc64</b> and <b>-mpowerpc</b>,
           while <b>-maix32</b> disables the 64-bit ABI and implies <b>-mno-powerpc64</b>.  GCC defaults to <b>-maix32</b>.

       <b>-mxl-compat</b>
       <b>-mno-xl-compat</b>
           Produce code that conforms more closely to IBM XLC semantics when using AIX-compatible ABI.  Pass
           floating-point arguments to prototyped functions beyond the register save area (RSA) on the stack
           in addition to argument FPRs.  Do not assume that most significant double in 128 bit long double
           value is properly rounded when comparing values.

           The AIX calling convention was extended but not initially documented to handle an obscure K&amp;R C
           case of calling a function that takes the address of its arguments with fewer arguments than
           declared.  AIX XL compilers access floating point arguments which do not fit in the RSA from the
           stack when a subroutine is compiled without optimization.  Because always storing floating-point
           arguments on the stack is inefficient and rarely needed, this option is not enabled by default
           and only is necessary when calling subroutines compiled by AIX XL compilers without optimization.

       <b>-mpe</b>
           Support <u>IBM</u> <u>RS/6000</u> <u>SP</u> <u>Parallel</u> <u>Environment</u> (PE).  Link an application written to use message
           passing with special startup code to enable the application to run.  The system must have PE
           installed in the standard location (<u>/usr/lpp/ppe.poe/</u>), or the <u>specs</u> file must be overridden with
           the <b>-specs=</b> option to specify the appropriate directory location.  The Parallel Environment does
           not support threads, so the <b>-mpe</b> option and the <b>-pthread</b> option are incompatible.

       <b>-malign-natural</b>
       <b>-malign-power</b>
           On AIX, 32-bit Darwin, and 64-bit PowerPC GNU/Linux, the option <b>-malign-natural</b> overrides the
           ABI-defined alignment of larger types, such as floating-point doubles, on their natural size-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">based&nbsp;sizebased</font>
           based boundary.  The option <b>-malign-power</b> instructs GCC to follow the ABI-specified alignment
           rules.  GCC defaults to the standard alignment defined in the ABI.

           On 64-bit Darwin, natural alignment is the default, and <b>-malign-power</b> is not supported.

       <b>-msoft-float</b>
       <b>-mhard-float</b>
           Generate code that does not use (uses) the floating-point register set.  Software floating point
           emulation is provided if you use the <b>-msoft-float</b> option, and pass the option to GCC when
           linking.

           (APPLE ONLY) While the -msoft-float option is supported, the libraries that do the floating point
           emulation are not shipped on Apple PowerPCs, with the effect that the emulation does not work.
           However, the option may be useful for a different reason.  Normally the compiler can use floating
           point registers in contexts where you might not expect it, for example, to copy data from one
           memory location to another.  The -msoft-float option will prevent it from doing this.

       <b>-mmultiple</b>
       <b>-mno-multiple</b>
           Generate code that uses (does not use) the load multiple word instructions and the store multiple
           word instructions.  These instructions are generated by default on POWER systems, and not
           generated on PowerPC systems.  Do not use <b>-mmultiple</b> on little endian PowerPC systems, since
           those instructions do not work when the processor is in little endian mode.  The exceptions are
           PPC740 and PPC750 which permit the instructions usage in little endian mode.

       <b>-mstring</b>
       <b>-mno-string</b>
           Generate code that uses (does not use) the load string instructions and the store string word
           instructions to save multiple registers and do small block moves.  These instructions are
           generated by default on POWER systems, and not generated on PowerPC systems.  Do not use <b>-mstring</b>
           on little endian PowerPC systems, since those instructions do not work when the processor is in
           little endian mode.  The exceptions are PPC740 and PPC750 which permit the instructions usage in
           little endian mode.

       <b>-mupdate</b>
       <b>-mno-update</b>
           Generate code that uses (does not use) the load or store instructions that update the base
           register to the address of the calculated memory location.  These instructions are generated by
           default.  If you use <b>-mno-update</b>, there is a small window between the time that the stack pointer
           is updated and the address of the previous frame is stored, which means code that walks the stack
           frame across interrupts or signals may get corrupted data.

       <b>-mfused-madd</b>
       <b>-mno-fused-madd</b>
           Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating point multiply and accumulate instructions.
           These instructions are generated by default if hardware floating is used.

       <b>-mno-bit-align</b>
       <b>-mbit-align</b>
           On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do not (do) force structures and unions that contain
           bit-fields to be aligned to the base type of the bit-field.

           For example, by default a structure containing nothing but 8 "unsigned" bit-fields of length 1
           would be aligned to a 4 byte boundary and have a size of 4 bytes.  By using <b>-mno-bit-align</b>, the
           structure would be aligned to a 1 byte boundary and be one byte in size.

       <b>-mno-strict-align</b>
       <b>-mstrict-align</b>
           On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do not (do) assume that unaligned memory references
           will be handled by the system.

       <b>-mrelocatable</b>
       <b>-mno-relocatable</b>
           On embedded PowerPC systems generate code that allows (does not allow) the program to be
           relocated to a different address at runtime.  If you use <b>-mrelocatable</b> on any module, all objects
           linked together must be compiled with <b>-mrelocatable</b> or <b>-mrelocatable-lib</b>.

       <b>-mrelocatable-lib</b>
       <b>-mno-relocatable-lib</b>
           On embedded PowerPC systems generate code that allows (does not allow) the program to be
           relocated to a different address at runtime.  Modules compiled with <b>-mrelocatable-lib</b> can be
           linked with either modules compiled without <b>-mrelocatable</b> and <b>-mrelocatable-lib</b> or with modules
           compiled with the <b>-mrelocatable</b> options.

       <b>-mno-toc</b>
       <b>-mtoc</b>
           On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do not (do) assume that register 2 contains a pointer
           to a global area pointing to the addresses used in the program.

       <b>-mlittle</b>
       <b>-mlittle-endian</b>
           On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems compile code for the processor in little endian mode.
           The <b>-mlittle-endian</b> option is the same as <b>-mlittle</b>.

       <b>-mbig</b>
       <b>-mbig-endian</b>
           On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems compile code for the processor in big endian mode.
           The <b>-mbig-endian</b> option is the same as <b>-mbig</b>.

       <b>-mdynamic-no-pic</b>
           On Darwin and Mac OS X systems, compile code so that it is not relocatable, but that its external
           references are relocatable.  The resulting code is suitable for applications, but not shared
           libraries.

       <b>-mprioritize-restricted-insns=</b><u>priority</u>
           This option controls the priority that is assigned to dispatch-slot restricted instructions
           during the second scheduling pass.  The argument <u>priority</u> takes the value <u>0/1/2</u> to assign
           <u>no/highest/second-highest</u> priority to dispatch slot restricted instructions.

       <b>-msched-costly-dep=</b><u>dependence</u><b>_</b><u>type</u>
           This option controls which dependences are considered costly by the target during instruction
           scheduling.  The argument <u>dependence</u><b>_</b><u>type</u> takes one of the following values: <u>no</u>: no dependence is
           costly, <u>all</u>: all dependences are costly, <u>true</u><b>_</b><u>store</u><b>_</b><u>to</u><b>_</b><u>load</u>: a true dependence from store to load
           is costly, <u>store</u><b>_</b><u>to</u><b>_</b><u>load</u>: any dependence from store to load is costly, <u>number</u>: any dependence
           which latency &gt;= <u>number</u> is costly.

       <b>-minsert-sched-nops=</b><u>scheme</u>
           This option controls which nop insertion scheme will be used during the second scheduling pass.
           The argument <u>scheme</u> takes one of the following values: <u>no</u>: Don't insert nops.  <u>pad</u>: Pad with nops
           any dispatch group which has vacant issue slots, according to the scheduler's grouping.
           <u>regroup</u><b>_</b><u>exact</u>: Insert nops to force costly dependent insns into separate groups.  Insert exactly
           as many nops as needed to force an insn to a new group, according to the estimated processor
           grouping.  <u>number</u>: Insert nops to force costly dependent insns into separate groups.  Insert
           <u>number</u> nops to force an insn to a new group.

       <b>-mcall-sysv</b>
           On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems compile code using calling conventions that adheres to
           the March 1995 draft of the System V Application Binary Interface, PowerPC processor supplement.
           This is the default unless you configured GCC using <b>powerpc-*-eabiaix</b>.

       <b>-maix-struct-return</b>
           Return all structures in memory (as specified by the AIX ABI).

       <b>-msvr4-struct-return</b>
           Return structures smaller than 8 bytes in registers (as specified by the SVR4 ABI).

       <b>-mabi=altivec</b>
           Extend the current ABI with AltiVec ABI extensions.  This does not change the default ABI,
           instead it adds the AltiVec ABI extensions to the current ABI.

       <b>-mabi=no-altivec</b>
           Disable AltiVec ABI extensions for the current ABI.

       <b>-mprototype</b>
       <b>-mno-prototype</b>
           On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems assume that all calls to variable argument functions
           are properly prototyped.  Otherwise, the compiler must insert an instruction before every non
           prototyped call to set or clear bit 6 of the condition code register (<u>CR</u>) to indicate whether
           floating point values were passed in the floating point registers in case the function takes a
           variable arguments.  With <b>-mprototype</b>, only calls to prototyped variable argument functions will
           set or clear the bit.

       <b>-msim</b>
           On embedded PowerPC systems, assume that the startup module is called <u>sim-crt0.o</u> and that the
           standard C libraries are <u>libsim.a</u> and <u>libc.a</u>.  This is the default for <b>powerpc-*-eabisim</b>.

       <b>-mads</b>
           On embedded PowerPC systems, assume that the startup module is called <u>crt0.o</u> and the standard C
           libraries are <u>libads.a</u> and <u>libc.a</u>.

       <b>-myellowknife</b>
           On embedded PowerPC systems, assume that the startup module is called <u>crt0.o</u> and the standard C
           libraries are <u>libyk.a</u> and <u>libc.a</u>.

       <b>-mvxworks</b>
           On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems, specify that you are compiling for a VxWorks system.

       <b>-mwindiss</b>
           Specify that you are compiling for the WindISS simulation environment.

       <b>-memb</b>
           On embedded PowerPC systems, set the <u>PPC</u><b>_</b><u>EMB</u> bit in the ELF flags header to indicate that <b>eabi</b>
           extended relocations are used.

       <b>-meabi</b>
       <b>-mno-eabi</b>
           On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do (do not) adhere to the Embedded Applications Binary
           Interface (eabi) which is a set of modifications to the System V.4 specifications.  Selecting
           <b>-meabi</b> means that the stack is aligned to an 8 byte boundary, a function "__eabi" is called to
           from "main" to set up the eabi environment, and the <b>-msdata</b> option can use both "r2" and "r13" to
           point to two separate small data areas.  Selecting <b>-mno-eabi</b> means that the stack is aligned to a
           16 byte boundary, do not call an initialization function from "main", and the <b>-msdata</b> option will
           only use "r13" to point to a single small data area.  The <b>-meabi</b> option is on by default if you
           configured GCC using one of the <b>powerpc*-*-eabi*</b> options.

       <b>-msdata=eabi</b>
           On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems, put small initialized "const" global and static data
           in the <b>.sdata2</b> section, which is pointed to by register "r2".  Put small initialized non-"const"
           global and static data in the <b>.sdata</b> section, which is pointed to by register "r13".  Put small
           uninitialized global and static data in the <b>.sbss</b> section, which is adjacent to the <b>.sdata</b>
           section.  The <b>-msdata=eabi</b> option is incompatible with the <b>-mrelocatable</b> option.  The
           <b>-msdata=eabi</b> option also sets the <b>-memb</b> option.

       <b>-msdata=sysv</b>
           On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems, put small global and static data in the <b>.sdata</b>
           section, which is pointed to by register "r13".  Put small uninitialized global and static data
           in the <b>.sbss</b> section, which is adjacent to the <b>.sdata</b> section.  The <b>-msdata=sysv</b> option is
           incompatible with the <b>-mrelocatable</b> option.

       <b>-msdata=default</b>
       <b>-msdata</b>
           On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems, if <b>-meabi</b> is used, compile code the same as
           <b>-msdata=eabi</b>, otherwise compile code the same as <b>-msdata=sysv</b>.

       <b>-msdata-data</b>
           On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems, put small global and static data in the <b>.sdata</b>
           section.  Put small uninitialized global and static data in the <b>.sbss</b> section.  Do not use
           register "r13" to address small data however.  This is the default behavior unless other <b>-msdata</b>
           options are used.

       <b>-msdata=none</b>
       <b>-mno-sdata</b>
           On embedded PowerPC systems, put all initialized global and static data in the <b>.data</b> section, and
           all uninitialized data in the <b>.bss</b> section.

       <b>-G</b> <u>num</u>
           On embedded PowerPC systems, put global and static items less than or equal to <u>num</u> bytes into the
           small data or bss sections instead of the normal data or bss section.  By default, <u>num</u> is 8.  The
           <b>-G</b> <u>num</u> switch is also passed to the linker.  All modules should be compiled with the same <b>-G</b> <u>num</u>
           value.

       <b>-mregnames</b>
       <b>-mno-regnames</b>
           On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do (do not) emit register names in the assembly
           language output using symbolic forms.

       <b>-mlongcall</b>
       <b>-mno-longcall</b>
       <b>-mlong-branch</b>
       <b>-mno-long-branch</b>
           Default to making all function calls indirectly, using a register, so that functions which reside
           further than 32 megabytes (33,554,432 bytes) from the current location can be called.  This
           setting can be overridden by the "shortcall" function attribute, or by "#pragma longcall(0)".

           Some linkers are capable of detecting out-of-range calls and generating glue code on the fly.  On
           these systems, long calls are unnecessary and generate slower code.  As of this writing, the AIX
           linker can do this, as can the GNU linker for PowerPC/64.  It is planned to add this feature to
           the GNU linker for 32-bit PowerPC systems as well.

           On Darwin/PPC systems, "#pragma longcall" will generate ``jbsr callee, L42'', plus a ``branch
           island'' (glue code).  The two target addresses represent the callee and the ``branch island''.
           The Darwin/PPC linker will prefer the first address and generate a ``bl callee'' if the PPC
           ``bl'' instruction will reach the callee directly; otherwise, the linker will generate ``bl L42''
           to call the ``branch island''.  The ``branch island'' is appended to the body of the calling
           function; it computes the full 32-bit address of the callee and jumps to it.

           On Mach-O (Darwin) systems, <b>-mlongcall</b> directs the compiler emit to the glue for every direct
           call, and the Darwin linker decides whether to use or discard it.  <b>-mlong-branch</b> is a synonym for
           <b>-mlongcall</b>.

           In the future, we may cause GCC to ignore all longcall specifications when the linker is known to
           generate glue.

       <b>-pthread</b>
           Adds support for multithreading with the <u>pthreads</u> library.  This option sets flags for both the
           preprocessor and linker.

       <b>Options</b> <b>for</b> <b>Code</b> <b>Generation</b> <b>Conventions</b>

       These machine-independent options control the interface conventions used in code generation.

       Most of them have both positive and negative forms; the negative form of <b>-ffoo</b> would be <b>-fno-foo</b>.  In
       the table below, only one of the forms is listed---the one which is not the default.  You can figure
       out the other form by either removing <b>no-</b> or adding it.

       <b>-fbounds-check</b>
           For front-ends that support it, generate additional code to check that indices used to access
           arrays are within the declared range.  This is currently only supported by the Java and Fortran
           77 front-ends, where this option defaults to true and false respectively.

       <b>-ftrapv</b>
           This option generates traps for signed overflow on addition, subtraction, multiplication
           operations.

       <b>-fwrapv</b>
           This option instructs the compiler to assume that signed arithmetic overflow of addition,
           subtraction and multiplication wraps around using twos-complement representation.  This flag
           enables some optimizations and disables other.  This option is enabled by default for the Java
           front-end, as required by the Java language specification.

       <b>-fexceptions</b>
           Enable exception handling.  Generates extra code needed to propagate exceptions.  For some
           targets, this implies GCC will generate frame unwind information for all functions, which can
           produce significant data size overhead, although it does not affect execution.  If you do not
           specify this option, GCC will enable it by default for languages like C++ which normally require
           exception handling, and disable it for languages like C that do not normally require it.
           However, you may need to enable this option when compiling C code that needs to interoperate
           properly with exception handlers written in C++.  You may also wish to disable this option if you
           are compiling older C++ programs that don't use exception handling.

       <b>-fnon-call-exceptions</b>
           Generate code that allows trapping instructions to throw exceptions.  Note that this requires
           platform-specific runtime support that does not exist everywhere.  Moreover, it only allows
           <u>trapping</u> instructions to throw exceptions, i.e. memory references or floating point instructions.
           It does not allow exceptions to be thrown from arbitrary signal handlers such as "SIGALRM".

       <b>-funwind-tables</b>
           Similar to <b>-fexceptions</b>, except that it will just generate any needed static data, but will not
           affect the generated code in any other way.  You will normally not enable this option; instead, a
           language processor that needs this handling would enable it on your behalf.

       <b>-fasynchronous-unwind-tables</b>
           Generate unwind table in dwarf2 format, if supported by target machine.  The table is exact at
           each instruction boundary, so it can be used for stack unwinding from asynchronous events (such
           as debugger or garbage collector).

       <b>-fpcc-struct-return</b>
           Return ``short'' "struct" and "union" values in memory like longer ones, rather than in
           registers.  This convention is less efficient, but it has the advantage of allowing
           intercallability between GCC-compiled files and files compiled with other compilers, particularly
           the Portable C Compiler (pcc).

           The precise convention for returning structures in memory depends on the target configuration
           macros.

           Short structures and unions are those whose size and alignment match that of some integer type.

           <b>Warning:</b> code compiled with the <b>-fpcc-struct-return</b> switch is not binary compatible with code
           compiled with the <b>-freg-struct-return</b> switch.  Use it to conform to a non-default application
           binary interface.

       <b>-freg-struct-return</b>
           Return "struct" and "union" values in registers when possible.  This is more efficient for small
           structures than <b>-fpcc-struct-return</b>.

           If you specify neither <b>-fpcc-struct-return</b> nor <b>-freg-struct-return</b>, GCC defaults to whichever
           convention is standard for the target.  If there is no standard convention, GCC defaults to
           <b>-fpcc-struct-return</b>, except on targets where GCC is the principal compiler.  In those cases, we
           can choose the standard, and we chose the more efficient register return alternative.

           <b>Warning:</b> code compiled with the <b>-freg-struct-return</b> switch is not binary compatible with code
           compiled with the <b>-fpcc-struct-return</b> switch.  Use it to conform to a non-default application
           binary interface.

       <b>-fshort-enums</b>
           Allocate to an "enum" type only as many bytes as it needs for the declared range of possible
           values.  Specifically, the "enum" type will be equivalent to the smallest integer type which has
           enough room.

           <b>Warning:</b> the <b>-fshort-enums</b> switch causes GCC to generate code that is not binary compatible with
           code generated without that switch.  Use it to conform to a non-default application binary
           interface.

       <b>-fshort-double</b>
           Use the same size for "double" as for "float".

           <b>Warning:</b> the <b>-fshort-double</b> switch causes GCC to generate code that is not binary compatible with
           code generated without that switch.  Use it to conform to a non-default application binary
           interface.

       <b>-fshort-wchar</b>
           Override the underlying type for <b>wchar_t</b> to be <b>short</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>int</b> instead of the default for the
           target.  This option is useful for building programs to run under WINE.

           <b>Warning:</b> the <b>-fshort-wchar</b> switch causes GCC to generate code that is not binary compatible with
           code generated without that switch.  Use it to conform to a non-default application binary
           interface.

       <b>-fshared-data</b>
           Requests that the data and non-"const" variables of this compilation be shared data rather than
           private data.  The distinction makes sense only on certain operating systems, where shared data
           is shared between processes running the same program, while private data exists in one copy per
           process.

       <b>-fno-common</b>
           In C, allocate even uninitialized global variables in the data section of the object file, rather
           than generating them as common blocks.  This has the effect that if the same variable is declared
           (without "extern") in two different compilations, you will get an error when you link them.  The
           only reason this might be useful is if you wish to verify that the program will work on other
           systems which always work this way.

       <b>-fno-ident</b>
           Ignore the <b>#ident</b> directive.

       <b>-finhibit-size-directive</b>
           Don't output a ".size" assembler directive, or anything else that would cause trouble if the
           function is split in the middle, and the two halves are placed at locations far apart in memory.
           This option is used when compiling <u>crtstuff.c</u>; you should not need to use it for anything else.

       <b>-fverbose-asm</b>
           Put extra commentary information in the generated assembly code to make it more readable.  This
           option is generally only of use to those who actually need to read the generated assembly code
           (perhaps while debugging the compiler itself).

           <b>-fno-verbose-asm</b>, the default, causes the extra information to be omitted and is useful when
           comparing two assembler files.

       <b>-fpic</b>
           Generate position-independent code (PIC) suitable for use in a shared library, if supported for
           the target machine.  Such code accesses all constant addresses through a global offset table
           (GOT).  The dynamic loader resolves the GOT entries when the program starts (the dynamic loader
           is not part of GCC; it is part of the operating system).  If the GOT size for the linked
           executable exceeds a machine-specific maximum size, you get an error message from the linker
           indicating that <b>-fpic</b> does not work; in that case, recompile with <b>-fPIC</b> instead.  (These maximums
           are 8k on the SPARC and 32k on the m68k and RS/6000.  The 386 has no such limit.)

           Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore works only on certain machines.
           For the 386, GCC supports PIC for System V but not for the Sun 386i.  Code generated for the IBM
           RS/6000 is always position-independent.

           <b>-fpic</b> is not supported on Mac OS X.

       <b>-fPIC</b>
           If supported for the target machine, emit position-independent code, suitable for dynamic linking
           and avoiding any limit on the size of the global offset table.  This option makes a difference on
           the m68k, PowerPC and SPARC.

           Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore works only on certain machines.

           <b>-fPIC</b> is the default on Darwin and Mac OS X.

       <b>-fpie</b>
       <b>-fPIE</b>
           These options are similar to <b>-fpic</b> and <b>-fPIC</b>, but generated position independent code can be only
           linked into executables.  Usually these options are used when <b>-pie</b> GCC option will be used during
           linking.

       <b>-ffixed-</b><u>reg</u>
           Treat the register named <u>reg</u> as a fixed register; generated code should never refer to it (except
           perhaps as a stack pointer, frame pointer or in some other fixed role).

           <u>reg</u> must be the name of a register.  The register names accepted are machine-specific and are
           defined in the "REGISTER_NAMES" macro in the machine description macro file.

           This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a three-way choice.

       <b>-fcall-used-</b><u>reg</u>
           Treat the register named <u>reg</u> as an allocable register that is clobbered by function calls.  It
           may be allocated for temporaries or variables that do not live across a call.  Functions compiled
           this way will not save and restore the register <u>reg</u>.

           It is an error to used this flag with the frame pointer or stack pointer.  Use of this flag for
           other registers that have fixed pervasive roles in the machine's execution model will produce
           disastrous results.

           This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a three-way choice.

       <b>-fcall-saved-</b><u>reg</u>
           Treat the register named <u>reg</u> as an allocable register saved by functions.  It may be allocated
           even for temporaries or variables that live across a call.  Functions compiled this way will save
           and restore the register <u>reg</u> if they use it.

           It is an error to used this flag with the frame pointer or stack pointer.  Use of this flag for
           other registers that have fixed pervasive roles in the machine's execution model will produce
           disastrous results.

           A different sort of disaster will result from the use of this flag for a register in which
           function values may be returned.

           This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a three-way choice.

       <b>-fpack-struct[=</b><u>n</u><b>]</b>
           Without a value specified, pack all structure members together without holes.  When a value is
           specified (which must be a small power of two), pack structure members according to this value,
           representing the maximum alignment (that is, objects with default alignment requirements larger
           than this will be output potentially unaligned at the next fitting location.

           <b>Warning:</b> the <b>-fpack-struct</b> switch causes GCC to generate code that is not binary compatible with
           code generated without that switch.  Additionally, it makes the code suboptimal.  Use it to
           conform to a non-default application binary interface.

       <b>-finstrument-functions</b>
           Generate instrumentation calls for entry and exit to functions.  Just after function entry and
           just before function exit, the following profiling functions will be called with the address of
           the current function and its call site.  (On some platforms, "__builtin_return_address" does not
           work beyond the current function, so the call site information may not be available to the
           profiling functions otherwise.)

                   void __cyg_profile_func_enter (void *this_fn,
                                                  void *call_site);
                   void __cyg_profile_func_exit  (void *this_fn,
                                                  void *call_site);

           The first argument is the address of the start of the current function, which may be looked up
           exactly in the symbol table.

           This instrumentation is also done for functions expanded inline in other functions.  The
           profiling calls will indicate where, conceptually, the inline function is entered and exited.
           This means that addressable versions of such functions must be available.  If all your uses of a
           function are expanded inline, this may mean an additional expansion of code size.  If you use
           <b>extern</b> <b>inline</b> in your C code, an addressable version of such functions must be provided.  (This
           is normally the case anyways, but if you get lucky and the optimizer always expands the functions
           inline, you might have gotten away without providing static copies.)

           A function may be given the attribute "no_instrument_function", in which case this
           instrumentation will not be done.  This can be used, for example, for the profiling functions
           listed above, high-priority interrupt routines, and any functions from which the profiling
           functions cannot safely be called (perhaps signal handlers, if the profiling routines generate
           output or allocate memory).

       <b>-fstack-check</b>
           Generate code to verify that you do not go beyond the boundary of the stack.  You should specify
           this flag if you are running in an environment with multiple threads, but only rarely need to
           specify it in a single-threaded environment since stack overflow is automatically detected on
           nearly all systems if there is only one stack.

           Note that this switch does not actually cause checking to be done; the operating system must do
           that.  The switch causes generation of code to ensure that the operating system sees the stack
           being extended.

       <b>-fstack-limit-register=</b><u>reg</u>
       <b>-fstack-limit-symbol=</b><u>sym</u>
       <b>-fno-stack-limit</b>
           Generate code to ensure that the stack does not grow beyond a certain value, either the value of
           a register or the address of a symbol.  If the stack would grow beyond the value, a signal is
           raised.  For most targets, the signal is raised before the stack overruns the boundary, so it is
           possible to catch the signal without taking special precautions.

           For instance, if the stack starts at absolute address <b>0x80000000</b> and grows downwards, you can use
           the flags <b>-fstack-limit-symbol=__stack_limit</b> and <b>-Wl,--defsym,__stack_limit=0x7ffe0000</b> to enforce
           a stack limit of 128KB.  Note that this may only work with the GNU linker.

       <b>-fargument-alias</b>
       <b>-fargument-noalias</b>
       <b>-fargument-noalias-global</b>
           Specify the possible relationships among parameters and between parameters and global data.

           <b>-fargument-alias</b> specifies that arguments (parameters) may alias each other and may alias global
           storage.<b>-fargument-noalias</b> specifies that arguments do not alias each other, but may alias global
           storage.<b>-fargument-noalias-global</b> specifies that arguments do not alias each other and do not
           alias global storage.

           Each language will automatically use whatever option is required by the language standard.  You
           should not need to use these options yourself.

       <b>-fleading-underscore</b>
           This option and its counterpart, <b>-fno-leading-underscore</b>, forcibly change the way C symbols are
           represented in the object file.  One use is to help link with legacy assembly code.

           <b>Warning:</b> the <b>-fleading-underscore</b> switch causes GCC to generate code that is not binary
           compatible with code generated without that switch.  Use it to conform to a non-default
           application binary interface.  Not all targets provide complete support for this switch.

       <b>-ftls-model=</b><u>model</u>
           Alter the thread-local storage model to be used.  The <u>model</u> argument should be one of
           "global-dynamic", "local-dynamic", "initial-exec" or "local-exec".

           The default without <b>-fpic</b> is "initial-exec"; with <b>-fpic</b> the default is "global-dynamic".

       <b>-fvisibility=</b><u>default|internal|hidden|protected</u>
           Set the default ELF image symbol visibility to the specified option---all symbols will be marked
           with this unless overridden within the code.  Using this feature can very substantially improve
           linking and load times of shared object libraries, produce more optimized code, provide near-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">perfect&nbsp;nearperfect</font>
           perfect API export and prevent symbol clashes.  It is <b>strongly</b> recommended that you use this in
           any shared objects you distribute.

           Despite the nomenclature, "default" always means public ie; available to be linked against from
           outside the shared object.  "protected" and "internal" are pretty useless in real-world usage so
           the only other commonly used option will be "hidden".  The default if <b>-fvisibility</b> isn't
           specified is "default", i.e., make every symbol public---this causes the same behavior as
           previous versions of GCC.

           A good explanation of the benefits offered by ensuring ELF symbols have the correct visibility is
           given by ``How To Write Shared Libraries'' by Ulrich Drepper (which can be found at
           &lt;<a href="http://people.redhat.com/~drepper/"><b>http://people.redhat.com/~drepper/</b></a><b></b>)---however a superior solution made possible by this option
           to marking things hidden when the default is public is to make the default hidden and mark things
           public.  This is the norm with DLL's on Windows and with <b>-fvisibility=hidden</b> and "__attribute__
           ((visibility("default")))" instead of "__declspec(dllexport)" you get almost identical semantics
           with identical syntax.  This is a great boon to those working with cross-platform projects.

           For those adding visibility support to existing code, you may find <b>#pragma</b> <b>GCC</b> <b>visibility</b> of use.
           This works by you enclosing the declarations you wish to set visibility for with (for example)
           <b>#pragma</b> <b>GCC</b> <b>visibility</b> <b>push(hidden)</b> and <b>#pragma</b> <b>GCC</b> <b>visibility</b> <b>pop</b>.  These can be nested up to
           sixteen times.  Bear in mind that symbol visibility should be viewed <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>API</b> <b>interface</b>
           <b>contract</b> and thus all new code should always specify visibility when it is not the default ie;
           declarations only for use within the local DSO should <b>always</b> be marked explicitly as hidden as so
           to avoid PLT indirection overheads---making this abundantly clear also aids readability and self-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">documentation&nbsp;selfdocumentation</font>
           documentation of the code.  Note that due to ISO C++ specification requirements, operator new and
           operator delete must always be of default visibility.

           Be aware that headers from outside your project, in particular system headers and headers from
           any other library you use, may not be expecting to be compiled with visibility other than the
           default.  You may need to explicitly say <b>#pragma</b> <b>GCC</b> <b>visibility</b> <b>push(default)</b> before including
           any such headers.

           An overview of these techniques, their benefits and how to use them is at
           &lt;<a href="http://www.nedprod.com/programs/gccvisibility.html"><b>http://www.nedprod.com/programs/gccvisibility.html</b></a><b></b>.

<b>ENVIRONMENT</b>
       This section describes several environment variables that affect how GCC operates.  Some of them work
       by specifying directories or prefixes to use when searching for various kinds of files.  Some are
       used to specify other aspects of the compilation environment.

       Note that you can also specify places to search using options such as <b>-B</b>, <b>-I</b> and <b>-L</b>.  These take
       precedence over places specified using environment variables, which in turn take precedence over
       those specified by the configuration of GCC.

       <b>LANG</b>
       <b>LC_CTYPE</b>
       <b>LC_MESSAGES</b>
       <b>LC_ALL</b>
           These environment variables control the way that GCC uses localization information that allow GCC
           to work with different national conventions.  GCC inspects the locale categories <b>LC_CTYPE</b> and
           <b>LC_MESSAGES</b> if it has been configured to do so.  These locale categories can be set to any value
           supported by your installation.  A typical value is <b>en_GB.UTF-8</b> for English in the United Kingdom
           encoded in UTF-8.

           The <b>LC_CTYPE</b> environment variable specifies character classification.  GCC uses it to determine
           the character boundaries in a string; this is needed for some multibyte encodings that contain
           quote and escape characters that would otherwise be interpreted as a string end or escape.

           The <b>LC_MESSAGES</b> environment variable specifies the language to use in diagnostic messages.

           If the <b>LC_ALL</b> environment variable is set, it overrides the value of <b>LC_CTYPE</b> and <b>LC_MESSAGES</b>;
           otherwise, <b>LC_CTYPE</b> and <b>LC_MESSAGES</b> default to the value of the <b>LANG</b> environment variable.  If
           none of these variables are set, GCC defaults to traditional C English behavior.

       <b>TMPDIR</b>
           If <b>TMPDIR</b> is set, it specifies the directory to use for temporary files.  GCC uses temporary
           files to hold the output of one stage of compilation which is to be used as input to the next
           stage: for example, the output of the preprocessor, which is the input to the compiler proper.

       <b>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</b>
           If <b>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</b> is set, it specifies a prefix to use in the names of the subprograms executed
           by the compiler.  No slash is added when this prefix is combined with the name of a subprogram,
           but you can specify a prefix that ends with a slash if you wish.

           If <b>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</b> is not set, GCC will attempt to figure out an appropriate prefix to use based
           on the pathname it was invoked with.

           If GCC cannot find the subprogram using the specified prefix, it tries looking in the usual
           places for the subprogram.

           The default value of <b>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</b> is <u>prefix/lib/gcc/</u> where <u>prefix</u> is the value of "prefix"
           when you ran the <u>configure</u> script.

           Other prefixes specified with <b>-B</b> take precedence over this prefix.

           This prefix is also used for finding files such as <u>crt0.o</u> that are used for linking.

           In addition, the prefix is used in an unusual way in finding the directories to search for header
           files.  For each of the standard directories whose name normally begins with <b>/usr/local/lib/gcc</b>
           (more precisely, with the value of <b>GCC_INCLUDE_DIR</b>), GCC tries replacing that beginning with the
           specified prefix to produce an alternate directory name.  Thus, with <b>-Bfoo/</b>, GCC will search
           <u>foo/bar</u> where it would normally search <u>/usr/local/lib/bar</u>.  These alternate directories are
           searched first; the standard directories come next.

       <b>COMPILER_PATH</b>
           The value of <b>COMPILER_PATH</b> is a colon-separated list of directories, much like <b>PATH</b>.  GCC tries
           the directories thus specified when searching for subprograms, if it can't find the subprograms
           using <b>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</b>.

       <b>LIBRARY_PATH</b>
           The value of <b>LIBRARY_PATH</b> is a colon-separated list of directories, much like <b>PATH</b>.  When
           configured as a native compiler, GCC tries the directories thus specified when searching for
           special linker files, if it can't find them using <b>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</b>.  Linking using GCC also uses
           these directories when searching for ordinary libraries for the <b>-l</b> option (but directories
           specified with <b>-L</b> come first).

       <b>LANG</b>
           This variable is used to pass locale information to the compiler.  One way in which this
           information is used is to determine the character set to be used when character literals, string
           literals and comments are parsed in C and C++.  When the compiler is configured to allow
           multibyte characters, the following values for <b>LANG</b> are recognized:

           <b>C-JIS</b>
               Recognize JIS characters.

           <b>C-SJIS</b>
               Recognize SJIS characters.

           <b>C-EUCJP</b>
               Recognize EUCJP characters.

           If <b>LANG</b> is not defined, or if it has some other value, then the compiler will use mblen and
           mbtowc as defined by the default locale to recognize and translate multibyte characters.

       Some additional environments variables affect the behavior of the preprocessor.

       <b>CPATH</b>
       <b>C_INCLUDE_PATH</b>
       <b>CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH</b>
       <b>OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH</b>
           Each variable's value is a list of directories separated by a special character, much like <b>PATH</b>,
           in which to look for header files.  The special character, "PATH_SEPARATOR", is target-dependent
           and determined at GCC build time.  For Microsoft Windows-based targets it is a semicolon, and for
           almost all other targets it is a colon.

           <b>CPATH</b> specifies a list of directories to be searched as if specified with <b>-I</b>, but after any paths
           given with <b>-I</b> options on the command line.  This environment variable is used regardless of which
           language is being preprocessed.

           The remaining environment variables apply only when preprocessing the particular language
           indicated.  Each specifies a list of directories to be searched as if specified with <b>-isystem</b>,
           but after any paths given with <b>-isystem</b> options on the command line.

           In all these variables, an empty element instructs the compiler to search its current working
           directory.  Empty elements can appear at the beginning or end of a path.  For instance, if the
           value of <b>CPATH</b> is ":/special/include", that has the same effect as <b>-I.</b> <b>-I/special/include</b>.

       <b>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</b>
           If this variable is set, its value specifies how to output dependencies for Make based on the
           non-system header files processed by the compiler.  System header files are ignored in the
           dependency output.

           The value of <b>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</b> can be just a file name, in which case the Make rules are
           written to that file, guessing the target name from the source file name.  Or the value can have
           the form <u>file</u> <u>target</u>, in which case the rules are written to file <u>file</u> using <u>target</u> as the target
           name.

           In other words, this environment variable is equivalent to combining the options <b>-MM</b> and <b>-MF</b>,
           with an optional <b>-MT</b> switch too.

       <b>SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES</b>
           This variable is the same as <b>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</b> (see above), except that system header files are
           not ignored, so it implies <b>-M</b> rather than <b>-MM</b>.  However, the dependence on the main input file is
           omitted.

<b>FOOTNOTES</b>
       1.  On some systems, <b>gcc</b> <b>-shared</b> needs to build supplementary stub code for constructors to work.  On
           multi-libbed systems, <b>gcc</b> <b>-shared</b> must select the correct support libraries to link against.
           Failing to supply the correct flags may lead to subtle defects.  Supplying them in cases where
           they are not necessary is innocuous.
