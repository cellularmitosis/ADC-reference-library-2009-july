This sample is a follow-on to the SimpleScripting and SimpleScriptingProperties
samples.  After completing the steps defined in the SimpleScripting sample to
set up and create a scriptable application and acquainting yourself with the
concepts in the SimpleScriptingProperties sample, you can continue with the
steps in this sample to add some objects to an application.  



Step 1:  Setting up

Create a new .sdef file that includes the standard scripting suite and add it
to your Xcode project.  Usually, this file will have the same name as your
application.  Going along with that convention, the .sdef file in this sample
has been named &quot;SimpleScriptingObjects.sdef&quot;.  In the contents of that file,
enter an empty dictionary that includes the standard AppleScript suite as
follows:


&lt;dictionary xmlns:xi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2003/XInclude&quot;&gt;

    &lt;xi:include
href=&quot;file:///System/Library/ScriptingDefinitions/CocoaStandard.sdef&quot;
xpointer=&quot;xpointer(/dictionary/suite)&quot;/&gt;

        &lt;!-- add your own suite definitions here --&gt;

&lt;/dictionary&gt;

The important parts of this definition are as follows:

1. The 'xi' namespace declaration in the opening dictionary element declares
that enclosed elements using the 'xi' namespace will follow conventions defined
by the XInclude standard.  This will allow us to include the standard
definitions.

2. The 'xi:include' element includes the Standard Suite in the .sdef.

NOTE: Prior to Mac OS X 10.5 developers would copy the standard suite from the
ScriptingDefinitions sample
(http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/ScriptingDefinitions/index.html) directly
into their .sdef file.  For backwards compatibility with Mac OS X 10.4, you may
continue to use that technique, but moving forward the XInclude technique
described above is recommended.




Step 2: Add a starting suite

Add a new suite to your .sdef file at the end of the dictionary just before the
closing &lt;/dictionary&gt; tag:


    &lt;suite name=&quot;Simple Scripting Objects Suite&quot; code=&quot;ScOb&quot;
            description=&quot;Simple Scripting Objects application specific scripting
facilities.&quot;&gt;
        &lt;!-- put your application specific scripting suite information here --&gt;
         
    &lt;/suite&gt;

It is inside of this suite definition where you will put your application
specific scripting information.  You can add additional suites if you like and
use them to group related scripting functionality, but for most purposes one
suite should be sufficient.




Step 3: Add an application class to your new script suite.

Here is our new suite with the application class added in:

    &lt;suite name=&quot;Simple Scripting Objects Suite&quot; code=&quot;ScOb&quot;
            description=&quot;Simple Scripting Objects application specific scripting
facilities.&quot;&gt;
        
        &lt;!-- put your application specific scripting suite information here --&gt;
        
        &lt;class name=&quot;application&quot; code=&quot;capp&quot; 
                    description=&quot;Our simple application class.&quot; inherits=&quot;application&quot;&gt;

            &lt;cocoa class=&quot;NSApplication&quot;/&gt;

            &lt;property name=&quot;weight&quot; code=&quot;ScWt&quot; type=&quot;real&quot; access=&quot;r&quot;
                    description=&quot;the weight of all of the items in the application&quot;/&gt;
                    
            &lt;property name=&quot;value&quot; code=&quot;valL&quot; type=&quot;real&quot; access=&quot;r&quot;
                    description=&quot;the value of all of the treasure in the application&quot;/&gt;
                    
            &lt;element type=&quot;treasure&quot;/&gt;
            
            &lt;element type=&quot;trinket&quot;/&gt;
            
            &lt;element type=&quot;bucket&quot;/&gt;
            
            &lt;element type=&quot;strong box&quot;&gt;
                &lt;cocoa key=&quot;strongBoxes&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/element&gt;
            
        &lt;/class&gt;

        &lt;!-- add your special classes (object definitions) here --&gt;


    &lt;/suite&gt;

Note, the application class we have added inherits from the application class
defined in the Standard Suite in Skeleton.sdef.  

The application class is the root container class for an scriptable
application.  All of the root functionality provided by your application will be
contained in this class and the other classes and objects that it contains.

Important points to note here:
  - the suite has a unique four-character code associated with it 'ScOb'. 
  - when selecting four character codes to pair together with terms you would
  like to use in AppleScript, you should always consult the AppleScript
Terminology and Apple Event Codes table here:
 
http://developer.apple.com/releasenotes/AppleScript/ASTerminology_AppleEventCodes/TermsAndCodes.html
  
  The four character codes you use for your terms you are using should always
agree with the four character codes in that table.  If you are introducing new
terms, then you should make sure the four character code you are using to
represent that term isn't already in use by consulting that table.


  - the &lt;cocoa class=&quot;NSApplication&quot;/&gt; part names the Objective-C class where
Cocoa will look for the property accessor methods for the properties we define
for our custom application AppleScript class.  For every property we define in
the scripting definition for our application class, we will define appropriate
accessor methods on the category of NSApplication defined in the
SimpleApplication.h and SimpleApplication.m files.

  - we have added two properties to the application class, weight and value.  
  
  - we have added four elements to the application class and we have identified
them by their type:
      &lt;element type=&quot;treasure&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;element type=&quot;trinket&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;element type=&quot;bucket&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;element type=&quot;strong box&quot;&gt;
        &lt;cocoa key=&quot;strongBoxes&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/element&gt;
  These definitions define the objects (elements) that our application
container will contain.  On the AppleScript side, Cocoa will display the plural
form of the elements we are using here when displaying the elements to the
Scripter.  For example, the scripter will see that the application contains
'treasures', 'trinkets', 'buckets', and 'strong boxes'.  
  
  - Cocoa will also used the plural name when generating kvc names for calling
accessors for these collections.
  
  - 'strong box' is an irregular plural so we have overridden the default name
generation provided by Cocoa and specified a name for Cocoa to use when
generating KVC compliant names for calling accessors for these collections.




Step 4: Add some additional class definitions to the scripting suite.


Here are the classes added to the application suite for this example:


(a) the 'trinket' class:

        &lt;class name=&quot;trinket&quot; code=&quot;ScOT&quot;
            description=&quot;A leaf object that does not contain other objects.&quot;&gt;
            
            &lt;cocoa class=&quot;Trinket&quot;/&gt;
            
            &lt;!-- properties --&gt;
            
            &lt;property name=&quot;id&quot; code=&quot;ID  &quot; type=&quot;text&quot; access=&quot;r&quot;
                description=&quot;The unique identifier.&quot;&gt;
                &lt;cocoa key=&quot;uniqueID&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/property&gt;
            
            &lt;property name=&quot;name&quot; code=&quot;pnam&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; access=&quot;rw&quot;
                    description=&quot;the item's name&quot;/&gt;

            &lt;property name=&quot;shiny&quot; code=&quot;TrSh&quot; type=&quot;boolean&quot; access=&quot;rw&quot;
                    description=&quot;shiny side up!&quot;/&gt;
                    
            &lt;property name=&quot;weight&quot; code=&quot;ScWt&quot; type=&quot;real&quot; access=&quot;rw&quot;
                    description=&quot;the item's weight&quot;/&gt;
                    
            &lt;property name=&quot;description&quot; code=&quot;desc&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; access=&quot;rw&quot;
                    description=&quot;a description of the item&quot;/&gt;
            
        &lt;/class&gt;
            
The trinket class is a simple class that has a number of properties.  The id
and name properties are necessary for the Cocoa runtime to function properly,
and the other properties are there for illustration.  We have identified the
Cocoa class implementing this AppleScript class in the '&lt;cocoa
class=&quot;Trinket&quot;/&gt;' element of this definition.  Cocoa will use this Objective-C
class for implementing the operations for this AppleScript class.




(b) the 'treasure' class:

        &lt;class name=&quot;treasure&quot; code=&quot;ScOR&quot; inherits=&quot;trinket&quot;
            description=&quot;A leaf object that does not contain other objects.&quot;&gt;
            
            &lt;cocoa class=&quot;Treasure&quot;/&gt;
            
            
            &lt;!-- properties --&gt;
            
            &lt;property name=&quot;value&quot; code=&quot;valL&quot; type=&quot;real&quot; access=&quot;rw&quot;
                    description=&quot;the item's value&quot;/&gt;
                    
            &lt;property name=&quot;metal&quot; code=&quot;SMtl&quot; type=&quot;preciousmetal&quot; access=&quot;rw&quot;
                    description=&quot;main constituent metal&quot;/&gt;
            
        &lt;/class&gt;

The treasure class is a subclass of the trinket class and it adds two new
properties to that definition.  For illustration, we have used a custom
enumeration ('preciousmetal') for one of the properties of this class.  We have
identified the Cocoa class implementing this AppleScript class in the '&lt;cocoa
class=&quot;Treasure&quot;/&gt;' element of this definition.  Cocoa will use this Objective-C
class for implementing the operations for this AppleScript class.




(c) the 'bucket' class:

        &lt;class name=&quot;bucket&quot; code=&quot;ScOB&quot;
            description=&quot;An object that can contain other objects.&quot;&gt;
            
            &lt;cocoa class=&quot;Bucket&quot;/&gt;
            
            
            &lt;!-- properties --&gt;
            
            &lt;property name=&quot;id&quot; code=&quot;ID  &quot; type=&quot;text&quot; access=&quot;r&quot;
                description=&quot;The unique identifier.&quot;&gt;
                &lt;cocoa key=&quot;uniqueID&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/property&gt;
            
            &lt;property name=&quot;name&quot; code=&quot;pnam&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; access=&quot;rw&quot;
                    description=&quot;the item's name&quot;/&gt;
            
            &lt;property name=&quot;weight&quot; code=&quot;ScWt&quot; type=&quot;real&quot; access=&quot;r&quot;
                    description=&quot;the weight of all of the items in the bucket&quot;/&gt;
                    
            &lt;property name=&quot;value&quot; code=&quot;valL&quot; type=&quot;real&quot; access=&quot;r&quot;
                    description=&quot;the value of all of the treasure in the bucket&quot;/&gt;
            
            
            &lt;!-- elements --&gt;
            
            &lt;element type=&quot;treasure&quot;/&gt;

            &lt;element type=&quot;trinket&quot;/&gt;

            
        &lt;/class&gt;

The bucket class is a container class that can contain both trinket and
treasure objects.  The id and name properties are necessary for the Cocoa
runtime to function properly, and the other properties are there for
illustration.  Note that we have declared both the value and the weight
properties as 'read only' (access=&quot;r&quot;).  For illustration, in our implementation
those values are calculated as the sum of the weights and values of the trinket
and treasure objects contained in our bucket object.  We have identified the
Cocoa class implementing this AppleScript class in the '&lt;cocoa class=&quot;Bucket&quot;/&gt;'
element of this definition.  Cocoa will use this Objective-C class for
implementing the operations for this AppleScript class.




(d) the 'strong box' class:

        &lt;class name=&quot;strong box&quot; plural=&quot;strong boxes&quot; code=&quot;ScOS&quot; inherits=&quot;bucket&quot;
            description=&quot;An object that can contain other objects.&quot;&gt;
            
            &lt;cocoa class=&quot;StrongBox&quot;/&gt;
            
            &lt;!-- properties --&gt;
                                
            &lt;property name=&quot;label&quot; code=&quot;clbl&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; access=&quot;rw&quot;
                    description=&quot;the label on the outside of the box&quot;/&gt;
            
            &lt;property name=&quot;weight&quot; code=&quot;ScWt&quot; type=&quot;real&quot; access=&quot;r&quot;
                    description=&quot;the weight of all of the items in the strong box&quot;/&gt;
                    
            &lt;property name=&quot;value&quot; code=&quot;valL&quot; type=&quot;real&quot; access=&quot;r&quot;
                    description=&quot;the value of all of the treasure in the strong box&quot;/&gt;

            &lt;!-- elements --&gt;
            
            &lt;element type=&quot;bucket&quot;/&gt;

            
        &lt;/class&gt;

The strong box class is a container class and it is a subclass of bucket has
all of the properties of bucket, but adds an extra property and it can contain
elements of type bucket.  Note that the strong box class provides specialized
methods (implemented in Strongbox.m) for the weight and value properties so we
can add in the totals from all of the buckets contained in a strong box.  even
though those properties have already been defined in the bucket superclass, we
have included them in this class definition so we can provide specialized
description values for them (important: we have used the same four letter codes
for those properties in this definition as the ones we used in the Bucket class
definition).  We have identified the Cocoa class implementing this AppleScript
class in the '&lt;cocoa class=&quot;StrongBox&quot;/&gt;' element of this definition.  Cocoa
will use this Objective-C class for implementing the operations for this
AppleScript class.






Step 5: Implement the setter and getter methods on a Category of NSApplication.


In this example we have provided the implementation for all of the necessary
setter and getter methods for maintaining our application's properties and
collections in the SimpleApplication.m file.  Comments in that file provide more
information about the implementation.  See the files SimpleApplication.h and
SimpleApplication.m for more information.


Step 6: Implement the objects defined by our scripting definition file.


In this example we have built all of our objects on top of the root class
'Element' defined in the files Element.h and Element.m.  This class maintains
the id and name properties and it does most of the necessary house keeping
operations for integrating with AppleScript and Cocoa.  Comments in that file
explain the implementation in greater detail.


Other classes we have defined for this sample are defined in the files
Trinket.h/m, Treasure.h/m, Bucket.h/m, and StrongBox.h/m.  Comments in those
files provide detailed explanations of those implementations.



Step 7:  Where to next?

Well, now that you have the very basics in hand, you're all ready to start
adding scriptability to your application.  But, careful planning before you
start adding in scripting features will be well worth your while.  So, please
consider reading the following documentation.

- The items listed in the section &quot;Making Your Application Scriptable&quot; on this
page are essential reading.  Everyone new to scripting should read through these
documents and familiarize themselves with the topics discussed.
http://developer.apple.com/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/GS_AppleScript/index.html

- &quot;Designing for Scriptability in Cocoa Scripting Guide provides a high-level
checklist of design issues and tactics:
http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ScriptableCocoaApplications/index.html

- This Scripting Interface Guidelines document provides more detailed
information you should consider when adding scriptability to your application: 
http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2002/tn2106.html

- The AppleScript terminology and Apple Event Codes document provides a listing
of four character codes that area already defined for use with specific terms. 
As you are adding terminology to your application you should always check there
to see if a four character code has already been defined for a term you would
like to use AND to make sure a four character code you would like to use is not
already being used by some other terminology. 
http://developer.apple.com/releasenotes/AppleScript/ASTerminology_AppleEventCodes/TermsAndCodes.html

- NSScriptCommand class is the one you use for implementing verbs (aka
commands) 
http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSScriptCommand_Class/Reference/Reference.html



Step 8:  And after that?

This sample is part of a suite of samples is structured as an incremental
tutorial with concepts illustrated in one sample leading to the next in the
