The grow boxworks as expected when the command key is not used.<p>I don't think that this happening because of a bug on our end. Some of ourapplications are written in Metrowerks PowerPlant and others in Think Pascal,so they don't share common code, but this unexpected condition exists in all ofour applications. I've since noticed the same problem in any application thatlimits the width of a window.</p><p>I haven't found any documentation discussing the relationship between thecommand key and the grow box. I really want to limit the width of a window, andnow there's a way around it. Why is this happening?</p><font size="+4">A</font>Back in the old days when the Macintosh screen was 9" (384 pixels x 542pixels), a lot of developers did not follow Apple's guidelines for window sizesand hardcoded the sizeRect given to GrowWindow based upon this small size.<p>When the Macintosh II was introduced in '87, Apple engineers felt it would befrustrating for users to not be able to use the whole area of the new 13"monitors. In response, Apple implemented the 'Command key grow' feature. Thismeant that if the command-key was pressed while resizing the window, userscould get whatever size they really wanted, because a sizeRect that washardcoded to the dimensions of the 9" screen would be ignored.</p><p>However, Apple's implementation of the 'Command key grow' feature was notwithout consequence to some applications whose code was not written inaccordance with Apple specifications. Certain applications were not able toaccommodate the unanticipated change to the size of their windows and wereprone to crashing and other problems.</p><p>As it currently stands, the 'Command key grow' feature is still in the system,as it has been since 1987, and even to this day developers should pay heed toit. As you've discovered, 'Command key grow' doesn't depend on the developmentenvironment.</p><p>Developers have been dealing with unusual monitor sizes for many years now, andfew ever hardcode the sizeRect anymore. In light of this, Apple felt that therewas not a need to document 'Command key grow' in the new <i>InsideMacintosh</i> series, however it is documented on page 209 of <i>InsideMacintosh V</i> (the old series).</p><!-- begin_date --><H4 ALIGN=center>[Aug 21 1996]</H4><!-- end_date --></td></tr></table></CENTER><!-- begin_footer_information -->	<table width="680" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
