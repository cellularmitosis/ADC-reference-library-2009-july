              The suffix is no longer stripped if it is identical to the remaining characters in the name,
               again for consistency with the shell utility.

              Some internal code cleanup.

          "File::Copy" upgraded to version 2.09

              $^O could sometimes become tainted. This has been fixed.

              "canonpath" on Win32 now collapses "foo/.." (or "foo\..") sections correctly, rather than
               doing the "misguided" work it was previously doing.  Note that "canonpath" on Unix still does
               <b>not</b> collapse these sections, as doing so would be incorrect.

              Some documentation improvements

              Some internal code cleanup

               tern" that allows the user to specify what prefix patterns should have long option style
               semantics applied.

              Options can now take multiple values at once (experimental)

              Various bug fixes

              "threads" will now honour "no warnings 'threads'"

              A thread's interpreter is now freed after "$t-&gt;join()" rather than after "undef $t", which
               should fix some "ithreads" memory leaks. (Fixed by Dave Mitchell)

              Some documentation typo fixes.

          Salvador Fandio provided improvements to reduce the memory usage of "sort" and to speed up some
           cases.

          Jarkko Hietaniemi and Andy Lester worked to mark as much data as possible in the C source files
           as "static", to increase the proportion of the executable file that the operating system can
           share between process, and thus reduce real memory usage on multi-user systems.

<b>Installation</b> <b>and</b> <b>Configuration</b> <b>Improvements</b>
       Parallel makes should work properly now, although there may still be problems if "make test" is
       instructed to run in parallel.

       Building with Borland's compilers on Win32 should work more smoothly. In particular Steve Hay has
       worked to side step many warnings emitted by their compilers and at least one C compiler internal
       error.

       "Configure" will now detect "clearenv" and "unsetenv", thanks to a patch from Alan Burlison. It will
       also probe for "futimes" and whether "sprintf" correctly returns the length of the formatted string,
       which will both be used in perl 5.8.9.

       There are improved hints for next-3.0, vmesa, IX, Darwin, Solaris, Linux, DEC/OSF, HP-UX and MPE/iX

       Perl extensions on Windows now can be statically built into the Perl DLL, thanks to a work by Vadim
       Konovalov. (This improvement was actually in 5.8.7, but was accidentally omitted from perl587delta).

<b>Selected</b> <b>Bug</b> <b>Fixes</b>
       <b>no</b> <b>warnings</b> <b>'category'</b> <b>works</b> <b>correctly</b> <b>with</b> <b>-w</b>

       Previously when running with warnings enabled globally via "-w", selective disabling of specific
       warning categories would actually turn off all warnings.  This is now fixed; now "no warnings 'io';"
       will only turn off warnings in the "io" class. Previously it would erroneously turn off all warnings.

       This bug fix may cause some programs to start correctly issuing warnings.

       <b>Remove</b> <b>over-optimisation</b>

       Perl 5.8.4 introduced a change so that assignments of "undef" to a scalar, or of an empty list to an
       array or a hash, were optimised away. As this could cause problems when "goto" jumps were involved,
       this change has been backed out.

       <u>sprintf()</u> <b>fixes</b>

       Using the <u>sprintf()</u> function with some formats could lead to a buffer overflow in some specific
       cases. This has been fixed, along with several other bugs, notably in bounds checking.

       In related fixes, it was possible for badly written code that did not follow the documentation of
       "Sys::Syslog" to have formatting vulnerabilities.  "Sys::Syslog" has been changed to protect people
       from poor quality third party code.

       <b>Debugger</b> <b>and</b> <b>Unicode</b> <b>slowdown</b>

       It had been reported that running under perl's debugger when processing Unicode data could cause
       unexpectedly large slowdowns. The most likely cause of this was identified and fixed by Nicholas
       Clark.

       <b>Smaller</b> <b>fixes</b>


          "FindBin" now works better with directories where access rights are more restrictive than usual.

          Several memory leaks in ithreads were closed. An improved implementation of "threads::shared" is
           available on CPAN - this will be merged into 5.8.9 if it proves stable.

          Trailing spaces are now trimmed from $! and $^E.

          Operations that require perl to read a process' list of groups, such as reads of $( and $), now
           dynamically allocate memory rather than using a fixed sized array. The fixed size array could
           cause C stack exhaustion on systems configured to use large numbers of groups.

          "PerlIO::scalar" now works better with non-default $/ settings.

          You can now use the "x" operator to repeat a "qw//" list. This used to raise a syntax error.

          The debugger now traces correctly execution in eval("")uated code that contains #line directives.

          The value of the "open" pragma is no longer ignored for three-argument opens.

          The optimisation of "for (reverse @a)" introduced in perl 5.8.6 could misbehave when the array
           had undefined elements and was used in LVALUE context. Dave Mitchell provided a fix.

          Some case insensitive matches between UTF-8 encoded data and 8 bit regexps, and vice versa, could
           give malformed character warnings. These have been fixed by Dave Mitchell and Yves Orton.

          "lcfirst" and "ucfirst" could corrupt the string for certain cases where the length UTF-8 encod-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;encoding</font>
           ing of the string in lower case, upper case or title case differed. This was fixed by Nicholas
           Clark.

          Perl will now use the C library calls "unsetenv" and "clearenv" if present to delete keys from
           %ENV and delete %ENV entirely, thanks to a patch from Alan Burlison.

<b>New</b> <b>or</b> <b>Changed</b> <b>Diagnostics</b>
       <b>Attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>freed</b> <b>array</b>

       This is a new warning, produced in situations such as this:

           $r = do {my @a; \$#a};
           $$r = 503;

       <b>Non-string</b> <b>passed</b> <b>as</b> <b>bitmask</b>

       This is a new warning, produced when number has been passed as a argument to <u>select()</u>, instead of a
       bitmask.

           # Wrong, will now warn
           $rin = fileno(STDIN);
           ($nfound,$timeleft) = select($rout=$rin, undef, undef, $timeout);

           # Should be
           $rin = '';
           vec($rin,fileno(STDIN),1) = 1;
           ($nfound,$timeleft) = select($rout=$rin, undef, undef, $timeout);

       <b>Search</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>not</b> <b>terminated</b> <b>or</b> <b>ternary</b> <b>operator</b> <b>parsed</b> <b>as</b> <b>search</b> <b>pattern</b>

       This syntax error indicates that the lexer couldn't find the final delimiter of a "?PATTERN?" con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">struct.&nbsp;construct.</font>
       struct. Mentioning the ternary operator in this error message makes it easier to diagnose syntax
       errors.

<b>Changed</b> <b>Internals</b>
       There has been a fair amount of refactoring of the "C" source code, partly to make it tidier and more
       maintainable. The resulting object code and the "perl" binary may well be smaller than 5.8.7, in par-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ticular&nbsp;particular</font>
       ticular due to a change contributed by Dave Mitchell which reworked the warnings code to be signifi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cantly&nbsp;significantly</font>
       cantly smaller. Apart from being smaller and possibly faster, there should be no user-detectable
       changes.

       Andy Lester supplied many improvements to determine which function parameters and local variables
       could actually be declared "const" to the C compiler. Steve Peters provided new *_set macros and
       reworked the core to use these rather than assigning to macros in LVALUE context.

       Dave Mitchell improved the lexer debugging output under "-DT"

       Nicholas Clark changed the string buffer allocation so that it is now rounded up to the next multiple
       of 4 (or 8 on platforms with 64 bit pointers). This should reduce the number of calls to "realloc"
       without actually using any extra memory.

       The "HV"'s array of "HE*"s is now allocated at the correct (minimal) size, thanks to another change
       by Nicholas Clark. Compile with "-DPERL_USE_LARGE_HV_ALLOC" to use the old, sloppier, default.

       For XS or embedding debugging purposes, if perl is compiled with "-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS_FORK_DUMP"
       in addition to "-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS" then a child process is "fork"ed just before global destruc-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion,&nbsp;destruction,</font>
       tion, which is used to display the values of any scalars found to have leaked at the end of global
       destruction. Without this, the scalars have already been freed sufficiently at the point of detection
       that it is impossible to produce any meaningful dump of their contents.  This feature was implemented
       by the indefatigable Nicholas Clark, based on an idea by Mike Giroux.

<b>Platform</b> <b>Specific</b> <b>Problems</b>
       The optimiser on HP-UX 11.23 (Itanium 2) is currently partly disabled (scaled down to +O1) when using
       HP C-ANSI-C; the cause of problems at higher optimisation levels is still unclear.

       There are a handful of remaining test failures on VMS, mostly due to test fixes and minor module
       tweaks with too many dependencies to integrate into this release from the development stream, where
       they have all been corrected.  The following is a list of expected failures with the patch number of
       the fix where that is known:

           ext/Devel/PPPort/t/ppphtest.t  #26913
           ext/List/Util/t/p_tainted.t    #26912
           lib/ExtUtils/t/PL_FILES.t      #26813
           lib/ExtUtils/t/basic.t         #26813
