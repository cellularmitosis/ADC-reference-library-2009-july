The server-side portion interacts with a databaseserver as in HTML-based WebObjects applications, and the client-sideportion, in addition to providing  the application's user interface,can also contain non-sensitive business logic.</p><br><a name = "BBCCGJEC"></a><p><b><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">Figure6-4 Java Client's distributed, multitierarchitecture</font></b></p> <img src = "../Art/javaclient_sides.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/javaclient_sides.gif]"><p> <a href="#BAJCFHED">Figure 6-5</a> elaborates the architecture of Java Client applications.</p><br><a name = "BAJCFHED"></a><p><b><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">Figure6-5 Architecture of a Java Client application</font></b></p> <img src = "../Art/javaclient_custom.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/javaclient_custom.gif]"><p>The architecture of Direct to Java Client applications isslightly more complex than that of non-direct Java Client applications,as illustrated in  <a href="#BBCBBJHG">Figure 6-6</a>. It includes the Rule System&#151;the part of the server-sideapplication responsible for dynamically generating the user interfaceand defining its behaviors.</p><br><a name = "BBCBBJHG"></a><p><b><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">Figure6-6 Architecture of a Direct to Java Clientapplication</font></b></p> <img src = "../Art/directjavaclient_app.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/directjavaclient_app.gif]"><p>The client and server applications have duties other thanmerely providing the user interface and database access&#151;for example,each can contain business logic and each communicates with the otherthrough a Web server. However, the database access/user interfacedivision is significant because it provides a richness of user interfacewithout compromising security or performance. </p><p>Sensitive business logic and database connection logic isprovided only by the server application. Because compiled Java onthe client side can be decompiled, the client application is limitedto user interface code and nonsensitive business logic. At the same time,the ability to put some of the business logic on the client (anynonsensitive logic) improves performance. By performing as muchprocessing as possible on the client (such as field validation),round trips to the server are limited.</p><p>To be clear, the Java Client architecture duplicates the graphof enterprise objects on the client application so the graph andits management occur on both server and client. WebObjects handlesall client-server communication and distributes the object graph acrossclient and server.</p><br>    <br><a href="Choosing_an_Approach.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/previous.gif" border="0"></a><a href="Managing_th_r_Interface.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/next.gif" border="0"></a>&nbsp;<br><br><p><hr><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">&#169; 2002 Apple Computer, Inc.
