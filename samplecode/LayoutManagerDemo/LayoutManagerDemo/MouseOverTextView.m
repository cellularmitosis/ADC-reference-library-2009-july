/*
  This application demonstrates interrogating the layout manager for information about
  text layout, and the use of temporary attributes to color text.  Specifically, we 
  provide rollover coloring of text--one color for the line, another for the word, 
  and a third for the character under the mouse.  A subclass of NSTextView is used,
  but solely for the purpose of obtaining mouse events.  The interesting portion of 
  the code involves the conversion of mouse coordinates to a particular glyph and
  character index, then determining the corresponding line and word, and finally 
  using temporary attributes for coloring.
