<h3 class="section">5.46 Using vector instructions through built-in functions</h3>

<p>On some targets, the instruction set contains SIMD vector instructions that
operate on multiple values contained in one large register at the same time. 
For example, on the i386 the MMX, 3Dnow! and SSE extensions can be used
this way.

   <p>The first step in using these extensions is to provide the necessary data
types.  This should be done using an appropriate <code>typedef</code>:

<pre class="example">     typedef int v4si __attribute__ ((mode(V4SI)));
</pre>
   <p>The base type <code>int</code> is effectively ignored by the compiler, the
actual properties of the new type <code>v4si</code> are defined by the
<code>__attribute__</code>.  It defines the machine mode to be used; for vector
types these have the form <code>V</code><var>n</var><var>B</var>; <var>n</var> should be the
number of elements in the vector, and <var>B</var> should be the base mode of the
individual elements.  The following can be used as base modes:

     <dl>
<dt><code>QI</code><dd>An integer that is as wide as the smallest addressable unit, usually 8 bits. 
<br><dt><code>HI</code><dd>An integer, twice as wide as a QI mode integer, usually 16 bits. 
<br><dt><code>SI</code><dd>An integer, four times as wide as a QI mode integer, usually 32 bits. 
<br><dt><code>DI</code><dd>An integer, eight times as wide as a QI mode integer, usually 64 bits. 
<br><dt><code>SF</code><dd>A floating point value, as wide as a SI mode integer, usually 32 bits. 
<br><dt><code>DF</code><dd>A floating point value, as wide as a DI mode integer, usually 64 bits. 
</dl>

   <p>Specifying a combination that is not valid for the current architecture
will cause gcc to synthesize the instructions using a narrower mode. 
For example, if you specify a variable of type <code>V4SI</code> and your
architecture does not allow for this specific SIMD type, gcc will
produce code that uses 4 <code>SIs</code>.

   <p>The types defined in this manner can be used with a subset of normal C
operations.  Currently, gcc will allow using the following operators on
these types: <code>+, -, *, /, unary minus</code>.

   <p>The operations behave like C++ <code>valarrays</code>.  Addition is defined as
the addition of the corresponding elements of the operands.  For
example, in the code below, each of the 4 elements in <var>a</var> will be
added to the corresponding 4 elements in <var>b</var> and the resulting
vector will be stored in <var>c</var>.

<pre class="example">     typedef int v4si __attribute__ ((mode(V4SI)));
     
     v4si a, b, c;
     
     c = a + b;
     
</pre>
   <p>Subtraction, multiplication, and division operate in a similar manner. 
Likewise, the result of using the unary minus operator on a vector type
is a vector whose elements are the negative value of the corresponding
elements in the operand.

   <p>You can declare variables and use them in function calls and returns, as
well as in assignments and some casts.  You can specify a vector type as
a return type for a function.  Vector types can also be used as function
arguments.  It is possible to cast from one vector type to another,
provided they are of the same size (in fact, you can also cast vectors
to and from other datatypes of the same size).

   <p>You cannot operate between vectors of different lengths or different
signedness without a cast.

   <p>A port that supports hardware vector operations, usually provides a set
of built-in functions that can be used to operate on vectors.  For
example, a function to add two vectors and multiply the result by a
third could look like this:

<pre class="example">     v4si f (v4si a, v4si b, v4si c)
     {
       v4si tmp = __builtin_addv4si (a, b);
       return __builtin_mulv4si (tmp, c);
     }
     
</pre>
