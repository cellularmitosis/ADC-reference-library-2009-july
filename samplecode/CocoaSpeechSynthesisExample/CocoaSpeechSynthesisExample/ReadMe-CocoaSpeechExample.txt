CocoaSpeechSynthensisExample
version 1.4

A Cocoa application using the Carbon Speech Synthesis API.

The CocoaSpeechSynthensisExample shows how to use the Carbon Speech Synthesis API from within a Mac OS X Cocoa application.  Once built, the application provides access to virtually all the features of the Speech Synthesis Framework.  The application code provides examples of the following concepts:

- Word highlighting using the word callback.
- Simple mouth animation using the phoneme callback.
- Saving of generated speech audio data to a file.
- Creation of a voice pop-up menu.
- Starting, stopping, pausing and continuing of the speech generation process.
