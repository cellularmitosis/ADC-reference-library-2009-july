It describes changes made to existing featuresand describes new features you may want to start using in your applications</p><br><a name = "TP503500820"></a><h2>Compatibility withWebObjects 4.0</h2><p>WebObjects 4.5 is compile-compatible with WebObjects 4.0.You should be able to run most WebObjects 4.0 applications by simplyrebuilding them using WebObjects 4.5. Note that Direct To Web andJava Client applications require some additional effort to convert toWebObjects 4.5; see the <i>WebObjects 4.5 Post-InstallationInstructions</i> for more information on converting yourexisting applications.</p><br><a name = "TP503500821"></a><h2>Changes in WebObjects4.5</h2><p>This section describes the primary changes to WebObjects forthe 4.5 release, including Enterprise Objects Framework (EOF), whichis considered part of WebObjects 4.5.</p><br><a name = "BAHBFAEB"></a><h3>Platform and LanguageSupport</h3><p>WebObjects makes the following improvements to platform andlanguage support in release 4.5:</p><ul><li>WebObjects applications written in Java are nowsupported on HP-UX.</li><li>WebObjects now supports JDK 1.1.8 on Windows NT and on Solaris(1.1.7 on HP-UX).</li><li>On Solaris and HP-UX, WebObjects no longer needs to be installedinto <tt>/opt/Apple</tt>.</li></ul><br><table border = "0" BGCOLOR="#E6E6E6"><tr><td rowspan = "1" colspan = "1" valign = "top" scope="row"><b>Note: </b>HP-UX10.20 is no longer supported; WebObjects 4.5 requires HP-UX 11.0.</td></tr></table><br><br><a name = "TP503500822"></a><h3>Deploying WebObjectsApplications</h3><p>In addition to the changes listed under  <a href="#BAHBFAEB">Platform and Language Support</a> (above),the following changes have been made to ease the deployment of WebObjectsapplications:</p><ul><li>Web server adaptors can now get their configurationinformation from a file on the local machine, a file on anothermachine running a web server, from <code>wotaskd</code> (the replacementfor MonitorProxy), or from other machines on the subnet running WebObjectsvia a new multicast mechanism.</li><li>Many of the responsibilities formerly assumed by Monitor arenow handled by <code>wotaskd</code> (eachhost involved in a WebObjects deployment now runs <code>wotaskd</code>).Monitor now simply changes settings in your deployment environment.</li></ul><br><a name = "TP503500823"></a><h3>Profiling and TuningApplications</h3><p>WebObjects 4.5 provides many new features to help you profileapplications, decrease their memory usage, and increase their speed.This section provides an overview of the features and tells youwhere to go for more information.</p><br><a name = "TP503500824"></a><h4>Profiling</h4><p>WebObjects 4.5 introduces a new feature to help you profileyour applications. event logging. A new event logging system recordsand displays how long certain operations in an application take.The measurements allow you to profile an application and optimize itsexecution time. For this, the EOF and WebObjects frameworks instrumentkey portions of their code to measure the elapsed time of functionsand methods. You can instrument key portions of your code as well.To learn how to use this feature, see <a href="EOF.html#CBGCFGEE">"Event Logging" </a> in the chapter  <a href="EOF.html#CBGHIHIB">What's New in Enterprise Objects Framework</a>.</p><br><a name = "TP503500825"></a><h4>Tuning</h4><p>There are many new features to help tune your application.They are:</p><ul><li>Object sharing<br><br>	EOF 4.5 introduces a newtechnique for sharing read-only enterprise objects. The new subclassof EOEditingContext, EOSharedEditingContext, defines a mechanismthat allows editing contexts to share enterprise objects for reading.This mechanism can reduce both the number of fetches an applicationmakes and the amount of redundant data it requires. See the section  <a href="EOF.html#CBGCHAIA">"Object Sharing" </a> in the chapter  <a href="EOF.html#CBGHIHIB">What's New in Enterprise Objects Framework</a>.<br><br></li><li>Subclassing EOGenericRecord<br><br>	EOF 4.5 adds a new optionfor creating custom enterprise objects: rather than creating a subclassof EOCustomObject (Java) or NSObject (Objective-C), you can nowsubclass EOGenericRecord.<br><br>	This feature is most significantin applications that use the Java bridge. By default, a subclassof EOGenericRecord stores its properties in a dictionary on theObjective-C side of the bridge instead of in individual instancevariables on the Java side. This allows EOF to access enterpriseobject properties with many fewer trips across the bridge, whichreduces memory usage and improves performance.<br><br>	See thesection  <a href="EOF.html#CBGDJHCD">"Subclassing EOGenericRecord" </a> inthe chapter  <a href="EOF.html#CBGHIHIB">What's New in Enterprise Objects Framework</a>.<br><br></li><li>Deferred faulting<br><br>	EOF uses faults as stand-ins for objectswhose data has not yet been fetched. Although fault creation ismuch faster than fetching, fault instantiation still takes time.To improve performance, EOF 4.5 has the ability to use <b>deferredfaults</b> (which are more efficient) for enterprise objectclasses that enable the feature. See the section  <a href="EOF.html#CBGBFBJB">"Deferred Faulting" </a> inthe chapter  <a href="EOF.html#CBGHIHIB">What's New in Enterprise Objects Framework</a>.<br><br></li><li>Snapshot reference counting<br><br>	This is a new feature thatremoves snapshots from an EODatabase when they are no longer usedby any enterprise objects in an application. This feature reducesthe memory footprint of WebObjects applications. See the section  <a href="EOF.html#CBGDABII">"Snapshot Reference Counting" </a> in the chapter  <a href="EOF.html#CBGHIHIB">What's New in Enterprise Objects Framework</a>.</li></ul><br><a name = "TP503500826"></a><h3>Tools Improvements</h3><ul><li>WebObjects Builder's user interface has beensignificantly enhanced and should now be even easier to use. Seethe chapter  <a href="WOTools.html#BBHFAEAG">"WebObjects Tools Changes" </a>.</li><li>EOModeler supports synchronization of a database schema withthe current state of a model. See the section  <a href="EOF.html#CBGBIECE">"Schema Synchronization" </a> in chapter  <a href="EOF.html#CBGHIHIB">What's New in Enterprise Objects Framework</a>.</li></ul><br><a name = "TP503500827"></a><h3>Object Modeling Improvements</h3><p>EOF 4.5 adds the following features that improve object modeling:</p><ul><li>Better handling of missing faults<br><br>	When afault fires but doesn't have a corresponding row in the database,an exception isn't automatically thrown. An exception is thrownonly if the application attempts to make changes to the missingfault. See  <a href="EOF.html#CBGCGEJG">"Handling Missing Faults" </a>.<br><br></li><li>Handling of ambiguous to-one relationships in Java<br><br>	Ifyou enable deferred faulting-a new feature in EOF 4.5-you canhave to-one relationships to non-leaf entities in an inheritancehierarchy. This arrangement was impossible without workarounds inearlier versions. See  <a href="EOF.html#CBGBFBJB">"Deferred Faulting" </a>.<br><br></li><li>Enterprise object classes are more flexible and easier tomaintain<br><br>	You can now subclass EOGenericRecord, which can benefitthe design of your enterprise objects. See  <a href="EOF.html#CBGDJHCD">"Subclassing EOGenericRecord" </a>.<br><br></li></ul><br><a name = "TP503500828"></a><h3>Managing Stale Data</h3><p>EOF 4.5 adds a snapshot timestamping feature to help you keepyour application's data fresh. It updates snapshots when fetchingand allows an editing context to request that the snapshots usedto build enterprise objects are no older than a particular timestamp.This has the effect of refreshing snapshots periodically, keepingthe application's view more up-to-date with the database. See  <a href="EOF.html#CBGBBEEF">"Snapshot Timestamping" </a>.</p><br><a name = "TP503500829"></a><h3>Automatic DatabaseReconnection</h3><p>In EOF 4.5, a concrete adaptor can now implement methods thatcause EOF to automatically attempt to reconnect to a database serverwhen a connection is unexpectedly dropped. This behavior handlesthe problem of transient communication failures. By default reconnectionis attempted by all of the adaptors that ship with EOF 4.5. Seethe section  <a href="EOF.html#CBGCGIIG">"Automatic Database Reconnection" </a> inthe chapter  <a href="EOF.html#CBGHIHIB">What's New in Enterprise Objects Framework</a>.</p><br><a name = "TP503500830"></a><h3>Direct to Web</h3><p>Direct to Web now allows you to create your own visual styleand exposes a great deal of new API. For more information, see thesection  <a href="WOTools.html#BBHCDDDJ">"Direct to Web Changes" </a> inthe chapter  <a href="WOTools.html#BBHFAEAG">WebObjects Tools Changes</a>.</p><br><a name = "TP503500831"></a><h3>Java Client</h3><p>Java Client has been extended considerably, including thefollowing:</p><ul><li>The foundation layer (com.apple.client.foundation)contains a new number formatter based on NSNumberFormatter and addsan NSUndoManager class, which is analogous to the server side class.</li><li>The control layer (com.apple.client.eocontrol) is more complete.</li><li>The distribution layer (com.apple.client.eodistribution onthe client side and com.apple.yellow.eodistribution on the serverside) now provides support for encrypted client/server communicationand for managing user defaults.</li><li>The interface layer (com.apple.client.eointerface) adds supportfor table cell editing and for displaying images and QuickTime media.</li></ul><p>Additionally, Java Client now has a new user interface generationlayer, Direct to Java Client, which is comparable to WebObjects'Direct to Web.</p><p>For more information on changes to Java Client, see the chapter  <a href="Java_Client.html#BFJIIAJF">"What's New in Java Client" </a>.</p><br><a name = "TP503500832"></a><h3>LDAP Adaptor</h3><p>EOF 4.5 comes with a new sample adaptor: the LDAP adaptor.The adaptor provides a simple way to verify a user's passwordon the Web with an LDAP server. For more information, see the section  <a href="EOF.html#CBGBIBHF">"LDAP Adaptor Example" </a> in the chapter  <a href="EOF.html#CBGHIHIB">What's New in Enterprise Objects Framework</a>.</p><br><a href="NewInWebObjects.html"><img src="../../../../../images/up.gif" border="0" width="36" height="16"></A></A></a></BODY></HTML>
