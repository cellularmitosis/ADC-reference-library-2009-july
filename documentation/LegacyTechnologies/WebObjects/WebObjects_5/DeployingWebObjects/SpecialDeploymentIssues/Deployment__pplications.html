For moreinformation on Java Client applications see the WebObjects JavaClient documentation, available at www.apple.com/developer.</font></li></ul><p>There are two main issues that you should keep in mind whenyou deploy and administer Java Client applications:</p><ul><li><b>sessiontimeout</b><p>Java Client applications offer the useran interface that is very similar to the one offered by regulardesktop applications. Therefore, they expect Java Client applicationsto behave in a way similar to their desktop applications.</p><p>Oneof the main differences between a desktop application and a JavaClient application is that Java Client applications open a connectionto a server-side application. This connection expires after a certainperiod of inactivity. By default, the timeout period is 30 minutes.This may not be enough time for an application user that launchesthe application, goes to lunch, and returns to work 45 minutes later.When the user tries to use the application (which is still runningon her computer), she will see a dialog that indicates that hersession has timed out. In addition, any changes that were not savedare lost.</p></font></li><li><b>traffic level</b><p>In HTML-based applications,the packets sent between the Web browser and the Web server tendto be large. However, the size of the packets doesn't vary much(the server always sends the entire page to the browser). In JavaClient applications, the packets sent by the server during applicationstartup can be large (the entire application or part of it is downloaded);subsequent packets are relatively small (user-entered data and searchresults, for example).</p></font></li></ul><br>    <br><a href="Special_Deployment_Issues.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/previous.gif" border="0"></a><a href="Deploying_W_pplications.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/next.gif" border="0"></a>&nbsp;<br><hr><p><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">&#169; 2001 Apple Computer, Inc.
