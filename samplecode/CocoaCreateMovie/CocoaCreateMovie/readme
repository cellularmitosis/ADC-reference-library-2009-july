READ ME - COCOACREATEMOVIEThis sample demonstrates how to create a QuickTime movie from a set of Cocoa jpeg NSImage objects. Specifically, the movie video track is built from the images. This is accomplished by creating a QuickDraw GWorld, copying the raw jpeg data from the NSImage into the GWorld, re-compressing the data using the QuickTime CompressImage function, and adding it to the video track of the movie. We use the NSBitmapImageRep -bitmapData method to access the raw jpeg NSImage data. The 24-bit image data is simply copied into the 32-bit GWorld (with zeros for the alpha component). Finally, the resulting movie is displayed in a window using the NSMovieView.REQUIREMENTSProject Builder v1.0.1Mac OS X 10.0
