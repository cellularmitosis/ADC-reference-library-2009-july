Why Was This Archived?This sample was archived because no one really understands the point of it.  Moreover, PBAllocate is not a very useful system call, as explained by a current File Manager engineer:>I rarely use Allocate because the space it>reserves for a file is only reserved until the file is>flushed, closed, or the volume is flushed. SetEOF allocates>space the same way as Allocate, but since EOF is changed to>include the allocated space, it can't be taken back.>>AllocContig is little different because it either allocates>contiguous or fails. Where I use AllocContig, I immediately>follow up with a SetEOF to grab the space -- hopefully>before something calls FlushVolAsync (the window is rather>small).Quinn "The Eskimo!"Worldwide Developer Technical Support18 Jun 1999
