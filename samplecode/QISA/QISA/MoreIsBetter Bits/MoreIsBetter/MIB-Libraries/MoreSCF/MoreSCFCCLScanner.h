Also made changes to support building with CFM, even on Mac OS 9.  The algorithm to scan for CCLs is the same on 9 vs X, so we might as well use the same code.Revision 1.2  2002/11/09 00:00:52  eskimo1Added compile time environment check. When using framework includes, explicitly include the frameworks we need. Convert nil to NULL.Revision 1.1  2002/01/16 22:52:26  eskimo1First checked in.*/#pragma once/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// MoreIsBetter Setup#include "MoreSetup.h"// System prototypes#if MORE_FRAMEWORK_INCLUDES	#include <CoreServices/CoreServices.h>#else	#include <CFArray.h>#endif/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////#ifdef __cplusplusextern "C" {#endif/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////extern pascal OSStatus MoreSCCreateCCLArray(CFArrayRef *result, CFIndex *indexOfDefaultCCL);	// Creates a CFArray containing a sorted list of CCL (modem script) 	// names.
