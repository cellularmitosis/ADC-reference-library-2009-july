README - SOUNDCONVERTERSoundConverter a very simple application that shows how to use the Sound Converter API and how to place audio data in a movie. The destination format parameters are hard coded in this sample.SoundConverter simply creates some uncompressed data (a sine wave at the pitch convert A), converts it to the hard-coded format (which can be any audio format supported by QuickTime 4.0 and Sound Manager 3.4), and places the data in a movie.Enjoy, QuickTime Team
