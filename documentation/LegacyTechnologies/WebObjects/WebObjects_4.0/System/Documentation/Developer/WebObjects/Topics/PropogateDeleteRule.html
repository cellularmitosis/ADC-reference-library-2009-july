EOModeler allows the user to set the delete rules for a relationship in the advanced relationship inspector. The different delete rules are discussed here.</P>

Nullify Delete Rule</H4>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId=606106">
 </A>
When the object is deleted and one of the relationships has a nullify delete rule, EOF traverses through the object graph to the relationship object(s) and sets any back pointer to the deleted object to nil. For example, if a department has employees, the employees relationship in the department has a nullify delete rule, and the department is deleted, EOF removes any back pointer from the employee(s) to the department.</P>

Cascade Delete Rule</H4>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId=606114">
 </A>
When the parent object is deleted, EOF deletes all the objects at the end of a relationship with the cascade delete rule. For example, a department has employees. If the department's employee relationship's delete rule is set as a cascade delete and the department object is deleted, it also deletes the employee objects.</P>

Deny Delete Rule</H4>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId=606123">

EOF will refuse to delete an object, that has an object at the other end of a relationship with the deny delete rule. For example, the department cannot be deleted if there are employees in the department.</P>

No Action Delete Rule</H4>

<A NAME="pgfId=606132">
 </A>
When the parent object is deleted, it does not do any checks to the objects at the other end of a relationship with the no action delete rule. Referring to the department/employee example, when the department is deleted, the employees are left with back pointers pointing to the nonexistent department.</P>
