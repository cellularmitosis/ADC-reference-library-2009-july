/*								OriginalSCSI.c									*//* * OriginalSCSI.c * Copyright © 1992-93 Apple Computer Inc. All Rights Reserved. * * Talk to the Macintosh SCSI Handler using the "old" interface as defined in * Inside Mac IV. This is a synchronous call that executes a single SCSI Command * on a device. It does not support multiple busses or logical units. * * Calling Sequence: *		OSErr				OriginalSCSI( *				short					targetID, *				const SCSI_CommandPtr	scsiCommand, *				unsigned short			cmdBlockLength, *				Boolean					writeToDevice, *				Ptr						bufferPtr, *				unsigned long			transferSize, *				unsigned long			transferQuantum, *				unsigned long			completionTimeout, *				unsigned short			*stsBytePtr, *				unsigned long			*actualTransferCount *			); * The parameters have the following meaning: * *	targetID			The SCSI Bus ID of the target (0 .. 6). Note that this *						function can only access LUN zero. *	scsiCommand			The SCSI Command Block (6, 10, or 12 bytes). The command *						block length will be determined by examining the command *						parameter. This is standardized for all but *						"vendor-specific" commands. *	writeToDevice		TRUE if this command writes to the device. FALSE if this *						command reads from the device or does not require a data *						phase. *	bufferPtr			The user data buffer for Read/Write commands. It should be *						NULL if a data transfer phase is not used for this command. *						(e.g. for Test Unit Ready). *	transferSize		The total number of bytes to transfer to or from the device. *	transferQuantum		This is needed to configure the transfer information block *						(TIB). The following values are appropriate: *						-- Set to zero for a one-shot blind transfer. *							ActualTransferCount is not correctly returned. *						-- Set to one if a polled transfer is needed. This is *							useful for Request Sense or other management requests, *							especially requests with a variable-length record. On *							return, the actual number of bytes that were transferred *							will be in the actualTransferCount variable. *						-- Set to the transferSize value for a normal, "Blind" *							transfer. This is the normal case for data requests. *							ActualTransferCount will equal transferSize on success, *							but does not correctly return the actual count on phase *							errors. This, however, can be recovered from the Request *							Sense record. *						-- Set to a sub-multiple (such as a block length) for *							requests that need re-synchronization between sectors. *						-- Other values will likely result in errors. *	completionTimeout	The timeout (in Ticks) for the command. This should be short *						for disks, but must be long for tape devices and some setup *						requests, such as Mode Select. *	stsBytePtr			This short is set to the byte returned in the device's *						Status Phase. *	actualTransferCount	This will be set to the number of "cycles" through the TIB *						loop times the transferCount. This should equal the number *						of bytes transferred if transferCount is set to one. *						(Ignored if NULL.) * Return codes: *	noErr			normal *	scCommErr		no such device (selection error) *	scPhaseErr		user data buffer was the wrong size for the transfer. *					Look at the status byte to see if this is a problem:  *					you may merely have given a large buffer size to *					a variable-length request, such as Device Inquiry. *	sc...			other SCSI error. *	statusErr		Device returned "Check condition." The caller should *					issue a Request Sense SCSI Command to this device. *	controlErr		Device returned "Busy" *	ioErr			Other (serious) device status. The caller should *					examine the Status and Message bytes to determine *					the problem. *	paramErr		Could not determine the command length. */#include <scsi.h>#include <Errors.h>#include <GestaltEqu.h>#include <Memory.h>#include <Events.h>#include "MacSCSICommand.h"#ifndef TRUE#define FALSE		0#define TRUE		1#endif/* * Execute a SCSI command using the original (Inside Mac IV) SCSI Manager. * Return codes: * *	noErr			normal *	paramErr		could not determine command length from command *	scCommErr		could not select this device or bus busy *	sc...			other scsi error *	statusErr		Device returned "Check condition" *	controlErr		Device returned "Busy" (Note: device error) *	ioErr			Other (serious) device status -- bug. */OSErr						OriginalSCSI(		short					targetID,			/* Device ID on this bus	*/		const SCSI_CommandPtr	scsiCommand,		/* The actual scsi command	*/		unsigned short			cmdBlockLength,		/* -> Length of CDB			*/		Boolean					writeToDevice,		/* TRUE to write			*/		Ptr						bufferPtr,			/* -> user data buffer		*/		unsigned long			transferSize,		/* How much to transfer		*/		unsigned long			transferQuantum,	/* TIB setup parameter		*/		unsigned long			completionTimeout,	/* Ticks to wait			*/		unsigned short			*stsBytePtr,		/* <- status phase byte		*/		unsigned long			*actualTransferCount	);/* * SCSI command status (from status phase) */#define	 kScsiStatusGood			0x00			/* Normal completion		*/#define	 kScsiStatusCheckCondition	0x02			/* Need GetExtendedStatus	*/#define	 kScsiStatusConditionMet	0x04			/* For Compare Command?		*/#define	 kScsiStatusBusy			0x08			/* Device busy (self-test?)	*/#define	 kScsiStatusIntermediate	0x10			/* Intermediate status		*/#define	 kScsiStatusResConflict		0x18			/* Reservation conflict		*/#define	 kScsiStatusQueueFull		0x28			/* Target can't do command	*/#define	 kScsiStatusReservedMask	0x3e			/* Vendor specific?			*//* * This is the maximum number of times we try to grab the SCSI Bus */#define kMaxSCSIRetries				40				/* 10 seconds, 4 times/sec	*//* * This test is TRUE if the SCSI bus status indicates "busy" (which is the case * if either the BSY or SEL bit is set). */#ifndef kScsiStatBSY#define kScsiStatBSY				(1 << 6)#endif#ifndef kScsiStatSEL#define kScsiStatSEL				(1 << 1)#endif#define ScsiBusBusy()		((SCSIStat() & (kScsiStatBSY | kScsiStatSEL)) != 0)static void		NextFunction(void);		/* Dummy function for OriginalSCSI size	*/static Boolean	IsVirtualMemoryRunning(void);/* * These are bitmasks for the vmHoldMask variable.
