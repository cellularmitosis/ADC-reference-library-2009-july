PERL584DELTA(1)                       Perl Programmers Reference Guide                       PERL584DELTA(1)



<b>NAME</b>
       perl584delta - what is new for perl v5.8.4

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       This document describes differences between the 5.8.3 release and the 5.8.4 release.

<b>Incompatible</b> <b>Changes</b>
       Many minor bugs have been fixed. Scripts which happen to rely on previously erroneous behaviour will
       consider these fixes as incompatible changes :-) You are advised to perform sufficient acceptance
       testing on this release to satisfy yourself that this does not affect you, before putting this
       release into production.

       The diagnostic output of Carp has been changed slightly, to add a space after the comma between argu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ments.&nbsp;arguments.</font>
       ments. This makes it much easier for tools such as web browsers to wrap it, but might confuse any
       automatic tools which perform detailed parsing of Carp output.

       The internal dump output has been improved, so that non-printable characters such as newline and
       backspace are output in "\x" notation, rather than octal. This might just confuse non-robust tools
       which parse the output of modules such as Devel::Peek.

<b>Core</b> <b>Enhancements</b>
       <b>Malloc</b> <b>wrapping</b>

       Perl can now be built to detect attempts to assign pathologically large chunks of memory.  Previously
       such assignments would suffer from integer wrap-around during size calculations causing a misalloca-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion,&nbsp;misallocation,</font>
       tion, which would crash perl, and could theoretically be used for "stack smashing" attacks.  The
       wrapping defaults to enabled on platforms where we know it works (most AIX configurations, BSDi, Dar-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">win,&nbsp;Darwin,</font>
       win, DEC OSF/1, FreeBSD, HP/UX, GNU Linux, OpenBSD, Solaris, VMS and most Win32 compilers) and
       defaults to disabled on other platforms.

       <b>Unicode</b> <b>Character</b> <b>Database</b> <b>4.0.1</b>

       The copy of the Unicode Character Database included in Perl 5.8 has been updated to 4.0.1 from 4.0.0.

       <b>suidperl</b> <b>less</b> <b>insecure</b>

       Paul Szabo has analysed and patched "suidperl" to remove existing known insecurities. Currently there
       are no known holes in "suidperl", but previous experience shows that we cannot be confident that
       these were the last. You may no longer invoke the set uid perl directly, so to preserve backwards
       compatibility with scripts that invoke #!/usr/bin/suidperl the only set uid binary is now
       "sperl5.8."<u>n</u> ("sperl5.8.4" for this release). "suidperl" is installed as a hard link to "perl"; both
       "suidperl" and "perl" will invoke "sperl5.8.4" automatically the set uid binary, so this change
       should be completely transparent.

       For new projects the core perl team would strongly recommend that you use dedicated, single purpose
       security tools such as "sudo" in preference to "suidperl".

       <b>format</b>

       In addition to bug fixes, "format"'s features have been enhanced. See perlform

<b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b>
       The (mis)use of "/tmp" in core modules and documentation has been tidied up.  Some modules available
       both within the perl core and independently from CPAN ("dual-life modules") have not yet had these
       changes applied; the changes will be integrated into future stable perl releases as the modules are
       updated on CPAN.

       <b>Updated</b> <b>modules</b>


       Attribute::Handlers
       B
       Benchmark
       CGI
       Carp
       Cwd
       Exporter
       File::Find
       IO
       IPC::Open3
       Local::Maketext

       ODBM_File
       POSIX
       Shell
       Socket
           There is experimental support for Linux abstract Unix domain sockets.

       Storable
       Switch
           Synced with its CPAN version 2.10

       Sys::Syslog
           "syslog()" can now use numeric constants for facility names and priorities, in addition to
           strings.

       Term::ANSIColor
       Time::HiRes
       Unicode::UCD
       Win32
           Win32.pm/Win32.xs has moved from the libwin32 module to core Perl

       base
       open
       threads
           Detached threads are now also supported on Windows.

       utf8

<b>Performance</b> <b>Enhancements</b>
          Accelerated Unicode case mappings ("/i", "lc", "uc", etc).

          In place sort optimised (eg "@a = sort @a")

          Unnecessary assignment optimised away in

             my $s = undef;
             my @a = ();
             my %h = ();

          Optimised "map" in scalar context

<b>Utility</b> <b>Changes</b>
       The Perl debugger (<u>lib/perl5db.pl</u>) can now save all debugger commands for sourcing later, and can
       display the parent inheritance tree of a given class.

<b>Installation</b> <b>and</b> <b>Configuration</b> <b>Improvements</b>
       The build process on both VMS and Windows has had several minor improvements made. On Windows Bor-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">land's&nbsp;Borland's</font>
       land's C compiler can now compile perl with PerlIO and/or USE_LARGE_FILES enabled.

       "perl.exe" on Windows now has a "Camel" logo icon. The use of a camel with the topic of Perl is a
       trademark of O'Reilly and Associates Inc., and is used with their permission (ie distribution of the
       source, compiling a Windows executable from it, and using that executable locally). Use of the sup-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">plied&nbsp;supplied</font>
       plied camel for anything other than a perl executable's icon is specifically not covered, and anyone
       wishing to redistribute perl binaries <u>with</u> the icon should check directly with O'Reilly beforehand.

       Perl should build cleanly on Stratus VOS once more.

<b>Selected</b> <b>Bug</b> <b>Fixes</b>
       More utf8 bugs fixed, notably in how "chomp", "chop", "send", and "syswrite" and interact with utf8
       data. Concatenation now works correctly when "use bytes;" is in scope.

       Pragmata are now correctly propagated into (?{...}) constructions in regexps.  Code such as

          my $x = qr{ ... (??{ $x }) ... };

       will now (correctly) fail under use strict. (As the inner $x is and has always referred to $::x)

       The "const in void context" warning has been suppressed for a constant in an optimised-away boolean
       expression such as "5 || print;"

       "perl -i" could "fchmod(stdin)" by mistake. This is serious if stdin is attached to a terminal, and
       perl is running as root. Now fixed.

<b>New</b> <b>or</b> <b>Changed</b> <b>Diagnostics</b>
       "Carp" and the internal diagnostic routines used by "Devel::Peek" have been made clearer, as
       described in "Incompatible Changes"

<b>Changed</b> <b>Internals</b>
       Some bugs have been fixed in the hash internals. Restricted hashes and their place holders are now
       allocated and deleted at slightly different times, but this should not be visible to user code.

<b>Future</b> <b>Directions</b>
       Code freeze for the next maintenance release (5.8.5) will be on 30th June 2004, with release by mid
       July.

<b>Platform</b> <b>Specific</b> <b>Problems</b>
       This release is known not to build on Windows 95.

<b>Reporting</b> <b>Bugs</b>
       If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently posted to the
       comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at <a href="http://bugs.perl.org">http://bugs.perl.org</a>  There may also be
       information at <a href="http://www.perl.org">http://www.perl.org</a> the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the <b>perlbug</b> program included with your release.
       Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
       output of "perl -V", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.
       You can browse and search the Perl 5 bugs at <a href="http://bugs.perl.org/">http://bugs.perl.org/</a>
