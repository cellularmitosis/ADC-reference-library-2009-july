<b>NAME</b>
       zshbuiltins - zsh built-in commands

<b>SHELL</b> <b>BUILTIN</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       <b>-</b> <u>simple</u> <u>command</u>
              See the section `Precommand Modifiers'.

       <b>.</b> <u>file</u> [ <u>arg</u> ... ]
              Read commands from <u>file</u> and execute them in the current shell environment.

              If <u>file</u> does not contain a slash, or if <b>PATH_DIRS</b> is set, the shell looks in the components of
              <b>$path</b> to find the directory containing <u>file</u>.  Files in the  current  directory  are  not  read
              unless  `<b>.</b>'  appears  somewhere  in <b>$path</b>.  If a file named `<u>file</u><b>.zwc</b>' is found, is newer than
              <u>file</u>, and is the compiled form (created with the <b>zcompile</b> builtin) of <u>file</u>, then commands  are
              read from that file instead of <u>file</u>.

              If  any  arguments  <u>arg</u>  are  given, they become the positional parameters; the old positional
              parameters are restored when the <u>file</u> is done executing.  The exit status is the  exit  status
              of the last command executed.

       <b>:</b> [ <u>arg</u> ... ]
              This  command  does  nothing,  although normal argument expansions is performed which may have
              effects on shell parameters.  A zero exit status is returned.

       <b>alias</b> [ {<b>+|-}gmrsL</b> <b>]</b> <b>[</b> <u>name</u><b>[=</b><u>value</u><b>]</b> <b>...</b> <b>]</b>
              For each <u>name</u> with a corresponding <u>value</u>, define an alias with that value.  A  trailing  space
              in  <u>value</u>  causes the next word to be checked for alias expansion.  If the <b>-g</b> flag is present,
              define a global alias; global aliases are expanded even if they do not occur in command  posi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion.&nbsp;position.</font>
              tion.

              If the <b>-s</b> flags is present, define a suffix alias: if the command word on a command line is in
              the form `<u>text</u><b>.</b><u>name</u>', where <u>text</u> is any non-empty string, it is replaced by  the  text  `<u>value</u>
              <u>text</u><b>.</b><u>name</u>'.   Note  that <u>name</u> is treated as a literal string, not a pattern.  A trailing space
              in <u>value</u> is not special in this case.  For example,

                     <b>alias</b> <b>-s</b> <b>ps=gv</b>

              will cause the command `<b>*.ps</b>' to be expanded to `<b>gv</b> <b>*.ps</b>'.  As alias expansion is carried  out
              earlier  than globbing, the `<b>*.ps</b>' will then be expanded.  Suffix aliases constitute a differ-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ent&nbsp;different</font>
              ent name space from other aliases (so in the above example it is still possible to  create  an
              alias for the command <b>ps</b>) and the two sets are never listed together.

              For  each  <u>name</u>  with no <u>value</u>, print the value of <u>name</u>, if any.  With no arguments, print all
              currently defined aliases other than suffix aliases.  If the <b>-m</b> flag is  given  the  arguments
              are  taken  as patterns (they should be quoted to preserve them from being interpreted as glob
              patterns), and the aliases matching these patterns are printed.  When printing aliases and one
              of  the  <b>-g</b>,  <b>-r</b>  or  <b>-s</b>  flags is present, restrict the printing to global, regular or suffix
              aliases, respectively; a regular alias is one which is neither a global nor  a  suffix  alias.
              Using  `<b>+</b>' instead of `<b>-</b>', or ending the option list with a single `<b>+</b>', prevents the values of
              the aliases from being printed.

              If the <b>-L</b> flag is present, then print each alias in a manner suitable for putting in a startup
              script.   The exit status is nonzero if a <u>name</u> (with no <u>value</u>) is given for which no alias has
              been defined.

       <b>autoload</b> [ {<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>}<b>UXktz</b> ] [ <b>-w</b> ] [ <u>name</u> ... ]
              Equivalent to <b>functions</b> <b>-u</b>, with the exception of <b>-X</b>/<b>+X</b> and <b>-w</b>.

              The flag <b>-X</b> may be used only inside a shell function, and may not be followed by a  <u>name</u>.   It
              causes  the calling function to be marked for autoloading and then immediately loaded and exe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cuted,&nbsp;executed,</font>
              cuted, with the current array of positional parameters as arguments.  This replaces the previ-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ous&nbsp;previous</font>
              ous  definition  of the function.  If no function definition is found, an error is printed and
              the function remains undefined and marked for autoloading.

              The flag <b>+X</b> attempts to load each <u>name</u> as an autoloaded function, but  does  <u>not</u>  execute  it.
              The  exit status is zero (success) if the function was not previously defined <u>and</u> a definition
              for it was found.  This does <u>not</u> replace any existing definition of the  function.   The  exit
              status  is  nonzero  (failure)  if  the function was already defined or when no definition was
              found.  In the latter case the function remains undefined  and  marked  for  autoloading.   If
              ksh-style  autoloading  is enabled, the function created will contain the contents of the file
              plus a call to the function itself appended to it, thus giving normal ksh  autoloading  behav-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">iour&nbsp;behaviour</font>
              iour on the first call to the function.

              With  the  <b>-w</b>  flag, the <u>name</u>s are taken as names of files compiled with the <b>zcompile</b> builtin,
              and all functions defined in them are marked for autoloading.

       <b>bg</b> [ <u>job</u> ... ]
       <u>job</u> ... <b>&amp;</b>
              Put each specified <u>job</u> in the background, or the current job if none is specified.

       <b>bindkey</b>
              See the section `Zle Builtins' in <a href="zshzle.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/zshzle"><u>zshzle</u>(1)</a>.

       <b>break</b> [ <u>n</u> ]
              Exit from an enclosing <b>for</b>, <b>while</b>, <b>until</b>, <b>select</b> or <b>repeat</b> loop.   If  <u>n</u>  is  specified,  then
              break <u>n</u> levels instead of just one.

       <b>builtin</b> <u>name</u> [ <u>args</u> ... ]
              Executes the builtin <u>name</u>, with the given <u>args</u>.

       <b>bye</b>    Same as <b>exit</b>.

       <b>cap</b>    See the section `The zsh/cap Module' in <a href="zshmodules.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/zshmodules"><u>zshmodules</u>(1)</a>.

       <b>cd</b> [ <b>-sLP</b> ] [ <u>arg</u> ]
       <b>cd</b> [ <b>-sLP</b> ] <u>old</u> <u>new</u>
       <b>cd</b> [ <b>-sLP</b> ] {<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>}<u>n</u>
              Change  the  current directory.  In the first form, change the current directory to <u>arg</u>, or to
              the value of <b>$HOME</b> if <u>arg</u> is not specified.  If <u>arg</u> is `<b>-</b>', change to the  value  of  <b>$OLDPWD</b>,
              the previous directory.

              Otherwise, if <u>arg</u> begins with a slash, attempt to change to the director given by <u>arg</u>.

              If <u>arg</u> does not begin with a slash, the behaviour depends on whether the current directory `<b>.</b>'
              occurs in the list of directories contained in the shell parameter <b>cdpath</b>.  If  it  does  not,
              first  attempt  to  change to the directory <u>arg</u> under the current directory, and if that fails
              but <b>cdpath</b> is set and contains at least one element attempt to change  to  the  directory  <u>arg</u>
              under each component of <b>cdpath</b> in turn until successful.  If `<b>.</b>' occurs in <b>cdpath</b>, then <b>cdpath</b>
              is searched strictly in order so that `<b>.</b>' is only tried at the appropriate point.

              If no directory is found, the option <b>CDABLE_VARS</b> is set, and  a  parameter  named  <u>arg</u>  exists
              whose  value begins with a slash, treat its value as the directory.  In that case, the parame-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ter&nbsp;parameter</font>
              ter is added to the named directory hash table.

              The second form of <b>cd</b> substitutes the string <u>new</u> for the string <u>old</u> in the name of the current
              directory, and tries to change to this new directory.

              The  third  form  of <b>cd</b> extracts an entry from the directory stack, and changes to that direc-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tory.&nbsp;directory.</font>
              tory.  An argument of the form `<b>+</b><u>n</u>' identifies a stack entry by counting from the left of  the
              list  shown by the <b>dirs</b> command, starting with zero.  An argument of the form `<b>-</b><u>n</u>' counts from
              the right.  If the <b>PUSHD_MINUS</b> option is set, the meanings of `<b>+</b>' and `<b>-</b>' in this context  are
              swapped.

              If  the  <b>-s</b> option is specified, <b>cd</b> refuses to change the current directory if the given path-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">name&nbsp;pathname</font>
              name contains symlinks.  If the <b>-P</b> option is given or the <b>CHASE_LINKS</b> option is set,  symbolic
              links  are  resolved  to their true values.  If the <b>-L</b> option is given symbolic links are fol-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lowed&nbsp;followed</font>
              lowed regardless of the state of the <b>CHASE_LINKS</b> option.

       <b>chdir</b>  Same as <b>cd</b>.

       <b>clone</b>  See the section `The zsh/clone Module' in <a href="zshmodules.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/zshmodules"><u>zshmodules</u>(1)</a>.

       <b>command</b> [ <b>-pvV</b> ] <u>simple</u> <u>command</u>
              The simple command argument is taken as an external command instead of a function  or  builtin
              and  is executed. If the <b>POSIX_BUILTINS</b> option is set, builtins will also be executed but cer-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tain&nbsp;certain</font>
              tain special properties of them are suppressed. The <b>-p</b>  flag  causes  a  default  path  to  be
              searched instead of that in <b>$path</b>. With the <b>-v</b> flag, <b>command</b> is similar to <b>whence</b> and with <b>-V</b>,
              it is equivalent to <b>whence</b> <b>-v</b>.

              See also the section `Precommand Modifiers'.

       <b>continue</b> [ <u>n</u> ]
              Resume the next iteration of the enclosing <b>for</b>, <b>while</b>, <b>until</b>, <b>select</b> or <b>repeat</b> loop.  If <u>n</u>  is
              specified, break out of <u>n</u>-1 loops and resume at the <u>n</u>th enclosing loop.

       <b>declare</b>
              Same as <b>typeset</b>.

       <b>dirs</b> [ <b>-c</b> ] [ <u>arg</u> ... ]
       <b>dirs</b> [ <b>-lpv</b> ]
              With  no  arguments, print the contents of the directory stack.  Directories are added to this
              stack with the <b>pushd</b> command, and removed with the <b>cd</b> or  <b>popd</b>  commands.   If  arguments  are
              specified, load them onto the directory stack, replacing anything that was there, and push the
              current directory onto the stack.

              <b>-c</b>     clear the directory stack.

              <b>-l</b>     print directory names in full instead of using of using <b>~</b> expressions.

              <b>-p</b>     print directory entries one per line.

              <b>-v</b>     number the directories in the stack when printing.


       <b>disable</b> [ <b>-afmrs</b> ] <u>name</u> ...
              Temporarily disable the <u>name</u>d hash table elements.  The default is  to  disable  builtin  com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mands.&nbsp;commands.</font>
              mands.   This  allows  you to use an external command with the same name as a builtin command.
              The <b>-a</b> option causes <b>disable</b> to act on regular or global aliases.  The <b>-s</b> option  causes  <b>dis</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able&nbsp;disable</font>
              <b>able</b>  to  act on suffix aliases.  The <b>-f</b> option causes <b>disable</b> to act on shell functions.  The
              <b>-r</b> options causes <b>disable</b> to act on reserved words.  Without arguments all disabled hash table
              elements  from  the  corresponding hash table are printed.  With the <b>-m</b> flag the arguments are
              taken as patterns (which should be quoted to prevent them from undergoing filename expansion),
              and all hash table elements from the corresponding hash table matching these patterns are dis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">abled.&nbsp;disabled.</font>
              abled.  Disabled objects can be enabled with the <b>enable</b> command.

       <b>disown</b> [ <u>job</u> ... ]
       <u>job</u> ... <b>&amp;|</b>
       <u>job</u> ... <b>&amp;!</b>
              Remove the specified <u>job</u>s from the job table; the shell will no longer  report  their  status,
              and  will  not  complain if you try to exit an interactive shell with them running or stopped.
              If no <u>job</u> is specified, disown the current job.

              If the <u>job</u>s are currently stopped and the <b>AUTO_CONTINUE</b>  option  is  not  set,  a  warning  is
              printed  containing  information about how to make them running after they have been disowned.
              If one of the latter two forms is used, the <u>job</u>s will automatically be made running,  indepen-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dent&nbsp;independent</font>
              dent of the setting of the <b>AUTO_CONTINUE</b> option.

       <b>echo</b> [ <b>-neE</b> ] [ <u>arg</u> ... ]
              Write  each  <u>arg</u>  on the standard output, with a space separating each one.  If the <b>-n</b> flag is
              not present, print a newline at the end.  <b>echo</b> recognizes the following escape sequences:

              <b>\a</b>     bell character
              <b>\b</b>     backspace
              <b>\c</b>     suppress final newline
              <b>\e</b>     escape
              <b>\f</b>     form feed
              <b>\n</b>     linefeed (newline)
              <b>\r</b>     carriage return
              <b>\t</b>     horizontal tab
              <b>\v</b>     vertical tab
              <b>\\</b>     backslash
              <b>\0</b><u>NNN</u>  character code in octal
              <b>\x</b><u>NN</u>   character code in hexadecimal
              <b>\u</b><u>NNNN</u> unicode character code in hexadecimal

              The <b>-E</b> flag, or the <b>BSD_ECHO</b> option, can be used to disable these escape  sequences.   In  the

       <b>emulate</b> [ <b>-LR</b> ] {<b>zsh</b>|<b>sh</b>|<b>ksh</b>|<b>csh</b>}
              Set  up  zsh  options  to  emulate the specified shell as much as possible.  <b>csh</b> will never be
              fully emulated.  If the argument is not one of the shells listed above, <b>zsh</b> will be used as  a
              default;  more  precisely,  the  tests performed on the argument are the same as those used to
              determine the emulation at startup based on the shell name, see the section `Compatibility' in
              <a href="zshmisc.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/zshmisc"><u>zshmisc</u>(1)</a>  .   If the <b>-R</b> option is given, all options are reset to their default value corre-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sponding&nbsp;corresponding</font>
              sponding to the specified emulation mode, except for certain options describing  the  interac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tive&nbsp;interactive</font>
              tive  environment;  otherwise,  only  those  options  likely  to cause portability problems in
              scripts and functions are altered.  If the <b>-L</b> option is given, the options  <b>LOCAL_OPTIONS</b>  and
              <b>LOCAL_TRAPS</b> will be set as well, causing the effects of the <b>emulate</b> command and any <b>setopt</b> and
              <b>trap</b> commands to be local to the immediately surrounding  shell  function,  if  any;  normally
              these options are turned off in all emulation modes except <b>ksh</b>.

       <b>enable</b> [ <b>-afmrs</b> ] <u>name</u> ...
              Enable  the  <u>name</u>d hash table elements, presumably disabled earlier with <b>disable</b>.  The default
              is to enable builtin commands.  The <b>-a</b> option causes  <b>enable</b>  to  act  on  regular  or  global
              aliases.   The  <b>-s</b> option causes <b>enable</b> to act on suffix aliases.  The <b>-f</b> option causes <b>enable</b>
              to act on shell functions.  The <b>-r</b> option causes <b>enable</b> to act  on  reserved  words.   Without
              arguments all enabled hash table elements from the corresponding hash table are printed.  With
              the <b>-m</b> flag the arguments are taken as patterns (should be quoted) and all hash table elements
              from the corresponding hash table matching these patterns are enabled.  Enabled objects can be
              disabled with the <b>disable</b> builtin command.

       <b>eval</b> [ <u>arg</u> ... ]
              Read the arguments as input to the shell and execute the  resulting  command  in  the  current
              shell process.

       <b>exec</b> <u>simple</u> <u>command</u>
              See the section `Precommand Modifiers'.

       <b>exit</b> [ <u>n</u> ]
              Exit  the shell with the exit status specified by <u>n</u>; if none is specified, use the exit status
              from the last command executed.  An EOF condition will also cause the shell  to  exit,  unless
              the <b>IGNORE_EOF</b> option is set.

       <b>export</b> [ <u>name</u>[<b>=</b><u>value</u>] ... ]
              The  specified  <u>name</u>s  are marked for automatic export to the environment of subsequently exe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cuted&nbsp;executed</font>
              cuted commands.  Equivalent to <b>typeset</b> <b>-gx</b>.  If a parameter specified does not already  exist,
              it is created in the global scope.

       <b>false</b> [ <u>arg</u> ... ]
              Do nothing and return an exit status of 1.

       <b>fc</b> [ <b>-e</b> <u>ename</u> ] [ <b>-nlrdDfEim</b> ] [ <u>old</u><b>=</b><u>new</u> ... ] [ <u>first</u> [ <u>last</u> ] ]
       <b>fc</b> <b>-p</b> [ <b>-a</b> ] [ <u>filename</u> [ <u>histsize</u> [ <u>savehistsize</u> ] ] ]
       <b>fc</b> <b>-P</b>
       <b>fc</b> <b>-ARWI</b> [ <u>filename</u> ]
              Select  a range of commands from <u>first</u> to <u>last</u> from the history list.  The arguments <u>first</u> and
              <u>last</u> may be specified as a number or as a string.  A negative number is used as an  offset  to
              the current history event number.  A string specifies the most recent event beginning with the
              given string.  All substitutions <u>old</u><b>=</b><u>new</u>, if any, are then performed on the commands.

              If the <b>-l</b> flag is given, the resulting commands are listed on standard output.  If the <b>-m</b> flag
              is also given the first argument is taken as a pattern (should be quoted) and only the history
              events matching this pattern will be shown.  Otherwise the editor program <u>ename</u> is invoked  on
              a  file  containing  these  history events.  If <u>ename</u> is not given, the value of the parameter
              <b>FCEDIT</b> is used; if that is not set the value of the parameter <b>EDITOR</b> is used; if that  is  not
              set  a  builtin  default,  usually `<b>vi</b>' is used.  If <u>ename</u> is `<b>-</b>', no editor is invoked.  When
              editing is complete, the edited command is executed.

              If <u>first</u> is not specified, it will be set to -1 (the most recent event), or to -16 if  the  <b>-l</b>
              flag  is given.  If <u>last</u> is not specified, it will be set to <u>first</u>, or to -1 if the <b>-l</b> flag is
              given.

              The flag <b>-r</b> reverses the order of the commands and the flag <b>-n</b> suppresses command numbers when
              listing.   Also  when  listing,  <b>-d</b>  prints  timestamps  for  each command, and <b>-f</b> prints full
              time-date stamps.  Adding the <b>-E</b> flag causes the dates to be printed as `<u>dd</u><b>.</b><u>mm</u><b>.</b><u>yyyy</u>',  instead
              of  the  default  `<u>mm</u><b>/</b><u>dd</u><b>/</b><u>yyyy</u>'.   Adding the <b>-i</b> flag causes the dates to be printed in ISO8601
              `<u>yyyy</u><b>-</b><u>mm</u><b>-</b><u>dd</u>' format.  With the <b>-D</b> flag, <b>fc</b> prints elapsed times.


              `<b>fc</b> <b>-p</b>' pushes the current history list onto a stack and switches to a new history  list.   If
              the  <b>-a</b> option is also specified, this history list will be automatically popped when the cur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rent&nbsp;current</font>
              rent function scope is exited, which is a much better solution than creating a  trap  function
              to  call  `<b>fc</b>  <b>-P</b>'  manually.   If no arguments are specified, the history list is left empty,
              <b>$HISTFILE</b> is unset, and <b>$HISTSIZE</b> &amp; <b>$SAVEHIST</b> are set to their default values.  If  one  argu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment&nbsp;argument</font>
              ment  is  given,  <b>$HISTFILE</b> is set to that filename, <b>$HISTSIZE</b> &amp; <b>$SAVEHIST</b> are left unchanged,
              and the history file is read in (if it exists) to initialize the new list.  If a second  argu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment&nbsp;argument</font>
              ment  is  specified,  <b>$HISTSIZE</b>  &amp;  <b>$SAVEHIST</b>  are instead set to the single specified numeric
              value.  Finally, if a third argument is specified, <b>$SAVEHIST</b> is set to a separate  value  from
              <b>$HISTSIZE</b>.   You  are free to change these environment values for the new history list however
              you desire in order to manipulate the new history list.

              `<b>fc</b> <b>-P</b>' pops the history list back to an older list saved by `<b>fc</b> <b>-p</b>'.   The  current  list  is
              saved  to  its <b>$HISTFILE</b> before it is destroyed (assuming that <b>$HISTFILE</b> and <b>$SAVEHIST</b> are set
              appropriately, of course).  The values of <b>$HISTFILE</b>, <b>$HISTSIZE</b>, and <b>$SAVEHIST</b> are restored  to
              the  values  they  had  when `<b>fc</b> <b>-p</b>' was called.  Note that this restoration can conflict with
              making these variables "local", so your best bet is to  avoid  local  declarations  for  these
              variables in functions that use `<b>fc</b> <b>-p</b>'.  The one other guaranteed-safe combination is declar-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;declaring</font>
              ing these variables to be local at the top of your function and  using  the  automatic  option
              (<b>-a</b>) with `<b>fc</b> <b>-p</b>'.  Finally, note that it is legal to manually pop a push marked for automatic
              popping if you need to do so before the function exits.

              `<b>fc</b> <b>-R</b>' reads the history from the given file, `<b>fc</b> <b>-W</b>' writes the history  out  to  the  given
              file, and `<b>fc</b> <b>-A</b>' appends the history out to the given file.  If no filename is specified, the
              <b>$HISTFILE</b> is assumed.  If the <b>-I</b> option is added to <b>-R</b>, only those events that are not already
              contained  within the internal history list are added.  If the <b>-I</b> option is added to <b>-A</b> or <b>-W</b>,
              only those events that are new since last incremental append/write to  the  history  file  are
              appended/written.  In any case, the created file will have no more than <b>$SAVEHIST</b> entries.

       <b>fg</b> [ <u>job</u> ... ]
       <u>job</u> ...
              Bring  each  specified <u>job</u> in turn to the foreground.  If no <u>job</u> is specified, resume the cur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rent&nbsp;current</font>
              rent job.

       <b>float</b> [ {<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>}<b>EFHghlprtux</b> ] [ <b>-LRZ</b> [ <u>n</u> ]] [ <u>name</u>[<b>=</b><u>value</u>] ... ]
              Equivalent to <b>typeset</b> <b>-E</b>, except that options irrelevant to floating  point  numbers  are  not
              permitted.

       <b>functions</b> [ {<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>}<b>UXkmtuz</b> ] [ <u>name</u> ... ]
       <b>functions</b> <b>-M</b> <u>mathfn</u> [ <u>min</u> [ <u>max</u> [ <u>shellfn</u> ] ] ]
       <b>functions</b> <b>-M</b> [ <b>-m</b> <u>pattern</u> ... ]
       <b>functions</b> <b>+M</b> [ <b>-m</b> ] <u>mathfn</u>
              Equivalent  to  <b>typeset</b> <b>-f</b>, with the exception of the <b>-M</b> option.  Use of the <b>-M</b> option may not
              be combined with any of the options handled by <b>typeset</b> <b>-f</b>.

              <b>functions</b> <b>-M</b> <u>mathfn</u> defines <u>mathfn</u> as the name of a mathematical function  recognised  in  all
              forms  of arithmetical expressions; see the section `Arithmetic Evaluation' in <a href="zshmisc.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/zshmisc"><u>zshmisc</u>(1)</a>.  By
              default <u>mathfn</u> may take any number of comma-separated arguments.  If <u>min</u>  is  given,  it  must
              have  exactly  <u>min</u>  args;  if <u>min</u> and <u>max</u> are both given, it must have at least <u>min</u> and and at
              most <u>max</u> args.  <u>max</u> may be -1 to indicate that there is no upper limit.

              By default the function is implemented by a shell function of the same  name;  if  <u>shellfn</u>  is
              specified  it gives the name of the corresponding shell function while <u>mathfn</u> remains the name
              used in arithmetical expressions.  The name of the function in <b>$0</b> is <u>mathfn</u>  (not  <u>shellfn</u>  as
              would usually be the case), provided the option <b>FUNCTION_ARGZERO</b> is in effect.  The positional
              parameters in the shell function correspond to the  arguments  of  the  mathematical  function
              call.   The  result  of  the  last arithmetical expression evaluated inside the shell function
              (even if it is a form that normally only returns a status) gives the result of the  mathemati-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cal&nbsp;mathematical</font>
              cal function.

              <b>functions</b>  <b>-M</b>  with  no  arguments lists all such user-defined functions in the same form as a
              definition.  With the additional option <b>-m</b> and a list of arguments, all functions whose <u>mathfn</u>
              matches one of the pattern arguments are listed.

              <b>function</b>  <b>+M</b>  removes  the  list  of mathematical functions; with the additional option <b>-m</b> the
              arguments are treated as patterns and all functions  whose  <b>mathfn</b>  matches  the  pattern  are
              removed.   Note  that the shell function implementing the behaviour is not removed (regardless
              of whether its name coincides with <b>mathfn</b>).

              For example, the following prints the cube of 3:

                     <b>zmath_cube()</b> <b>{</b> <b>((</b> <b>$1</b> <b>*</b> <b>$1</b> <b>*</b> <b>$1</b> <b>))</b> <b>}</b>
                     <b>functions</b> <b>-M</b> <b>cube</b> <b>1</b> <b>1</b> <b>zmath_cube</b>
                     <b>print</b> <b>$((</b> <!-- a --><b>cube(3)</b><!-- /a --><b></b> <b>))</b>

       <b>getcap</b> See the section `The zsh/cap Module' in <a href="zshmodules.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/zshmodules"><u>zshmodules</u>(1)</a>.

       <b>getln</b> [ <b>-AclneE</b> ] <u>name</u> ...
              Read the top value from the buffer stack and put it in the shell parameter  <b>name</b>.   Equivalent
              to <b>read</b> <b>-zr</b>.

       <b>getopts</b> <u>optstring</u> <u>name</u> [ <u>arg</u> ... ]
              Checks the <u>arg</u>s for legal options.  If the <u>arg</u>s are omitted, use the positional parameters.  A
              valid option argument begins with a `<b>+</b>' or a `<b>-</b>'.  An argument not beginning with a `<b>+</b>'  or  a
              `<b>-</b>', or the argument `<b>--</b>', ends the options.  Note that a single `<b>-</b>' is not considered a valid
              option argument.  <u>optstring</u> contains the letters that <b>getopts</b> recognizes.  If a letter is fol-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lowed&nbsp;followed</font>
              lowed  by  a  `<b>:</b>',  that option is expected to have an argument.  The options can be separated
              from the argument by blanks.

              Each time it is invoked, <b>getopts</b> places the option letter it  finds  in  the  shell  parameter
              <u>name</u>, prepended with a `<b>+</b>' when <u>arg</u> begins with a `<b>+</b>'.  The index of the next <u>arg</u> is stored in
              <b>OPTIND</b>.  The option argument, if any, is stored in <b>OPTARG</b>.

              The first option to be examined may be changed by explicitly assigning to <b>OPTIND</b>.  <b>OPTIND</b>  has
              an  initial value of <b>1</b>, and is normally reset to <b>1</b> upon exit from a shell function.  <b>OPTARG</b> is
              not reset and retains its value from the most recent call to <b>getopts</b>.  If either of <b>OPTIND</b>  or
              <b>OPTARG</b>  is explicitly unset, it remains unset, and the index or option argument is not stored.
              The option itself is still stored in <u>name</u> in this case.

              A leading `<b>:</b>' in <u>optstring</u> causes <b>getopts</b> to store the letter of any invalid option in <b>OPTARG</b>,
              and  to  set  <u>name</u>  to `<b>?</b>' for an unknown option and to `<b>:</b>' when a required option is missing.
              Otherwise, <b>getopts</b> sets <u>name</u> to `<b>?</b>' and prints an error message when  an  option  is  invalid.
              The exit status is nonzero when there are no more options.

       <b>hash</b> [ <b>-Ldfmrv</b> ] [ <u>name</u>[<b>=</b><u>value</u>] ] ...
              <b>hash</b>  can  be  used  to  directly modify the contents of the command hash table, and the named
              directory hash table.  Normally one would modify these tables by modifying one's <b>PATH</b> (for the
              command  hash table) or by creating appropriate shell parameters (for the named directory hash
              table).  The choice of hash table to work on is determined  by  the  <b>-d</b>  option;  without  the
              option  the  command hash table is used, and with the option the named directory hash table is
              used.

              Given no arguments, and neither the <b>-r</b> or <b>-f</b> options, the selected hash table will  be  listed
              in full.

              The  <b>-r</b>  option causes the selected hash table to be emptied.  It will be subsequently rebuilt
              in the normal fashion.  The <b>-f</b> option causes the selected hash table to be fully rebuilt imme-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">diately.&nbsp;immediately.</font>
              diately.  For the command hash table this hashes all the absolute directories in the <b>PATH</b>, and
              for the named directory hash table this adds all users' home directories.  These  two  options
              cannot be used with any arguments.

              The  <b>-m</b>  option  causes the arguments to be taken as patterns (which should be quoted) and the
              elements of the hash table matching those patterns are printed.  This is the only way to  dis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">play&nbsp;display</font>
              play a limited selection of hash table elements.

              For  each  <u>name</u> with a corresponding <u>value</u>, put `<u>name</u>' in the selected hash table, associating
              it with the pathname `<u>value</u>'.  In the command hash table, this means that whenever  `<u>name</u>'  is
              used  as  a command argument, the shell will try to execute the file given by `<u>value</u>'.  In the
              named directory hash table, this means that `<u>value</u>' may be referred to as `<b>~</b><u>name</u>'.

              For each <u>name</u> with no corresponding <u>value</u>, attempt to add <u>name</u> to  the  hash  table,  checking
              what  the  appropriate  <b>value</b>  is in the normal manner for that hash table.  If an appropriate
              <b>value</b> can't be found, then the hash table will be unchanged.

              The <b>-v</b> option causes hash table entries to be listed as they are added by explicit  specifica-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion.&nbsp;specification.</font>
              tion.  If has no effect if used with <b>-f</b>.

              If  the  <b>-L</b>  flag  is  present, then each hash table entry is printed in the form of a call to
              hash.

       <b>integer</b> [ {<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>}<b>Hghilprtux</b> ] [ <b>-LRZ</b> [ <u>n</u> ]] [ <u>name</u>[<b>=</b><u>value</u>] ... ]
              Equivalent to <b>typeset</b> <b>-i</b>, except that options irrelevant to integers are not permitted.

       <b>jobs</b> [ <b>-dlprs</b> ] [ <u>job</u> ... ]
       <b>jobs</b> <b>-Z</b> <u>string</u>
              Lists information about each given job, or all jobs if <u>job</u> is  omitted.   The  <b>-l</b>  flag  lists
              process  IDs,  and the <b>-p</b> flag lists process groups.  If the <b>-r</b> flag is specified only running
              jobs will be listed and if the <b>-s</b> flag is given only stopped jobs are shown.  If the  <b>-d</b>  flag
              is given, the directory from which the job was started (which may not be the current directory
              of the job) will also be shown.

              The <b>-Z</b> option replaces the shell's argument and environment space with the given string, trun-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cated&nbsp;truncated</font>
              cated  if  necessary to fit.  This will normally be visible in <b>ps</b> <a href="ps.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ps">(<u>ps</u>(1)</a>) listings.  This fea-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ture&nbsp;feature</font>

       <b>kill</b> <b>-l</b> [ <u>sig</u> ... ]
              Sends either <b>SIGTERM</b> or the specified signal to the given  jobs  or  processes.   Signals  are
              given  by  number  or by names, with or without the `<b>SIG</b>' prefix.  If the signal being sent is
              not `<b>KILL</b>' or `<b>CONT</b>', then the job will be sent a `<b>CONT</b>' signal if it is stopped.   The  argu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment&nbsp;argument</font>

              the signal is printed.

              On some systems, alternative signal names are allowed for a few signals.  Typical examples are
              <b>SIGCHLD</b> and <b>SIGCLD</b> or <b>SIGPOLL</b> and <b>SIGIO</b>, assuming they correspond to the same  signal  number.
              <b>kill</b>  <b>-l</b>  will  only list the preferred form, however <b>kill</b> <b>-l</b> <u>alt</u> will show if the alternative
              form corresponds to a signal number.  For example, under Linux <b>kill</b> <b>-l</b> <b>IO</b>  and  <b>kill</b>  <b>-l</b>  <b>POLL</b>
              both output 29, hence <b>kill</b> <b>-IO</b> and <b>kill</b> <b>-POLL</b> have the same effect.

              Many systems will allow process IDs to be negative to kill a process group or zero to kill the
              current process group.

       <b>let</b> <u>arg</u> ...
              Evaluate each <u>arg</u> as an arithmetic expression.  See the  section  `Arithmetic  Evaluation'  in
              <a href="zshmisc.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/zshmisc"><u>zshmisc</u>(1)</a>  for a description of arithmetic expressions.  The exit status is 0 if the value of
              the last expression is nonzero, and 1 otherwise.

       <b>limit</b> [ <b>-hs</b> ] [ <u>resource</u> [ <u>limit</u> ] ] ...
              Set or display resource limits.  Unless the <b>-s</b> flag is given, the limit applies only the chil-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dren&nbsp;children</font>
              dren of the shell.  If <b>-s</b> is given without other arguments, the resource limits of the current
              shell is set to the previously set resource limits of the children.

              If <u>limit</u> is not specified, print the current limit placed on <u>resource</u>, otherwise set the limit
              to  the specified value.  If the <b>-h</b> flag is given, use hard limits instead of soft limits.  If
              no <u>resource</u> is given, print all limits.

              When looping over multiple resources, the shell will abort immediately if it detects  a  badly
              formed  argument.   However, if it fails to set a limit for some other reason it will continue
              trying to set the remaining limits.

              <u>resource</u> can be one of:

              <b>addressspace</b>
                     Maximum amount of address space used.
              <b>aiomemorylocked</b>
                     Maximum amount of memory locked in RAM for AIO operations.
              <b>aiooperations</b>
                     Maximum number of AIO operations.
              <b>cachedthreads</b>
                     Maximum number of cached threads.
              <b>coredumpsize</b>
                     Maximum size of a core dump.
              <b>cputime</b>
                     Maximum CPU seconds per process.
              <b>datasize</b>
                     Maximum data size (including stack) for each process.
              <b>descriptors</b>
                     Maximum value for a file descriptor.
              <b>filesize</b>
                     Largest single file allowed.
              <b>maxproc</b>
                     Maximum number of processes.
              <b>maxpthreads</b>
                     Maximum number of threads per process.
              <b>memorylocked</b>
                     Maximum amount of memory locked in RAM.
              <b>memoryuse</b>
                     Maximum resident set size.
              <b>msgqueue</b>
                     Maximum number of bytes in POSIX message queues.
              <b>resident</b>
                     Maximum resident set size.
              <b>sigpending</b>
                     Maximum number of pending signals.
              <b>sockbufsize</b>
                     Maximum size of all socket buffers.
              <b>stacksize</b>
                     Maximum stack size for each process.
              <b>vmemorysize</b>
                     Maximum amount of virtual memory.

              Which of these resource limits are available depends on the system.  <u>resource</u> can be  abbrevi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ated&nbsp;abbreviated</font>
              ated  to  any unambiguous prefix.  It can also be an integer, which corresponds to the integer
              defined for the resource by the operating system.

              If argument corresponds to a number which is out of the range of the resources configured into
              the  shell,  the shell will try to read or write the limit anyway, and will report an error if
              this fails.  As the shell does not store such resources internally,  an  attempt  to  set  the
              limit will fail unless the <b>-s</b> option is present.

              <u>limit</u> is a number, with an optional scaling factor, as follows:

              <u>n</u><b>h</b>     hours
              <u>n</u><b>k</b>     kilobytes (default)
              <u>n</u><b>m</b>     megabytes or minutes
              [<u>mm</u><b>:</b>]<u>ss</u>
                     minutes and seconds

       <b>local</b> [ {<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>}<b>AEFHUahlprtux</b> ] [ <b>-LRZi</b> [ <u>n</u> ]] [ <u>name</u>[<b>=</b><u>value</u>] ] ...
              Same  as  <b>typeset</b>,  except that the options <b>-g</b>, and <b>-f</b> are not permitted.  In this case the <b>-x</b>
              option does not force the use of <b>-g</b>, i.e. exported variables will be local to functions.

       <b>log</b>    List all users currently logged in who are affected by the current setting of the <b>watch</b> param-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">eter.&nbsp;parameter.</font>
              eter.

       <b>logout</b> [ <u>n</u> ]
              Same as <b>exit</b>, except that it only works in a login shell.

       <b>noglob</b> <u>simple</u> <u>command</u>
              See the section `Precommand Modifiers'.

       <b>popd</b> [ {<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>}<u>n</u> ]
              Remove  an entry from the directory stack, and perform a <b>cd</b> to the new top directory.  With no
              argument, the current top entry is removed.  An argument of the form `<b>+</b><u>n</u>' identifies  a  stack
              entry by counting from the left of the list shown by the <b>dirs</b> command, starting with zero.  An
              argument of the form <b>-n</b> counts from the right.  If the <b>PUSHD_MINUS</b> option is set, the meanings
              of `<b>+</b>' and `<b>-</b>' in this context are swapped.

       <b>print</b> [ <b>-abcDilmnNoOpPrsz</b> ] [ <b>-u</b> <u>n</u> ] [ <b>-f</b> <u>format</u> ] [ <b>-C</b> <u>cols</u> ]
         [ <b>-R</b> [ <b>-en</b> ]] [ <u>arg</u> ... ]
              With  the `<b>-f</b>' option the arguments are printed as described by <b>printf</b>.  With no flags or with
              the flag `<b>-</b>', the arguments are printed on the standard output as described by <b>echo</b>, with  the
              following  differences:  the escape sequence `<b>\M-</b><u>x</u>' metafies the character <u>x</u> (sets the highest
              bit), `<b>\C-</b><u>x</u>' produces a control character (`<b>\C-@</b>' and  `<b>\C-?</b>'  give  the  characters  NUL  and
              delete),  and  `<b>\E</b>' is a synonym for `<b>\e</b>'.  Finally, if not in an escape sequence, `<b>\</b>' escapes
              the following character and is not printed.

              <b>-a</b>     Print arguments with the column incrementing first.  Only useful with  the  <b>-c</b>  and  <b>-C</b>
                     options.

              <b>-b</b>     Recognize all the escape sequences defined for the <b>bindkey</b> command, see <a href="zshzle.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/zshzle"><u>zshzle</u>(1)</a>.

              <b>-c</b>     Print  the  arguments  in columns.  Unless <b>-a</b> is also given, arguments are printed with
                     the row incrementing first.

              <b>-C</b> <u>cols</u>
                     Print the arguments in <u>cols</u> columns.  Unless <b>-a</b> is also given,  arguments  are  printed
                     with the row incrementing first.

              <b>-D</b>     Treat  the  arguments  as  directory  names,  replacing prefixes with <b>~</b> expressions, as
                     appropriate.

              <b>-i</b>     If given together with <b>-o</b> or <b>-O</b>, sorting is performed case-independently.

              <b>-l</b>     Print the arguments separated by newlines instead of spaces.

              <b>-m</b>     Take the first argument as a pattern (should be quoted), and remove it from  the  argu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment&nbsp;argument</font>
                     ment list together with subsequent arguments that do not match this pattern.

              <b>-n</b>     Do not add a newline to the output.

              <b>-N</b>     Print the arguments separated and terminated by nulls.

              <b>-o</b>     Print the arguments sorted in ascending order.

              <b>-O</b>     Print the arguments sorted in descending order.

              <b>-p</b>     Print the arguments to the input of the coprocess.

              <b>-P</b>     Perform prompt expansion (see <a href="zshmisc.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/zshmisc"><u>zshmisc</u>(1)</a>).

              <b>-r</b>     Ignore the escape conventions of <b>echo</b>.

              <b>-R</b>     Emulate  the  BSD  <b>echo</b>  command, which does not process escape sequences unless the <b>-e</b>
                     flag is given.  The <b>-n</b> flag suppresses the trailing newline.  Only the <b>-e</b> and <b>-n</b>  flags
                     are recognized after <b>-R</b>; all other arguments and options are printed.

              <b>-s</b>     Place the results in the history list instead of on the standard output.

              <b>-u</b> <u>n</u>   Print the arguments to file descriptor <u>n</u>.

              <b>-z</b>     Push the arguments onto the editing buffer stack, separated by spaces.

              If  any  of  `<b>-m</b>',  `<b>-o</b>'  or `<b>-O</b>' are used in combination with `<b>-f</b>' and there are no arguments
              (after the removal process in the case of `<b>-m</b>') then nothing is printed.

       <b>printf</b> <u>format</u> [ <u>arg</u> ... ]
              Print the arguments according to the format specification. Formatting rules are  the  same  as
              used  in  C. The same escape sequences as for <b>echo</b> are recognised in the format. All C conver-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion&nbsp;conversion</font>
              sion specifications ending in one of csdiouxXeEfgGn are handled. In addition to this, `<b>%b</b>' can
              be  used  instead  of `<b>%s</b>' to cause escape sequences in the argument to be recognised and `<b>%q</b>'
              can be used to quote the argument in such a way that allows it to be reused  as  shell  input.
              With  the numeric format specifiers, if the corresponding argument starts with a quote charac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ter,&nbsp;character,</font>
              ter, the numeric value of the following character is used as the number to print otherwise the
              argument  is evaluated as an arithmetic expression. See the section `Arithmetic Evaluation' in
              <a href="zshmisc.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/zshmisc"><u>zshmisc</u>(1)</a> for a description of arithmetic expressions. With `<b>%n</b>', the corresponding  argument
              is taken as an identifier which is created as an integer parameter.

              Normally, conversion specifications are applied to each argument in order but they can explic-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">itly&nbsp;explicitly</font>
              itly specify the <u>n</u>th argument is to be used by replacing `<b>%</b>' by `<b>%</b><u>n</u><b>$</b>' and `<b>*</b>' by `<b>*</b><u>n</u><b>$</b>'.  It is
              recommended  that  you  do not mix references of this explicit style with the normal style and
              the handling of such mixed styles may be subject to future change.

              If arguments remain unused after formatting, the format string is reused until  all  arguments
              have  been consumed. With the <b>print</b> builtin, this can be suppressed by using the <b>-r</b> option. If
              more arguments are required by the format than have been specified, the  behaviour  is  as  if
              zero or an empty string had been specified as the argument.

       <b>pushd</b> [ <b>-sLP</b> ] [ <u>arg</u> ]
       <b>pushd</b> [ <b>-sLP</b> ] <u>old</u> <u>new</u>
       <b>pushd</b> [ <b>-sLP</b> ] {<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>}<u>n</u>
              Change the current directory, and push the old current directory onto the directory stack.  In
              the first form, change the current directory to <u>arg</u>.  If <u>arg</u> is not specified, change  to  the
              second  directory  on the stack (that is, exchange the top two entries), or change to <b>$HOME</b> if
              the <b>PUSHD_TO_HOME</b> option is set or if there is only one entry on the stack.  Otherwise, <u>arg</u> is
              interpreted  as  it would be by <b>cd</b>.  The meaning of <u>old</u> and <u>new</u> in the second form is also the
              same as for <b>cd</b>.

              The third form of <b>pushd</b> changes directory by rotating the directory list.  An argument of  the
              form  `<b>+</b><u>n</u>'  identifies  a  stack entry by counting from the left of the list shown by the <b>dirs</b>
              command, starting with zero.  An argument of the form `<b>-</b><u>n</u>' counts  from  the  right.   If  the
              <b>PUSHD_MINUS</b> option is set, the meanings of `<b>+</b>' and `<b>-</b>' in this context are swapped.

              If  the  option  <b>PUSHD_SILENT</b> is not set, the directory stack will be printed after a <b>pushd</b> is
              performed.

              The options <b>-s</b>, <b>-L</b> and <b>-P</b> have the same meanings as for the <b>cd</b> builtin.

       <b>pushln</b> [ <u>arg</u> ... ]
              Equivalent to <b>print</b> <b>-nz</b>.

       <b>pwd</b> [ <b>-rLP</b> ]
              Print the absolute pathname of the current working directory.  If the <b>-r</b> or  the  <b>-P</b>  flag  is
              specified,  or  the  <b>CHASE_LINKS</b>  option is set and the <b>-L</b> flag is not given, the printed path
              will not contain symbolic links.

       <b>r</b>      Same as <b>fc</b> <b>-e</b> <b>-</b>.

       <b>read</b> [ <b>-rszpqAclneE</b> ] [ <b>-t</b> [ <u>num</u> ] ] [ <b>-k</b> [ <u>num</u> ] ] [ <b>-d</b> <u>delim</u> ]
        [ <b>-u</b> <u>n</u> ] [ <u>name</u>[<b>?</b><u>prompt</u>] ] [ <u>name</u> ...  ]
              Read one line and break it into fields using the characters in <b>$IFS</b> as separators,  except  as
              noted  below.   The  first field is assigned to the first <u>name</u>, the second field to the second
              <u>name</u>, etc., with leftover fields assigned to the last <u>name</u>.  If <u>name</u> is omitted then <b>REPLY</b>  is
              used for scalars and <b>reply</b> for arrays.

              <b>-r</b>     Raw mode: a `<b>\</b>' at the end of a line does not signify line continuation and backslashes
                     in the line don't quote the following character and are not removed.

              <b>-s</b>     Don't echo back characters if reading from the terminal.  Currently does not work  with
                     the <b>-q</b> option.

              <b>-q</b>     Read only one character from the terminal and set <u>name</u> to `<b>y</b>' if this character was `<b>y</b>'
                     or `<b>Y</b>' and to `<b>n</b>' otherwise.  With this flag set the return status is zero only if  the
                     character  was `<b>y</b>' or `<b>Y</b>'.  Note that this always reads from the terminal, even if used
                     with the <b>-p</b> or <b>-u</b> or <b>-z</b> flags or with redirected input.  This option may also  be  used
                     within zle widgets.

              <b>-k</b> [ <u>num</u> ]
                     Read  only  one  (or <u>num</u>) characters.  All are assigned to the first <u>name</u>, without word
                     splitting.  This flag is ignored when <b>-q</b> is present.  Input is read from  the  terminal
                     unless one of <b>-u</b> or <b>-p</b> is present.  This option may also be used within zle widgets.

                     Note  that  despite the mnemonic `key' this option does read full characters, which may
                     consist of multiple bytes if the option <b>MULTIBYTE</b> is set.

              <b>-z</b>     Read one entry from the editor buffer stack and assign it to the  first  <u>name</u>,  without
                     word  splitting.   Text is pushed onto the stack with `<b>print</b> <b>-z</b>' or with <b>push-line</b> from
                     the line editor (see <a href="zshzle.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/zshzle"><u>zshzle</u>(1)</a>).  This flag is ignored when the  <b>-k</b>  or  <b>-q</b>  flags  are
                     present.

              <b>-e</b>
              <b>-E</b>     The  input read is printed (echoed) to the standard output.  If the <b>-e</b> flag is used, no
                     input is assigned to the parameters.

              <b>-A</b>     The first <u>name</u> is taken as the name of an array and all words are assigned to it.

              <b>-c</b>
              <b>-l</b>     These flags are allowed only if called inside a function used for completion (specified
                     with  the  <b>-K</b> flag to <b>compctl</b>).  If the <b>-c</b> flag is given, the words of the current com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
                     mand are read. If the <b>-l</b> flag is given, the whole line is assigned  as  a  scalar.   If
                     both flags are present, <b>-l</b> is used and <b>-c</b> is ignored.

              <b>-n</b>     Together  with <b>-c</b>, the number of the word the cursor is on is read.  With <b>-l</b>, the index
                     of the character the cursor is on is read.  Note that the command name is  word  number
                     1,  not word 0, and that when the cursor is at the end of the line, its character index
                     is the length of the line plus one.

              <b>-u</b> <u>n</u>   Input is read from file descriptor <u>n</u>.

              <b>-p</b>     Input is read from the coprocess.

              <b>-d</b> <u>delim</u>
                     Input is terminated by the first character of <u>delim</u> instead of by newline.

              <b>-t</b> [ <u>num</u> ]
                     Test if input is available before attempting to read.  If <u>num</u> is present, it must begin
                     with a digit and will be evaluated to give a number of seconds, which may be a floating
                     point number; in this case the read times out if input is  not  available  within  this
                     time.   If <u>num</u> is not present, it is taken to be zero, so that <b>read</b> returns immediately
                     if no input is available.  If no input is available, return status 1 and do not set any
                     variables.

                     This  option  is not available when reading from the editor buffer with <b>-z</b>, when called
                     from within completion with <b>-c</b> or <b>-l</b>, with <b>-q</b> which clears the input queue before read-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing,&nbsp;reading,</font>
                     ing, or within zle where other mechanisms should be used to test for input.

                     Note  that  read does not attempt to alter the input processing mode.  The default mode
                     is canonical input, in which an entire line is read at a time,  so  usually  `<b>read</b>  <b>-t</b>'
                     will not read anything until an entire line has been typed.  However, when reading from
                     the terminal with <b>-k</b> input is processed one key at a time; in this  case,  only  avail-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ability&nbsp;availability</font>
                     ability  of  the first character is tested, so that e.g. `<b>read</b> <b>-t</b> <b>-k</b> <b>2</b>' can still block
                     on the second character.  Use two instances of `<b>read</b> <b>-t</b> <b>-k</b>' if  this  is  not  what  is
                     wanted.   If the first argument contains a `<b>?</b>', the remainder of this word is used as a
                     <u>prompt</u> on standard error when the shell is interactive.

              The value (exit status) of <b>read</b> is 1 when an end-of-file is encountered, or when <b>-c</b> or  <b>-l</b>  is
              present and the command is not called from a <b>compctl</b> function, or as described for <b>-q</b>.  Other-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">wise&nbsp;Otherwise</font>
              wise the value is 0.

              The behavior of some combinations of the <b>-k</b>, <b>-p</b>, <b>-q</b>, <b>-u</b> and <b>-z</b> flags is undefined.   Presently
              <b>-q</b>  cancels all the others, <b>-p</b> cancels <b>-u</b>, <b>-k</b> cancels <b>-z</b>, and otherwise <b>-z</b> cancels both <b>-p</b> and
              <b>-u</b>.

              The <b>-c</b> or <b>-l</b> flags cancel any and all of <b>-kpquz</b>.

       <b>readonly</b>
              Same as <b>typeset</b> <b>-r</b>.

       <b>rehash</b> Same as <b>hash</b> <b>-r</b>.

       <b>return</b> [ <u>n</u> ]
              Causes a shell function or <b>.</b> script to return to the invoking script with  the  return  status
              specified by <u>n</u>.  If <u>n</u> is omitted, the return status is that of the last command executed.

              If <b>return</b> was executed from a trap in a <b>TRAP</b><u>NAL</u> function, the effect is different for zero and
              non-zero return status.  With zero status (or after an implicit  return  at  the  end  of  the
              trap), the shell will return to whatever it was previously processing; with a non-zero status,
              the shell will behave as interrupted except that the return status of the  trap  is  retained.
              Note  that  the numeric value of the signal which caused the trap is passed as the first argu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment,&nbsp;argument,</font>
              ment, so the statement `<b>return</b> <b>$((128+$1))</b>' will return the same status as if the  signal  had
              not been trapped.

       <b>sched</b>  See the section `The zsh/sched Module' in <a href="zshmodules.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/zshmodules"><u>zshmodules</u>(1)</a>.

       <b>set</b> [ {<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>}<u>options</u> | {<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>}<b>o</b> [ <u>option</u><b>_</b><u>name</u> ] ] ... [ {<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>}<b>A</b> [ <u>name</u> ] ] [ <u>arg</u> ... ]
              Set  the  options  for  the  shell and/or set the positional parameters, or declare and set an
              array.  If the <b>-s</b> option is given, it causes the  specified  arguments  to  be  sorted  before
              assigning  them  to  the  positional parameters (or to the array <u>name</u> if <b>-A</b> is used).  With <b>+s</b>
              sort arguments in descending order.  For the meaning of the other  flags,  see  <a href="zshoptions.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/zshoptions"><u>zshoptions</u>(1)</a>.
              Flags may be specified by name using the <b>-o</b> option. If no option name is supplied with <b>-o</b>, the
              current option states are printed.  With <b>+o</b> they are printed in a form that  can  be  used  as
              input to the shell.

              If  the <b>-A</b> flag is specified, <u>name</u> is set to an array containing the given <u>arg</u>s; if no <u>name</u> is
              specified, all arrays are printed together with their values.

              If <b>+A</b> is used and <u>name</u> is an array, the given arguments will replace the initial  elements  of
              that array; if no <u>name</u> is specified, all arrays are printed without their values.

              The  behaviour  of arguments after <b>-A</b> <u>name</u> or <b>+A</b> <u>name</u> depends on whether the option <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b>
              is set.  If it is not set, all arguments following <u>name</u> are treated as values for  the  array,
              regardless  of  their  form.  If the option is set, normal option processing continues at that
              point; only regular arguments are treated as values for the array.  This means that

                     <b>set</b> <b>-A</b> <b>array</b> <b>-x</b> <b>--</b> <b>foo</b>

              sets <b>array</b> to `<b>-x</b> <b>--</b> <b>foo</b>' if <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b> is not set, but sets the array to <b>foo</b> and turns on the
              option `<b>-x</b>' if it is set.

              If  the  <b>-A</b>  flag  is  not present, but there are arguments beyond the options, the positional
              parameters are set.  If the option list (if any) is terminated by `<b>--</b>', and there are no  fur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ther&nbsp;further</font>
              ther arguments, the positional parameters will be unset.

              If no arguments and no `<b>--</b>' are given, then the names and values of all parameters are printed
              on the standard output.  If the only argument is `<b>+</b>', the names of all parameters are printed.

              For  historical reasons, `<b>set</b> <b>-</b>' is treated as `<b>set</b> <b>+xv</b>' and `<b>set</b> <b>-</b> <u>args</u>' as `<b>set</b> <b>+xv</b> <b>--</b> <u>args</u>'
              when in any other emulation mode than zsh's native mode.

       <b>setopt</b> [ {<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>}<u>options</u> | {<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>}<b>o</b> <u>option</u><b>_</b><u>name</u> ] [ <u>name</u> ... ]
              Set the options for the shell.  All options specified either with flags or by  name  are  set.
              If  no  arguments are supplied, the names of all options currently set are printed.  If the <b>-m</b>
              flag is given the arguments are taken as patterns (which should be quoted to protect them from
              filename expansion), and all options with names matching these patterns are set.

       <b>shift</b> [ <u>n</u> ] [ <u>name</u> ... ]
              The  positional  parameters <b>${</b><u>n</u>+1<b>}</b> ... are renamed to <b>$1</b> ..., where <u>n</u> is an arithmetic expres-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion&nbsp;expression</font>
              sion that defaults to 1.  If any <u>name</u>s are given then the arrays with these names are  shifted
              instead of the positional parameters.

       <b>source</b> <u>file</u> [ <u>arg</u> ... ]
              Same  as <b>.</b>, except that the current directory is always searched and is always searched first,

       <b>suspend</b> [ <b>-f</b> ]
              Suspend the execution of the shell (send it a <b>SIGTSTP</b>) until it receives  a  <b>SIGCONT</b>.   Unless
              the <b>-f</b> option is given, this will refuse to suspend a login shell.

              Like the system version of <b>test</b>.  Added for compatibility; use conditional expressions instead
              (see the section `Conditional Expressions').  The main  differences  between  the  conditional
              expression  syntax  and the <b>test</b> and <b>[</b> builtins are:  these commands are not handled syntacti-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cally,&nbsp;syntactically,</font>
              cally, so for example an empty variable expansion may cause an argument to be omitted;  syntax
              errors cause status 2 to be returned instead of a shell error; and arithmetic operators expect
              integer arguments rather than arithemetic expressions.

       <b>trap</b> [ <u>arg</u> ] [ <u>sig</u> ... ]
              <u>arg</u>  is  a  series  of commands (usually quoted to protect it from immediate evaluation by the
              shell) to be read and executed when the shell receives any of the signals specified by one  or
              more  <u>sig</u>  args.  Each <u>sig</u> can be given as a number, or as the name of a signal either with or
              without the string <b>SIG</b> in front (e.g. 1, HUP, and SIGHUP are all the same signal).

              If <u>arg</u> is `<b>-</b>', then the specified signals are reset to their defaults, or, if no <u>sig</u> args  are
              present, all traps are reset.

              If  <u>arg</u>  is  an  empty string, then the specified signals are ignored by the shell (and by the
              commands it invokes).

              If <u>arg</u> is omitted but one or more <u>sig</u> args are provided (i.e.  the first argument is  a  valid
              signal number or name), the effect is the same as if <u>arg</u> had been specified as `<b>-</b>'.

              The <b>trap</b> command with no arguments prints a list of commands associated with each signal.

              If  <u>sig</u>  is <b>ZERR</b> then <u>arg</u> will be executed after each command with a nonzero exit status.  <b>ERR</b>
              is an alias for <b>ZERR</b> on systems that have no <b>SIGERR</b> signal (this is the usual case).   If  <u>sig</u>
              is  <b>DEBUG</b>  then  <u>arg</u>  will  be  executed after each command.  If <u>sig</u> is <b>0</b> or <b>EXIT</b> and the <b>trap</b>
              statement is executed inside the body of a function, then the command <u>arg</u>  is  executed  after
              the  function  completes.  The value of <b>$?</b> at the start of execution is the exit status of the
              shell or the return status of the function exiting.  If <u>sig</u> is <b>0</b> or <b>EXIT</b> and the  <b>trap</b>  state-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment&nbsp;statement</font>
              ment  is not executed inside the body of a function, then the command <u>arg</u> is executed when the
              shell terminates.

              <b>ZERR</b>, <b>DEBUG</b>, and <b>EXIT</b> traps are not executed inside other traps.

              Note that traps defined with the <b>trap</b> builtin are slightly different  from  those  defined  as
              `<b>TRAP</b><u>NAL</u>  ()  { ... }', as the latter have their own function environment (line numbers, local
              variables, etc.) while the former use the environment  of  the  command  in  which  they  were
              called.  For example,

                     <b>trap</b> <b>'print</b> <b>$LINENO'</b> <b>DEBUG</b>

              will print the line number of a command executed after it has run, while

                     <b>TRAPDEBUG()</b> <b>{</b> <b>print</b> <b>$LINENO;</b> <b>}</b>

              will always print the number zero.

              Alternative  signal  names  are  allowed as described under <b>kill</b> above.  Defining a trap under
              either name causes any trap under an alternative name to be removed.  However,  it  is  recom-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mended&nbsp;recommended</font>
              mended that for consistency users stick exclusively to one name or another.

       <b>true</b> [ <u>arg</u> ... ]
              Do nothing and return an exit status of 0.

       <b>ttyctl</b> <b>-fu</b>
              The  <b>-f</b>  option freezes the tty, and <b>-u</b> unfreezes it.  When the tty is frozen, no changes made
              to the tty settings by external programs will be honored by the shell, except for  changes  in
              the  size  of the screen; the shell will simply reset the settings to their previous values as
              soon as each command exits or is suspended.  Thus, <b>stty</b> and similar programs  have  no  effect
              when the tty is frozen.  Without options it reports whether the terminal is frozen or not.

       <b>type</b> [ <b>-wfpams</b> ] <u>name</u> ...
              Equivalent to <b>whence</b> <b>-v</b>.

       <b>typeset</b> [ {<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>}<b>AEFHUafghklprtuxmz</b> ] [ <b>-LRZi</b> [ <u>n</u> ]] [ <u>name</u>[<b>=</b><u>value</u>] ... ]
       <b>typeset</b> -T [ {<b>+|-}Urux</b> <b>]</b> <b>[</b> <b>-LRZ</b> <b>[</b> <u>n</u> <b>]]</b> <u>SCALAR</u><b>[=</b><u>value</u><b>]</b> <u>array</u> <b>[</b> <u>sep</u> <b>]</b>
              Set or display attributes and values for shell parameters.

              A  parameter is created for each <u>name</u> that does not already refer to one.  When inside a func-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion,&nbsp;function,</font>
              tion, a new parameter is created for every <u>name</u> (even those that already exist), and is  unset
              again  when  the  function  completes.  See `Local Parameters' in <a href="zshparam.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/zshparam"><u>zshparam</u>(1)</a>.  The same rules
              apply to special shell parameters, which retain their special attributes when made local.

              For each <u>name</u><b>=</b><u>value</u> assignment, the parameter <u>name</u> is set to <u>value</u>.   Note  that  arrays  cur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rently&nbsp;currently</font>
              rently cannot be assigned in <b>typeset</b> expressions, only scalars and integers.

              If the shell option <b>TYPESET_SILENT</b> is not set, for each remaining <u>name</u> that refers to a param-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">eter&nbsp;parameter</font>
              eter that is set, the name and value of the parameter are printed in the form  of  an  assign-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment.&nbsp;assignment.</font>
              ment.   Nothing  is  printed  for newly-created parameters, or when any attribute flags listed
              below are given along with the <u>name</u>.  Using `<b>+</b>' instead of minus  to  introduce  an  attribute
              turns it off.

              If  the  <b>-p</b> option is given, parameters and values are printed in the form of a typeset comand
              and an assignment (which will be  printed  separately  for  arrays  and  associative  arrays),
              regardless  of  other flags and options.  Note that the <b>-h</b> flag on parameters is respected; no
              value will be shown for these parameters.

              If the <b>-T</b> option is given, two or three arguments must be present (an exception is  that  zero
              arguments  are allowed to show the list of parameters created in this fashion).  The first two
              are the name of a scalar and an array parameter (in that order) that will be tied together  in
              the  manner  of  <b>$PATH</b> and <b>$path</b>.  The optional third argument is a single-character separator
              which will be used to join the elements of the array to form the scalar; if absent, a colon is
              used,  as with <b>$PATH</b>.  Only the first character of the separator is significant; any remaining
              characters are ignored.  Only the scalar parameter may be assigned an initial value.  Both the
              scalar  and the array may otherwise be manipulated as normal.  If one is unset, the other will
              automatically be unset too.  There is no way of untying the variables without unsetting  them,
              or  converting the type of one of them with another <b>typeset</b> command; <b>+T</b> does not work, assign-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;assigning</font>
              ing an array to <u>SCALAR</u> is an error, and assigning a scalar to <u>array</u>  sets  it  to  be  a  sin-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">gle-element&nbsp;single-element</font>
              gle-element  array.   Note  that both `<b>typeset</b> <b>-xT</b> <b>...</b>' and `<b>export</b> <b>-T</b> <b>...</b>' work, but only the
              scalar will be marked for export.  Setting the value using the scalar version causes  a  split
              on all separators (which cannot be quoted).

              The  <b>-g</b>  (global) flag is treated specially: it means that any resulting parameter will not be
              restricted to local scope.  Note that this does not necessarily mean that the  parameter  will
              be  global, as the flag will apply to any existing parameter (even if unset) from an enclosing
              function.  This flag does not affect the parameter after creation, hence it has no effect when
              listing  existing  parameters, nor does the flag <b>+g</b> have any effect except in combination with
              <b>-m</b> (see below).

              If no <u>name</u> is present, the names and values of all parameters are printed.  In this  case  the
              attribute  flags  restrict  the  display  to  only  those  parameters  that have the specified
              attributes, and using `<b>+</b>' rather than `<b>-</b>' to introduce the flag  suppresses  printing  of  the
              values  of  parameters  when there is no parameter name.  Also, if the last option is the word
              `<b>+</b>', then names are printed but values are not.

              If the <b>-m</b> flag is given the <u>name</u> arguments are taken as patterns  (which  should  be  quoted).
              With  no  attribute  flags, all parameters (or functions with the <b>-f</b> flag) with matching names
              are printed (the shell option <b>TYPESET_SILENT</b> is not used in  this  case).   Note  that  <b>-m</b>  is
              ignored  if  no patterns are given.  If the <b>+g</b> flag is combined with <b>-m</b>, a new local parameter
              is created for every matching parameter that is not already local.  Otherwise <b>-m</b>  applies  all
              other  flags or assignments to the existing parameters.  Except when assignments are made with
              <u>name</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>, using <b>+m</b> forces the matching parameters to be printed, even inside a function.

              If no attribute flags are given and either no <b>-m</b> flag is present or the <b>+m</b> form was used, each
              parameter name printed is preceded by a list of the attributes of that parameter (<b>array</b>, <b>asso</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ciation,&nbsp;association,</font>
              <b>ciation</b>, <b>exported</b>, <b>integer</b>, <b>readonly</b>).  If <b>+m</b> is used with  attribute  flags,  and  all  those
              flags  are  introduced  with  <b>+</b>, the matching parameter names are printed but their values are
              not.

              The following attribute flags may be specified:

              <b>-A</b>     The names refer to associative array parameters; see `Array Parameters' in <a href="zshparam.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/zshparam"><u>zshparam</u>(1)</a>.

              <b>-L</b>     Left  justify  and  remove  leading blanks from <u>value</u>.  If <u>n</u> is nonzero, it defines the
                     width of the field.  If <u>n</u> is zero, the width is determined by the width of the value of
                     the  first  assignment.   In the case of numeric parameters, the length of the complete
                     value assigned to the parameter is used to determine the  width,  not  the  value  that
                     would be output.

                     The  width  is the count of characters, which may be multibyte characters if the <b>MULTI</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">BYTE&nbsp;MULTIBYTE</font>
                     <b>BYTE</b> option is in effect.  Note that the screen width of the  character  is  not  taken
                     into  account;  if  this  is  required,  use  padding  with  parameter  expansion flags
                     <b>${(ml</b><u>...</u><b>)</b><u>...</u><b>}</b> as described in `Parameter Expansion Flags' in <a href="zshexpn.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/zshexpn"><u>zshexpn</u>(1)</a>.

                     When the parameter is expanded, it is filled on the right with blanks or  truncated  if
                     necessary  to  fit  the  field.   Note  truncation  can lead to unexpected results with
                     numeric parameters.  Leading zeros are removed if the <b>-Z</b> flag is also set.

              <b>-R</b>     Similar to <b>-L</b>, except that right justification is used; when the parameter is expanded,
                     the  field  is  left filled with blanks or truncated from the end.  May not be combined
                     with the <b>-Z</b> flag.

              <b>-U</b>     For arrays (but not for associative arrays), keep only the  first  occurrence  of  each
                     duplicated  value.   This  may  also be set for colon-separated special parameters like
                     <b>PATH</b> or <b>FIGNORE</b>, etc.  This flag has a different meaning when used with <b>-f</b>; see  below.

              <b>-Z</b>     Specially handled if set along with the <b>-L</b> flag.  Otherwise, similar to <b>-R</b>, except that
                     leading zeros are used for padding instead of blanks if the first  non-blank  character
                     is  a  digit.   Numeric  parameters are specially handled: they are always eligible for
                     padding with zeroes, and the zeroes are inserted at an appropriate place in the output.

              <b>-a</b>     The  names  refer to array parameters.  An array parameter may be created this way, but
                     it may not be assigned to in the <b>typeset</b> statement.  When displaying, both  normal  and
                     associative arrays are shown.

              <b>-f</b>     The  names  refer to functions rather than parameters.  No assignments can be made, and
                     the only other valid flags are <b>-t</b>, <b>-k</b>, <b>-u</b>, <b>-U</b> and <b>-z</b>.  The flag <b>-t</b> turns  on  execution
                     tracing  for  this  function.   The <b>-u</b> and <b>-U</b> flags cause the function to be marked for
                     autoloading; <b>-U</b> also causes alias expansion to  be  suppressed  when  the  function  is
                     loaded.   The <b>fpath</b> parameter will be searched to find the function definition when the
                     function is first referenced; see the section `Functions'. The <b>-k</b> and <b>-z</b> flags make the
                     function be loaded using ksh-style or zsh-style autoloading respectively. If neither is
                     given, the setting of the KSH_AUTOLOAD option determines how the function is loaded.

              <b>-h</b>     Hide: only useful for special parameters (those marked  `&lt;S&gt;'  in  the  table  in  <a href="zshparam.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/zshparam"><u>zsh</u></a>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">param(1)),&nbsp;zshparam(1)),</font>
                     <a href="zshparam.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/zshparam"><u>param</u>(1)</a>),  and  for local parameters with the same name as a special parameter, though
                     harmless for others.  A special parameter with this attribute will not retain its  spe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cial&nbsp;special</font>
                     cial  effect  when  made  local.   Thus  after `<b>typeset</b> <b>-h</b> <b>PATH</b>', a function containing
                     `<b>typeset</b> <b>PATH</b>' will create an ordinary local parameter without the usual  behaviour  of
                     <b>PATH</b>.   Alternatively,  the  local  parameter may itself be given this attribute; hence
                     inside a function `<b>typeset</b> <b>-h</b> <b>PATH</b>' creates an ordinary local parameter and the special
                     <b>PATH</b> parameter is not altered in any way.  It is also possible to create a local param-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">eter&nbsp;parameter</font>
                     eter using `<b>typeset</b> <b>+h</b> <u>special</u>', where the local copy of <u>special</u> will retain  its  spe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cial&nbsp;special</font>
                     cial  properties  regardless  of  having  the  <b>-h</b> attribute.  Global special parameters
                     loaded from shell modules (currently those in <b>zsh/mapfile</b> and <b>zsh/parameter</b>) are  auto-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">matically&nbsp;automatically</font>
                     matically given the <b>-h</b> attribute to avoid name clashes.

              <b>-H</b>     Hide  value:  specifies  that  <b>typeset</b> will not display the value of the parameter when
                     listing parameters; the display for such parameters is always as if the  `<b>+</b>'  flag  had
                     been  given.  Use of the parameter is in other respects normal, and the option does not
                     apply if the parameter is specified by name, or by pattern with the <b>-m</b> option.  This is
                     on  by  default for the parameters in the <b>zsh/parameter</b> and <b>zsh/mapfile</b> modules.  Note,
                     however, that unlike the <b>-h</b> flag this is also useful for non-special parameters.

              <b>-i</b>     Use an internal integer representation.  If <u>n</u> is nonzero it defines the  output  arith-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">metic&nbsp;arithmetic</font>
                     metic base, otherwise it is determined by the first assignment.

              <b>-E</b>     Use an internal double-precision floating point representation.  On output the variable
                     will be converted to scientific notation.  If <u>n</u> is nonzero it  defines  the  number  of
                     significant figures to display; the default is ten.

              <b>-F</b>     Use an internal double-precision floating point representation.  On output the variable
                     will be converted to fixed-point decimal notation.  If <u>n</u> is nonzero it defines the num-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ber&nbsp;number</font>
                     ber of digits to display after the decimal point; the default is ten.

              <b>-l</b>     Convert  the result to lower case whenever the parameter is expanded.  The value is <u>not</u>
                     converted when assigned.

              <b>-r</b>     The given <u>name</u>s are marked readonly.  Note that if <u>name</u> is  a  special  parameter,  the
                     readonly attribute can be turned on, but cannot then be turned off.

              <b>-t</b>     Tags the named parameters.  Tags have no special meaning to the shell.  This flag has a
                     different meaning when used with <b>-f</b>; see above.

              <b>-u</b>     Convert the result to upper case whenever the parameter is expanded.  The value is  <u>not</u>
                     converted  when  assigned.   This  flag  has a different meaning when used with <b>-f</b>; see
                     above.

              <b>-x</b>     Mark for automatic export to the environment of subsequently executed commands.  If the
                     option  <b>GLOBAL_EXPORT</b>  is set, this implies the option <b>-g</b>, unless <b>+g</b> is also explicitly
                     given; in other words the parameter is not made local to the enclosing function.   This
                     is for compatibility with previous versions of zsh.

       <b>ulimit</b> [ [ <b>-SHacdfilmnpqstvx</b> | <b>-N</b> <u>resource</u> [ <u>limit</u> ] ... ]
              Set or display resource limits of the shell and the processes started by the shell.  The value
              of <u>limit</u> can be a number in the unit specified below or the value  `<b>unlimited</b>'.   By  default,
              only soft limits are manipulated. If the <b>-H</b> flag is given use hard limits instead of soft lim-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">its.&nbsp;limits.</font>
              its.  If the <b>-S</b> flag is given together with the <b>-H</b> flag set both hard and soft limits.  If  no
              options  are used, the file size limit (<b>-f</b>) is assumed.  If <u>limit</u> is omitted the current value
              of the specified resources are printed.  When more than one resource values  are  printed  the
              limit name and unit is printed before each value.

              When  looping  over multiple resources, the shell will abort immediately if it detects a badly
              formed argument.  However, if it fails to set a limit for some other reson  it  will  continue
              trying to set the remaining limits.

              <b>-a</b>     Lists all of the current resource limits.
              <b>-c</b>     512-byte blocks on the size of core dumps.
              <b>-d</b>     K-bytes on the size of the data segment.
              <b>-f</b>     512-byte blocks on the size of files written.
              <b>-i</b>     The number of pending signals.
              <b>-l</b>     K-bytes on the size of locked-in memory.
              <b>-m</b>     K-bytes on the size of physical memory.
              <b>-n</b>     open file descriptors.
              <b>-q</b>     Bytes in POSIX message queues.
              <b>-s</b>     K-bytes on the size of the stack.
              <b>-t</b>     CPU seconds to be used.
              <b>-u</b>     processes available to the user.
              <b>-v</b>     K-bytes on the size of virtual memory.  On some systems this refers to the limit called
                     `address space'.
              <b>-x</b>     The number of locks on files.

              A resource may also be specified by integer in the form `<b>-N</b> <u>resource</u>', where  <u>resource</u>  corre-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sponds&nbsp;corresponds</font>
              sponds  to  the integer defined for the resource by the operating system.  This may be used to
              set the limits for resources known to the shell which do not  correspond  to  option  letters.
              Such limits will be shown by number in the output of `<b>ulimit</b> <b>-a</b>'.

              The number may alternatively be out of the range of limits compiled into the shell.  The shell
              will try to read or write the limit anyway, and will report an error if this fails.

       <b>umask</b> [ <b>-S</b> ] [ <u>mask</u> ]
              The umask is set to <u>mask</u>.  <u>mask</u> can be either an octal number or a symbolic value as described
              in <a href="chmod.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/chmod"><u>chmod</u>(1)</a>.  If <u>mask</u> is omitted, the current value is printed.  The <b>-S</b> option causes the mask
              to be printed as a symbolic value.  Otherwise, the mask is printed as an octal  number.   Note
              that  in  the symbolic form the permissions you specify are those which are to be allowed (not
              denied) to the users specified.

       <b>unalias</b>
              Same as <b>unhash</b> <b>-a</b>.

       <b>unfunction</b>
              Same as <b>unhash</b> <b>-f</b>.

       <b>unhash</b> [ <b>-adfms</b> ] <u>name</u> ...
              Remove the element named <u>name</u> from an internal hash table.  The  default  is  remove  elements
              from the command hash table.  The <b>-a</b> option causes <b>unhash</b> to remove regular or global aliases.
              The <b>-s</b> option causes <b>unhash</b> to remove suffix aliases.  The <b>-f</b> option causes <b>unhash</b>  to  remove
              shell functions.  The <b>-d</b> options causes <b>unhash</b> to remove named directories.  If the <b>-m</b> flag is
              given the arguments are taken as patterns (should be quoted) and all elements  of  the  corre-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sponding&nbsp;corresponding</font>
              sponding hash table with matching names will be removed.

       <b>unlimit</b> [ <b>-hs</b> ] <u>resource</u> ...
              The  resource  limit  for each <u>resource</u> is set to the hard limit.  If the <b>-h</b> flag is given and
              the shell has appropriate privileges, the hard resource limit for each  <u>resource</u>  is  removed.
              The resources of the shell process are only changed if the <b>-s</b> flag is given.

       <b>unset</b> [ <b>-fmv</b> ] <u>name</u> ...
              Each named parameter is unset.  Local parameters remain local even if unset; they appear unset
              within scope, but the previous value will still reappear when the scope ends.

              Individual elements of associative array parameters may be unset by using subscript syntax  on
              <u>name</u>,  which should be quoted (or the entire command prefixed with <b>noglob</b>) to protect the sub-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">script&nbsp;subscript</font>
              script from filename generation.

              If the <b>-m</b> flag is specified the arguments are taken as patterns (should  be  quoted)  and  all
              parameters  with matching names are unset.  Note that this cannot be used when unsetting asso-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ciative&nbsp;associative</font>
              ciative array elements, as the subscript will be treated as part of the pattern.

              The <b>-v</b> flag specifies that <u>name</u> refers to parameters. This is the default behaviour.

              <b>unset</b> <b>-f</b> is equivalent to <b>unfunction</b>.

       <b>unsetopt</b> [ {<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>}<u>options</u> | {<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>}<b>o</b> <u>option</u><b>_</b><u>name</u> ] [ <u>name</u> ... ]
              Unset the options for the shell.  All options specified either  with  flags  or  by  name  are
              unset.   If  no  arguments are supplied, the names of all options currently unset are printed.
              If the <b>-m</b> flag is given the arguments are taken as patterns (which should be  quoted  to  pre-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">serve&nbsp;preserve</font>
              serve them from being interpreted as glob patterns), and all options with names matching these
              patterns are unset.

       <b>wait</b> [ <u>job</u> ... ]
              Wait for the specified jobs or processes.  If <u>job</u> is not given then all currently active child
              processes  are  waited for.  Each <u>job</u> can be either a job specification or the process ID of a
              job in the job table.  The exit status from this command is that of the job waited for.

       <b>whence</b> [ <b>-vcwfpams</b> ] <u>name</u> ...
              For each name, indicate how it would be interpreted if used as a command name.

              <b>-v</b>     Produce a more verbose report.

              <b>-c</b>     Print the results in a <b>csh</b>-like format.  This takes precedence over <b>-v</b>.

              <b>-w</b>     For each <u>name</u>, print `<u>name</u><b>:</b> <u>word</u>' where <u>word</u> is one of <b>alias</b>, <b>builtin</b>,  <b>command</b>,  <b>func</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion,&nbsp;function,</font>
                     <b>tion</b>,  <b>hashed</b>,  <b>reserved</b> or <b>none</b>, according as <u>name</u> corresponds to an alias, a built-in
                     command, an external command, a  shell  function,  a  command  defined  with  the  <b>hash</b>
                     builtin,  a reserved word, or is not recognised.  This takes precedence over <b>-v</b> and <b>-c</b>.

              <b>-f</b>     Causes the contents of a shell function to be displayed, which would otherwise not hap-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pen&nbsp;happen</font>
                     pen unless the <b>-c</b> flag were used.

              <b>-p</b>     Do  a  path  search  for  <u>name</u> even if it is an alias, reserved word, shell function or
                     builtin.

              <b>-a</b>     Do a search for all occurrences of <u>name</u> throughout the command path.  Normally only the
                     first occurrence is printed.

              <b>-m</b>     The  arguments  are  taken  as patterns (should be quoted), and the information is dis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">played&nbsp;displayed</font>

       <b>zcompile</b> [ <b>-U</b> ] [ <b>-z</b> | <b>-k</b> ] [ <b>-R</b> | <b>-M</b> ] <u>file</u> [ <u>name</u> ... ]
       <b>zcompile</b> <b>-ca</b> [ <b>-m</b> ] [ <b>-R</b> | <b>-M</b> ] <u>file</u> [ <u>name</u> ... ]
       <b>zcompile</b> <b>-t</b> <u>file</u> [ <u>name</u> ... ]
              This builtin command can be used to compile functions or scripts, storing the compiled form in
              a  file, and to examine files containing the compiled form.  This allows faster autoloading of
              functions and execution of scripts by avoiding parsing of the text when the files are read.

              The first form (without the <b>-c</b>, <b>-a</b> or <b>-t</b> options) creates a compiled file.  If only  the  <u>file</u>
              argument  is  given,  the  output  file has the name `<u>file</u><b>.zwc</b>' and will be placed in the same
              directory as the <u>file</u>.  The shell will load the compiled file instead of the  normal  function
              file  when  the  function is autoloaded; see the section `Autoloading Functions' in <!-- a --><u>zshfunc</u>(1)<!-- /a -->
              for a description of how autoloaded functions are searched.  The  extension  <b>.zwc</b>  stands  for
              `zsh word code'.

              If  there is at least one <u>name</u> argument, all the named files are compiled into the output <u>file</u>
              given as the first argument.  If <u>file</u> does not end in <b>.zwc</b>, this  extension  is  automatically
              appended.   Files  containing  multiple  compiled functions are called `digest' files, and are
              intended to be used as elements of the <b>FPATH</b>/<b>fpath</b> special array.

              The second form, with the <b>-c</b> or <b>-a</b> options, writes the compiled definitions for all the  named
              functions  into <u>file</u>.  For <b>-c</b>, the names must be functions currently defined in the shell, not
              those marked for autoloading.  Undefined functions that are  marked  for  autoloading  may  be
              written  by  using  the <b>-a</b> option, in which case the <b>fpath</b> is searched and the contents of the
              definition files for those functions, if found, are compiled into <u>file</u>.  If both <b>-c</b> and <b>-a</b> are
              given,  names of both defined functions and functions marked for autoloading may be given.  In
              either case, the functions in files written with the <b>-c</b> or <b>-a</b> option will be autoloaded as  if
              the <b>KSH_AUTOLOAD</b> option were unset.

              The  reason  for  handling  loaded and not-yet-loaded functions with different options is that
              some definition files for autoloading define multiple functions, including the  function  with
              the  same  name as the file, and, at the end, call that function.  In such cases the output of
              `<b>zcompile</b> <b>-c</b>' does not include the additional functions defined in the  file,  and  any  other
              initialization code in the file is lost.  Using `<b>zcompile</b> <b>-a</b>' captures all this extra informa-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion.&nbsp;information.</font>
              tion.

              If the <b>-m</b> option is combined with <b>-c</b> or <b>-a</b>, the <u>name</u>s are used as patterns and  all  functions
              whose  names match one of these patterns will be written. If no <u>name</u> is given, the definitions
              of all functions currently defined or marked as autoloaded will be written.

              The third form, with the <b>-t</b> option, examines an existing compiled file.  Without further argu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ments,&nbsp;arguments,</font>
              ments,  the names of the original files compiled into it are listed.  The first line of output
              shows the version of the shell which compiled the file and how the file will be used (i.e.  by
              reading  it directly or by mapping it into memory).  With arguments, nothing is output and the
              return status is set to zero if definitions for <u>all</u> <u>name</u>s were found in the compiled file, and
              non-zero if the definition for at least one <u>name</u> was not found.

              Other options:

              <b>-U</b>     Aliases are not expanded when compiling the <u>name</u>d files.

              <b>-R</b>     When the compiled file is read, its contents are copied into the shell's memory, rather
                     than memory-mapped (see <b>-M</b>).  This happens automatically on systems that do not support
                     memory mapping.

                     When  compiling scripts instead of autoloadable functions, it is often desirable to use
                     this option; otherwise the whole file, including the code  to  define  functions  which
                     have already been defined, will remain mapped, consequently wasting memory.

              <b>-M</b>     The  compiled  file is mapped into the shell's memory when read. This is done in such a
                     way that multiple instances of the shell running on  the  same  host  will  share  this
                     mapped  file.   If  neither <b>-R</b> nor <b>-M</b> is given, the <b>zcompile</b> builtin decides what to do
                     based on the size of the compiled file.

              <b>-k</b>
              <b>-z</b>     These options are used when the compiled  file  contains  functions  which  are  to  be
                     autoloaded.  If  <b>-z</b>  is  given,  the function will be autoloaded as if the <b>KSH_AUTOLOAD</b>
                     option is <u>not</u> set, even if it is set at the time the compiled file is  read,  while  if
                     the  <b>-k</b> is given, the function will be loaded as if <b>KSH_AUTOLOAD</b> <u>is</u> set.  These options
                     also take precedence over any <b>-k</b> or <b>-z</b> options specified to the  <b>autoload</b>  builtin.  If
                     neither  of  these  options  is given, the function will be loaded as determined by the
                     setting of the <b>KSH_AUTOLOAD</b> option at the time the compiled file is read.

                     These options may also appear as many times as necessary between the  listed  <u>name</u>s  to
                     specify the loading style of all following functions, up to the next <b>-k</b> or <b>-z</b>.

                     The  created  file  always  contains  two  versions  of  the  compiled  format, one for
                     big-endian machines and one for small-endian machines.  The upshot of this is that  the
                     compiled  file is machine independent and if it is read or mapped, only one half of the
                     file is actually used (and mapped).

       <b>zmodload</b> <b>-R</b> <u>modalias</u> ...
              Performs operations relating to zsh's loadable modules.  Loading of modules while the shell is
              running  (`dynamical  loading') is not available on all operating systems, or on all installa-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tions&nbsp;installations</font>
              tions on a particular operating system, although the <b>zmodload</b> command itself is always  avail-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able&nbsp;available</font>
              able and can be used to manipulate modules built into versions of the shell executable without
              dynamical loading.

              Without arguments the names of all currently loaded binary modules are printed.  The <b>-L</b> option
              causes  this  list  to  be in the form of a series of <b>zmodload</b> commands.  Forms with arguments
              are:

              <b>zmodload</b> [ <b>-i</b> ] <u>name</u> ...
              <b>zmodload</b> <b>-u</b> [ <b>-i</b> ] <u>name</u> ...
                     In the simplest case, <b>zmodload</b> loads a binary module.  The module must  be  in  a  file
                     with  a  name  consisting  of the specified <u>name</u> followed by a standard suffix, usually
                     `<b>.so</b>' (`<b>.sl</b>' on HPUX).  If the module to be loaded is already loaded and the <b>-i</b>  option
                     is  given, the duplicate module is ignored.  Otherwise <b>zmodload</b> prints an error message
                     and returns a non-zero status.  If  <b>zmodload</b>  detects  an  inconsistency,  such  as  an
                     invalid  module  name  or  circular dependency list, the current code block is aborted.
                     Hence `<b>zmodload</b> <b>-i</b> <u>module</u> <b>2&gt;/dev/null</b>' is sufficient to test whether a module is avail-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able.&nbsp;available.</font>
                     able.  If it is available, the module is loaded if necessary, while if it is not avail-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able,&nbsp;available,</font>
                     able, non-zero status is silently returned.

                     The <u>name</u>d module is searched for in the same  way  a  command  is,  using  <b>$module_path</b>
                     instead of <b>$path</b>.  However, the path search is performed even when the module name con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tains&nbsp;contains</font>
                     tains a `<b>/</b>', which it usually does.  There is no way to prevent the path search.

                     With <b>-u</b>, <b>zmodload</b> unloads modules.  The same <u>name</u> must be given that was given when the
                     module  was  loaded, but it is not necessary for the module to exist in the filesystem.
                     The <b>-i</b> option suppresses the error if the module is  already  unloaded  (or  was  never
                     loaded).

                     Each  module  has  a boot and a cleanup function.  The module will not be loaded if its
                     boot function fails.  Similarly a module can only be unloaded if its  cleanup  function
                     runs successfully.

              <b>zmodload</b> <b>-d</b> [ <b>-L</b> ] [ <u>name</u> ]
              <b>zmodload</b> <b>-d</b> <u>name</u> <u>dep</u> ...
              <b>zmodload</b> <b>-ud</b> <u>name</u> [ <u>dep</u> ... ]
                     The  <b>-d</b>  option  can  be used to specify module dependencies.  The modules named in the
                     second and subsequent arguments will be loaded before the module  named  in  the  first
                     argument.

                     With  <b>-d</b> and one argument, all dependencies for that module are listed.  With <b>-d</b> and no
                     arguments, all module dependencies are listed.  This listing is by default in  a  Make-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">file-like&nbsp;Makefile-like</font>
                     file-like format.  The <b>-L</b> option changes this format to a list of <b>zmodload</b> <b>-d</b> commands.

                     If <b>-d</b> and <b>-u</b> are both used, dependencies are removed.  If only one argument  is  given,
                     all dependencies for that module are removed.

              <b>zmodload</b> <b>-ab</b> [ <b>-L</b> ]
              <b>zmodload</b> <b>-ab</b> [ <b>-i</b> ] <u>name</u> [ <u>builtin</u> ... ]
              <b>zmodload</b> <b>-ub</b> [ <b>-i</b> ] <u>builtin</u> ...
                     The  <b>-ab</b>  option defines autoloaded builtins.  It defines the specified <u>builtin</u>s.  When
                     any of those builtins is called, the module specified in the first argument is  loaded.
                     If  only  the  <u>name</u> is given, one builtin is defined, with the same name as the module.
                     <b>-i</b> suppresses the error if the builtin is already defined or autoloaded, regardless  of
                     which module it came from.

                     With <b>-ab</b> and no arguments, all autoloaded builtins are listed, with the module name (if
                     different) shown in parentheses after the builtin name.  The  <b>-L</b>  option  changes  this
                     format to a list of <b>zmodload</b> <b>-a</b> commands.

                     If  <b>-b</b> is used together with the <b>-u</b> option, it removes builtins previously defined with
                     <b>-ab</b>.  This is only possible if the builtin is not yet loaded.  <b>-i</b> suppresses the  error
                     if the builtin is already removed (or never existed).

              <b>zmodload</b> <b>-ac</b> [ <b>-IL</b> ]
              <b>zmodload</b> <b>-ac</b> [ <b>-iI</b> ] <u>name</u> [ <u>cond</u> ... ]
              <b>zmodload</b> <b>-uc</b> [ <b>-iI</b> ] <u>cond</u> ...
                     The  <b>-ac</b> option is used to define autoloaded condition codes. The <u>cond</u> strings give the
                     names of the conditions defined by the module. The optional <b>-I</b> option is used to define
                     infix condition names. Without this option prefix condition names are defined.

                     If given no condition names, all defined names are listed (as a series of <b>zmodload</b> com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mands&nbsp;commands</font>
                     mands if the <b>-L</b> option is given).

                     The <b>-uc</b> option removes definitions for autoloaded conditions.

              <b>zmodload</b> <b>-ap</b> [ <b>-L</b> ]
              <b>zmodload</b> <b>-ap</b> [ <b>-i</b> ] <u>name</u> [ <u>parameter</u> ... ]
              <b>zmodload</b> <b>-up</b> [ <b>-i</b> ] <u>parameter</u> ...
                     The <b>-p</b> option is like the <b>-b</b> and <b>-c</b> options, but  makes  <b>zmodload</b>  work  on  autoloaded
                     parameters instead.

              <b>zmodload</b> <b>-af</b> [ <b>-L</b> ]
              <b>zmodload</b> <b>-af</b> [ <b>-i</b> ] <u>name</u> [ <u>function</u> ... ]
              <b>zmodload</b> <b>-uf</b> [ <b>-i</b> ] <u>function</u> ...
                     The <b>-f</b> option is like the <b>-b</b>, <b>-p</b>, and <b>-c</b> options, but makes <b>zmodload</b> work on autoloaded
                     math functions instead.

              <b>zmodload</b> <b>-a</b> [ <b>-L</b> ]
              <b>zmodload</b> <b>-a</b> [ <b>-i</b> ] <u>name</u> [ <u>builtin</u> ... ]
              <b>zmodload</b> <b>-ua</b> [ <b>-i</b> ] <u>builtin</u> ...
                     Equivalent to <b>-ab</b> and <b>-ub</b>.

              <b>zmodload</b> <b>-e</b> [ <b>-A</b> ] [ <u>string</u> ... ]
                     The <b>-e</b> option without arguments lists all loaded modules; if  the  <b>-A</b>  option  is  also
                     given,  module  aliases corresponding to loaded modules are also shown.  With arguments
                     only the return status is set to zero if all <u>string</u>s given as arguments  are  names  of
                     loaded  modules  and  to  one if at least on <u>string</u> is not the name of a loaded module.
                     This can be used to test for the availability of things  implemented  by  modules.   In
                     this case, any aliases are automatically resolved and the <b>-A</b> flag is not used.

              <b>zmodload</b> <b>-A</b> [ <b>-L</b> ] [ <u>modalias</u>[<b>=</b><u>module</u>] ... ]
                     For  each  argument,  if  both  <u>modalias</u> and <u>module</u> are given, define <u>modalias</u> to be an
                     alias for the module <u>module</u>.  If the module <u>modalias</u> is  ever  subsequently  requested,
                     either  via  a  call  to  <b>zmodload</b> or implicitly, the shell will attempt to load <u>module</u>
                     instead.  If <u>module</u> is not given, show the definition of <u>modalias</u>.  If no arguments are
                     given,  list  all defined module aliases.  When listing, if the <b>-L</b> flag was also given,
                     list the definition as a <b>zmodload</b> command to recreate the alias.

                     The existence of aliases for modules is completely  independent  of  whether  the  name
                     resolved  is actually loaded as a module: while the alias exists, loading and unloading
                     the module under any alias has exactly the same effect as using the resolved name,  and
                     does  not  affect  the  connection between the alias and the resolved name which can be
                     removed either by <b>zmodload</b> <b>-R</b> or by redefining the  alias.   Chains  of  aliases  (i.e.
                     where  the  first  resolved name is itself an alias) are valid so long as these are not
                     circular.  As the aliases take the same format as module names, they may  include  path
                     separators:   in  this  case, there is no requirement for any part of the path named to
                     exist as the alias will be resolved first.  For example, `<b>any/old/alias</b>'  is  always  a
                     valid alias.

                     Dependencies  added to aliased modules are actually added to the resolved module; these
                     remain if the alias is removed.  It is valid to create an alias whose name  is  one  of
                     the  standard  shell  modules  and which resolves to a different module.  However, if a
                     module has dependencies, it will not be possible to use the module name as an alias  as
                     the module will already be marked as a loadable module in its own right.

                     Apart from the above, aliases can be used in the <b>zmodload</b> command anywhere module names
                     are required.  However, aliases will not be shown in lists of  loaded  modules  with  a
                     bare `<b>zmodload</b>'.

              <b>zmodload</b> <b>-R</b> <u>modalias</u> ...
                     For  each  <u>modalias</u> argument that was previously defined as a module alias via <b>zmodload</b>
                     <b>-A</b>, delete the alias.  If any was not defined, an error is caused and the remainder  of
                     the line is ignored.

              Note that <b>zsh</b> makes no distinction between modules that were linked into the shell and modules
              that are loaded dynamically. In both cases this builtin command has to be used to make  avail-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able&nbsp;available</font>
              able  the  builtins  and  other  things defined by modules (unless the module is autoloaded on
              these definitions). This is true even for systems that don't support dynamic loading  of  mod-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ules.&nbsp;modules.</font>
              ules.
