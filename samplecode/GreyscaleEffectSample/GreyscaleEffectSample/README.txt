README - Greyscale Filter EffectThis sample code package shows how to define a custom effect for QuickTime 3 or later.This effect uses a single source as input, and renders that source in greyscale. It alsoallows for a brightness value which can range from -100...0...100. A value of 0 signifiesno change in brightness.This is a very basic sample and a good place to start if you've never looked atQuickTime effect code before.This sample makes use of some code from the Dimmer2 Effect Framework. While Dimmer2 isa recommended companion to this sample, it is more complex, using multiple sources,multiple pixel formats, non-Macintosh support, tweens etc.For developers who have asked for a quick and dirty single source filter sample, this one'sfor you...Enjoy,QuickTime Team
