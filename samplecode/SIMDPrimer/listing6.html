    &lt;emmintrin.h&gt; defines an intrinsic named _mm_shuffle_pd for the shufpd

    doubles), so we must cast it to the vector type we are using.  Since we are
    only moving data around and not interpreting the bits with arithmetic, this
    is okay.

    The selector passed to shufpd is a two-bit field.  The first bit selects
    which eight bytes in the first parameter are taken (0 for the first eight
    bytes, 1 for the second eight bytes).  The second bit selects which eight
    bytes in the second parameter are taken.

    The shufpd instruction is also available as a GCC extension.  To use the
    GCC extension, the first two parameters must be cast to the correct type:

    instruction.  However, its return type is __m128i (a vector containing
    integers), so we must cast it to the vector type we are using.  Since we
    are only moving data around and not interpreting the bits with arithmetic,
    this is okay.

    The selector passed to pshufd is an eight-bit field.  Each pair selects
    four bytes from the first parameter (0 for the first four bytes, 1 for the
    second four bytes, 2 for the third four bytes, and 3 for the last four
    bytes).

    The pshufd instruction is also available as a GCC extension.  To use the

        That code works and is functionally identical to the above code in
        terms of what it computes.  Unfortunately, GCC does not generate the
        best assembly code.  For example, it uses separate registers for i and
        vN even though we can get the work done with just one.

        Discussing what GCC does and how to work with it is beyond the scope of
        this primer.  It does require experimentation and studying the assembly
        language GCC generates.  Also, work-arounds are subject to breaking
        when new versions of GCC are used or even when simple code changes are
        made.  These are part of the reasons I prefer to use assembly language
        for core pieces of high-performance work.
