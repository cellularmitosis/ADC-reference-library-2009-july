<p><font face="Times"><em>WebObjects System Overview</em> is written
for developers who want to start using WebObjects. However, anyone
interested in WebObjects technology will get something out of this
book.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">For the most part, this book does not assume you have a background
in object-oriented programming. However, WebObjects is based on
object-oriented frameworks written in Java, an object-oriented language.
You should be familiar with object-oriented programming if you intend
to write WebObjects applications. There are many books available
on the subject if you aren't.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">A hallmark advantage of WebObjects is the database connectivity
it provides. To fully appreciate this technology, you should have
some understanding of databases (although this book doesn't require
it). Again, there are many books available on the subject.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Because WebObjects provides four distinct approaches to developing
applications, this book discusses them one by one, and compares
their pros and cons to help the developer decide which approach
is appropriate for his or her application.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">This book has the following chapters:</font></p>
<ul><p><li><b>What
Is WebObjects?</b> Introduces the technologies of WebObjects
and how they fit together.</li></p>
<p><li><b>Enterprise Objects.</b> Describes the objects
that lie at the heart of all WebObjects applications and encapsulate
your application's business logic and data.</li></p>
<p><li><b>HTML-Based Applications.</b> Describes
the approach that allows you to create HTML applications for the
World Wide Web.</li></p>
<p><li><b>Direct To Web Applications.</b> Describes
the rapid development version of the HTML-based application approach.</li></p>
<p><li><b>Java Client Applications.</b> Describes
the approach with which you can produce a graphical user interface
application that runs on a client machine.</li></p>
<p><li><b>Direct to Java Client Applications.</b> Describes
the rapid development version of the Java Client approach.</li></p>
<p><li><b>Choosing Your Approach.</b> Summarizes
the pros and cons of these approaches, and then outlines the process
you should go through to decide which approach or combination of
approaches is appropriate for your particular WebObjects application.</li></p></ul>
