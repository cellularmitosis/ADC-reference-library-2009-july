SimpleSpeechRecExample, version 1.2
A Simple Carbon Application Using Speech Recognition
	
The SimpleSpeechRecExample program demonstrates how to use the Speech Recognition Manager in a simple application.  This program listens for four phrases: "Hi", "Goodbye", "What time is it", and "What day is it".  When it recognizes one of the phrases, it displays the phrase in the dialog.

The Speech Recognition code is contained in the four routines at the end of the file: InitAndStartSpeechRecognition, MakeALanguageModel, HandleSpeechDoneAppleEvent, and CleanupSpeechRecognitionStuff. The rest this file contains classic Macintosh event and dialog handling code to support these Speech Recognition routines.
