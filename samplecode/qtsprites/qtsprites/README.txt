README - QTSpritesThis sample code creates three sprite movies. In the first, an icon moves from left to right,and changes its image at the halfway point. In the second, a picture is gradually changedfrom fully transparent to fully opaque. The third movie is more complicated; in it,the sprite track contains three sprites: a space ship, an icon, and aworld. Optionally, the track also contains a fourth sprite, a backgroundpicture. The space ship and icon move about as the sprite movie plays.See the file QTSprites.c for further details.This sample code also shows how to test for mouse clicks ("hits") on asprite. Open a movie containing a sprite track and then click on a sprite;its visibility state is toggled between visible and invisible. For Windows builds using Microsoft Visual C++, the Makefile (QTSprites.mak)automatically calls Rez to create the resource file QTSprites.qtr from theinput file QTSprites.r. The .qtr file must reside in the same directory as theapplication QTSprites.exe. For final delivery of your product, you shouldinsert the .qtr file into the .exe file by using the tool RezWack.Enjoy,QuickTime Team
