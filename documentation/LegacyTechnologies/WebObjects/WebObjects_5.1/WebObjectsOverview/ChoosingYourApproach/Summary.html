Any user with a Web-enabled computer and a Webbrowser can use the application. Its disadvantages are the limitationsof the HTML-based user interface&#151;delays due to round trips tothe server and a limited widget set.</p><p>Direct to Web has the same advantages and limitations of theWebObjects HTML-based approach. However, it also allows you to developdata-driven applications extremely quickly. The downside of Directto Web is that it generates a particular user interface that maynot be suitable for your application.</p><p>Java Client applications provide the rich and fast user interfacesof client-server desktop applications. The disadvantage of thisapproach is portability. You need to install or download the applicationon the user's computer.</p><p>Direct to Java Client allows you to quickly develop data-drivenJava Client applications and therefore has the advantages and disadvantagesof Java Client. However, like Direct to Web, Direct to Java Clientimposes a particular user interface that may not be suitable foryour application.</p><br>    <br><a href="Adding_Rapid_Development.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/previous.gif" border="0"></a><a href="Where_to_Go_From_Here.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/next.gif" border="0"></a>&nbsp;<br><br><p><hr><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">&#169; 2002 Apple Computer, Inc.
