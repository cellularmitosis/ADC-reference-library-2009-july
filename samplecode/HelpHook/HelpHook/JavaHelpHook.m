// The wrong way to call AppKit from JNI: directly from an arbitrary Java thread.  The worst (and most likely)

	*	Calling this method in the sample as-is shows no visible difference.  However, removing the
	*	"SampleHelp" folder from your app bundle exposes it as a dangerous technique.
	*
	*   If there is no locatable help folder in your app, an alert dialog is brought up by AppKit.
	*   When this method is called directly from Java's actionPerformed, and the dialog appears, 
	*	the AWT queue is now blocked on it.  Clicks on buttons in the Frame are hung up in
	*	the queue and are not processed until the dialog (and the actionPerformed method waiting on it)
	*	returns.  Worse, resizing the Java frame causes a deadlock: live-resizing originates from AppKit,
	*	which on Mac OS X 10.3 sends blocking repaint requests to AWT, which is still blocked on showHelp.
	*
	*	AWT:actionPerformed --(blocked)--> badShowHelp --> AppKit dialog
	*	 ^
	*	 |
	*	 | (blocked)
	*	 |
	*	AWT:repaint <--(blocked)--	AppKit live resize
	*
	*	Note this is not a problem in the "good" showHelp method, because it correctly sends showHelp:
	*	to the main AppKit thread.  The dialog comes up and is processed normally by AppKit, 
	*	freeing up the AWT Event Queue in the process.  Button clicks, and more importantly live resize repaints
	*	can now be processed.
	*
	*			+----> showHelp --> AppKit dialog
	*			|
	*			| (performSelector... non-blocking)
	*			|
	*	AWT:actionPerformed (allowed to return... AWT events continue to process)
	*	 ^
	*	 |
	*	 | (queue is open.. not blocked)
	*	 |
	*	AWT:repaint <--(blocked)--	AppKit live resize
	*			
	*	This demonstrates the importance of using performSelectorOnMainThread when making AppKit calls from JNI, 
	*	and the more general rule of communicating between AppKit and AWT asynchronously at all times.
