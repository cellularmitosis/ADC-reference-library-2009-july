/*File: IconListUtilities.cAbstract: Handles adding and removing data from the custom Icon List.Version: 3.0Change History:		<3.0>	no changes necessary	<2.0>	changed ReleaseListIcons to make sure the icons get 			released when they are unregistered (see the comment 			in the function for discussion)	<1.0>	first release version			though we're not using them, Mac OS 8.6 introduces 			packages; we made getCurrentResourceFSSpec to allow for 			the possibility that our main application file might not 			contain the 'icns' resources at some point in the future© Copyright 2005 Apple Computer, Inc.
