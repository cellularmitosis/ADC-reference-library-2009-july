This application uses double buffering for both recording and playback. Once a buffer is filled by the recording, the buffer is passed to the playback to be played.  The palyback has a small delay between the buffers which does not sound very good.  The delay sounds a little like a skip in a record.  The way to quit the application is to hold down the mouse button until the app quits.
