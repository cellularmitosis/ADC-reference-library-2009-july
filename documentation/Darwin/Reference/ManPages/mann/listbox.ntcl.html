<b>WIDGET-SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       Command-Line Name:<b>-activestyle</b>                                                                        |
       Database Name:  <b>activeStyle</b>                                                                           |
       Database Class: <b>ActiveStyle</b>                                                                           |

              Specifies  the  style in which to draw the active element.  This must be one of <b>dotbox</b> (show a |
              focus ring around the active element), <b>none</b> (nospecial indication of active element) or <b>under-</b> |
              <b>line</b> (underline the active element).  The default is <b>underline</b>.                                |

       Command-Line Name:<b>-height</b>                                                                             |
       Database Name:  <b>height</b>                                                                                |
       Database Class: <b>Height</b>                                                                                |

              Specifies  the  desired  height  for  the window, in lines.  If zero or less, then the desired |
              height for the window is made just large enough to hold all the elements in the listbox.       |

       Command-Line Name:<b>-listvariable</b>                                                                       |
       Database Name:  <b>listVariable</b>                                                                          |
       Database Class: <b>Variable</b>                                                                              |

              Specifies the name of a variable.  The value of the variable is a list to be displayed  inside |
              the  widget; if the variable value changes then the widget will automatically update itself to |
              reflect the new value.  Attempts to assign a variable with an invalid list value to <b>-listvari-</b> |
              <b>able</b>  will  cause  an error.  Attempts to unset a variable in use as a <b>-listvariable</b> will fail |
              but will not generate an error.                                                                |

       Command-Line Name:<b>-selectmode</b>                                                                         |
       Database Name:  <b>selectMode</b>                                                                            |
       Database Class: <b>SelectMode</b>                                                                            |

              Specifies one of several styles for manipulating the selection.  The value of the  option  may |
              be  arbitrary,  but  the  default bindings expect it to be either <b>single</b>, <b>browse</b>, <b>multiple</b>, or |
              <b>extended</b>;  the default value is <b>browse</b>.                                                        |

       Command-Line Name:<b>-state</b>                                                                              |
       Database Name:  <b>state</b>                                                                                 |
       Database Class: <b>State</b>                                                                                 |

              Specifies one of two states for the listbox:  <b>normal</b> or <b>disabled</b>.  If the listbox is  disabled |
              then  items  may not be inserted or deleted, items are drawn in the <b>-disabledforeground</b> color, |
              and selection cannot be modified and is not shown (though selection information is  retained). |

       Command-Line Name:<b>-width</b>                                                                              |
       Database Name:  <b>width</b>                                                                                 |
       Database Class: <b>Width</b>                                                                                 |

              Specifies  the desired width for the window in characters.  If the font doesn't have a uniform |
              width then the width of the character ``0'' is used in translating  from  character  units  to |
              screen  units.   If  zero  or  less,  then the desired width for the window is made just large |
              enough to hold all the elements in the listbox.                                                |
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ |


<b>DESCRIPTION</b>                                                                                                  |
       The <b>listbox</b> command creates a new window (given by the <u>pathName</u> argument) and makes it into a listbox |
       widget.   Additional  options, described above, may be specified on the command line or in the option |
       database to configure aspects of the listbox such as its colors, font, text, and relief.  The <b>listbox</b> |
       command  returns  its <u>pathName</u> argument.  At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a |
       window named <u>pathName</u>, but <u>pathName</u>'s parent must exist.                                              |

       A listbox is a widget that displays a list of strings, one per line.  When first created, a new list- |
       box  has  no  elements.   Elements may be added or deleted using widget commands described below.  In |
       addition, one or more elements may be selected as described below.  If a  listbox  is  exporting  its |
       selection  (see <b>exportSelection</b> option), then it will observe the standard X11 protocols for handling |
       the selection.  Listbox selections are available as type <b>STRING</b>; the value of the selection  will  be |
       the text of the selected elements, with newlines separating the elements.                             |

       It  is  not  necessary  for all the elements to be displayed in the listbox window at once;  commands |
       described below may be used to change the view in the window.   Listboxes  allow  scrolling  in  both |
       directions using the standard <b>xScrollCommand</b> and <b>yScrollCommand</b> options.  They also support scanning, |
       as described below.                                                                                   |


<b>INDICES</b>                                                                                                      |
       Many of the widget commands for listboxes take one or more indices as arguments.  An index  specifies |
       a particular element of the listbox, in any of the following ways:                                    |

       <u>num-</u>                                                                                                  |
       <u>ber</u>                                                                                                |  |
                   Specifies the element as a numerical index, where 0 corresponds to the first  element  in |
                   the listbox.                                                                              |

       <b>active</b>                                                                                                ||
                   Indicates the element that has the location cursor.  This element will  be  displayed  as |
                   specified  by  <b>-activestyle</b>  when the listbox has the keyboard focus, and it is specified |
                   with the <b>activate</b> widget command.                                                         |

       <b>anchor</b>                                                                                                ||
                   Indicates the anchor point for the selection, which is set with the <b>selection</b> <b>anchor</b> wid- |
                   get command.                                                                              |

       <b>end</b>                                                                                                   ||
                   Indicates  the  end of the listbox.  For most commands this refers to the last element in |
                   the listbox, but for a few commands such as <b>index</b> and <b>insert</b> it  refers  to  the  element |
                   just after the last one.

       <b>@</b><u>x</u><b>,</b><u>y</u>        Indicates  the  element  that covers the point in the listbox window specified by <u>x</u> and <u>y</u>
                   (in pixel coordinates).  If no element covers that point, then  the  closest  element  to
                   that point is used.

       In  the widget command descriptions below, arguments named <u>index</u>, <u>first</u>, and <u>last</u> always contain text
       indices in one of the above forms.


<b>WIDGET</b> <b>COMMAND</b>
       The <b>listbox</b> command creates a new Tcl command whose name is <u>pathName</u>.  This command may  be  used  to
       invoke various operations on the widget.  It has the following general form:
              <u>pathName</u> <u>option</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
       <u>Option</u> and the <u>arg</u>s determine the exact behavior of the command.  The following commands are possible
       for listbox widgets:

       <u>pathName</u> <b>activate</b> <u>index</u>
              Sets the active element to the one indicated by <u>index</u>.  If <u>index</u> is outside the range of  ele- |
              ments  in  the  listbox then the closest element is activated.  The active element is drawn as
              specified by <b>-activestyle</b> when the widget has the input focus, and its index may be  retrieved
              with the index <b>active</b>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>bbox</b> <u>index</u>
              Returns a list of four numbers describing the bounding box of the text in the element given by
              <u>index</u>.  The first two elements of the list give the x and y coordinates of the upper-left cor-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ner&nbsp;corner</font>
              ner  of  the  screen area covered by the text (specified in pixels relative to the widget) and
              the last two elements give the width and height of the area, in pixels.  If  no  part  of  the
              element given by <u>index</u> is visible on the screen, or if <u>index</u> refers to a non-existent element, |
              then the result is an empty string;  if the element is partially visible, the result gives the
              full area of the element, including any parts that are not visible.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>cget</b> <u>option</u>
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <u>option</u>.  <u>Option</u> may have any of
              the values accepted by the <b>listbox</b> command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>configure</b> ?<u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no <u>option</u> is specified, returns a
              list  describing  all of the available options for <u>pathName</u> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for informa-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;information</font>
              tion on the format of this list).  If <u>option</u> is specified with  no  <u>value</u>,  then  the  command
              returns a list describing the one named option (this list will be identical to the correspond-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;corresponding</font>
              ing sublist of the value returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).  If  one  or  more  <u>option-value</u>
              pairs  are  specified,  then the command modifies the given widget <!-- a -->option(s)<!-- /a --> to have the given
              <!-- a -->value(s)<!-- /a -->;  in this case the command returns an empty string.  <u>Option</u> may have any of the  val-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ues&nbsp;values</font>
              ues accepted by the <b>listbox</b> command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>curselection</b>
              Returns a list containing the numerical indices of all of the elements in the listbox that are
              currently selected.  If there are no elements selected in the listbox then an empty string  is
              returned.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>delete</b> <u>first</u> ?<u>last</u>?
              Deletes  one or more elements of the listbox.  <u>First</u> and <u>last</u> are indices specifying the first
              and last elements in the range to delete.  If <u>last</u> isn't specified it defaults to <u>first</u>,  i.e.
              a single element is deleted.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>get</b> <u>first</u> ?<u>last</u>?
              If  <u>last</u>  is  omitted,  returns  the contents of the listbox element indicated by <u>first</u>, or an |
              empty string if <u>first</u> refers to a non-existent element.  If <u>last</u>  is  specified,  the  command
              returns  a  list whose elements are all of the listbox elements between <u>first</u> and <u>last</u>, inclu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sive.&nbsp;inclusive.</font>
              sive.  Both <u>first</u> and <u>last</u> may have any of the standard forms for indices.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>index</b> <u>index</u>
              Returns the integer index value that corresponds to <u>index</u>.  If <u>index</u> is <b>end</b> the  return  value |
              is a count of the number of elements in the listbox (not the index of the last element).

       <u>pathName</u> <b>insert</b> <u>index</u> ?<u>element</u> <u>element</u> <u>...</u>?
              Inserts  zero  or  more  new  elements in the list just before the element given by <u>index</u>.  If
              <u>index</u> is specified as <b>end</b> then the new elements are added to the end of the list.  Returns  an
              empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>itemcget</b> <u>index</u> <u>option</u>
              Returns  the  current  value of the item configuration option given by <u>option</u>. <u>Option</u> may have
              any of the values accepted by the <b>listbox</b> <b>itemconfigure</b> command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>itemconfigure</b> <u>index</u> ?<u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u>? ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Query or modify the configuration options of an item in the listbox.  If no <u>option</u>  is  speci-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fied,&nbsp;specified,</font>
              fied,  returns  a list describing all of the available options for the item (see <b>Tk_Configure</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">Info&nbsp;Tk_ConfigureInfo</font>
              <b>Info</b> for information on the format of this list).  If <u>option</u> is specified with no <u>value</u>,  then
              the command returns a list describing the one named option (this list will be identical to the
              corresponding sublist of the value returned if no  <u>option</u>  is  specified).   If  one  or  more
              <u>option-value</u> pairs are specified, then the command modifies the given widget <!-- a -->option(s)<!-- /a --> to have
              the given <!-- a -->value(s)<!-- /a -->;  in this case the command returns an empty string. The  following  options
              are currently supported for items:

              <b>-background</b> <u>color</u>
                     <u>Color</u>  specifies  the background color to use when displaying the item. It may have any
                     of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetColor</b>.

              <b>-foreground</b> <u>color</u>
                     <u>Color</u> specifies the foreground color to use when displaying the item. It may  have  any
                     of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetColor</b>.

              <b>-selectbackground</b> <u>color</u>
                     <u>color</u>  specifies  the  background  color  to  use  when displaying the item while it is
                     selected. It may have any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetColor</b>.

              <b>-selectforeground</b> <u>color</u>
                     <u>color</u> specifies the foreground color to use  when  displaying  the  item  while  it  is
                     selected. It may have any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetColor</b>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>nearest</b> <u>y</u>
              Given  a  y-coordinate within the listbox window, this command returns the index of the (visi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ble)&nbsp;(visible)</font>
              ble) listbox element nearest to that y-coordinate.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>scan</b> <u>option</u> <u>args</u>
              This command is used to implement scanning on listboxes.   It  has  two  forms,  depending  on
              <u>option</u>:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>scan</b> <b>mark</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u>
                     Records  <u>x</u>  and <u>y</u> and the current view in the listbox window;  used in conjunction with
                     later <b>scan</b> <b>dragto</b> commands.  Typically this command is associated with a  mouse  button
                     press in the widget.  It returns an empty string.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>scan</b> <b>dragto</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u>.
                     This  command  computes  the  difference  between its <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> arguments and the <u>x</u> and <u>y</u>
                     arguments to the last <b>scan</b> <b>mark</b> command for the widget.  It then adjusts the view by 10
                     times  the  difference in coordinates.  This command is typically associated with mouse
                     motion events in the widget, to produce the effect of dragging the list at  high  speed
                     through the window.  The return value is an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>see</b> <u>index</u>
              Adjust  the view in the listbox so that the element given by <u>index</u> is visible.  If the element
              is already visible then the command has no effect; if the element is near one edge of the win-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dow&nbsp;window</font>
              dow  then the listbox scrolls to bring the element into view at the edge;  otherwise the list-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">box&nbsp;listbox</font>
              box scrolls to center the element.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <u>option</u> <u>arg</u>
              This command is used to adjust the selection within a listbox.  It has several forms,  depend-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;depending</font>
              ing on <u>option</u>:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>anchor</b> <u>index</u>
                     Sets  the  selection  anchor  to the element given by <u>index</u>.  If <u>index</u> refers to a non- |
                     existent element, then the closest element is used.  The selection anchor is the end of
                     the  selection  that is fixed while dragging out a selection with the mouse.  The index
                     <b>anchor</b> may be used to refer to the anchor element.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>clear</b> <u>first</u> ?<u>last</u>?
                     If any of the elements between <u>first</u> and <u>last</u> (inclusive) are selected, they are  dese-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lected.&nbsp;deselected.</font>
                     lected.  The selection state is not changed for elements outside this range.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>includes</b> <u>index</u>
                     Returns 1 if the element indicated by <u>index</u> is currently selected, 0 if it isn't.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>set</b> <u>first</u> ?<u>last</u>?
                     Selects  all  of  the  elements in the range between <u>first</u> and <u>last</u>, inclusive, without
                     affecting the selection state of elements outside that range.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>size</b>
              Returns a decimal string indicating the total number of elements in the listbox.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b> <u>args</u>
              This command is used to query and change the horizontal position of  the  information  in  the
              widget's window.  It can take any of the following forms:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b>
                     Returns  a list containing two elements.  Each element is a real fraction between 0 and
                     1;  together they describe the horizontal span that is  visible  in  the  window.   For
                     example,  if the first element is .2 and the second element is .6, 20% of the listbox's
                     text is off-screen to the left, the middle 40% is visible in the window, and 40% of the
                     text  is  off-screen  to the right.  These are the same values passed to scrollbars via
                     the <b>-xscrollcommand</b> option.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b> <u>index</u>
                     Adjusts the view in the window so that the character position given by  <u>index</u>  is  dis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">played&nbsp;displayed</font>
                     played at the left edge of the window.  Character positions are defined by the width of
                     the character <b>0</b>.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b> <b>moveto</b> <u>fraction</u>
                     Adjusts the view in the window so that <u>fraction</u> of the total width of the listbox  text
                     is off-screen to the left.  <u>fraction</u> must be a fraction between 0 and 1.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b> <b>scroll</b> <u>number</u> <u>what</u>
                     This  command shifts the view in the window left or right according to <u>number</u> and <u>what</u>.
                     <u>Number</u> must be an integer.  <u>What</u> must be either <b>units</b> or <b>pages</b> or  an  abbreviation  of
                     one  of  these.   If  <u>what</u> is <b>units</b>, the view adjusts left or right by <u>number</u> character
                     units (the width of the <b>0</b> character) on the display;  if it  is  <b>pages</b>  then  the  view
                     adjusts  by  <u>number</u>  screenfuls.   If <u>number</u> is negative then characters farther to the
                     left become visible;  if it is positive then characters farther  to  the  right  become
                     visible.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b> <u>?args</u>?
              This  command  is  used  to query and change the vertical position of the text in the widget's
              window.  It can take any of the following forms:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b>
                     Returns a list containing two elements, both of which are real fractions between 0  and
                     1.   The first element gives the position of the listbox element at the top of the win-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dow,&nbsp;window,</font>
                     dow, relative to the listbox as a whole (0.5 means it is halfway through  the  listbox,
                     for  example).  The second element gives the position of the listbox element just after
                     the last one in the window, relative to the listbox as a whole.   These  are  the  same
                     values passed to scrollbars via the <b>-yscrollcommand</b> option.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b> <u>index</u>
                     Adjusts  the  view in the window so that the element given by <u>index</u> is displayed at the
                     top of the window.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b> <b>moveto</b> <u>fraction</u>
                     Adjusts the view in the window so that the element given by <u>fraction</u> appears at the top
                     of  the window.  <u>Fraction</u> is a fraction between 0 and 1;  0 indicates the first element
                     in the listbox, 0.33 indicates the element one-third the way through the  listbox,  and
                     so on.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b> <b>scroll</b> <u>number</u> <u>what</u>
                     This  command  adjusts  the view in the window up or down according to <u>number</u> and <u>what</u>.
                     <u>Number</u> must be an integer.  <u>What</u> must be either <b>units</b> or <b>pages</b>.  If <u>what</u> is <b>units</b>,  the
                     view  adjusts up or down by <u>number</u> lines;  if it is <b>pages</b> then the view adjusts by <u>num</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ber&nbsp;number</font>
                     <u>ber</u> screenfuls.  If <u>number</u> is negative then earlier elements become visible;  if it  is
                     positive then later elements become visible.


<b>DEFAULT</b> <b>BINDINGS</b>
       Tk  automatically  creates  class bindings for listboxes that give them Motif-like behavior.  Much of
       the behavior of a listbox is determined by its <b>selectMode</b> option, which selects one of four  ways  of
       dealing with the selection.

       If  the  selection  mode  is  <b>single</b> or <b>browse</b>, at most one element can be selected in the listbox at
       once.  In both modes, clicking button 1 on an element selects it and  deselects  any  other  selected
       item.  In <b>browse</b> mode it is also possible to drag the selection with button 1.

       If  the  selection  mode  is  <b>multiple</b>  or  <b>extended</b>, any number of elements may be selected at once,
       including discontiguous ranges.  In <b>multiple</b> mode, clicking button 1 on an element toggles its selec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;selection</font>
       tion  state  without affecting any other elements.  In <b>extended</b> mode, pressing button 1 on an element
       selects it, deselects everything else, and sets the anchor to the element under the mouse;   dragging
       the mouse with button 1 down extends the selection to include all the elements between the anchor and
       the element under the mouse, inclusive.

       Most people will probably want to use <b>browse</b> mode for single selections and <b>extended</b> mode for  multi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ple&nbsp;multiple</font>
       ple selections; the other modes appear to be useful only in special situations.

       Any time the selection changes in the listbox, the virtual event <b>&lt;&lt;ListboxSelect&gt;&gt;</b> will be generated.
       It is easiest to bind to this event to be made aware of any changes to listbox selection.

       In addition to the above behavior, the following additional behavior is defined by the default  bind-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ings:&nbsp;bindings:</font>
       ings:

       [1]    In  <b>extended</b>  mode, the selected range can be adjusted by pressing button 1 with the Shift key
              down:  this modifies the selection to consist of the elements between the anchor and the  ele-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment&nbsp;element</font>
              ment  under  the  mouse,  inclusive.   The  un-anchored  end of this new selection can also be
              dragged with the button down.

       [2]    In <b>extended</b> mode, pressing button 1 with the Control key down starts a toggle  operation:  the
              anchor is set to the element under the mouse, and its selection state is reversed.  The selec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;selection</font>
              tion state of other elements isn't changed.  If the mouse is dragged with button 1 down,  then
              the  selection state of all elements between the anchor and the element under the mouse is set
              to match that of the anchor element;  the selection state of all other elements  remains  what
              it was before the toggle operation began.

       [3]    If  the  mouse  leaves the listbox window with button 1 down, the window scrolls away from the
              mouse, making information visible that used to be off-screen on the side of  the  mouse.   The
              scrolling  continues  until the mouse re-enters the window, the button is released, or the end
              of the listbox is reached.

       [4]    Mouse button 2 may be used for scanning.  If it is pressed and dragged over the  listbox,  the
              contents of the listbox drag at high speed in the direction the mouse moves.

       [5]    If  the  Up  or Down key is pressed, the location cursor (active element) moves up or down one
              element.  If the selection mode is <b>browse</b> or <b>extended</b> then the  new  active  element  is  also
              selected  and  all  other  elements  are  deselected.  In <b>extended</b> mode the new active element
              becomes the selection anchor.

       [6]    In <b>extended</b> mode, Shift-Up and Shift-Down move the location cursor (active element) up or down
              one  element  and  also  extend the selection to that element in a fashion similar to dragging
              with mouse button 1.

       [7]    The Left and Right keys scroll the listbox view left and right by the width of  the  character
              <b>0</b>.   Control-Left and Control-Right scroll the listbox view left and right by the width of the
              window.  Control-Prior and Control-Next also scroll left and right by the width of the window.

       [8]    The  Prior  and  Next  keys scroll the listbox view up and down by one page (the height of the
              window).

       [9]    The Home and End keys scroll the listbox horizontally to the left  and  right  edges,  respec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tively.&nbsp;respectively.</font>
              tively.

       [10]   Control-Home  sets  the  location cursor to the the first element in the listbox, selects that
              element, and deselects everything else in the listbox.

       [11]   Control-End sets the location cursor to the the last element in the listbox, selects that ele-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment,&nbsp;element,</font>
              ment, and deselects everything else in the listbox.

       [12]   In <b>extended</b> mode, Control-Shift-Home extends the selection to the first element in the listbox
              and Control-Shift-End extends the selection to the last element.

       [13]   In <b>multiple</b> mode, Control-Shift-Home moves the location cursor to the  first  element  in  the
              listbox and Control-Shift-End moves the location cursor to the last element.

       [14]   The  space and Select keys make a selection at the location cursor (active element) just as if
              mouse button 1 had been pressed over this element.

       [15]   In <b>extended</b> mode, Control-Shift-space and Shift-Select extend the selection to the active ele-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment&nbsp;element</font>
              ment just as if button 1 had been pressed with the Shift key down.

       [16]   In  <b>extended</b>  mode, the Escape key cancels the most recent selection and restores all the ele-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ments&nbsp;elements</font>
              ments in the selected range to their previous selection state.

       [17]   Control-slash selects everything in the widget, except in <b>single</b> and <b>browse</b>  modes,  in  which
              case it selects the active element and deselects everything else.

       [18]   Control-backslash  deselects  everything  in the widget, except in <b>browse</b> mode where it has no
              effect.

       [19]   The F16 key (labelled Copy on many Sun workstations) or Meta-w copies  the  selection  in  the
              widget to the clipboard, if there is a selection.


       The  behavior  of  listboxes  can  be  changed  by defining new bindings for individual widgets or by
       redefining the class bindings.
