	/* kvc methods for the 'strong boxes' AppleScript element.  Here we implement the methods
	necessary for maintaining the list of strong boxes inside of the application container.
	Note the names. In our scripting definition file we specified that the 'strong box'
	class contains an element of type 'strong box', like so:
			<element type="strong box">
				<cocoa key="strongBoxes"/>
			</element>
	But, in our class definition of 'strong box' we have specified an irregular plural form
	for the class name:
		<class name="strong box" plural="strong boxes" code="ScOS" inherits="bucket"
			description="An object that can contain other objects.">
	This makes sense, because simply slapping an 's' on the end of our class name won't
	produce the correct plural form for our class (ie, 'strong boxes') and we would like
	the user to see a proper spelling.
	
	But, now, since we have provided our own plural form, exactly what Cocoa key should
	be used becomes ambiguous.  So, what we have done is explicitly called out the Cocoa
	key we are going to use for our collection of strong boxes inside of our element
	declaration inside of our application class object (see above).   With that in place,
	we can define our accessor methods using the key strongBoxes and normal kvc conventions:
