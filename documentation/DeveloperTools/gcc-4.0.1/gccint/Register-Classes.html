<h3 class="section">13.8 Register Classes</h3>

<p><a name="index-register-class-definitions-1823"></a><a name="index-class-definitions_002c-register-1824"></a>
On many machines, the numbered registers are not all equivalent. 
For example, certain registers may not be allowed for indexed addressing;
certain registers may not be allowed in some instructions.  These machine
restrictions are described to the compiler using <dfn>register classes</dfn>.

 <p>You define a number of register classes, giving each one a name and saying
which of the registers belong to it.  Then you can specify register classes
that are allowed as operands to particular instruction patterns.

 <p><a name="index-ALL_005fREGS-1825"></a><a name="index-NO_005fREGS-1826"></a>In general, each register will belong to several classes.  In fact, one
class must be named <code>ALL_REGS</code> and contain all the registers.  Another
class must be named <code>NO_REGS</code> and contain no registers.  Often the
union of two classes will be another class; however, this is not required.

 <p><a name="index-GENERAL_005fREGS-1827"></a>One of the classes must be named <code>GENERAL_REGS</code>.  There is nothing
terribly special about the name, but the operand constraint letters
`<samp><span class="samp">r</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">g</span></samp>' specify this class.  If <code>GENERAL_REGS</code> is
the same as <code>ALL_REGS</code>, just define it as a macro which expands
to <code>ALL_REGS</code>.

 <p>Order the classes so that if class <var>x</var> is contained in class <var>y</var>
then <var>x</var> has a lower class number than <var>y</var>.

 <p>The way classes other than <code>GENERAL_REGS</code> are specified in operand
constraints is through machine-dependent operand constraint letters. 
You can define such letters to correspond to various classes, then use
them in operand constraints.

 <p>You should define a class for the union of two classes whenever some
instruction allows both classes.  For example, if an instruction allows
either a floating point (coprocessor) register or a general register for a
certain operand, you should define a class <code>FLOAT_OR_GENERAL_REGS</code>
which includes both of them.  Otherwise you will get suboptimal code.

 <p>You must also specify certain redundant information about the register
classes: for each class, which classes contain it and which ones are
contained in it; for each pair of classes, the largest class contained
in their union.

 <p>When a value occupying several consecutive registers is expected in a
certain class, all the registers used must belong to that class. 
Therefore, register classes cannot be used to enforce a requirement for
a register pair to start with an even-numbered register.  The way to
specify this requirement is with <code>HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK</code>.

 <p>Register classes used for input-operands of bitwise-and or shift
instructions have a special requirement: each such class must have, for
each fixed-point machine mode, a subclass whose registers can transfer that
mode to or from memory.  For example, on some machines, the operations for
single-byte values (<code>QImode</code>) are limited to certain registers.  When
this is so, each register class that is used in a bitwise-and or shift
instruction must have a subclass consisting of registers from which
single-byte values can be loaded or stored.  This is so that
<code>PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS</code> can always have a possible value to return.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Data type: <b>enum reg_class</b><var><a name="index-enum-reg_005fclass-1828"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>An enumerated type that must be defined with all the register class names
as enumerated values.  <code>NO_REGS</code> must be first.  <code>ALL_REGS</code>
must be the last register class, followed by one more enumerated value,
<code>LIM_REG_CLASSES</code>, which is not a register class but rather
tells how many classes there are.

      <p>Each register class has a number, which is the value of casting
the class name to type <code>int</code>.  The number serves as an index
in many of the tables described below.

constants.  These names are used in writing some of the debugging dumps.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>REG_CLASS_CONTENTS</b><var><a name="index-REG_005fCLASS_005fCONTENTS-1831"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>An initializer containing the contents of the register classes, as integers
which are bit masks.  The <var>n</var>th integer specifies the contents of class
<var>n</var>.  The way the integer <var>mask</var> is interpreted is that
register <var>r</var> is in the class if <var>mask</var><code> &amp; (1 &lt;&lt; </code><var>r</var><code>)</code> is 1.

      <p>When the machine has more than 32 registers, an integer does not suffice. 
Then the integers are replaced by sub-initializers, braced groupings containing
several integers.  Each sub-initializer must be suitable as an initializer
for the type <code>HARD_REG_SET</code> which is defined in <samp><span class="file">hard-reg-set.h</span></samp>. 
In this situation, the first integer in each sub-initializer corresponds to
registers 0 through 31, the second integer to registers 32 through 63, and
so on.

which is the register value plus a displacement.

&mdash; Macro: <b>MODE_BASE_REG_CLASS</b> (<var>mode</var>)<var><a name="index-MODE_005fBASE_005fREG_005fCLASS-1834"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This is a variation of the <code>BASE_REG_CLASS</code> macro which allows
the selection of a base register in a mode dependent manner.  If
<var>mode</var> is VOIDmode then it should return the same value as
<code>BASE_REG_CLASS</code>.

<blockquote><p>A C expression whose value is the register class to which a valid
base register must belong in order to be used in a base plus index
register address.  You should define this macro if base plus index
addresses have different requirements than other base register uses.

address where its value is either multiplied by a scale factor or
added to another register (as well as added to a displacement).

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>CONSTRAINT_LEN</b> (<var>char, str</var>)<var><a name="index-CONSTRAINT_005fLEN-1837"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>For the constraint at the start of <var>str</var>, which starts with the letter
<var>c</var>, return the length.  This allows you to have register class /
constant / extra constraints that are longer than a single letter;
you don't need to define this macro if you can do with single-letter
constraints only.  The definition of this macro should use
DEFAULT_CONSTRAINT_LEN for all the characters that you don't want
to handle specially. 
There are some sanity checks in genoutput.c that check the constraint lengths
for the md file, so you can also use this macro to help you while you are
transitioning from a byzantine single-letter-constraint scheme: when you
return a negative length for a constraint you want to re-use, genoutput
will complain about every instance where it is used in the md file.

<blockquote><p>A C expression which defines the machine-dependent operand constraint
letters for register classes.  If <var>char</var> is such a letter, the
value should be the register class corresponding to it.  Otherwise,
the value should be <code>NO_REGS</code>.  The register letter `<samp><span class="samp">r</span></samp>',
corresponding to class <code>GENERAL_REGS</code>, will not be passed
to this macro; you do not need to handle it.

different variants.

you define this macro, the compiler will use it instead of

use as a base register in base plus index operand addresses, accessing
memory in mode <var>mode</var>.  It may be either a suitable hard register or a

<blockquote><p>A C expression which is nonzero if register number <var>num</var> is
suitable for use as an index register in operand addresses.  It may be
either a suitable hard register or a pseudo register that has been
allocated such a hard register.

      <p>The difference between an index register and a base register is that
the index register may be scaled.  If an address involves the sum of
two registers, neither one of them scaled, then either one may be
labeled the &ldquo;base&rdquo; and the other the &ldquo;index&rdquo;; but whichever
labeling is used must fit the machine's constraints of which registers
may serve in each capacity.  The compiler will try both labelings,
looking for one that is valid, and will reload one or both registers
only if neither labeling works.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS</b> (<var>x, class</var>)<var><a name="index-PREFERRED_005fRELOAD_005fCLASS-1844"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>A C expression that places additional restrictions on the register class
to use when it is necessary to copy value <var>x</var> into a register in class
<var>class</var>.  The value is a register class; perhaps <var>class</var>, or perhaps
another, smaller class.  On many machines, the following definition is
safe:

     <pre class="smallexample">          #define PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS(X,CLASS) CLASS
     </pre>
      <p>Sometimes returning a more restrictive class makes better code.  For
example, on the 68000, when <var>x</var> is an integer constant that is in range
for a `<samp><span class="samp">moveq</span></samp>' instruction, the value of this macro is always
<code>DATA_REGS</code> as long as <var>class</var> includes the data registers. 
Requiring a data register guarantees that a `<samp><span class="samp">moveq</span></samp>' will be used.

      <p>One case where <code>PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS</code> must not return
<var>class</var> is if <var>x</var> is a legitimate constant which cannot be
loaded into some register class.  By returning <code>NO_REGS</code> you can
force <var>x</var> into a memory location.  For example, rs6000 can load
immediate values into general-purpose registers, but does not have an
instruction for loading an immediate value into a floating-point
register, so <code>PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS</code> returns <code>NO_REGS</code> when
<var>x</var> is a floating-point constant.  If the constant can't be loaded
into any kind of register, code generation will be better if
<code>LEGITIMATE_CONSTANT_P</code> makes the constant illegitimate instead
of using <code>PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>PREFERRED_OUTPUT_RELOAD_CLASS</b> (<var>x, class</var>)<var><a name="index-PREFERRED_005fOUTPUT_005fRELOAD_005fCLASS-1845"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Like <code>PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS</code>, but for output reloads instead of
input reloads.  If you don't define this macro, the default is to use
<var>class</var>, unchanged. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>LIMIT_RELOAD_CLASS</b> (<var>mode, class</var>)<var><a name="index-LIMIT_005fRELOAD_005fCLASS-1846"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>A C expression that places additional restrictions on the register class
to use when it is necessary to be able to hold a value of mode
<var>mode</var> in a reload register for which class <var>class</var> would
ordinarily be used.

      <p>Unlike <code>PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS</code>, this macro should be used when
there are certain modes that simply can't go in certain reload classes.

      <p>The value is a register class; perhaps <var>class</var>, or perhaps another,
smaller class.

      <p>Don't define this macro unless the target machine has limitations which
require the macro to do something nontrivial.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>SECONDARY_RELOAD_CLASS</b> (<var>class, mode, x</var>)<var><a name="index-SECONDARY_005fRELOAD_005fCLASS-1847"></a></var><br>
&mdash; Macro: <b>SECONDARY_INPUT_RELOAD_CLASS</b> (<var>class, mode, x</var>)<var><a name="index-SECONDARY_005fINPUT_005fRELOAD_005fCLASS-1848"></a></var><br>
&mdash; Macro: <b>SECONDARY_OUTPUT_RELOAD_CLASS</b> (<var>class, mode, x</var>)<var><a name="index-SECONDARY_005fOUTPUT_005fRELOAD_005fCLASS-1849"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Many machines have some registers that cannot be copied directly to or
from memory or even from other types of registers.  An example is the
`<samp><span class="samp">MQ</span></samp>' register, which on most machines, can only be copied to or
from general registers, but not memory.  Some machines allow copying all
registers to and from memory, but require a scratch register for stores
to some memory locations (e.g., those with symbolic address on the RT,
and those with certain symbolic address on the SPARC when compiling
PIC).  In some cases, both an intermediate and a scratch register are
required.

      <p>You should define these macros to indicate to the reload phase that it may
need to allocate at least one register for a reload in addition to the
register to contain the data.  Specifically, if copying <var>x</var> to a
register <var>class</var> in <var>mode</var> requires an intermediate register,
you should define <code>SECONDARY_INPUT_RELOAD_CLASS</code> to return the
largest register class all of whose registers can be used as
intermediate registers or scratch registers.

      <p>If copying a register <var>class</var> in <var>mode</var> to <var>x</var> requires an
intermediate or scratch register, <code>SECONDARY_OUTPUT_RELOAD_CLASS</code>
should be defined to return the largest register class required.  If the
requirements for input and output reloads are the same, the macro
<code>SECONDARY_RELOAD_CLASS</code> should be used instead of defining both
macros identically.

      <p>The values returned by these macros are often <code>GENERAL_REGS</code>. 
Return <code>NO_REGS</code> if no spare register is needed; i.e., if <var>x</var>
can be directly copied to or from a register of <var>class</var> in
<var>mode</var> without requiring a scratch register.  Do not define this
macro if it would always return <code>NO_REGS</code>.

      <p>If a scratch register is required (either with or without an
intermediate register), you should define patterns for
`<samp><span class="samp">reload_in</span><var>m</var></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">reload_out</span><var>m</var></samp>', as required
(see <a href="Standard-Names.html#Standard-Names">Standard Names</a>.  These patterns, which will normally be
implemented with a <code>define_expand</code>, should be similar to the
`<samp><span class="samp">mov</span><var>m</var></samp>' patterns, except that operand 2 is the scratch
register.

      <p>Define constraints for the reload register and scratch register that
contain a single register class.  If the original reload register (whose
class is <var>class</var>) can meet the constraint given in the pattern, the
value returned by these macros is used for the class of the scratch
register.  Otherwise, two additional reload registers are required. 
Their classes are obtained from the constraints in the insn pattern.

      <p><var>x</var> might be a pseudo-register or a <code>subreg</code> of a
pseudo-register, which could either be in a hard register or in memory. 
Use <code>true_regnum</code> to find out; it will return &minus;1 if the pseudo is
in memory and the hard register number if it is in a register.

      <p>These macros should not be used in the case where a particular class of
registers can only be copied to memory and not to another class of
registers.  In that case, secondary reload registers are not needed and
would not be helpful.  Instead, a stack location must be used to perform
the copy and the <code>mov</code><var>m</var> pattern should use memory as an
intermediate storage.  This case often occurs between floating-point and
general registers.

<blockquote><p>Certain machines have the property that some registers cannot be copied
to some other registers without using memory.  Define this macro on
those machines to be a C expression that is nonzero if objects of mode

<blockquote><p>Normally when <code>SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED</code> is defined, the compiler

<blockquote><p>When the compiler needs a secondary memory location to copy between two
registers of mode <var>mode</var>, it normally allocates sufficient memory to
hold a quantity of <code>BITS_PER_WORD</code> bits and performs the store and
load operations in a mode that many bits wide and whose class is the
same as that of <var>mode</var>.

      <p>This is right thing to do on most machines because it ensures that all
bits of the register are copied and prevents accesses to the registers
in a narrower mode, which some machines prohibit for floating-point
registers.

      <p>However, this default behavior is not correct on some machines, such as
the DEC Alpha, that store short integers in floating-point registers
differently than in integer registers.  On those machines, the default
widening will not work correctly and you must define this macro to
suppress that widening in some cases.  See the file <samp><span class="file">alpha.h</span></samp> for
details.

      <p>Do not define this macro if you do not define

      <p>Define <code>SMALL_REGISTER_CLASSES</code> to be an expression with a nonzero

registers were needed for spill registers.  If this macro returns nonzero
for those classes, those pseudos will only be allocated by
<samp><span class="file">global.c</span></samp>, which knows how to reallocate the pseudo to another
register.  If there would not be another register available for
reallocation, you should not change the definition of this macro since
the only effect of such a definition would be to slow down register
allocation.

      <p>This is closely related to the macro <code>HARD_REGNO_NREGS</code>.  In fact,
the value of the macro <code>CLASS_MAX_NREGS (</code><var>class</var><code>, </code><var>mode</var><code>)</code>

floating-point registers on the Alpha extends them to 64 bits. 
Therefore loading a 64-bit object and then storing it as a 32-bit object
does not store the low-order 32 bits, as would be the case for a normal
