 <P>Use the component window to edit a component. There are three basic things you add to a            
 component: HTML elements, variables, and methods. You add HTML elements in the upper               
 display of the component window by dragging them from a palette. You add variables and             
 methods to the bottom of the window by clicking the add variable and add method buttons in         
 the bottom half of the window. Finally, you edit methods using the Script window, which you can    
 see if you click the script button.
