<b>NAME</b>
       Mac::Memory - MacOS Memory Manager

       Provide the MacPerl interface to the memory management routines in the MacOS.

       Access to Inside Macintosh is essential for proper use of these functions.  Explanations of terms,
       processes and procedures are provided there.  Any attempt to use these functions without guidance can
       cause severe errors in your machine, including corruption of data. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>warned.</b>

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       The Memory module defines Ptr and Handle classes, and function interfaces to the memory management.

           use Mac::Memory;
           $handle = new Handle;
           $handle2 = NewHandle;

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The following packages and functions provide low level access to the memory management functions.

       <b>Handle</b>

       Handle provides an object interface to do simple operations on MacOS handles.  The interface is
       simpler than the more general memory management functions.

       new
       new STRING
           Create a new handle and return it. Copy $STRING into the handle if present.  Return a 0 value if
           a handle could not be created.

               $h = new Handle;
               $hs = new Handle("This string will now exist in hyperspace");

       size
           Return the size of a handle (i.e., its data portion).

               die unless (new Handle)-&gt;size == 0;
               die unless $hs-&gt;size == 40;

       append DATA
           Appends the DATA to the end of the handle and returns the success as the result.

               $h-&gt;append("This string will now exist in hyperspace");
               die unless $h-&gt;size == 40;

       set OFFSET, LENGTH, DATA
       set OFFSET, LENGTH
       set OFFSET
       set Munge the contents of the handle with the $DATA (deleting if not present), for the $LENGTH
           (through to the end of the handle contents if not present), starting at $OFFSET (the beginning if
           not present).

               $h-&gt;set(5, 6, "datum");

           yields

               "This datum will now exist in hyperspace"

       get OFFSET, LENGTH
       get OFFSET
       get Return a datum which is the contents of the memory referenced by $HANDLE, starting at $OFFSET
           (default zero), of length $LENGTH (default the rest of the handle).

               die unless $hs-&gt;get(5, 6) eq "string";

       address
           Return the address of the memory block.

       state
       state NEWSTATE
           Return the (locked) state of the handle, or return TRUE if the $NEWSTATE of the handle is
           installed.

               my $state = $h-&gt;state;
               HLock($h);
               # bunch of operations requiring $h to be locked
               $h-&gt;state($state);  # so nested locks exit properly

           More than the lock state is stored here, so restoring the actual state on leaving a scope is
           required.

       open MODE
           Open a stream to a handle and return it.

           NOT DEFINED AT THE MOMENT

           SysRet _open(hand, mode)      Handle    hand      int       mode      CODE:      RETVAL =
           OpenHandle(hand, mode);      OUTPUT:      RETVAL

       dispose
           Disposes of the handle.  Return zero if no error was detected.

       Almost all of the memory management needs in MacPerl can be handled by the above interface

       <b>Ptr</b>

       Ptr provides an object interface to do simple operations on MacOS pointers (nonrelocatable heap
       blocks). There are very few good reasons to create pointers like this.

       size
           Return the size of a pointer (i.e., its data portion).

               die unless $ptr-&gt;size == 40;

       set OFFSET, DATA
       get OFFSET, LENGTH
       get OFFSET
       get Return a datum which is the contents of the memory referenced by PTR, starting at $OFFSET
           (default zero), of length $LENGTH (default the rest of the block).

               die unless $ps-&gt;get(5, 6) eq "string";

       address
           Return the address of the memory block.

       dispose
           Disposes of the block.  Return zero if no error was detected.

       <b>Functions</b>


       GetApplLimit
           <b>Mac</b> <b>OS</b> <b>only.</b>

           The GetApplLimit function returns the current application heap limit.

       TopMem
           Return a pointer to the top of memory for the application.

       NewHandle BYTECOUNT
       NewHandleSys BYTECOUNT
       NewHandleClear BYTECOUNT
       NewHandleSysClear BYTECOUNT
           <b>Mac</b> <b>OS</b> <b>only.</b> (NewHandleSys, NewHandleSysClear)

           Return a handle of $BYTECOUNT size.

           NewHandleSys returns a handle in the system heap.

           The NewHandleClear and NewHandleSysClear functions work much as the NewHandle and NewHandleSys
           functions do but set all bytes in the new block to 0 instead of leaving the contents of the block
           undefined.  Currently, this is quite inefficient.

       NewPtr BYTECOUNT
       NewPtrSys BYTECOUNT
           <b>Mac</b> <b>OS</b> <b>only.</b>

       NewPtrClear BYTECOUNT
       NewPtrSysClear BYTECOUNT
           <b>Mac</b> <b>OS</b> <b>only.</b> (NewPtrSys, NewPtrSysClear)

           Allocate a nonrelocatable block of memory of a specified size.

           NewPtrSys and NewPtrSysClear allocate blocks in the system heap.

           NewPtrClear and NewPtrSysClear allocate and zero the blocks (inefficiently).

       MaxBlock
       MaxBlockSys
           <b>Mac</b> <b>OS</b> <b>only.</b> (MaxBlockSys)

           The MaxBlock function returns the maximum contiguous space, in bytes, that you could obtain after
           compacting the current heap zone. MaxBlock does not actually do the compaction.

           MaxBlockSys does the same for the system heap.

       StackSpace
           The StackSpace function returns the current amount of stack space (in bytes) between the current
           stack pointer and the application heap at the instant of return from the trap.

       NewEmptyHandle
       NewEmptyHandleSys
           <b>Mac</b> <b>OS</b> <b>only.</b> (NewEmptyHandleSys)

           The NewEmptyHandle function initializes a new handle by allocating a master pointer for it, but
           it does not allocate any memory for the handle to control.  NewEmptyHandle sets the handle's
           master pointer to NIL.

           NewEmptyHandleSys does the same for the system heap.

       HLock HANDLE
           Lock a relocatable block so that it does not move in the heap. If you plan to dereference a
           handle and then allocate, move, or purge memory (or call a routine that does so), then you should
           lock the handle before using the dereferenced handle.

       HUnlock HANDLE
           Unlock a relocatable block so that it is free to move in its heap zone.

       HPurge HANDLE
           Mark a relocatable block so that it can be purged if a memory request cannot be fulfilled after
           compaction.

       HNoPurge HANDLE
           Mark a relocatable block so that it cannot be purged.

       HLockHi HANDLE
           The HLockHi procedure attempts to move the relocatable block referenced by the handle $HANDLE
           upward until it reaches a nonrelocatable block, a locked relocatable block, or the top of the
           heap. Then HLockHi locks the block.

       TempNewHandle BYTECOUNT
           The TempNewHandle function returns a handle to a block of size $BYTECOUNT from temporary memory.
           If it cannot allocate a block of that size, the function returns NIL.

       TempMaxMem
           The TempMaxMem function compacts the current heap zone and returns the size of the largest
           contiguous block available for temporary allocation.

               $SIZE = &amp;TempMaxMem;

       TempFreeMem
           The TempFreeMem function returns the total amount of free temporary memory that you could
           allocate by calling TempNewHandle. The returned value is the total number of free bytes. Because
           these bytes might be dispersed throughout memory, it is ordinarily not possible to allocate a
           single relocatable block of that size.

               $SIZE = &amp;TempFreeMem;

       CompactMem BYTECOUNT
       CompactMemSys BYTECOUNT
           <b>Mac</b> <b>OS</b> <b>only.</b> (CompactMemSys)

           The CompactMem function compacts the current heap zone by moving unlocked, relocatable blocks
           down until they encounter nonrelocatable blocks or locked, relocatable blocks, but not by purging
           blocks. It continues compacting until it either finds a contiguous block of at least $BYTECOUNT
           free bytes or has compacted the entire zone.

           The CompactMem function returns the size, in bytes, of the largest contiguous free block for
           which it could make room, but it does not actually allocate that block.

           CompactMemSys does the same for the system heap.

       PurgeMem BYTECOUNT
       PurgeMemSys BYTECOUNT
           <b>Mac</b> <b>OS</b> <b>only.</b> (PurgeMemSys)

           The PurgeMem procedure sequentially purges blocks from the current heap zone until it either
           allocates a contiguous block of at least $BYTECOUNT free bytes or has purged the entire zone. If
           it purges the entire zone without creating a contiguous block of at least $BYTECOUNT free bytes,
           PurgeMem generates a memFullErr.

           The PurgeMem procedure purges only relocatable, unlocked, purgeable blocks.

           The PurgeMem procedure does not actually attempt to allocate a block of  $BYTECOUNT bytes.

           PurgeMemSys does the same for the system heap.

       FreeMem
       FreeMemSys
           <b>Mac</b> <b>OS</b> <b>only.</b> (FreeMemSys)

           The FreeMem function returns the total amount of free space (in bytes) in the current heap zone.
           Note that it usually isn't possible to allocate a block of that size, because of heap
           fragmentation due to nonrelocatable or locked blocks.

           FreeMemSys does the same for the system heap.

       ReserveMem BYTECOUNT
       ReserveMemSys BYTECOUNT
           <b>Mac</b> <b>OS</b> <b>only.</b> (ReserveMemSys)

           The ReserveMem procedure attempts to create free space for a block of $BYTECOUNT contiguous
           logical bytes at the lowest possible position in the current heap zone. It pursues every
           available means of placing the block as close as possible to the bottom of the zone, including
           moving other relocatable blocks upward, expanding the zone (if possible), and purging blocks from
           it.

           ReserveMemSys does the same for the system heap.

       MaxMem
       MaxMemSys
           <b>Mac</b> <b>OS</b> <b>only.</b> (MaxMemSys)

           Use the MaxMem function to compact and purge the current heap zone. The values returned are the
           amount of memory available and the amount by which the zone can grow.

               ($SIZE, $GROW) = &amp;MaxMem;

           MaxMemSys does the purge and compact of the system heap zone, and the $GROW value is set to zero.

       MoveHHi HANDLE
           The MoveHHi procedure attempts to move the relocatable block referenced by the handle $HANDLE
           upward until it reaches a nonrelocatable block, a locked relocatable block, or the top of the
           heap.

       DisposePtr PTR
           Releases the memory occupied by the nonrelocatable block specified by $PTR.

       GetPtrSize PTR
           The GetPtrSize function returns the logical size, in bytes, of the nonrelocatable block pointed
           to by $PTR.

       SetPtrSize PTR, NEWSIZE
           The SetPtrSize procedure attempts to change the logical size of the nonrelocatable block pointed
           to by $PTR. The new logical size is specified by $NEWSIZE.  Return zero if no error was detected.

       DisposeHandle HANDLE
           The DisposeHandle procedure releases the memory occupied by the relocatable block whose handle is
           $HANDLE. It also frees the handle's master pointer for other uses.

       SetHandleSize HANDLE, BYTECOUNT
           The SetHandleSize procedure attempts to change the logical size of the relocatable block whose
           handle is $HANDLE. The new logical size is specified by $BYTECOUNT.  Return zero if no error was
           detected.

       GetHandleSize HANDLE
           The GetHandleSize function returns the logical size, in bytes, of the relocatable block whose
           handle is $HANDLE. In case of an error, GetHandleSize returns 0.

       ReallocateHandle HANDLE, BYTECOUNT
           Allocates a new relocatable block with a logical size of $BYTECOUNT bytes. It updates the handle
           $HANDLE by setting its master pointer to point to the new block.  The new block is unlocked and
           unpurgeable.  Return zero if no error was detected.

       EmptyHandle
           Free memory taken by a relocatable block without freeing the relocatable block's master pointer
           for other uses.

       MoreMasters
           Call the MoreMasters procedure several times at the beginning of your program to prevent the
           Memory Manager from running out of master pointers in the middle of application execution. If it
           does run out, it allocates more, possibly causing heap fragmentation.

       BlockMove SOURCEPTR, DESTPTR, BYTECOUNT
       BlockMoveData SOURCEPTR, DESTPTR, BYTECOUNT
           The BlockMove/BlockMoveData procedure moves a block of $BYTECOUNT consecutive bytes from the
           address designated by $SOURCEPTR to that designated by $DESTPTR.

       PurgeSpace
           Determine the total amount of free memory and the size of the largest allocatable block after a
           purge of the heap.

               ($Total, $Contiguous) = &amp;PurgeSpace;

       HGetState HANDLE
           Get the current properties of a relocatable block (perhaps so that you can change and then later
           restore those properties).

       HSetState HANDLE, STATE
           Restore properties of a block after a call to HGetState.

       HandToHand HANDLE
           The HandToHand function attempts to copy the information in the relocatable block to which
           $HANDLE is a handle.  Return "undef" if an error was detected.

       PtrToHand PTR, BYTECOUNT
           The PtrToHand function returns a newly created handle to a copy of the number of bytes specified
           by $BYTECOUNT, beginning at the location specified by $PTR.  Return "undef" if an error was
           detected.

       PtrToXHand HANDLE, PTR, BYTECOUNT
           The PtrToXHand function makes the existing handle, specified by $HANDLE, a handle to a copy of
           the number of bytes specified by $BYTECOUNT, beginning at the location specified by $PTR.  Return
           "undef" if an error was detected.

       HandAndHand AHNDLE, BHNDLE
           The HandAndHand function concatenates the information from the relocatable block to which $AHNDL
           is a handle onto the end of the relocatable block to which $BHNDL is a handle. The $AHNDL
           variable remains unchanged.  Return zero if no error was detected.

       PtrAndHand PTR, HANDLE, BYTECOUNT
           The PtrAndHand function takes the number of bytes specified by $BYTECOUNT, beginning at the
           location specified by $PTR, and concatenates them onto the end of the relocatable block to which
           $HANDLE is a handle.

       The low level interface is not likely to be needed, except for the <u>HLock()</u> function.
