 * SimplePing
 *****************************************************
 * Purpose:  This function uses the above functions to ping a given remote host with
 * a given number of packets and with a given timeout to wait for responses on each packet.
 * Note this function does not require root permissions since on MacOSX 10.2.x pings are
 * possible using non-privileged datagram sockets.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *  HostToPing     A C-String describing the remote host.  On calling
 * SimplePing this variable will hold a description of the host as a C-String.  The string
 * can either be a hostname (e.g. www.google.com) or an IP address (e.g. 17.203.23.111)
 *
 *   NumberOfPacketsToSend  An integer.  On calling SimplePing this variable holds
 * the number of ping packets to send to the host before stopping.
 *
 *   PingTimeoutInSeconds  An integer.  On calling Simple Ping this variable holds
 * the amount of time SimplePing will wait for responses from the ping before going onto the next packet.
 *
 *   ReturnimmediatelyAfterReply An integer.  On calling Simple Ping if this variable is zero then 
 * we will wait for the timeout to occur even if we get the appropriate ping reply (waiting for any other packets).
 * If this variable is non-zero then simple ping will return immediately after getting the appropriate ping reply to
 * the request.
 *
 *   *Function Result*   A UNIX error integer return value as described in:
 *        /usr/include/sys/errno.h on a BSD system.
 *         Note: This value will be zero on success.

 * WaitAndPrintICMPs
 *****************************************************
 * Purpose:  This function creates an ICMP packet with the necessary information
 * inside of it to make it a ping packet.  This function also sends that ping packet to
 * the remote host.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *  SocketConnectionToHost A socket descriptor expressed as an integer.  On calling
 * WaitAndPrintICMPs this variable will be a valid socket which is already setup
 * for communicating with the remote host.  This will be used in getting the reply
 * packets from the host.
 *
 *   TimeoutInSeconds  A timeout expressed as an integer.  On calling 
 * WaitAndPrintICMPs this variable will have the number of seconds to wait for
 * ICMP replies.  Note even if a valid ICMP reply comes that matches what we expect
 * we will still wait for additional ICMP packets until the timeout has occurred.
 *
 *   ReturnimmediatelyAfterReply An integer.  On calling WaitAndPrintICMPs if this variable is zero then 
 * we will wait for the timeout to occur even if we get the appropriate ping reply (waiting for any other packets).
 * If this variable is non-zero then simple ping will return immediately after getting the appropriate ping reply to
 * the request.
 *
 *   GotResponse    A pre-allocated integer.  when calling WaitAndPrintICMPs
 * this variable will be a pre-allocated integer.  On successful return from WaitAndPrintICMPs this
 * variable will hold a value of 1 if a ICMP packet response to our ping was received.
 * And a zero otherwise.  On failed return the value of this variable will be undefined.
 *
 *   *Function Result*   A UNIX error integer return value as described in:
 *        /usr/include/sys/errno.h on a BSD system.
 *         Note: This value will be zero on success.
