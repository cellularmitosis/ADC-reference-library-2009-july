/**********************************************************************	SetDefaultDTP		This application demonstrates how to send an AppleEvent to the Finder	that will cause a new default desktop printer to be selected.		The user interface consists of a dialog that collects a string that	is the name of a desktop printer. Upon hitting the default button,	the application forms an AppleEvent and sends it off to the Finder.  The AppleEvent is constructed by getting the address of the Finder,  generating a core event to a Finder extension, and adding a direct  object which specifies the GX printing extension, the set default  printer command, and the desktop printer name.		If the Printing Finder Extension (part of QuickDraw GX) is installed  and a valid desktop printer was specified then that printer should  become the default printer.	/**********************************************************************
