<H1><A NAME=MARKER-9-42></A><A NAME=MARKER-2-43></A>Document Operations</H1>
 MacApp provides built-in machinery for document operations such as creating a new document, opening an existing document, saving a document, reverting to a previous version of a document, and closing a document. You add code to perform operations such as reading and writing your document's specific data and creating views to display that data.<P>
 MacApp's default behavior is to create a new document when an application is launched. A user can also create a new document by choosing New from the File menu or typing Command-N. The application can also receive an Apple event specifying creation of a new document. In each of these situations, MacApp calls the application object's <CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-44></A>OpenNew</CODE> method to create the new document. <P>
 The <CODE>TApplication::OpenNew</CODE> method first calls the application object's <CODE>DoMakeDocument</CODE> method to create a document, then calls several methods of the returned document object, including the <CODE>DoMakeViews</CODE> method, which creates views for the document. This process is described in <A HREF=#MARKER-9-53>"Creating a New Document," beginning on page 170</A>.<P>
 Your application class overrides <CODE>DoMakeDocument</CODE> to make the kinds of documents it needs. This mechanism works for many different types of documents--you override <CODE>OpenNew</CODE> only if you want to implement a nonstandard way of creating a new document.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING60-5></A>
<H2><A NAME=MARKER-2-45></A>How MacApp Document Classes Work With Files</H2>
 MacApp supports disk-based file operations--reading from disk, writing to disk, checking for disk space to save the document's contents, and so on--through the interaction of three classes: <CODE>TFile</CODE>, <A NAME=MARKER-2-46></A><CODE>TFileHandler</CODE>, and <CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-47></A>TFileBasedDocument</CODE>.<P>
 MacApp supplies the <CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-48></A>TFile</CODE> class to manage low-level File Manager calls. The <CODE>TFile</CODE> class contains fields and methods for opening, closing, moving, renaming, and deleting a file, and for performing low-level operations such as getting a volume name or reference number, or setting the creation date or file permissions.<P>
 You can specify a disk file to the File Manager with three pieces of information: a volume reference number, a directory ID, and a filename. The <CODE>TFile</CODE> class uses these three pieces of information to identify the file it manages, storing the information in the <CODE>fFileSpec</CODE> field.<P>
 When a new document based on the <CODE>TFileBasedDocument</CODE> class is initialized, the <CODE>IFileBasedDocument</CODE> method creates both a <CODE>TFile</CODE> object and a <CODE>TFileHandler</CODE> object for the document; for an existing document, a <CODE>TFile</CODE> object is passed in to <CODE>IFileBasedDocument</CODE>. The document's file-handler field manages disk file access, calling methods of its <CODE>TFile</CODE> object to make the low-level file system input and output calls. Methods of the file handler also call methods of the document, such as <CODE>DoRead</CODE> and <CODE>DoWrite</CODE>, passing a reference to the <CODE>TFile</CODE> object to do the low-level reading or writing.<P>
 A<CODE> TFileHandler</CODE> object can be associated with one or more instances of <CODE>TFile</CODE>, allowing the document to store and retrieve data in multiple formats from multiple disk files. MacApp's default behavior, however, assumes one file per document--more complex file handling is left as an exercise for the reader.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING60-11></A>
<H3><A NAME=MARKER-9-49></A>Kinds of Documents</H3>
 <A NAME=MARKER-2-50></A>MacApp defines command constants to allow your application to use a range of open and new commands:<P>
<PRE>
const CommandNumber cNew = 10;
const CommandNumber cNewLast = 19;
const CommandNumber cOpen = 20;
const CommandNumber cOpenLast = 29;
</PRE>
 MacApp uses the cNew constant for the New menu command in the File menu, but your application can use any value between cNew and cNewLast to specify particular versions of the New command. Similarly, MacApp uses cOpen for the Open menu command, but you can use any value between cOpen and cOpenLast. These menu command numbers are handled in the <CODE>TApplication::DoMenuCommand</CODE> method.<P>
 For a command number in the New range, <CODE>DoMenuCommand</CODE> calls the application object's <CODE>DoNew</CODE> method. The <CODE>DoNew</CODE> method creates and posts a <CODE>TNewDocumentCommand</CODE> object, which stores the command number in its <CODE>fIdentifier</CODE> field. The <CODE>DoIt</CODE> method of the command object calls the application's <CODE>OpenNew</CODE> method, passing the command number. The <CODE>OpenNew</CODE> method makes the following call to determine the kind of document that should be created:<P>
<PRE>
this-&gt;KindOfDocument(itsCommandNumber, NULL)
</PRE>
 In the <CODE>TApplication</CODE> class, <CODE>KindOfDocument</CODE> just returns the command number, which is passed on by <CODE>OpenNew</CODE> in a call to <CODE>DoMakeDocument</CODE>. Your application class always overrides <CODE>DoMakeDocument</CODE> to create the kinds of documents it knows about. Your application may create only one kind of document, or it may create different kinds depending on the command number passed by <CODE>OpenNew</CODE>. Your application class can also override <CODE>KindOfDocument</CODE> to return a special value based on the command number. The process of opening a new document is described in the next section.<P>
 MacApp uses a similar mechanism to open existing documents. For a menu command number in the Open range, the application object's <CODE>DoMenuCommand</CODE> method calls <CODE>DoOpen</CODE>, which creates a <CODE>TODocCommand</CODE> object. The command's <CODE>DoIt</CODE> method calls the application's <CODE>OpenOld</CODE> method. Like the <CODE>OpenNew</CODE> method, <CODE>OpenOld</CODE> calls <CODE>KindOfDocument</CODE> before calling <CODE>DoMakeDocument</CODE>. Opening an existing document is described beginning on <A HREF=#MARKER-9-67>page 173</A>.<A NAME=MARKER-2-51></A><P>
<A NAME=HEADING60-19></A>
<H3><A NAME=MARKER-2-52></A><A NAME=MARKER-9-53></A>Creating a New Document</H3>
 When a user creates a new document, the application object calls its <CODE>OpenNew</CODE> method, which in turn calls <CODE>DoMakeDocument</CODE>. In your application class, you override <CODE>DoMakeDocument</CODE> to create the kinds of documents your application uses. (Kinds of documents are described in the previous section.)<P>
 When the <CODE>OpenNew</CODE> method calls <CODE>DoMakeDocument</CODE>, the following actions take place, as shown in <A HREF=#MARKER-9-58>Figure 7-2</A>:<P>
<OL>
<LI>The <CODE>T<I>YourApplication::DoMakeDocument</I></CODE> method creates an instance of <CODE>T<I>YourDocument</I></CODE> and calls <CODE>I<I>YourDocument</I></CODE>. This allows your application to create the type of document it needs, and to perform any special initialization the document requires.
<LI>The <CODE>I<I>YourDocument</I></CODE> method calls <CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-55></A>IFileBasedDocument</CODE>.
<LI>The <CODE>IFileBasedDocument</CODE> method calls <CODE>this-&gt;DoMakeFile</CODE> and <CODE>this-&gt;<A NAME=MARKER-2-57></A>DoMakeFileHandler</CODE> to create an instance of <CODE>TFile</CODE> and an instance of <CODE>TFileHandler</CODE> for the document.<P>

<OL>
<LI><A NAME=MARKER-9-59></A>The <CODE>TFileBasedDocument::DoMakeFile</CODE> method calls <CODE>gApplication-&gt;DoMakeFile</CODE>, giving your application the flexibility to control file creation at the document or application level.

File forks are described in the next section.
<LI>After calling <CODE>DoMakeDocument</CODE> to create a new document, the <CODE>OpenNew</CODE> method calls the document's <CODE>DoInitialState</CODE> method to perform any special initialization.
<LI><CODE>OpenNew</CODE> calls the document's <CODE>DoMakeViews</CODE> method to create a window and other views for the document. It then calls the document's <CODE>UntitledName</CODE> and <CODE>SetTitle</CODE> methods to give the document a title (such as "Untitled 1").
<LI>Finally, <CODE>OpenNew</CODE> calls the document's <CODE>DoPostMakeViews</CODE> method, giving the document a chance to perform any final initialization at a time when all the views have been created.<P>
</OL>
 The next section describes how your application can modify the values passed to the <CODE>NewFile</CODE> routine (in step 5 above) to change MacApp's default file-handling behavior.<A NAME=MARKER-2-62></A><P>
<A NAME=HEADING60-35></A>
<H3><A NAME=MARKER-2-63></A>How a MacApp Document Uses File Forks</H3>
 A Macintosh file consists of two parts or forks: the data fork and the resource fork. The data fork generally stores data, and the resource fork stores resources, such as an application's menu resources. Documents generally use the data fork and applications use the resource fork.<P>
 When you create a document, you specify which file forks your application will use and whether it will keep the forks open. Keeping a file fork open is appropriate if your application must frequently access data in the fork. The default is to use both the data and resource forks, but not to keep them open. The call to <CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-64></A>NewFile</CODE> in step 5 above shows how the default values are set.<P>
 MacApp defines a Boolean constant for each of the values passed to <CODE>NewFile</CODE>, as shown in <A HREF=#MARKER-9-65>Table 7-1</A>.<P>
<B>Table 7-1  <A NAME=MARKER-9-65></A><B>Table 7-1 Constants passed as parameters to <CODE>NewFile</B>

</CODE></B><P>
 If MacApp's default file configuration is not appropriate for a particular document type in your application, you can override the <CODE>DoMakeFile</CODE> method of the document class. If you want to change the file configuration for all document types used by your application, you can override the <CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-66></A>DoMakeFile</CODE> method of your application class and pass different values to <CODE>NewFile</CODE>.<A NAME=MARKER-9-67></A><A NAME=MARKER-2-68></A><P>
<A NAME=HEADING60-41></A>
<H2><A NAME=MARKER-2-69></A>Opening an Existing Document</H2>
 A user may launch your application by selecting one or more documents in the Finder and double-clicking. When that happens, the operating system sends the application an Open Documents event with a file list containing an entry for each selected document. MacApp opens the documents through a series of calls to the application object's <CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-70></A>OpenOld</CODE> method. If the same type of Apple event is sent by a script, it is handled in a similar way.<P>
 A user can also open an existing document by choosing Open from the File menu or typing Command-O. MacApp presents a standard file dialog to obtain the name of the file to open. If the user chooses a document that is already open, MacApp displays the "Document is already open" message and brings the document's window or windows to the front. If the specified document is not open, MacApp again calls the application object's <CODE>OpenOld</CODE> method to open the document.<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Note</B>
<DD>The application object calls its <CODE>ChooseDocument</CODE> method to put up the standard file dialog. <CODE>ChooseDocument</CODE> calls <CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-62></A>GetStandardFileParameters</CODE>, which calls <CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-72></A>GetFileTypeList</CODE> (both methods of the application) to get a list of file types to display in the file dialog. <CODE>GetFileTypeList</CODE> uses only the application's <CODE>fMainFileType</CODE>, but you can override this method if your application uses more than one document type.<EM></EM>  <IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "graphics/diamond.gif">
</DL>
 The <CODE>TApplication::OpenOld</CODE> method is shown in <A HREF=#MARKER-9-78>Figure 7-3</A>, which illustrates how MacApp opens an existing document. It is similar to the <CODE>OpenNew</CODE> method, in that it first calls the application object's <CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-73></A>DoMakeDocument</CODE> method to create a document, then calls several methods of the returned document object. The main difference is that since it is opening an existing document, <CODE>OpenOld</CODE> calls the document's <CODE>DoRead</CODE> method to read the document's data before calling <CODE>DoMakeViews</CODE> to make the document's views. And since the <CODE>OpenOld</CODE> method already has a <CODE>TFile</CODE> object describing the document to be opened, the document doesn't need to create a new <CODE>TFile</CODE> object.<P>
 The document, file, and file-handler objects work together with a file stream object (not shown) to read the document's data from disk. File streams are described in <A HREF=MacAppProgGuide-27.html#MARKER-9-46>"Streams," beginning on page 50</A>.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING60-47></A>
<H2><A NAME=MARKER-2-75></A><A NAME=MARKER-9-76></A>Creating Views for a Document</H2>
 When a user creates a new document, opens an existing document, or prints a document from the Finder, MacApp calls the document object's <CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-77></A>DoMakeViews</CODE> method to create a view hierarchy to display the document's data. You override the default implementation of <CODE>DoMakeViews</CODE>, found in <CODE>TDocument</CODE>, to create the specialized views used by your documents.<P>
 In your <CODE>DoMakeViews</CODE> method, you can create view objects by calling the <CODE>new</CODE> routine and initializing the views procedurally. However, this approach has a significant disadvantage--each time you change the appearance of a view, you have to recompile and rebuild your application.<P>
<B>Figure 7-3  <A NAME=MARKER-9-78></A>Opening an existing document<A NAME=MARKER-2-61></A><A NAME=MARKER-2-80></A></B><P>
<IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "graphics/MacApp_PG-L-058.gif"><P>
 A better way to define most views is by using a <CODE>'<A NAME=MARKER-2-81></A>View'</CODE> resource definition in your application's resource file. Then you can use a graphical resource editor to change a view's appearance and the value of its instance variables without having to modify your code. For more information, see <A HREF=MacAppProgGuide-101.html#MARKER-9-58>"Specifying Views With View Resource Templates," beginning on page 217</A>.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING60-53></A>
<H2><A NAME=MARKER-2-82></A><A NAME=MARKER-9-83></A>Reverting to a Previous Version of a Document</H2>
 A user can choose the Revert command from the File menu to return the current document to its most recently saved version. The Revert command is handled by the document object's <CODE>DoMenuCommand</CODE> method:<P>
<OL>
<LI>The <CODE>TDocument::DoMenuCommand</CODE> method creates and posts a <CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-84></A>TRevertDocCommand</CODE> object.
<LI>The <CODE>DoIt</CODE> method of the <CODE>TRevertDocCommand</CODE> object calls the document's <CODE>RevertDocument</CODE> method, then calls its <CODE>ShowReverted</CODE> method. 
<LI>The <CODE>TFileBasedDocument::<A NAME=MARKER-2-85></A>RevertDocument</CODE> method<P>
<UL>
<LI>gives the user a chance to confirm before completing the revert operation, since a revert operation is not undoable; if the user confirms, it performs the next two steps:
<LI>calls the document's <CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-86></A>FreeData</CODE> method to free the current document's storage
<LI>re-reads the disk version of the document to get the most recently saved version; if there is no disk version, <CODE>RevertDocument</CODE> instead calls the <CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-87></A>DoInitialState</CODE> method of the document<P>
</UL>
<LI>The <CODE>TDocument::<A NAME=MARKER-2-88></A>ShowReverted</CODE> method iterates over all the document's windows, calling <CODE>ShowReverted</CODE> for each window, which in turn calls <CODE>ShowReverted</CODE> for each of the window's views. Some views, such as MacApp's <CODE>TTEView</CODE>, perform calculations or other operations when reverting.<P>
</OL>
 The default behavior of the <CODE>TRevertDocCommand</CODE> command is to send an Apple event specifying the revert document operation, so the reverting is recordable and can be handled by an attached script.<A NAME=MARKER-2-89></A><A NAME=MARKER-2-90></A><P>
<A NAME=HEADING60-63></A>
<H2><A NAME=MARKER-2-91></A>Determining Whether a Document Has Changed</H2>
 When a user closes a document, MacApp examines the <CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-92></A>fChangeCount</CODE> field of the document object to determine whether the document has changed since it was last saved. If the value of <CODE>fChangeCount</CODE> is greater than 0, the document is considered to be changed.<P>
 If you specify the document as the command's context when you use a command object to make changes to your document's data, the document's change count is updated automatically when the command's <CODE>DoIt</CODE>, <CODE>UndoIt</CODE>, or <CODE>RedoIt</CODE> method is called.<P>
 However, if you change the document's data through other mechanisms, you need to update the change count directly. You can do so in one of two ways:<P>
<UL>
<LI>By calling the document's <CODE>Changed</CODE> method. The <CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-93></A>Changed</CODE> method decrements the change count for an undo change (<CODE>cUndo</CODE>) and increments it for any other change. When the change count is incremented, it is always set to a positive value (a minimum of 1).
<LI>By setting the <CODE>fChangeCount</CODE> field directly through the method <CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-94></A>SetChangeCount</CODE>.<P>
</UL>
 When a user closes a document whose content has changed, MacApp displays an alert box with the "Save Changes Before Closing?" message and takes appropriate action based upon the user's choice:<P>
<DL>
<DT>Save
<DD> Closes the document and saves the changes
<DT>Don't Save
<DD> Closes the document but does not save the changes
<DT>Cancel
<DD> Cancels the close operation
<DT><B>Note</B>
<DD>You shouldn't normally use a document as a notifier to send messages to other objects through the dependency system. Calling Changed to broadcast a message also marks the document as changed (and in need of saving). Instead, have the document create a separate object that you can use as a notifier hub.<EM></EM>  <IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "graphics/diamond.gif">

<H2><A NAME=MARKER-2-95></A><A NAME=MARKER-9-96></A>Saving a Document</H2>
 When the user chooses Save from the File menu, the command is handled by the document object. Saving can be performed as a function of either the <CODE>TDocument</CODE> class or the <CODE>TFileBasedDocument</CODE> class. In this scenario, we consider the more common case of saving a file-based document. Saving the document is a cooperative task performed by the document, its file-handler object, and its file object, in the following series of steps:<P>
<OL>
<LI>The <CODE>TDocument::DoMenuCommand</CODE> method calls <CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-97></A>DoSave</CODE>.
<LI>The <CODE>TFileBasedDocument::DoSave</CODE> method creates, initializes, and posts a <CODE>TSaveFileDocCommand</CODE> object.
<LI>The initialization method of the <CODE>TSaveFileDocCommand</CODE> object performs any required interaction with the user, such as getting a name for the saved file.
<LI>When the command is performed, it creates and sends an Apple event describing the save operation. In this way the operation is recordable and can be handled by an attached script.
<LI>The <CODE>DoIt</CODE> method of the <CODE>TSaveFileDocCommand</CODE> object calls the document object's <CODE>SaveDocument</CODE> method. <A HREF=#MARKER-9-106>Figure 7-4</A> shows the steps that take place starting with the call to <CODE>SaveDocument</CODE>.
<LI>The <CODE>TFileBasedDocument::SaveDocument</CODE> method calls <CODE>aFileHandler-&gt;<A NAME=MARKER-2-99></A>SaveFile</CODE>.<P>

<IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "graphics/MacApp_PG-L-054.gif"><P>
A MacApp document's <CODE>DoWrite</CODE> method typically creates a file-based stream (not shown) and calls methods of the stream to write the data. The stream object calls the file's <CODE><A NAME=MARKER-9-122></A>WriteData</CODE> method to make the low-level calls that write the data to disk.<A NAME=MARKER-2-108></A><P>
<A NAME=HEADING60-93></A>
<H2><A NAME=MARKER-2-109></A><A NAME=MARKER-9-110></A>Saving a Document in Place</H2>
 When a user saves a document, the document's file handler can use its <CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-111></A>SaveViaTemp</CODE> method to create a copy of the existing document file before writing the new version or it can use its <CODE>SaveInPlace</CODE> method to save the data on top of the old version. Saving with a temporary file is safer since there is always a saved version of the file to fall back on. Saving in place can save a user's changes when there is not enough room to save with a temporary file.<P>
 MacApp's default behavior is to try to save with <CODE>SaveViaTemp</CODE> and, if that is not possible, to ask the user before saving with <CODE>SaveInPlace</CODE>. This behavior is controlled by the <CODE>fSaveInPlace</CODE> field of the document's file handler. The default is set in the <CODE>TFileHandler</CODE> constructor:<P>
<PRE>
fHowToSave = svtAskUser;
</PRE>
 To change the default behavior, you can set the value of <CODE>fHowToSave</CODE> in your <CODE>I<I>YourDocument</I></CODE> method after calling <CODE>IFileBasedDocument</CODE>. Here are the possible values for <CODE>fSaveInPlace</CODE>:<P>
<DL>
<DT><CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-112></A>svtAlways</CODE>
<DD> Always save with <CODE>SaveViaTemp</CODE>. Never overwrite the existing file.
<DT><CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-113></A>svtAskUser</CODE>

 By default, MacApp closes a document when a document window is closed if the window's <CODE>fClosesDocument</CODE> field has the value <CODE>TRUE</CODE>. MacApp closes the document when the last open window is closed, even if that window's <CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-157></A>fClosesDocument</CODE> field has the value <CODE>FALSE</CODE>. To modify this behavior, you can override the <CODE>TDocument::CloseWindow</CODE> method in your document class.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING60-106></A>
<H2><A NAME=MARKER-9-118></A><A NAME=MARKER-2-119></A>Closing a Document</H2>
 Most documents have one or more associated windows. A user typically closes a document by closing its window (or its last open window). A user can close a window by clicking the close box, choosing the Close menu command, typing Command-W, or quitting the application. In each of these cases, MacApp handles basic closing operations automatically. Your document class may have to do nothing more than provide a destructor routine to free any storage allocated by the class.<P>
 The application may also receive a Close Window or Close Document event from another application or from a script. Or it may receive a Quit Application event from the operating system, from another application, or from a script. Any of these Apple events can lead to document being closed, and again, most of the work of closing windows and documents is handled automatically by MacApp.<P>
 The next sections describe MacApp's mechanisms for closing a document.<P>

<H3><A NAME=MARKER-9-120></A>Closing a Document Directly</H3>
 When a user closes a window by clicking the close box, choosing the Close menu command, or typing Command-W, MacApp calls the window object's <CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-121></A>CloseByUser</CODE> method. If a window's <CODE>fClosesDocument</CODE> field has the value <CODE>TRUE</CODE> and that document is file based, calling <CODE>CloseByUser</CODE> results in the following sequence of steps:<P>
<OL>
<LI><A NAME=MARKER-9-122></A>The <CODE>TWindow::CloseByUser</CODE> method calls the <CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-123></A>CloseWindow</CODE> method of the window's document, if it has one.<A NAME=MARKER-10-14></A>
<LI>If the passed window belongs to the document and is the last open window, the <CODE>TDocument::CloseWindow</CODE> method calls its own <CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-125></A>DoClose</CODE> method; otherwise, it calls the window's <CODE>DoClose</CODE> method.
<LI>The <CODE>TFileBasedDocument::DoClose</CODE> method creates and posts a <CODE>TCloseFileDocCommand</CODE> object. <P>
For a <CODE>TDocument</CODE> object, the <CODE>DoClose</CODE> method creates and posts a <CODE>TCloseDocCommand</CODE> object. Both versions set the command object's <CODE>fUseAppleEvent</CODE> field to <CODE>TRUE</CODE>. But the <CODE>TCloseFileDocCommand</CODE> object performs additional steps to save the document on disk, including creating a file-handler object.<P>
The following steps examine only the <CODE>TCloseFileDocCommand</CODE> class.
<LI>If necessary, the <CODE>TCloseFileDocCommand::<A NAME=MARKER-10-5></A>ICloseFileDocCommand</CODE> method calls the file handler's <CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-129></A>RequestFileName</CODE> routine to obtain a name and location for saving the document.
<LI>When <CODE>TCloseFileDocCommand</CODE> is performed, it sends an Apple event describing the close operation (<A NAME=MARKER-9-130></A>because <CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-131></A>fUseAppleEvent</CODE> was set to <CODE>TRUE</CODE> in a previous step). This makes the close operation recordable and gives any attached script a chance to handle the operation.
<LI>The <CODE>TCloseFileDocCommand::DoIt</CODE> method<P>
<UL>
<LI>may call <CODE>fDocument-&gt;<A NAME=MARKER-2-132></A>PoseSaveDialog</CODE> to ask the user to confirm saving the file
<LI>may call <CODE>aFileDocument-&gt;<A NAME=MARKER-2-133></A>SaveDocument</CODE> to save the file (see <A HREF=#MARKER-9-96>"Saving a Document," beginning on page 177</A>)
<LI>calls <CODE>fDocument-&gt;<A NAME=MARKER-2-134></A>CloseAndFree</CODE> to close and free the document object (<CODE>CloseAndFree</CODE> first calls the document's <CODE>Close</CODE> method, then its <CODE>Free</CODE> method)<P>
</UL>
<LI>The <CODE>TFileBasedDocument::<A NAME=MARKER-2-135></A>Close</CODE> method may ask the user whether to save the document. It may also call <CODE>SaveDocument</CODE> to save the document, if it wasn't already saved in the previous step. Finally, it calls <CODE>Inherited</CODE>.
<LI>The <CODE>TDocument::Close</CODE> method calls <CODE>CloseAndFree</CODE> on each of the document's windows.
<LI>Calling <CODE>Free</CODE> on a document or window object causes the object to be deleted, a process that in turn causes the object's destructor method to be called. The destructor method frees any memory allocated by the object.<P>
</OL>
<A NAME=HEADING60-126></A>
<H3>Closing a Document With a Close Document or Close Window Event</H3>
 When an application receives a Close Document Apple event, it dispatches the event to the specified document's <CODE><A NAME=MARKER-10-6></A>DoAEClose</CODE> method. The <CODE>DoAEClose</CODE> method of the <CODE>TDocument</CODE> class creates a <CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-137></A>TCloseDocCommand</CODE> object; in <CODE>TFileBasedDocument</CODE>, <CODE>DoAEClose</CODE> creates a <CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-138></A>TCloseFileDocCommand</CODE> object. In either case, the command is performed immediately. The command closes and frees the document, as described in the previous section. One difference in closing the document with an Apple event is that function overloading is used to specify a different version of <CODE>ICloseFileDocCommand</CODE> (or <CODE><A NAME=MARKER-10-15></A>ICloseDocCommand</CODE>)--one whose parameter list includes message and reply Apple events. Another difference is that the command does not send an Apple event when it is performed, since it is already being performed in response to a received Apple event.<P>
 When an application receives a Close Window Apple event, it dispatches the event to the specified window's <CODE>DoAEClose</CODE> method. If the window closes its document (the <CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-140></A>fClosesDocument</CODE> field has the value <CODE>TRUE</CODE>), the window's <CODE>DoAEClose</CODE> method calls the document's <CODE>DoAEClose</CODE> method, with the same result described in the previous paragraph. <P>
<A NAME=HEADING60-129></A>
<H3><A NAME=MARKER-9-141></A>Closing a Document When Quitting the Application</H3>
 When a user quits the application, the application object's <CODE>DoMenuCommand</CODE> method creates a <CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-142></A>TQuitCommand</CODE> object and posts it to the command queue. When the application receives a Quit Application event from the operating system or from a script, the application object's <CODE>DoAEClose</CODE> method creates a <CODE>TQuitCommand</CODE> object and performs it immediately. In both cases, the <CODE>DoIt</CODE> method of the <CODE>TQuitCommand</CODE> command closes and frees all documents and windows before closing the application.<P>
 A <CODE>TQuitCommand</CODE> object makes and processes other command objects so that Apple events to close all the open windows and documents will be recorded before the event to close the application. This is done so that a recorded script can be played back and the same actions will happen in the same order, including Save/Don't Save choices and save file locations specified by the user, without having to prompt the user again.<P>
 The <CODE>TQuitCommand</CODE> performs the following steps:<P>
<OL>
<LI>The <CODE>TQuitCommand</CODE>::<CODE>DoIt</CODE> method calls three of its own methods:<P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>DoCloseInWindowOrder</CODE>
<LI><CODE>DoCloseWindowlessDocuments</CODE>
<LI>DoCloseApplication<P>
</UL>
<LI>The <CODE>DoCloseInWindowOrder</CODE> method iterates through all open windows. If a window has a document, it calls the <CODE>TQuitCommand::CloseADocument</CODE> method. <CODE><A NAME=MARKER-10-3></A>CloseADocument</CODE> calls the document's <CODE>MakeCloseCommand</CODE> method, then immediately processes the returned command to close the document.<P>
After executing the <CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-145></A>DoCloseInWindowOrder</CODE> method, all windows are closed and all documents that had open windows are closed.
<LI>The <CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-146></A>DoCloseWindowlessDocuments</CODE> method iterates over each remaining document in the application, calling the document's <CODE>MakeCloseCommand</CODE> method, then immediately processing the returned command to close the document. <CODE>DoCloseWindowlessDocuments</CODE> doesn't really care if the document is windowless or not, but all documents with windows should have been closed by now.
<LI>Now that all windows and documents have been closed, the <A NAME=MARKER-2-147></A>DoCloseApplication method creates and processes a <CODE>TQuitAppCommand</CODE> to finish quitting the application.<A NAME=MARKER-2-148></A><A NAME=MARKER-2-149></A><P>
</OL>

<H2><A NAME=MARKER-2-150></A><A NAME=MARKER-9-151></A>A Note on Ghost Documents</H2>
 MacApp's scripting support allows an application to get and set properties of objects, including document objects. In the course of determining the object specified by an Apple event, it may be necessary to count the number of documents. To do so, MacApp works with the application object's document list. However, in some cases the document list may contain a reference to a document that should not be considered when dispatching Apple events. For example, the application may have created a document solely to help in displaying Clipboard data.<P>
 A ghost document is a document that should not be visible to the AppleScript interface. The <CODE>TDocument</CODE> class defines a Boolean field, <CODE>fIsGhostDocument</CODE>, to identify ghost documents. If the <CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-152></A>fIsGhostDocument</CODE> field has the value <CODE>TRUE</CODE>, the document is not considered as a possible Apple event object. MacApp supplies the <CODE>CNoGhostDocsIterator</CODE> class to iterate over a list of documents, returning only those documents whose <CODE>fIsGhostDocument</CODE> field has the value <CODE>FALSE</CODE> (the default value).<A NAME=MARKER-2-153></A><P>
