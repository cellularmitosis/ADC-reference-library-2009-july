<H2><A NAME=MARKER-9-475></A>Installing Modifications to a Script System</H2>
 <A NAME=MARKER-2-945></A>Applications that are written to take advantage of the Macintosh script management system function correctly regardless of the localized version of Macintosh system software under which they run. However, it is also possible to tailor an individual application for a specific script system or set of scripts, or for a specific regional variation of the system script or other script.<P>
 To do so may require installing a new script system or a modified set of resources to replace those of a currently installed script system. (This is especially true if your target region is not already supported by a localized version of system software.) Either way usually involves modifying the System file. The Apple Computer system software licensing policy forbids shipping a modified System file, so you cannot install your replacement resources in a System file and ship it with your application. However, there are three other approaches you can take:<P>
<UL>
<LI>If you create individual modified versions of an installed script system's resources--in order to implement region-specific sorting or formatting conventions--you can attach those resources to your application and have them replace the existing script system's resources whenever your application is running.<P>
This method requires no modifications to the System file at all. For specific instructions, see the discussion on replacing a script system's default international resources in the chapter "Script Manager" in this book.
<LI>If you want individual resources permanently installed in the System file, you <BR>can have the user run the Installer to install your resources. Contact Macintosh Developer Technical Support for information on how to use the Installer. The user <BR>will then be able to select or deselect your resources as defaults through the Text, Numbers, and Date &amp; Time control panels. See <A HREF=Text-39.html#MARKER-9-491>"User Control of Script Settings" beginning on page 1-107</A>.
<LI>If you want to provide a complete script system with your application, you can ship it as a separate file in a folder along with fonts and any other assocated files. The user can then install it as an auxiliary script as described earlier, under <A HREF=Text-36.html#MARKER-9-470>"Components of Auxiliary Scripts."</A><P>
Your script system must be complete or it will not be enabled at startup. What constitutes a complete script system is described under testing for script systems in the chapter "Script Manager" in this book. The formats of the resources you need to include are described in the appendixes "International Resources" and "Keyboard Resources" in this book.<P>
</UL>
 In general, it is not feasible to replace a system script, except by doing an "Update Install" from another complete localized system, as described on <A HREF=Text-36.html#MARKER-9-466>page 1-101</A>. Although the user can replace individual resources in the System file by using a resource editor such as ResEdit, it is not possible to directly replace a system script with an auxiliary script because a system script requires an international configuration (<CODE>'itlc'</CODE>) resource, which is not part of any auxiliary script. Furthermore, replacing the system script is not the same as localizing all of the system software. A system script should support the system software it is shipped with, meaning that the language and icons of system menus, dialog boxes, and messages should reflect the system script. Merely replacing the system script does not accomplish that.<A NAME=MARKER-2-23></A>   <A NAME=MARKER-9-175></A><P>
