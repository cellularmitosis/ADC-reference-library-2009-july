Test::Harness::TAP(3pm)               Perl Programmers Reference Guide               Test::Harness::TAP(3pm)



<b>NAME</b>
       Test::Harness::TAP - Documentation for the TAP format

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       TAP, the Test Anything Protocol, is Perl's simple text-based interface between testing modules such
       as Test::More and the test harness Test::Harness.

<b>TODO</b>
       Exit code of the process.

<b>THE</b> <b>TAP</b> <b>FORMAT</b>
       TAP's general format is:

           1..N
           ok 1 Description # Directive
           # Diagnostic
           ....
           ok 47 Description
           ok 48 Description
           more tests....

       For example, a test file's output might look like:

           1..4
           ok 1 - Input file opened
           not ok 2 - First line of the input valid
           ok 3 - Read the rest of the file
           not ok 4 - Summarized correctly # TODO Not written yet

<b>HARNESS</b> <b>BEHAVIOR</b>
       In this document, the "harness" is any program analyzing TAP output.  Typically this will be Perl's
       <u>prove</u> program, or the underlying "Test::Harness::runtests" subroutine.

       A harness must only read TAP output from standard output and not from standard error.  Lines written
       to standard output matching "/^(not )?ok\b/" must be interpreted as test lines.  All other lines must
       not be considered test output.

<b>TESTS</b> <b>LINES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>THE</b> <b>PLAN</b>
       <b>The</b> <b>plan</b>

       The plan tells how many tests will be run, or how many tests have run.  It's a check that the test
       file hasn't stopped prematurely.  It must appear once, whether at the beginning or end of the output.

       The plan is usually the first line of TAP output and it specifies how many test points are to follow.
       For example,

           1..10

       means you plan on running 10 tests. This is a safeguard in case your test file dies silently in the
       middle of its run.  The plan is optional but if there is a plan before the test points it must be the
       first non-diagnostic line output by the test file.

       In certain instances a test file may not know how many test points it will ultimately be running. In
       this case the plan can be the last non-diagnostic line in the output.

       The plan cannot appear in the middle of the output, nor can it appear more than once.

       <b>The</b> <b>test</b> <b>line</b>

       The core of TAP is the test line.  A test file prints one test line test point executed. There must
       be at least one test line in TAP output. Each test line comprises the following elements:

       * "ok" or "not ok"
           This tells whether the test point passed or failed. It must be at the beginning of the line.
           "/^not ok/" indicates a failed test point. "/^ok/" is a successful test point. This is the only
           mandatory part of the line.

           Note that unlike the Directives below, "ok" and "not ok" are case-sensitive.

       * Test number
           TAP expects the "ok" or "not ok" to be followed by a test point number. If there is no number the
           harness must maintain its own counter until the script supplies test numbers again. So the fol-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lowing&nbsp;following</font>
           lowing test output

               1..6
               not ok
               ok
               not ok
               ok
               ok

           has five tests.  The sixth is missing.  Test::Harness will generate

               FAILED tests 1, 3, 6
               Failed 3/6 tests, 50.00% okay

       * Description
           Any text after the test number but before a "#" is the description of the test point.

               ok 42 this is the description of the test

           Descriptions should not begin with a digit so that they are not confused with the test point num-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ber.&nbsp;number.</font>
           ber.

           The harness may do whatever it wants with the description.

       * Directive
           The test point may include a directive, following a hash on the test line.  There are currently
           two directives allowed: "TODO" and "SKIP".  These are discussed below.

       To summarize:

       * ok/not ok (required)
       * Test number (recommended)
       * Description (recommended)
       * Directive (only when necessary)

<b>DIRECTIVES</b>
       Directives are special notes that follow a "#" on the test line.  Only two are currently defined:
       "TODO" and "SKIP".  Note that these two keywords are not case-sensitive.

       <b>TODO</b> <b>tests</b>

       If the directive starts with "# TODO", the test is counted as a todo test, and the text after "TODO"
       is the explanation.

           not ok 13 # TODO bend space and time

       Note that if the TODO has an explanation it must be separated from "TODO" by a space.

       These tests represent a feature to be implemented or a bug to be fixed and act as something of an
       executable "things to do" list.  They are <b>not</b> expected to succeed.  Should a todo test point begin
       succeeding, the harness should report it as a bonus.  This indicates that whatever you were supposed
       to do has been done and you should promote this to a normal test point.

       <b>Skipping</b> <b>tests</b>

       If the directive starts with "# SKIP", the test is counted as having been skipped.  If the whole test
       file succeeds, the count of skipped tests is included in the generated output.  The harness should
       report the text after " # SKIP\S*\s+" as a reason for skipping.

           ok 23 # skip Insufficient flogiston pressure.

       Similarly, one can include an explanation in a plan line, emitted if the test file is skipped com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pletely:&nbsp;completely:</font>
       pletely:

           1..0 # Skipped: WWW::Mechanize not installed

<b>OTHER</b> <b>LINES</b>
       <b>Bail</b> <b>out!</b>

       As an emergency measure a test script can decide that further tests are useless (e.g. missing depen-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dencies)&nbsp;dependencies)</font>
       dencies) and testing should stop immediately. In that case the test script prints the magic words

           Bail out!

       to standard output. Any message after these words must be displayed by the interpreter as the reason
       why testing must be stopped, as in

           Bail out! MySQL is not running.

       <b>Diagnostics</b>

       Additional information may be put into the testing output on separate lines.  Diagnostic lines should
       begin with a "#", which the harness must ignore, at least as far as analyzing the test results.  The
       harness is free, however, to display the diagnostics.  Typically diagnostics are used to provide
       information about the environment in which test file is running, or to delineate a group of tests.

           ...
           ok 18 - Closed database connection
           # End of database section.
           # This starts the network part of the test.
           # Daemon started on port 2112
           ok 19 - Opened socket
           ...
           ok 47 - Closed socket
           # End of network tests

       <b>Anything</b> <b>else</b>

       Any output line that is not a plan, a test line or a diagnostic is incorrect.  How a harness handles
       the incorrect line is undefined.  Test::Harness silently ignores incorrect lines, but will become
       more stringent in the future.

<b>EXAMPLES</b>
       All names, places, and events depicted in any example are wholly fictitious and bear no resemblance
       to, connection with, or relation to any real entity. Any such similarity is purely coincidental,
       unintentional, and unintended.

       <b>Common</b> <b>with</b> <b>explanation</b>

       The following TAP listing declares that six tests follow as well as provides handy feedback as to
       what the test is about to do. All six tests pass.

           1..6
           #
           # Create a new Board and Tile, then place
           # the Tile onto the board.
           #
           ok 1 - The object isa Board
           ok 2 - Board size is zero
           ok 3 - The object isa Tile
           ok 4 - Get possible places to put the Tile
           ok 5 - Placing the tile produces no error
           ok 6 - Board size is 1

       <b>Unknown</b> <b>amount</b> <b>and</b> <b>failures</b>

       This hypothetical test program ensures that a handful of servers are online and network-accessible.
       Because it retrieves the hypothetical servers from a database, it doesn't know exactly how many
       servers it will need to ping. Thus, the test count is declared at the bottom after all the test
       points have run. Also, two of the tests fail.

           ok 1 - retrieving servers from the database
           # need to ping 6 servers
           ok 2 - pinged diamond
           ok 3 - pinged ruby
           not ok 4 - pinged saphire
           ok 5 - pinged onyx
           not ok 6 - pinged quartz
           ok 7 - pinged gold
           1..7

       <b>Giving</b> <b>up</b>

       This listing reports that a pile of tests are going to be run. However, the first test fails, report-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">edly&nbsp;reportedly</font>
       edly because a connection to the database could not be established. The program decided that continu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;continuing</font>
       ing was pointless and exited.

           1..573
           not ok 1 - database handle
           Bail out! Couldn't connect to database.

       <b>Skipping</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b>

       The following listing plans on running 5 tests. However, our program decided to not run tests 2 thru
       5 at all. To properly report this, the tests are marked as being skipped.

           1..5
           ok 1 - approved operating system
           # $^0 is solaris
           ok 2 - # SKIP no /sys directory
           ok 3 - # SKIP no /sys directory
           ok 4 - # SKIP no /sys directory
           ok 5 - # SKIP no /sys directory

       <b>Skipping</b> <b>everything</b>

       This listing shows that the entire listing is a skip. No tests were run.

           1..0 # skip because English-to-French translator isn't installed

       <b>Got</b> <b>spare</b> <b>tuits?</b>

       The following example reports that four tests are run and the last two tests failed. However, because
       the failing tests are marked as things to do later, they are considered successes. Thus, a harness
       should report this entire listing as a success.

           1..4
           ok 1 - Creating test program
           ok 2 - Test program runs, no error
           not ok 3 - infinite loop # TODO halting problem unsolved
           not ok 4 - infinite loop 2 # TODO halting problem unsolved

       <b>Creative</b> <b>liberties</b>

       This listing shows an alternate output where the test numbers aren't provided. The test also reports
       the state of a ficticious board game in diagnostic form. Finally, the test count is reported at the
       end.

           ok - created Board
           ok
           ok
           ok
           ok
           ok
           ok
           ok
           # +------+------+------+------+
