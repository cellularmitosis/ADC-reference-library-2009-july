The desired behavior				 							is one where if other AppleTalk clients on the node send				 							broadcast messages, that they are also sent to the endpoint.				 							To this end, there is the ATALK_IOC_FULLSELFSEND Ioct, which				 							must be sent to the DDP endpoint.															Note that the ATALK_IOC_FULLSELFSEND is desired to respond											similarly to the PSetSelfSend function.  If the result is											not negative, then the following responses can be expected.															0 - FullSelfSend was previously off											1 - FullSelfSend was previously on															Input parameters															ep - the AppleTalk EndpointRef on which to enable											fullSelfSend. You can pass any AppleTalk endpoint,											DDP or above, to this function. 											enableSelfSend - a long word of the desired setting.															Return result											< 0 - error											0 - FullSelfSend was previously off											1 - FullSelfSend was previously on															Note that if the use of the Ioctl returns an error < 0, then											the PBSetSelfSend function is called.															Note: As with the PSetSelfSend call, the Ioctl call affects											AppleTalk globally. If you enable this feature, it is											recommended that you not disable the feature when the 											process quits.  The user may launch another process which											enables selfsend.  Turning off selfsend in this case,											affects the other process, as well.				*/#include "OpenTransport.h"			// open transport files			#include "OpenTptAppletalk.h"#include "AppleTalk.h"extern OSStatus DoNegotiateSelfSendOption(EndpointRef ep, long enableSelfSend);/*	Sample function to enable/disable the SelfSend option for 	an AppleTalk endpoint. 	Input	EndpointRef ep - endpoint on which to set SelfSend option on	long enableSelfSend - 1L - option on, 0L - option off   Return: kOTNoError indicates that the option was successfully negotiated   			otherwise the error result is returned	IMPORTANT NOTE: if you find that this sample fails to enable/disable self send, check			the file OpenTptAppleTalk.h and ensure that ATALK_IOC_FULLSELFSEND is defined 			as follows					#define ATALK_IOC_FULLSELFSEND			MIOC_CMD(MIOC_ATALK,47)					there are versions of the header file that incorrectly define 			ATALK_IOC_FULLSELFSEND as follows.					#define ATALK_IOC_FULLSELFSEND			MIOC_CMD(MIOC_ATALK,47) // INCORRECT				*/OSStatus DoNegotiateSelfSendOption(EndpointRef ep, long enableSelfSend){	OSStatus		result;	SetSelfparms	pb;	Boolean			usePB = false;		if (OTIsSynchronous(ep) == false)			// check whether ep sync or not		usePB = true;	else	{		result = OTIoctl(ep, ATALK_IOC_FULLSELFSEND, (void*)enableSelfSend);		if (result < kOTNoError)			usePB = true;	// if an error occured, try using the PBSetSelfSend call	}		if (usePB == true)	{		pb.newSelfFlag = enableSelfSend != 0 ? true : false;  /* set self send option */		result = PSetSelfSend((MPPPBPtr) &pb, false);			}			return result;}
