<h1> About WebObjects</h1>
</a><a name="2137">
WebObjects is an object-oriented environment for developing and deploying World Wide Web applications. A WebObjects application runs on a server machine and receives requests from a user's web browser on a client machine. It dynamically generates HTML pages in response to the user's requests. WebObjects provides a suite of tools for rapid application development, as well as prebuilt application components and a web application server. <p>
</a><a name="1913">
WebObjects is flexible enough to suit the needs of any web programmer. You can write code using one of three programming languages: Java, Objective-C, or WebScript. You can write simple WebObjects applications in a matter of minutes. For more complex projects, WebObjects makes it easy by performing common web application tasks automatically and by allowing you to reuse objects you've written for other applications.<p>
