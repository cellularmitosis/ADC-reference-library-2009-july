You can optionally add the kFCPItemsToSelectList parameter, which is a AEDescList list of kFCPSelectItemInBrowser items. Use this if you want more than one item to be selected.

The project is always brought to the foreground inside of FCP. If no project file or UUID is supplied, then no XML will be returned.
@param kFCPProjectFileKey Which project file to operate on.

/*!
@defined kFCPFindItemsInProject
@discussion Using the kFCPFindItemsInProject event, you can ask FCP to initiate a search for items in the Browser and have the results brought up in a new Find Results window to the user. 
This can be used to bring multiple items to the attention of the user at once.
The kFCPFindLogicMode parameter controls whether the criteria entries are combined with AND (all entries must apply) or OR (only one entry need apply).
The kFCPFindParameters list contains one or more entries that are the search criteria. You can use multiple entries to very precisely control what results are obtained.
For example, one entry can specify that the Name column of the items must start with a string 'Camera' and the next entry specifies that the Notes column must not contain the string 'bad take'.
Each criteria entry is made up of 4 elements: the string to search for, the way to match the string, the column to search, and whether to use matching or non-matching items.
Note that each criteria entry is an AERecord, so the list consists of records, each of which contains several parameters.
@param kFCPProjectFileKey Which project file to operate on.
@param kFCPFindLogicMode A flag specifying which logical operator to use, logical AND or logical OR. The constants for this are defined below.
@param kFCPFindParameters An AEDescList list of criteria AERecords. The list of criteria records has the following form:
						 <index>				a record holding one set of criteria
									kFCPFindMatchMode		which way to match, specified by one of the FCPFindMatchType values.
									kFCPFindOmitCriteria	A boolean that will reverse the sense of the criteria (i.e non-matches rather than matches are returned)	
									kFCPFindColumnName		A UTF-8 string that (optinally) restricts the criteria to a single FCP Browser column.
														If missing or unknown then any column otherwise specific column. The available columns are specified using
														the XML tags for clip properties. The full list is given below.
									kFCPFindSearchString	The text string to search for, specified as a UTF-8 string.
@discussion
 * These are the valid values for kFCPFindColumnName.
 * Each is the name of an XML tag for a clip property.
 * FCP will map them to browser column names.
 * The values are:
 *
 *		name
 *		duration
 *		in
 *		out
 *		start
 *		end
 *		scene
 *		shottake
 *		lognote
 *		good
 *		label
 *		label2
 *		mastercomment1
