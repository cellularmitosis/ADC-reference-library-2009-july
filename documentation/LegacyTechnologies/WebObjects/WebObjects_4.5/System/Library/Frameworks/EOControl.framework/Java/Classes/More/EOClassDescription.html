(EOModel and EOEntity are defined in EOAccess.)</p><p>An enterprise object takes advantage of the metadata registeredfor it by using the EOClassDescription-related methods defined inthe EOEnterpriseObject interface (and implemented in EOCustomObjectand EOGenericRecord). Primary among these methods is  <a href="../../Protocols/EOEnterpriseObject.html#//apple_ref/java/intfm/EOEnterpriseObject/classDescription">classDescription</a>, which returns theclass description associated with the enterprise object. Throughthis class description the enterprise object has access to all ofthe information relating to its entity in a model file.</p><p>In addition to methods that return information based on anenterprise object's class description, the EOClassDescription-relatedmethods the  <a href="../../Protocols/EOEnterpriseObject.html#BABBCHJH">EOEnterpriseObject</a> interface definesinclude methods that are automatically invoked when a particularoperation occurs. These include validation methods and methods thatare invoked whenever an enterprise object is inserted or fetched.</p><p>All of this comes together in your running application. Whena user tries to perform a particular operation on an enterpriseobject (such as attempting to delete it), the EOEditingContext sendsthese validation messages to your enterprise object, which in turn(by default) forwards them to its EOClassDescription. Based on theresult, the operation is either accepted or refused. For example, referentialintegrity constraints in your model might state that you can'tdelete a department object that has employees. If a user attemptsto delete a department that has employees, an exception is returned andthe deletion is refused.</p><br><a name = "BGGCHAGF"></a><h2>Using EOClassDescription</h2><p>For the most part, you don't need to programmatically interactwith EOClassDescription. It extends the behavior of your enterpriseobjects transparently. However, there are two cases in which youdo need to programmatically interact with it: </p><ul><li>When you override EOClassDescription-relatedEOEnterpriseObject methods in an enterprise object class. Thesemethods are used to perform validation and to intervene when enterpriseobjects based on EOModels are created and fetched. (The EOModelclass is defined in EOAccess.) For objects that don't have EOModels,you can override a different set of EOEnterpriseObject methods; thisis described in more detail in the section  <a href="#BAABFICB">"Working with Objects That Don't Have EOModels"</a>.</li><li>When you create a subclass of EOClassDescription</li></ul><br><h2>Overriding Methods in an Enterprise Object</h2><p>As described above, EOEnterpriseObject defines several EOClassDescription-relatedmethods. It's common for enterprise object classes to overridethe following methods to either perform validation, to assign defaultvalues ( <a href="../../Protocols/EOEnterpriseObject.html#//apple_ref/java/intfm/EOEnterpriseObject/awakeFromInsertion">awakeFromInsertion</a>), or to provideadditional initialization to newly fetched objects ( <a href="../../Protocols/EOEnterpriseObject.html#//apple_ref/java/intfm/EOEnterpriseObject/awakeFromFetch">awakeFromFetch</a>):</p><ul><li> <a href="../../Protocols/EOValidation.html#//apple_ref/java/intfm/EOValidation/validateForSave">validateForSave</a></li><li> <a href="../../Protocols/EOValidation.html#//apple_ref/java/intfm/EOValidation/validateForDelete">validateForDelete</a></li><li> <a href="../../Protocols/EOValidation.html#//apple_ref/java/intfm/EOValidation/validateForInsert">validateForInsert</a></li><li> <a href="../../Protocols/EOValidation.html#//apple_ref/java/intfm/EOValidation/validateForUpdate">validateForUpdate</a></li><li> <a href="../../Protocols/EOEnterpriseObject.html#//apple_ref/java/intfm/EOEnterpriseObject/awakeFromInsertion">awakeFromInsertion</a></li><li> <a href="../../Protocols/EOEnterpriseObject.html#//apple_ref/java/intfm/EOEnterpriseObject/awakeFromFetch">awakeFromFetch</a></li><li> <a href="../../Protocols/EOEnterpriseObject.html#//apple_ref/java/intfm/EOEnterpriseObject/userPresentableDescription">userPresentableDescription</a></li></ul><p>For example, an enterprise object class can implement a <code>validateForSave</code> methodthat checks the values of salary and jobLevel properties beforeallowing the values to be saved to the database:</p><blockquote><pre>public void validateForSave() throw EOValidation.Exception {    if (salary &gt; 1500 && jobLevel &lt; 2) {        throw new EOValidation.Exception(            "The salary is too high for that position!");        }    // pass the check on to the EOClassDescription    super.validateForSave();}</pre></blockquote><br><p>For more discussion of this subject, see the chapter "DesigningEnterprise Objects" in the <i>Enterprise Objects FrameworkDeveloper's Guide</i>, and the  <a href="../../Protocols/EOEnterpriseObject.html#BABBCHJH">EOEnterpriseObject</a> interface specification.</p><br><a name = "BAABFICB"></a><h2>Working with Objects ThatDon't Have EOModels</h2><p>Although an EOModel is the most common source of an EOClassDescriptionfor a class, it isn't the only one. Objects that don't havean EOModel can implement EOClassDescription methods directly as instancemethods, and the rest of the Framework will treat them just as itdoes enterprise objects that have this information provided by anexternal EOModel.</p><p>There are a few reasons you might want to do this. First ofall, if your object implements the methods  <a href="../EOClassDescription.html#//apple_ref/java/instm/EOClassDescription/entityName">entityName</a>,  <a href="../EOClassDescription.html#//apple_ref/java/instm/EOClassDescription/attributeKeys">attributeKeys</a>,  <a href="../EOClassDescription.html#//apple_ref/java/instm/EOClassDescription/toOneRelationshipKeys">toOneRelationshipKeys</a>,and  <a href="../EOClassDescription.html#//apple_ref/java/instm/EOClassDescription/toOneRelationshipKeys">toOneRelationshipKeys</a>,EOEditingContexts can snapshot the object and thereby provide undofor it.</p><p>Secondly, you might want to implement EOClassDescription'svalidation or referential integrity methods to add these featuresto your classes.</p><p>Implementing EOClassDescription methods on a per-class basisin this way is a good alternative to creating a subclass of EOClassDescription. </p><br><h2>Creating a Subclass of EOClassDescription</h2><p>You create a subclass of EOClassDescription when you wantto use an external source of information other than an EOModel toextend your objects. Another possible scenario is if you've added informationto an EOModel (such as in its user dictionary) and you want thatinformation to become part of your class description-in that case,you'd probably want to create a subclass of the access layer'sEOEntityClassDescription.</p><p>When you create a subclass of EOClassDescription, you onlyneed to implement the methods that have significance for your subclass.</p><p>If you're using an external source of information otherthan an EOModel, you need to decide when to register class descriptions,which you do by invoking the method  <a href="../EOClassDescription.html#//apple_ref/java/clm/EOClassDescription/registerClassDescription">registerClassDescription</a>. You can eitherregister class descriptions in response to a EOClassDescriptionNeeded...notification (an  <a href="../EOClassDescription.html#BAAEBFBI">ClassDescriptionNeededForClassNotification</a> oran  <a href="../EOClassDescription.html#BAADCFDA">ClassDescriptionNeededForEntityNameNotification</a>),or you can register class descriptions at the time you initializeyour application (in other words, you can register all potentialclass descriptions ahead of time). The default implementation inEnterprise Objects Framework is based on responding to the EOClassDescriptionNeeded...notifications. When an EOModel receives one of these notifications,it supplies a class description for the specified class or entityname by invoking  <a href="../EOClassDescription.html#//apple_ref/java/clm/EOClassDescription/registerClassDescription">registerClassDescription</a></p><br><a name = "BGGBDFJI"></a><h2>EOEntityClassDescription</h2><p>There are only three methods in EOClassDescription that havemeaningful implementations (that is, that don't either return null orsimply return without doing anything):  <a href="../EOClassDescription.html#//apple_ref/java/clm/EOClassDescription/invalidateClassDescriptionCache">invalidateClassDescriptionCache</a>,  <a href="../EOClassDescription.html#//apple_ref/java/clm/EOClassDescription/registerClassDescription">registerClassDescription</a>, and  <a href="../EOClassDescription.html#//apple_ref/java/instm/EOClassDescription/propagateDeleteForObject">propagateDeleteForObject</a>.The default behavior of the rest of the methods in Enterprise ObjectsFramework comes from the implementation in the access layer'sEOClassDescription subclass EOEntityClassDescription. For more information,see the EOEntityClassDescription class specification.</p><br><a name = "BGGCCHCB"></a><h2>The EOClassDescription'sDelegate</h2><p>You can assign a delegate to the EOClassDescription class.EOClassDescription sends the message  <a href="../../Protocols/EOClassDescClassDelegate.html#//apple_ref/java/intfm/EOClassDescription.ClassDelegate/shouldPropagateDeleteForObject">shouldPropagateDeleteForObject</a> toits delegate when delete propagation is about to take place fora particular object. The delegate can either allow or deny the operationfor a specified relationship key. For more information, see themethod description for  <a href="../../Protocols/EOClassDescClassDelegate.html#//apple_ref/java/intfm/EOClassDescription.ClassDelegate/shouldPropagateDeleteForObject">shouldPropagateDeleteForObject</a>.</p><br><a href="../../EOControlTOC.html"><img src="../../../../../../../images/up.gif" border="0" alt="Table of Contents"></a></BODY></HTML>
