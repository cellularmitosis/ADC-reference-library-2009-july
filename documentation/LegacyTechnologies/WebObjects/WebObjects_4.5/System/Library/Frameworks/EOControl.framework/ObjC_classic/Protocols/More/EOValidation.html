This method is responsiblefor two things: coercing the value into an appropriate type forthe object, and validating it according to the object's rules.The default implementation provided by NSObject consults the object'sEOClassDescription (using the EOEnterpriseObject informal protocol method  <a frame= "conv" href="../../Protocols/EOEnterpriseObject.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/EOEnterpriseObject/classDescription">classDescription</a>) to coerce the valueand to check for basic errors, such as a <b>null</b> valuewhen that isn't allowed. If no basic errors exist, this default implementationthen validates the value according to the object itself. It searchesfor a method of the form <b>validate</b><em>Key</em>: andinvokes it if it exists. These are the methods that your customclasses can implement to validate individual properties, such as <code>validateAge</code>: tocheck that the value the user entered is within acceptable limits. The <code>validateAge:</code> methodshould return <code>nil</code>, indicatingthe value is acceptable, or an NSException created by calling theNSException method  <a frame= "conv" href="../../Classes/NSExceptionAdditions.html#//apple_ref/occ/clm/NSException Additions/validationExceptionWithFormat:">validationExceptionWithFormat:</a>. </p><p>Coercion is performed automatically for you (by the EOClassDescription),so all you need handle is validation itself. Since you can implementcustom validation logic in the <b>validate</b><em>Key</em>: methods,you rarely need to override the EOValidation method  <a frame= "conv" href="../../Protocols/EOValidation.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/EOValidation/validateValue:forKey:">validateValue:forKey:</a>. Rather, thedefault implementation provided by NSObject is generally sufficient.</p><p>As an example of how validating a single property works, supposethat Member objects have an <b>age</b> attributestored as an integer. This attribute has a lower limit of 16, definedby the Member class. Now, suppose a user types "12" into a textfield for the age of a member. The value comes into the Framework asa string. When <b>validateValue:forKey:</b> isinvoked to validate the new value, the method uses its EOClassDescriptionto convert the string "12" into an NSNumber, then invokes <b>validateAge:</b> withthat NSNumber. The <b>validateAge:</b> methodcompares the age to its limit of 16 and returns an exception to indicatethat the new value is not acceptable.</p><blockquote><pre>- (NSException *)validateAge:(NSNumber *)age{    if ([age intValue] &lt; 16) {        return [NSException            validationExceptionWithFormat:@"Age of %@ is below minimum.", age];    }    return nil;}</pre></blockquote><br><p>The method  <a frame= "conv" href="../../Classes/NSExceptionAdditions.html#//apple_ref/occ/clm/NSException Additions/validationExceptionWithFormat:">validationExceptionWithFormat:</a> usedin the above example is a method that the Framework adds to NSExceptionfor convenient creation of validation exceptions. </p><br><h2>When Properties are Validated</h2><p>The Framework validates all of an object's properties beforethe object is saved to an external source-either inserted or updated.Additionally, you can design your application so that changes toa property's value are validated immediately, as soon as a userattempts to leave an editable field in the user interface (in JavaClient and Application Kit applications only). Whenever an EODisplayGroup setsa value in an object, it sends the object a <b>validateValue:forKey:</b> message,allowing the object to coerce the value's type, perform any additionalvalidation, and return an exception if the value isn't valid. Bydefault, the display group leaves validation errors to be handledwhen the object is saved, using <b>validateValue:forKey:</b> onlyfor type coercion. However, you can use the EODisplayGroup method <b>setValidatesChangesImmediately:</b> withan argument of YES to tell the display group to immediately presentan attention panel whenever a validation error is encountered.</p><br><a name = "CJFEAACJ"><h2>Validating Before an Operation</h2></a><p>The remaining EOValidation methods- <a frame= "conv" href="../../Protocols/EOValidation.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/EOValidation/validateForInsert">validateForInsert</a>,  <a frame= "conv" href="../../Protocols/EOValidation.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/EOValidation/validateForUpdate">validateForUpdate</a>,  <a frame= "conv" href="../../Protocols/EOValidation.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/EOValidation/validateForSave">validateForSave</a>, and  <a frame= "conv" href="../../Protocols/EOValidation.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/EOValidation/validateForDelete">validateForDelete</a>-validate an entireobject to see if it's valid for a particular operation. These methodsare invoked automatically by the Framework when the associated operationis initiated. NSObject provides default implementations, so youonly have to implement them yourself when special validation logicis required. For example, you can override these methods in yourcustom enterprise object classes to allow or refuse the operationbased on property values. For example, a Fee object might refuseto be deleted if it hasn't been paid yet. Or you can overridethese methods to perform delayed validation of properties or tocompare multiple properties against one another; for example, youmight verify that a pair of dates is in the proper temporal order.</p><blockquote><pre>- (NSException *)validateForSave{    NSException *exception = [super validateForSave];    NSException *myException = nil;    if ([startDate compare:endDate] == NSOrderedDescending) {        myException = [NSException             validationExceptionWithFormat:@"Start date must precede end date."];    }    if (exception && myException) {        exception = [NSException aggregateExceptionWithExceptions:            [NSArray arrayWithObjects:exception, myException, nil]];    } else if (myException) {        exception = myException;    }    return exception;}</pre></blockquote><br><p>Note that this method also invokes <b>super</b>'simplementation. This is important, as the default implementationsof the <b>validateFor...</b> methods pass thecheck on to the object's EOClassDescription, which performs basicchecking among properties, including invoking  <a frame= "conv" href="../../Protocols/EOValidation.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/EOValidation/validateValue:forKey:">validateValue:forKey:</a> for each property.The access layer's EOEntityClassDescription class verifies constraintsbased on an EOModel, such as delete rules. For example, the deleterule for a Department object might state that it can't be deletedif it still contains Employee objects.</p><p>The method <b>validateForSave</b> is thegeneric validation method for when an object is written to the externalstore. The default implementations of <b>validateForInsert</b>,  <a frame= "conv" href="../../Protocols/EOValidation.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/EOValidation/validateForUpdate">validateForUpdate</a> both invoke it.If an object performs validation that isn't specific to insertionor to updating, it should go in <b>validateForSave</b>.</p><br><a href="../../EOControlTOC.html"><img src="../../../../../../../images/up.gif" border="0" alt="Table of Contents"></a> </BODY></HTML>
