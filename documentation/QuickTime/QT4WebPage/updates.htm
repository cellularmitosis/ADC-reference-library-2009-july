<H2><HR>Updates to the First Edition</H2>

The first edition included serial numbers for QuickTime 4, issued
before October 12, 2000--these will not work with QuickTime 5.
<P>
The first edition included QuickTime 4.1.2, so you need to download a new version from<br>
<A HREF="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/">http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/</A>.
<P>
QuickTime Player has a new user interface. This directly affects many of the examples in the 
first edition.
Two items are of particular importance:
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Wherever the first edition refers to "Get Info" or the "Info" window, you must now use "Get Movie Properties," to open the "Properties" window. In QuickTime&nbsp;5 the "Get Info" command opens a non-editable Info window.
<P>
	<LI>You no longer need to use modifier keys (option, or ctrl-alt) to access any of the editing functions, such as Add Scaled. They are now available from the Edit menu in the usual way.
</UL>

<P>

<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>

	<LI>Sorenson 3 video codec
