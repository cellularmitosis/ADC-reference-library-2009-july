CalcControlRgnLast updated 8/28/99This snippet shows how to call a CDEF to get the control's Region.You can make other calls to the CDEF using the same method.This snippet works for both 68K and PowerPC. I includedthe both versions so you can see it works for both platforms. This is the first snippet to use my SimpleAppLib framework. SimpleAppLibwas designed to hide the menial tasks of getting a Mac applicationrunning. Since SimpleAppLib handles the event loop and the gory detailsof a running application, this lets you see all the code that thesnippet is trying to show without having to dig through thousands oflines of code. For example, this snippet is 255 lines of code. (126lines without comments) Hopefully this will let me get a lot moresample code out since I can now concentrate on the sample code andnot waste my time reinventing the wheel.  One of the benefits of SimpleAppLib is that it will shield you from the gory details of the Mac OS. We will be releasing the SimpleAppLibproject when I get the source code cleaned up for general distribution.
