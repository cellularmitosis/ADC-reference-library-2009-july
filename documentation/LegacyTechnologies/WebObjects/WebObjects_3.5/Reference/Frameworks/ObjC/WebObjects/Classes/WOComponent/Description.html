WOComponent objects dynamically render web pages (or sections of pages) at

run time. They provide custom navigation and other logic for the page, provide

a framework for organizing constituent objects (static and dynamic HTML elements

and subcomponents), and enable the attribute bindings of dynamic elements.

<P>
Objects of the WOComponent class represent web pages (or sections of pages)

that are dynamically rendered at runtime. A WOComponent object specifies the

overall behavior of a WebObjects page, including navigation logic and database

access. It also provides a framework for organizing the HTML elements of

a page as objects and for binding the attributes of the page's dynamic elements

to properties of the component.

<BLOCKQUOTE>

  <B>Note</B>: The term <I>component</I> has a range of meanings, not surprising

  since what it refers to exists on several levels. Sometimes "component" can

  refer to a WOComponent object, sometimes to the component directory, and sometimes

  to the rendered web page. For the purposes of this specification, "component"

  means WOComponent object, unless otherwise indicated.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

A component is represented in the file system by a directory with a <B>.wo</B> extension. It

contains files supplying three kinds of information:

<UL>

  <LI>

    A standard HTML description of the what is rendered on a page, with

    &lt;WEBOBJECT&gt; markers as placeholders for dynamic elements <BR>

    <BR>

  <LI>

    A declarations file supplying the class name and initial values for dynamic

    elements and specifying bindings between component properties (instance variables

    and methods) and element attributes. <BR>

    <BR>

  <LI>

    Implementation logic, specified either in a Java or Objective-C compiled

    subclass of WOComponent or in a component <B>.wos</B> script.

</UL>

<P>

Each WOComponent subclass has the same name as its component directory.

By convention, the name of the component representing the first page of an

application is Main. The names of the HTML, declaration, and implementation

files in the component directory should match (minus their extensions) the

name of the component directory (for example, <B>Main.html</B>). If there is a

component script (a <B>.wos</B> file), the code it contains is made the implementation

behavior of a special subclass of WOComponent created at runtime.

<BLOCKQUOTE>

  <B>Note</B>: For more on the organization and contents of component directories,

  see the
first chapter of the 
  <A href="../../../../../../DevGuide/DevGuideTOC.html" target=_top><I>WebObjects Developer's Guide</I></A>.

  Overview of WOComponent Methods

</H2>

<P>

The WOComponent class has many methods that have the same names as methods

of the WOApplication class. However, the scope of the WOComponent methods

is limited to a component rather than being application-wide. For example,

you can control component-definition caching on a per-component basis using

<B>setCachingEnabled:</B>, which has a WOApplication counterpart. When this

kind of caching is enabled for a component, the application parses the contents

of the component directory the first time the component is requested, creates

the component definition, stores this object in memory, and restores it for

subsequent requests.

<P>
The WOComponent class also has the localization method <B>stringForKey:InTableNamed:withDefaultValue:</B>.

The difference is that the WOComponent method confines its search for the <B>.strings</B>

file to the component directory. As with WOApplication's method, it 

searches the localized (<B>.lproj</B>) subdirectory in the order of language preference. For more on caching and localization, see the

class description of the

<A href="../WOApplication/WOApplication.html" target=_top>WOApplication</A>

class.

<P>

WOComponent objects also respond to <B>awake</B>, <B>sleep</B>, and the three

request-handling messages: <B>takeValuesFromRequest:inContext:</B>, <B>invokeActionForRequest:inContext:</B>,

and <B>appendToResponse:inContext:</B>. You can override these methods in your compiled

subclasses, and thereby integrate your custom behavior into the request-response

loop. (You can also override these methods in component scripts using WebScript.)

<P>

By implementing the

NSCoding protocol

(<B>encodeWithCoder:</B> and <b>initWithCoder:</b> methods), WOComponent objects can serialize their state in an object archive.

This capability makes WOComponent objects persistent across sessions when they and their "owning" session (which initiates the archiving) are stored in the page or in cookies. These methods are automatically implemented for scripted components.

<BR>

<BR>


<H2>

  Subcomponents

</H2>

<P>

A WOComponent object can represent a dynamic fragment of a Web page as well

as an entire page. Such <I>subcomponents</I>, or <I>reusable components</I>,

are nested within a parent component representing the page <I>or</I> another

subcomponent. The capability for assembling components in a hierarchical

structure to constitute a page is a key advantage of WebObjects. With frameworks

of reusable components, developers can quickly build complex pages and can

reuse components as building blocks in multiple development projects.

<P>

Each component keeps track of its subcomponents. When a component receives

a request-handling message, such as <B>takeValuesFromRequest:inContext:</B>, it forwards

that message to its subcomponents. But how does a child component communicate

with its parent? It is frequently important that child and parent components

have some way to synchronize their states. For instance, if a subcomponent

presents a palette of options (such as colors), it must have some way to

communicate a selection to the parent component so that the parent can update

its display with the new option.

<P>

The WOComponent class provides a child-parent callback mechanism for this purpose.

In the parent's declaration file, you bind an arbitrary attribute of the

child to an action method of the parent. Then, as the last step in the child's

action method, you invoke <B>performParentAction:</B> with the argument being

the arbitrary attribute, returning the object received back as the response

page. See the method description for <B>performParentAction:</B> for details.

<BR>

<BR>

<H2>

  Templates and Component Definitions

</H2>

<P>

A component renders itself in HTML through a graph of objects representing

its static and dynamic elements and its subcomponents. This graph of objects

is called a dynamic <I>template</I>. Each object in the template contributes,

in its turn, to the generation of HTML during the <B>appendToResponse:inContext:</B>

phase of the request-response loop. (During the other two phases, the appropriate

dynamic elements in the template extract page values and invoke actions.)

<P>

At runtime, when a component is requested, the application constructs a

dynamic template from two sources in the component directory: the static

HTML template (the <B>.html</B> file) and the declaration (<B>.wod</B>) file. The HTML

file represents the static part of the component template and the declarations

file captures the dynamic part. The declaration file indicates the class

of each dynamic element and can specify initial attribute values and bindings

between element attributes and properties of the component. The application

parses these two files and integrates them where there are

"&lt;WEBOBJECT&gt;&lt;/WEBOBJECT&gt;" markers in the HTML file, inserting

the dynamic-element objects within the template's HTML syntactic tree.

<P>

The binding between the attributes of dynamic elements and the properties

of a component is two-way. When it's their turn to extract values, invoke

an action, or append their content, dynamic elements can "push" and "pull"

values to and from the bound instance variables or methods of the component.

This associative behavior always occurs with reference to the current component

(page or subcomponent), which is maintained on a stack.

<P>

A component instance itself does not contain its dynamic template as instance

data. WOComponents are by definition reusable and instances are often re-created

within the same session or across sessions. It therefore makes sense to keep

the template in a central location where it is accessible by all instances

of a component. When the application parses the contents of a component

directory, it creates a <I>component definition</I>, a compact description

of a component that includes path and URL information as well as the component's

template. The application instantiates WOComponent objects from their component

definitions and (if <B>isCachingEnabled</B> returns YES) stores component

definitions in memory for future requests. <BR>

Component objects associated with a response receive this message during

the last phase of the request-response loop. In the append-to-response phase,

the application objects (particularly the response page instance itself)

generate the HTML content of the page. WOComponent's default implementation

of this method forwards the message to the root WOElement object of the component

template. Compiled or scripted subclasses of WOComponent can override this

method to replace or supplement the default behavior with custom logic.

WOComponent objects associated with a request page receive this message during

the middle phase of request handling. In this middle phase, the

<B>invokeActionForRequest:inContext:</B> message is propagated through the WOElement objects of

the page; the dynamic element on which the user has acted (by, for example,

clicking a button) responds by triggering the method in the request component

that is bound to the action. WOComponent's default implementation of this method

forwards the message to the root WOElement object of the component template.

and extension.

This method is provided for backwards compatibility only. For WebObjects 3.5 and above, you should use the <A HREF="../WOResourceManager/WOResourceManager.html" target=_top>WOResourceManager</A> API to retrieve resources.

<P>
Allows a subcomponent to invoke an action method of its parent component

bound to the child component (<I>attribute</I>). Parent and child components

are "synchronized" when this method returns: the variables that are bound

by a declaration of the child component in the parent component's declaration

file have the same value.

<P>

An example best illustrates this mechanism. Let's say you have a Palette

subcomponent, and this WOComponent is nested in a parent component with a

"displaySelection" action method. When the user selects an item in the palette

(perhaps a color), you want to invoke "displaySelection" to show the result

of the new selection (perhaps a car in the new color). The declaration in

the parent's ".wod" file would look like this:

<PRE>PALETTE: Palette {

    selection = number;

    callBack = "displaySelection";

 };

</PRE>

<P>

The "callBack" item is an arbitrary attribute of the child component bound

in this declaration to the parent component's "displaySelection" method.

The <B>performParentAction:</B> method is used to activate this binding. Let's

assume the child component has an action method called "click"; the

implementation would look like this:

<PRE>- click {             /* this is the child's action */

    selection = /* some value */;

    /* now invoke the parent's action */

    return [self performParentAction:callBack];

<P>
Enables or disables the caching of component definitions for the receiving

component. WOComponent definitions contain templates and other common information

related to components, and are used to generate instances of those components.

When this attribute is set to YES, the application parses the HTML

template and the declaration (".wod") file of a component once and then stores

the resulting component definition for future requests. By default, this

kind of caching is disabled so that you can edit a <I>scripted</I> component

without having to relaunch the application every time to check the results.

(Note that this does not apply to Java subclasses of WOComponent; in this case,

you still have to kill and relaunch the application.)

<P>

With WOApplication's method of the same name, you can turn component-definition

caching off globally. You can then control caching of individual component

definitions using WOComponent's version of this method. Selective caching is

an especially valuable technique for very large applications where only the

most frequently requested components should be cached.

Invoked at the conclusion of a request-handling cycle to give component the

opportunity for deallocating objects created and initialized in its

<B>awake</B> method. The default implementation does nothing.

Returns from within the component directory a localized string from string

table "<I>aTable</I>.strings" using <I>aKey</I> to look it up. If no string

value for the key is found in the table, <I>defaultValue</I> (optional) is

returned. The method first searches the "<I>aTable</I>.strings" file, if

it exists, in each localized (".lproj") subdirectories of the component;

searching proceeds in the order of the language list maintained by the WOSession

object (for details, see the <B>setLanguages:</B> method of the

<A href="../WOSession/WOSession.html" target=_top>WOSession</A> class).

If no string value matching the key is found, the search then continues for

a non-localized or default version of the string in the

"<I>aTable</I>.strings" file (if it exists) directly under the component

directory. If after this no string matching the key is found and no default

value is specified, the method returns <B>nil</B>.

<P>

<A href="../WOApplication/WOApplication.html" target=_top>WOApplication</A>

<P>
WOComponent objects associated with a request receive this message during the

first phase of the request-response loop. The default WOComponent behavior

is to resend the message to the root object of the component's template.

In this phase, each dynamic element in the template extracts any entered

data or changed state (such as a check in a check box) associated with an

attribute and assigns the value to the component variable bound to the attribute.

Compiled or scripted subclasses of Component can override this method to

replace or supplement the default behavior with custom logic.

Returns the root object of the graph of static and dynamic HTML elements

and subcomponents that is used to graphically render the component identified

by <I>aName</I>. This template is constructed from the ".html" and ".wod"

file found in the component directory. You identify the template by specifying

the component directory, which consists of the component name plus the "wo"

extension: for example, "HelloWorld.wo." If the template is not cached, the

application will parse the HTML and declaration files of the specified component

to create the template. If the flag returned by WOApplication's

<B>printsHTMLParserDiagnostics</B> is YES, the application sends

HTML diagnostic messages to the standard output device.

Returns the URL of the resource in the component directory that has a name

of <I>aName</I> and an extension of <I>anExtension</I>. The method searches all

localized component subdirectories (".lproj") in the preferred language order

before searching directly under the component directory (".wo") for the resource.

The preferred language order is returned by

<A href="../WOSession/WOSession.html" target=_top>WOSession</A>'s

<B>languages</B> method.

<P>

This method is provided for backwards compatibility only. For WebObjects 3.5 and above, you should use the <A HREF="../WOResourceManager/WOResourceManager.html" target=_top>WOResourceManager</A> API to retrieve resources. WOResourceManager is not able to retrieve resources stored inside component directories.
