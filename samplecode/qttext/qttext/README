README - QTTextQTText is a sample application that shows how to do searches on text media,how to use a simple text procedure to retrieve the text from a text media sample,and how to edit that text. It is based on the code provided with the develop articleon QuickTime text by Nick Thompson (issue 20). Make sure to read that articlefor complete details on the techniques employed in QTText.For Windows builds using Microsoft Visual C++, the Makefile (QTText.mak)automatically calls Rez to create the resource file QTText.qtr from theinput file QTText.r. The .qtr file must reside in the same directory as theapplication QTText.exe. For final delivery of your product, you shouldinsert the .qtr file into the .exe file by using the tool RezWack.Enjoy,QuickTime Team
