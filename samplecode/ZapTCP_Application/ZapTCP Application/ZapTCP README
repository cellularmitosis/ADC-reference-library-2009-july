ZapTCP application------------------Steve FalkenburgMacDTS6/29/93------------------This small application contains a trap patch to _ExitToShell which will search all open MacTCPconnections for any connections which are allocated within the application which is currently inthe process of quitting or crashing.For any connection found to be allocted within the app heap, the connection will be closed andits assocated MacTCP stream will be released.  This will prevent most of the Mac crashes associatedwith MacTCP networking, contributing to Mac reliability and stability.You can easily put this code into your MacTCP application for the same functionality.  Also, thiscode could be changed to close other network resources such as PPC toolbox or ADSP connections.
