HIToolboxSOU-Delegates
File: main.c

Abstract:

	This project is a demo of the HIObject Delegate API discussed in WWDC 2006 session 105, HIToolbox State of the Union.
	The only addition to this source file for the demo is located in the HandleNew function; look there for a sample of
	creating and adding an HIObject delegate.
