Pod::Man(3)                          User Contributed Perl Documentation                         Pod::Man(3)



<b>NAME</b>
       Pod::Man - Convert POD data to formatted *roff input

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
           use Pod::Man;
           my $parser = Pod::Man-&gt;new (release =&gt; $VERSION, section =&gt; 8);

           # Read POD from STDIN and write to STDOUT.
           $parser-&gt;parse_file (\*STDIN);

           # Read POD from file.pod and write to file.1.
           $parser-&gt;parse_from_file ('file.pod', 'file.1');

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       Pod::Man is a module to convert documentation in the POD format (the preferred language for
       documenting Perl) into *roff input using the man macro set.  The resulting *roff code is suitable for
       display on a terminal using <a href="../man1/nroff.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/nroff"><u>nroff</u>(1)</a>, normally via <a href="../man1/man.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/man"><u>man</u>(1)</a>, or printing using <a href="../man1/troff.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/troff"><u>troff</u>(1)</a>.  It is
       conventionally invoked using the driver script <b>pod2man</b>, but it can also be used directly.

       As a derived class from Pod::Simple, Pod::Man supports the same methods and interfaces.  See
       Pod::Simple for all the details.

       <u>new()</u> can take options, in the form of key/value pairs that control the behavior of the parser.  See
       below for details.

       If no options are given, Pod::Man uses the name of the input file with any trailing ".pod", ".pm", or
       ".pl" stripped as the man page title, to section 1 unless the file ended in ".pm" in which case it
       defaults to section 3, to a centered title of "User Contributed Perl Documentation", to a centered
       footer of the Perl version it is run with, and to a left-hand footer of the modification date of its
       input (or the current date if given STDIN for input).

       Pod::Man assumes that your *roff formatters have a fixed-width font named CW.  If yours is called
       something else (like CR), use the "fixed" option to specify it.  This generally only matters for
       troff output for printing.  Similarly, you can set the fonts used for bold, italic, and bold italic
       fixed-width output.

       Besides the obvious pod conversions, Pod::Man also takes care of formatting <u>func()</u>, <!-- a --><u>func</u>(3)<!-- /a -->, and
       simple variable references like $foo or @bar so you don't have to use code escapes for them; complex
       expressions like $fred{'stuff'} will still need to be escaped, though.  It also translates dashes
       that aren't used as hyphens into en dashes, makes long dashes--like this--into proper em dashes,
       fixes "paired quotes," makes C++ look right, puts a little space between double underbars, makes
       ALLCAPS a teeny bit smaller in <b>troff</b>, and escapes stuff that *roff treats as special so that you
       don't have to.

       The recognized options to <u>new()</u> are as follows.  All options take a single argument.

       center
           Sets the centered page header to use instead of "User Contributed Perl Documentation".

       date
           Sets the left-hand footer.  By default, the modification date of the input file will be used, or
           the current date if <u>stat()</u> can't find that file (the case if the input is from STDIN), and the
           date will be formatted as YYYY-MM-DD.

       fixed
           The fixed-width font to use for vertabim text and code.  Defaults to CW.  Some systems may want
           CR instead.  Only matters for <b>troff</b> output.

       fixedbold
           Bold version of the fixed-width font.  Defaults to CB.  Only matters for <b>troff</b> output.

       fixeditalic
           Italic version of the fixed-width font (actually, something of a misnomer, since most fixed-width
           fonts only have an oblique version, not an italic version).  Defaults to CI.  Only matters for
           <b>troff</b> output.

       fixedbolditalic
           Bold italic (probably actually oblique) version of the fixed-width font.  Pod::Man doesn't assume
           you have this, and defaults to CB.  Some systems (such as Solaris) have this font available as
           CX.  Only matters for <b>troff</b> output.

       name
           Set the name of the manual page.  Without this option, the manual name is set to the uppercased
           base name of the file being converted unless the manual section is 3, in which case the path is
           parsed to see if it is a Perl module path.  If it is, a path like ".../lib/Pod/Man.pm" is
           converted into a name like "Pod::Man".  This option, if given, overrides any automatic
           determination of the name.

       quotes
           Sets the quote marks used to surround C&lt;&gt; text.  If the value is a single character, it is used
           as both the left and right quote; if it is two characters, the first character is used as the
           left quote and the second as the right quoted; and if it is four characters, the first two are
           used as the left quote and the second two as the right quote.

           This may also be set to the special value "none", in which case no quote marks are added around
           C&lt;&gt; text (but the font is still changed for troff output).

       release
           Set the centered footer.  By default, this is the version of Perl you run Pod::Man under.  Note
           that some system an macro sets assume that the centered footer will be a modification date and
           will prepend something like "Last modified: "; if this is the case, you may want to set "release"
           to the last modified date and "date" to the version number.

       section
           Set the section for the ".TH" macro.  The standard section numbering convention is to use 1 for
           user commands, 2 for system calls, 3 for functions, 4 for devices, 5 for file formats, 6 for
           games, 7 for miscellaneous information, and 8 for administrator commands.  There is a lot of
           variation here, however; some systems (like Solaris) use 4 for file formats, 5 for miscellaneous
           information, and 7 for devices.  Still others use 1m instead of 8, or some mix of both.  About
           the only section numbers that are reliably consistent are 1, 2, and 3.

           By default, section 1 will be used unless the file ends in .pm in which case section 3 will be
           selected.

       The standard Pod::Simple method <u>parse</u><b>_</b><u>file()</u> takes one argument naming the POD file to read from.  By
       default, the output is sent to STDOUT, but this can be changed with the <u>output</u><b>_</b><u>fd()</u> method.

       The standard Pod::Simple method <u>parse</u><b>_</b><u>from</u><b>_</b><u>file()</u> takes up to two arguments, the first being the
       input file to read POD from and the second being the file to write the formatted output to.

       You can also call <u>parse</u><b>_</b><u>lines()</u> to parse an array of lines or <u>parse</u><b>_</b><u>string</u><b>_</b><u>document()</u> to parse a
       document already in memory.  To put the output into a string instead of a file handle, call the
       <u>output</u><b>_</b><u>string()</u> method.  See Pod::Simple for the specific details.

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       roff font should be 1 or 2 chars, not "%s"
           (F) You specified a *roff font (using "fixed", "fixedbold", etc.) that wasn't either one or two
           characters.  Pod::Man doesn't support *roff fonts longer than two characters, although some *roff
           extensions do (the canonical versions of <b>nroff</b> and <b>troff</b> don't either).

       Invalid quote specification "%s"
           (F) The quote specification given (the quotes option to the constructor) was invalid.  A quote
           specification must be one, two, or four characters long.

<b>BUGS</b>
       Eight-bit input data isn't handled at all well at present.  The correct approach would be to map E&lt;&gt;
       escapes to the appropriate UTF-8 characters and then do a translation pass on the output according to
       the user-specified output character set.  Unfortunately, we can't send eight-bit data directly to the
       output unless the user says this is okay, since some vendor *roff implementations can't handle eight-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">bit&nbsp;eightbit</font>
       bit data.  If the *roff implementation can, however, that's far superior to the current hacked
       characters that only work under troff.

       There is currently no way to turn off the guesswork that tries to format unmarked text appropriately,
       and sometimes it isn't wanted (particularly when using POD to document something other than Perl).
       Most of the work towards fixing this has now been done, however, and all that's still needed is a
       user interface.

       The NAME section should be recognized specially and index entries emitted for everything in that
       section.  This would have to be deferred until the next section, since extraneous things in NAME
       tends to confuse various man page processors.  Currently, no index entries are emitted for anything
       in NAME.

       Pod::Man doesn't handle font names longer than two characters.  Neither do most <b>troff</b>
       implementations, but GNU troff does as an extension.  It would be nice to support as an option for
       those who want to use it.

       The preamble added to each output file is rather verbose, and most of it is only necessary in the
       presence of non-ASCII characters.  It would ideally be nice if all of those definitions were only
       output if needed, perhaps on the fly as the characters are used.

       Pod::Man is excessively slow.

<b>CAVEATS</b>
       The handling of hyphens and em dashes is somewhat fragile, and one may get the wrong one under some
       circumstances.  This should only matter for <b>troff</b> output.

       When and whether to use small caps is somewhat tricky, and Pod::Man doesn't necessarily get it right.

       Converting neutral double quotes to properly matched double quotes doesn't work unless there are no
       formatting codes between the quote marks.  This only matters for troff output.
