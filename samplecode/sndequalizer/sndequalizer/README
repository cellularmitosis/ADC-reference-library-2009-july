README - SndEqualizerThis sample creates and manages a dialog window containing a graphic equalizer display, similar to the one in the "LCD panel" in QuickTime Player. Really there are just two key functions that you use to make this happen, MediaSetSoundEqualizerBands and MediaGetSoundEqualizerBandLevels. Enjoy, QuickTime Team
