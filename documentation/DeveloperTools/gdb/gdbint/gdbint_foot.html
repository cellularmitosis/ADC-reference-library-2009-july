<P>The function
cast is not portable ISO C.

<P>As of this writing (April 2001),
setting verbosity level is not yet implemented, and is always returned
as zero.  So calling <CODE>ui_out_message</CODE> with a <VAR>verbosity</VAR>
argument more than zero will cause the message to never be printed.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT3" HREF="gdbint_9.html#DOCF3">(3)</A></H3>
<P>Some D10V instructions are
actually pairs of 16-bit sub-instructions.  However, since you can't
jump into the middle of such a pair, code addresses can only refer to
full 32 bit instructions, which is what matters in this explanation.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT4" HREF="gdbint_9.html#DOCF4">(4)</A></H3>
<P>The
above is from the original example and uses K&#38;R C.  GDB
has since converted to ISO C but lets ignore that.
