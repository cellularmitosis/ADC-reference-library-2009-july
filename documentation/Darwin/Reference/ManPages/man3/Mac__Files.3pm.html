<b>NAME</b>
       Mac::Files - Macintosh Toolbox Interface to the File and Alias Manager

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       <b>Constants</b>

       Constants for file access permissions.  Use these constants to request a type of access to a file or
       fork, or to deny a type of access to a file or fork to other paths that may request access.

       Note that it is possible, on Mac OS 8 and 9, to open a file residing on read-only media with write
       access. On Mac OS X, however, you cannot open a file with write access on read-only media; the
       attempt to open the file fails with a wrPermErr error.

       fsCurPerm
           Requests whatever permissions are currently allowed. If write access is unavailable (because the
           file is locked or the file is already open with write permission), then read permission is
           granted. Otherwise read/write permission is granted.

       fsRdPerm
           Requests permission to read the file.

       fsWrPerm
           Requests permission to write to the file. If write permission is granted, no other access paths
           are granted write permission. Note, however, that the File Manager does not support write-only
           access to a file. Thus, fsWrPerm is synonymous with fsRdWrPerm.

       fsRdWrPerm
           Requests exclusive read and write permission. If exclusive read/write permission is granted, no
           other users are granted permission to write to the file. Other users may, however, be granted
           permission to read the file.

       fsRdWrShPerm
           Requests shared read and write permission. Shared read/write permission allows mutliple access
           paths for reading and writing. This is safe only if there is some way of locking portions of the
           file before writing to them. Use the functions PBLockRangeSync and PBUnlockRangeSync to lock and
           unlock ranges of bytes within a file. On Mac OS 8 and 9, these functions are supported only on
           remotely mounted volumes, or on local volumes that are shareable on the network. You should check
           that range locking is available before requesting shared read/ write permission. On Mac OS X,
           range locking is available on all volumes.

       fsRdDenyPerm
           Requests that any other paths be prevented from having read access. A path cannot be opened if
           you request read permission (with the fsRdPerm constant) but some other path has requested deny-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">read&nbsp;denyread</font>
           read access. Similarly, the path cannot be opened if you request deny-read permission, but some
           other path already has read access. This constant is used with the PBHOpenDenySync and
           PBHOpenRFDenySync functions.

       fsWrDenyPerm
           Requests that any other paths be prevented from having write access. A path cannot be opened if
           you request write permission (with the fsWrPerm constant) but some other path has requested deny-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">write&nbsp;denywrite</font>
           write access. Similarly, the path cannot be opened if you request deny-write permission, but some
           other path already has write access. This constant is used with the PBHOpenDenySync and
           PBHOpenRFDenySync functions.

       ioFlAttrib bits, returned by FSpGetCatInfo.

       kioFlAttribLocked
           Set if file or directory is locked

       kioFlAttribResOpen
           Set if resource fork is open

       kioFlAttribDataOpen
           Set if data fork is open

       kioFlAttribDir
           Set if this is a directory

       kioFlAttribCopyProt
           Set if AppleShare server "copy-protects" the file

       kioFlAttribFileOpen
           Set if file (either fork) is open

       kioFlAttribInShared
           Set if the directory is within a shared area of the directory hierarchy

       kioFlAttribMounted
           Set if the directory is a share point that is mounted by some user

       kioFlAttribSharePoint
           Set if the directory is a share point

       Finder flags

       kIsOnDesk
           Files and folders (System 6)

       kColor
           Files and folders; bit 0x0020 was kRequireSwitchLaunch, but is now reserved for future use

       kIsShared
           Files only (Applications only); if clear, the application needs to write to its resource fork,
           and therefore cannot be shared on a server

       kHasNoINITs
           Files only (Extensions/Control Panels only); this file contains no INIT resource

       kHasBeenInited
           Files only; clear if the file contains desktop database; resources ('BNDL', 'FREF', 'open',
           'kind'...) that have not been added yet. Set only by the Finder; reserved for folders - make sure
           this bit is cleared for folders; bit 0x0200 was the letter bit for AOCE, but is now reserved for
           future use

       kHasCustomIcon
           Files and folders

       kIsStationery
           Files only

       kNameLocked
           Files and folders

       kHasBundle
           Files only

       kIsInvisible
           Files and folders

       kIsAlias
           Files only

       AppleTalk/GetAliasInfo Constants

       asiZoneName
           Return AppleTalk zone name from GetAliasInfo.

       asiServerName
           Return AppleTalk server name from GetAliasInfo.

       asiVolumeName
           Return volume name from GetAliasInfo.

           Return last component of target file name from GetAliasInfo.

       asiParentName
           Return name of enclosing folder from GetAliasInfo. This index value is 1.  Higher indices will
           return folder names higher up the hierarchy.

       Folder type constants.  Specify a type of folder on a particular volume.  Use in vRefNum parameter of
       <u>FindFolder()</u>.

       kOnSystemDisk
           previously was 0x8000 but that is an unsigned value whereas vRefNum is signed

       kOnAppropriateDisk
           Generally, the same as kOnSystemDisk, but it's clearer that this isn't always the 'boot' disk.

       Folder Domains - Carbon only.  The constants above can continue to be used, but the folder/volume
       returned will be from one of the domains below.

       kSystemDomain

           Domain referring to the currently configured Classic System Folder

       kLastDomainConstant
