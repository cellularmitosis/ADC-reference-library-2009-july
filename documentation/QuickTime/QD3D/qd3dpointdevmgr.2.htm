The QuickDraw&nbsp;3D Pointing Device Manager is the 3D analogue of some of the managers contained in the Macintosh Toolbox, which you can use to create and handle two-dimensional aspects of your application's user interface (such as windows, controls, and menus). The key benefit in both cases (that is, two- and three-dimensional) is the same: by using the routines supplied by Apple Computer, Inc., you can guarantee that your application looks and acts just like any other applications that use those routines.<A NAME="marker=3076"> </A></P><P CLASS="T1.Text1"><A NAME="pgfId=4132"> </A>This consistency of the user interface among different applications helps users learn to use your application; it also helps them focus on the distinctive features of your application, because they are not distracted by unnecessary differences between your application and other 3D applications they may have used.</P><P CLASS="I.Important"><A NAME="pgfId=4133"> </A>In general, you should use the user interface routines contained in the QuickDraw&nbsp;3D Pointing Device Manager for your three-dimensional user interface elements unless you have a compelling reason to adopt some other user interface paradigms. </P><P CLASS="T1.Text1"><A NAME="pgfId=3088"> </A>The QuickDraw&nbsp;3D Pointing Device Manager contains several kinds of routines, including routines you can use to</P><UL><LI CLASS="B1.Bullet1"><A NAME="pgfId=3089"> </A>determine what kinds of pointing devices are available on a particular computer</LI><LI CLASS="B1.Bullet1"><A NAME="pgfId=2106"> </A>configure one or more of those devices to control items in a 3D model (such as the position of an object or a camera)</LI></UL><P CLASS="T1.Text1"><A NAME="pgfId=3092"> </A>The following sections describe these tasks and the routines you can use to perform them.<A NAME="marker=3093"> </A></P><H2 CLASS="H2.Heading2TOC"><A HREF="qd3dpointdevmgr.3.htm#pgfId=3094" CLASS="Hypertext">Controllers</A></H2><H2 CLASS="H2.Heading2TOC"><A HREF="qd3dpointdevmgr.4.htm#pgfId=3149" CLASS="Hypertext">Controller States</A></H2><H2 CLASS="H2.Heading2TOC"><A HREF="qd3dpointdevmgr.5.htm#pgfId=3154" CLASS="Hypertext">Trackers</A></H2><hr>&#169; d by Apple Computer, Inc.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><!-- start of footer --><!--#include virtual="/includes/framesetfooter" --><!-- end of footer --></BODY></HTML>
