NamingTableAccess - a Pascal Unit, and a small application demonstrating its usage. Helps dig out the contents of the NamingTable in a TrueType 'sfnt'(see "The TrueTypeª Font Format Specification Version 1.0", APDA M0825LL/A, p. 232).Access to tables contained in a 'sfnt' has been coded along the lines suggested by Mike Reed (see  d e v e l o p  n¡ 8, "Curves ahead").The demo application calls the NamingTableLookup function in the following way:  index := 0;  REPEAT  { loop through all available strings: "index" keeps track of the last request }    platformID := 1;  { sorry - no Microsoft Windows here! }    encodingID := gEncoding;       { gEncoding, gLangage, gContent ... }    languageID := gLanguage;      {... correspond to the menu selections ... )    nameID := gContent;             { ... within the demo application. }    s := NamingTableLookup(sfnt, platformID, encodingID, languageID, nameID, index);    IF s <> '' THEN     BEGIN       { insert the string s into the display }     END;  UNTIL s = '';Please, send comments, bug reports, suggestions and gifts to:Joseph Maurer, Macintosh Developer Technical SupportAppleLink VELOCIO.
