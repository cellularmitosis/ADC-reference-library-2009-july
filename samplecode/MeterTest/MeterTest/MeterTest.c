/*	File:		MeterTest.c	Contains:	This snippet demonstrates record metering through the use of SPBGetDeviceInfo() 				and SPBSetDeviceInfo() using the siLevelMeterOnOff selector. The code calls 				SPBSetDeviceInfo() to initially set metering to off, then does a quick sampling of 				sound input using SPBGetDeviceInfo(). Metering is then turned on and sampling is 				repeated. This is an SIOW application and could be done more elegantly using a				graphical representation for sound input levels. But you get the idea. . .			Written by: Kevin Mellander		Copyright:	Copyright © 1994-1999 by Apple Computer, Inc., All Rights Reserved.				You may incorporate this Apple sample source code into your program(s) without				restriction.
