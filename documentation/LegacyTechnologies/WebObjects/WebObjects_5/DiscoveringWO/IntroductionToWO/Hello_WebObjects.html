Though this project is trivial, it doesserve as an example with which to examine the interface of ProjectBuilder. Also, a successful build and launch verifies that yourdevelopment environment is correctly installed and configured. </p><br><a name = "TPXREF101"></a><h3><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Launch Project Builder</font></h3><ol><li>Navigateto the <tt>/Developer/Applications</tt> directory.</font></li><li>Double-click the Project Builder icon.<br> <img src = "../Art/projectbuildericon.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/projectbuildericon.gif]"><p>The first timeyou run Project Builder, you are greeted by a setup assistant thatwalks you through some of the basic configuration settings of ProjectBuilder. At this point, you could customize the build system usedto compile your projects, but for now, accept the default optionson each pane.</p></font></li></ol><br><a name = "TPXREF102"></a><h3><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Using the New Project Assistant</font></h3><p>When you first launch Project Builder, you see only its menubar. To create a project to work in, choose New Project from theFile menu. The Project Builder Assistant appears, walking you througha few steps to create a new project.</p><br><a name = "TPXREF108"></a><p><b><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">Figure3-1 The New Project Assistant</font></b></p> <img src = "../Art/pbassistantnewproject.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/pbassistantnewproject.gif]"><p>There are several project types to choose from. Each startsout with a slightly different set of files and configuration tofacilitate particular types of applications, from command-line toolsto desktop applications. The following are two types of WebObjectsproject you can develop:</p><ul><li><b>WebObjectsApplication</b> This project type is the basic startingpoint for WebObjects applications. It provides one Web page, a systemfor moving resources like images to your Web server's documentroot during installation, and other basic components like the Sessionand Application classes.</font></li><li><b>WebObjects Framework</b> A framework isa bundle of related code, resources such as sounds and graphics,and more. You can make your applications dependent on your frameworksas a means of sharing code between applications. Your WebObjects applicationsare based on the JavaWebObjects framework, and you can write yourown as well.</font></li></ul><p>Follow these steps to build your first WebObjects applicationproject.</p><ol><li>Select WebObjectsApplication from the list of templates and click Next.</font></li><li>Type <code>HelloWebObjects</code> inthe Project Name text input field.<p>If you don't want to usethe default project location, click Set and navigate to the directorywhere you want to store your project. </p><br><a name = "TPXREF109"></a><p><b><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">Figure 3-2 Choosinga location for the project</font></b></p> <img src = "../Art/intronewprojectassistant.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/intronewprojectassistant.gif]"></font></li><li>Click Finish to create the project.<p>A window similarto the one in  <a href="#BABFHIJD">Figure 3-3</a> appears.</p></font></li></ol><br><a name = "TPXREF104"></a><h3><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">The Main Window</font></h3><br><a name = "BABFHIJD"></a><p><b><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">Figure3-3 Project Builder's main window</font></b></p> <img src = "../Art/pbhellowo.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/pbhellowo.gif]"><p>The Project Builder main window organizes all the files inyour project and provides all the tools you need to edit, build,and debug them. </p><p>When you first create a project, Project Builder displaysthe release notes in the code editor, which is the pane where youusually edit files. This document contains information about thelatest release of Project Builder. You should read it carefully.</p><p>The left pane is a tabbed pane used for organization. In theGroups & Files pane, which is initially visible, there are severalgroups of files, each with a disclosure triangle. </p><ul><li>Classes<p>Thisgroup initially contains the <code>.java</code> filesfor the Application, Session, and DirectAction classes that yourapplication uses. You can customize your application by changingthese files. In addition, when you add new classes to your project,they are stored here by default.</p></font></li><li>Web Components<p>Each Web page or component you createis stored within its own subgroup in the Web Components group. Eachsubgroup contains the files that define the HTML representationand WebObjects behavior for each component. Initially, only theMain subgroup is present.</p><p>Inside the Main subgroup youfind three items: <tt>Main.wo</tt>, <tt>Main.java</tt> ,and <tt>Main.api</tt>. They define the look and behaviorof the Main component.</p></font></li><li>Resources<p>Graphics, sounds, and movies for your componentsare stored in this folder. In database-enabled applications, themodel files (with the extension <code>.eomodeld</code>)are stored here.</p></font></li><li>Web Server Resources<p>Some resources may be referencednot only by your WebObjects applications but also by static pagesin other parts of the site. Resources in this folder are moved toa location outside of the application wrapper, where they can beaccessed by other means as well.</p></font></li><li>Frameworks<p>Every WebObjects project is dependent on atleast the JavaWebObjects framework, which contains the code behindWebObjects. You can add additional frameworks to your project bychoosing Project &gt; Add Files.</p></font></li><li>Documentation<p>Documentation for your project can be organizedby Project Builder.</p></font></li><li>Products<p>The actual files created by compiling your applicationare listed under this group. It includes the executable, an organizedtree of resources for components, and localized versions of thecomponents themselves. </p></font></li></ul><p>The other three panes, Bookmarks, Targets, and Breakpoints,are explained in greater detail later in the book.</p><br><a name = "TPXREF105"></a><h3><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Modifying the Main Component</font></h3><p>Now you'll use WebObjects Builder to modify the Main component.</p><ol><li>Open <code>Main.wo</code>.<br> <img src = "../Art/pbmainwosel.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/pbmainwosel.gif]"><p>Double-clickthe <code>Main.wo</code> componentin the Main subgroup in the Web Components group in the Groups &Files list in Project Builder. The WebObjects Builder application opensand displays a window for Main.wo.</p></font></li><li>Modify <code>Main.wo</code>.<p>Enter <code>HelloWorld!</code> in the content pane.</p><br> <img src = "../Art/wobmainhello.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/wobmainhello.gif]"></font></li><li>Save <code>Main.wo</code>.<p>ChooseFile &gt; Save.</p></font></li></ol><br><a name = "TPXREF106"></a><h3><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Building the Project</font></h3><p>All that remains is to compile the project and run it. Whenyou start the build process, Project Builder does more than compilethe Java bytecode from your files. First, only files that have changedsince the last build are compiled, to save time. Project Builderalso gathers all the resources required for your project, organizesthem for your Web server, and compresses your Java class files intoa JAR (Java Archive) file.</p><p>When you choose Build from the Build menu, the build paneappears so you can watch the progress of the build. This is alsothe pane that displays Java compilation errors if your project hasany, but its output is frequently very useful even when it doesn'tcontain error messages.</p><p>In Project Builder, choose Build &gt; Build or click  <img src = "../Art/buildicon.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/buildicon.gif]"> in the mainwindow. </p><p>Because you didn't modify any Java code, you shouldn'tencounter any compilation errors. When the compilation progressbar is complete, you're ready to run your project.</p><br><a name = "TPXREF107"></a><h3><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Running the Project</font></h3><p>Unless you changed the default location when you first ranProject Builder, you now have a bundle called <tt>HelloWebObjects.woa</tt> inthe <tt>build</tt> directory at the top level of yourproject's directory.</p><p>Choose Debug &gt; Run Executable or click  <img src = "../Art/launchicon.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/launchicon.gif]"> in ProjectBuilder's main window.</p><p>Since your application is already built, the Run pane appearsimmediately, displaying the output from your application as it runs:</p><pre>Reading MacOSClassPath.txt ...Launching HelloWebObjects.woa ...</pre><p>. . .</p><pre>Creating adaptor of class WODefaultAdaptor listening on port -1 with a listen queue  size of 128 and 2 WOWorkerThreads.Creating LifebeatThread now with: HelloWebObjects -1 1085 30000Welcome to HelloWebObjects!Opening application's URL in browser: http://localhost:49189/cgi-bin/WebObjects/HelloWebObjectsWaiting for requests...</pre><p>After the last line appears, the URL shown opens automaticallyin your default browser.</p><br><a name = "TPXREF110"></a><p><b><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">Figure3-4 The HelloWebObjects application inaction</font></b></p> <img src = "../Art/iehellowo.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/iehellowo.gif]"><br><a href="Project_Builder.html" target="_right"><img src="../Images/previous.gif" border="0" alt="Previous"></a><a href="../DynamicContent/index.html" target="_top"><img src="../Images/next.gif" border="0" alt="Next"></a>&nbsp;<hr alt=""><p><font face="Palatino" size="1">&#169; 2001 Apple Computer, Inc.</font></p><!-- start of footer --><!--#include virtual="/includes/framesetfooter" --><!-- end of footer --></body></html>>
