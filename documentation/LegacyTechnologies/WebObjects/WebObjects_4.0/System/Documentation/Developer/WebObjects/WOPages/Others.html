The Omni Development group graciously maintains a very useful WebObjects mailing list, on which you can ask questions, answer questions, and share code with other WebObjects developers.  This is probably the most useful external source of WebObjects information you'll find.
<p>
To subscribe to the WebObjects mailing list, send mail to <a href="mailto:listproc@omnigroup.com?subscribe WebObjects Your Name">listproc@omnigroup.com</a> saying (in the body of the message):
