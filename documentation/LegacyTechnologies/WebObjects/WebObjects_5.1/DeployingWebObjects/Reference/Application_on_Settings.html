You can set the value of these propertiesin Monitor, in the command line, or in an application's <code>Properties</code> file(which you would have to create and place in the <code>Contents/Resources</code> directoryof the application). The following sections describe all the settingsand their function.</p><br><a name = "BCIFAFEC"></a><h3><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Application Settings</font></h3><p>The following sections describe the properties that applyto all the instances of an application. In Monitor, you set thevalue of these properties in the Application Settings section ofthe application configuration page.</p><br><a name = "BCIIIJBB"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Adaptor</font></h4><p>The default adaptor class an instance uses. (This is not theHTTP adaptor used by the HTTP server.) You use this if the applicationdefines a subclass of the WOAdaptor class to be used to create adaptorobjects (instead of using the WOAdaptor class itself).</p><br><a name = "TPXREF120"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Adaptor Threads</font></h4><p>The number of worker threads that the adaptor creates to handlerequests to the application. It applies only to adaptor objectsof the WODefaultAdaptor class in WebObjects 4.5.</p><br><a name = "TPXREF121"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Listen Queue Size</font></h4><p>Determines the depth of the listen queue. While the instancehandles a request, the socket buffer can hold as many additionalrequests as this setting indicates before it starts refusing them.If you expect spikes in the traffic level of a specific application,consider increasing the value of this property. While it does notnecessarily improve performance, or allow the instance to processmore requests at sustained high loads, it may reduce the numberof times an application's user has to retry to send a particularrequest during high-traffic periods.</p><p>Keep in mind that if an application instance's listen queuesize becomes full and a request is refused by it, the request doesnot get redirected to another instance with space left over in itsqueue. The client will have to resend the request.</p><br><a name = "TPXREF122"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Maximum Adaptor Threads</font></h4><p>The maximum number of worker threads the HTTP adaptor createsto handle requests to the application. It applies only to adaptorprocesses of the WODefaultAdaptor class in WebObjects 5. The purposeof these threads is to process TCP or UDP packets; they have nothingto do with request processing.</p><br><a name = "TPXREF123"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Minimum Adaptor Threads</font></h4><p>The initial number of worker threads the adaptor creates tohandle requests to the application. It applies only to adaptor processesof the WODefaultAdaptor class in WebObjects 5.</p><br><a name = "TPXREF124"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Name</font></h4><p>This property is used by the HTTP adaptor to implement loadbalancing . The adaptor can load-balance only between instanceswith the same application name. The property can be used to creategroups of instances, even when the instances share the same executablefile. This argument is set automatically for instances started bywotaskd.</p><br><a name = "TPXREF125"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Phased Startup</font></h4><p>If this option is selected, when a wotaskd process startsup, the instances that it manages that have  <a href="#BCIBFHDG">	Auto Recover</a> selected are startedone-at-a-time instead of all at once. This option is selected bydefault. For more information, see  <a href="#BCIBFHDG">"Auto Recover"</a>.</p><br><a name = "TPXREF126"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Starting Port</font></h4><p>The first port number to try to assign to a new instance ofthe application. If the port is in use by another instance (of anyapplication), the next nonassigned port number is used.</p><br><a name = "TPXREF127"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Time Allowed for Startup</font></h4><p>The number of seconds Monitor waits for an instance to startbefore determining that the instance failed to start.</p><br><a name = "BCIDBFIB"></a><h3><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Instance Settings</font></h3><p>The following sections explain the properties that can beset in Monitor in the New Instance Defaults section of the applicationconfiguration page and in the Instance Settings section of the instanceconfiguration page.</p><br><a name = "TPXREF128"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Additional Arguments</font></h4><p>Additional information to send to the instance when it'sstarted. You can use this property to set the values of propertiesfor which Monitor doesn't provide a user interface.</p><br><a name = "TPXREF129"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Auto-Open In Browser</font></h4><p>Determines whether the instance automatically opens a Webbrowser window to the application's URL (starting up the browserif necessary).</p><br><a name = "BCIBFHDG"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Auto Recover</font></h4><p>Indicates whether instances are restarted automatically wheneverthey become unresponsive or are manually shut down.</p><br><a name = "TPXREF130"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Caching Enabled</font></h4><p>Determines whether the instance caches component definitionsinstead of parsing HTML code and declaration files each time a requestis processed. (A component is a Web page or a portion of one.)</p><br><a name = "TPXREF131"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Debugging Enabled</font></h4><p>Determines whether application instances print debugging messagesto the standard error stream during startup.</p><br><a name = "TPXREF132"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">ID</font></h4><p>The instance's identification number. Must be unique forthe load-balancing process to operate correctly. (This propertyis not available in the New Instance Defaults section.)</p><br><a name = "TPXREF133"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Lifebeat Interval</font></h4><p>Determines the interval, in seconds, between lifebeats.</p><br><a name = "BCIEFJHJ"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Minimum Active Sessions</font></h4><p>The minimum number of active sessions an instance must havebefore it can be terminated by Monitor. (A session is an objectof the WOSession class that stores user-state information.) See  <a href="#BCIEGHDH">"Scheduling Settings"</a>.</p><br><a name = "TPXREF134"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Output Path</font></h4><p>Allows you to redirect the instance's standard output andstandard error streams to the directory specified. The file generatedis named as follows:</p><pre>&lt;application name&gt;-&lt;instance ID&gt;</pre><br><a name = "TPXREF135"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Path</font></h4><p>Location of the launch script file for the application. Forexample, <code>MyApp</code> for MacOS X and Solaris, and <code>MyApp.cmd</code> forWindows 2000.</p><br><a name = "TPXREF136"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Port</font></h4><p>The port on which the instance runs. (This property is notavailable in the New Instance Defaults section.)</p><br><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">ProjectSearch Path</font></h4><p>List of file-system paths that WebObjects searches in rapid-turnaroundmode. These are the paths where your projects are located (relativepaths are relative to your project's launch script). WebObjectssearches for your projects in the order in which you specify the paths.You must specify the paths using the following format:</p><pre>(&quot;firstPath&quot;,&quot;secondPath&quot;,...)</pre><br><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">SessionTimeout</font></h4><p>Specifies the time, in seconds, that passes after the lastrequest is processed before the session times out.</p><br><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">StatisticsPage Password</font></h4><p>Specifies the password that must be entered to gain accessto the instance statistics (WOStats) page of an application instance.</p><br><a name = "BCIDJIAC"></a><h3><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Email Notification Settings</font></h3><p>You can tell Monitor to send a message to one of more emailaddresses when instances of the application terminate unexpectedly.(Manual or scheduled instance shut downs are not considered unexpectedterminations.) You specify the value of these settings in the Email Notificationssection of the Site page.</p><br><a name = "BCIBEFFD"></a><h3><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Load Balancing and AdaptorSettings</font></h3><p>The following sections explain the properties related to loadbalancing and other adaptor settings. In Monitor, you specify thevalue of these settings in the HTTP Adaptor Settings section ofthe site configuration page and in the Load Balancing and AdaptorSettings section of the application configuration page.</p><br><a name = "BCIGCCHA"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Connect Timeout</font></h4><p>The length of time, in seconds, before the adaptor gives upconnecting to an instance.</p><br><a name = "BCIHEBBI"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Connection Pool Size</font></h4><p>The maximum number of simultaneous connections the adaptorshould keep open for each configured instance.</p><br><a name = "BCIFIFEH"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Dormant</font></h4><p>The number of times the adaptor skips an instance of the applicationbefore trying again.</p><br><a name = "BCIFFCDD"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Load-Balancing Scheme</font></h4><p>The load-balancing method used by the adaptor for instancesof the application. The options provided by WebObjects are RoundRobin, Random, and Load Average. You can also use a custom loadbalancer by choosing Custom in the pop-up menu under "Load balancingscheme" in the Load Balancing and Adaptor Settings section ofthe application configuration page in Monitor and entering the loadbalancer's name in the Custom Scheduler Name text field. See  <a sector="mod" href="../Deployment/iSetting_Up_Applications.html" target="_top">"Load Balancing and Adaptor Settings"</a> for more information.</p><br><a name = "BCIBAAFH"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Receive Buffer Size</font></h4><p>The size, in bytes, of the TCP socket receive buffer that'sused for adaptor-to-instance communication.</p><br><a name = "BCIHCHAD"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Receive Timeout</font></h4><p>The length of time, in seconds, the adaptor waits for a responsefrom an instance of the application before giving up.</p><br><a name = "BCIBGJFC"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Redirection URL</font></h4><p>The URL that the user is redirected to when an instance failsto respond to a direct request.</p><br><a name = "BCICCDFH"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Retries</font></h4><p>The number of times a request is retried (trying several instances)if a communications failure occurs before an error page is returnedto the HTTP server.</p><br><a name = "BCIFDGFE"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Send Buffer Size</font></h4><p>The size, in bytes, of the TCP socket send buffer that'sused for adaptor-to-instance communication.</p><br><a name = "BCICFGDC"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Send Timeout</font></h4><p>The length of time, in seconds, the adaptor attempts to senddata to an instance of the application before giving up.</p><br><a name = "BCIDCAGJ"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">URL Version</font></h4><p>The WebObjects version to use for URL parsing and formatting.All WebObjects 4, 4.5, and 5 applications use version 4 URLs bydefault.</p><br><a name = "BCIEGHDH"></a><h3><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Scheduling Settings</font></h3><p>These properties determine when Monitor restarts applicationinstances. Restarting instances regularly helps you deploy highlyreliable sites. You set the values of scheduling properties in theScheduling section of the application configuration page.</p><br><a name = "TPXREF137"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Is Scheduled</font></h4><p>Determines whether the schedule defined for a particular instanceis active.</p><br><a name = "TPXREF138"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Graceful Scheduling</font></h4><p>Determines whether an instance is shut down gracefully orimmediately at its scheduled shut-down time. During a graceful shutdown,the instance does not create sessions for new users (they are automaticallydirected to other available instances, if any). Existing sessions remainactive until they time out or are destroyed programmatically. Whenthe number of active sessions drops to the value set for the MinimumActive Sessions property, the instance is restarted. When GracefulScheduling is not selected for the instance, it is restarted immediately,terminating active sessions. See  <a href="#BCIEFJHJ">"Minimum Active Sessions"</a> for moreinformation. </p><br><a name = "TPXREF139"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Types of Schedule</font></h4><p>There are three types of schedule available for instances:hourly, daily, and weekly.</p><ul><li><b>Hourly</b> Theinstance is restarted after a certain number of hours from a particularhour.</font></li><li><b>Daily</b> The instance is restarted ata particular hour every day.</font></li><li><b>Weekly</b> The instance is restarted aparticular hour on a specific day of the week.</font></li></ul><br>    <br><a href="Deployment__s_Reference.html" target="content"><img src="../images/previous.gif" border="0"></a><a href="Command_Line_Arguments.html" target="content"><img src="../images/next.gif" border="0"></a>&nbsp;<br><br><p><hr><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">&#169; 2002 Apple Computer, Inc.
