This sample shows how to use SPBRecord to record to memory, convert thesampling rate to some arbitrary rate, and then write the recorded, rateconverted samples to disk, asynchronously, using PBWriteAsync.This sample is useful for those developers who wish more flexibilitythan what is offered with SPBRecordToFile, or for those wishing to recordat a rate not supported by the sound input driver.This sample uses two parameter blocks because as Macs get faster, anddrives can't quite keep up, using just one parameter block for two writesis just asking for trouble.  It's not that much extra memory and it willbe a weird bug you never have to find.  The pbInUse field of each parameterblock is supposed to keep us from reusing the parameter block in case thingsget really stopped up.These routines are designed to be easliy portable (in fact they were rippedfrom another sample), so you should be able to use them with little modification.It checks for errors returned from SPBRecord and from the PBWrites.  If thereis a disk error returned from a PBWrite the SPBRecord completion routine willnot start the next record, killing the recording process and the error will bereturned in the Vars structure (in the theErr field).Happy recording!
