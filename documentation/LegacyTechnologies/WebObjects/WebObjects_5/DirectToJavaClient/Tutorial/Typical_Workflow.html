Removeany fields necessary, add others, and then order the property keysas you want them to appear in the Query Window.</li></p><p><li>Choose list in the Assistant's Task pull-down list, andmodify the list property keys. Since the Query Window displays listproperties as well as query properties, you can see what changesyou need to make.</li></p><p><li>Click the next tab in the Query Window. The Assistant automaticallyupdates to track your movements in the application. This saves yousetting the Entity pull-down list in the Assistant.</li></p><p><li>Repeat steps 2 through 4, until you've set the query andlist property keys for all the main entities.</li></p><p><li>Click the first tab in the Query Window.</li></p><p><li>Click New to open a form window for the current entity. Makenecessary changes to the entity's form property keys.</li></p><p><li>Make any necessary changes to property keys of any other entitythat appears in the current entity's form window. To do so, choose <code>list</code> or <code>identify</code> fromthe Assistant's Task pull-down list, and set the Entity pull-downlist to the other entity.</li></p><p><li>Click the next tab in the Query Window.</li></p><p><li>Repeat steps 7 and 9.</li></p></ol><p><font face="Times"> The following sections demonstrate this approach. Beforecontinuing, open the Assistant if it isn't open already, and selectthe Properties tab.</font></p><a name = "TPXREF112"></a><h3><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande">Examiningthe Panes of the Query Window</font></h3><p><font face="Times">You've already configured the Movie pane of the Query Window,so examine the next pane, Talent. The window allows you to searchon a talent's first and last names, and it shows the first andlast names in the results table. This is fine, so move on to thenext pane, Studio.</font></p><a name = "TPXREF113"></a><h4><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande">Configuringthe Studio Pane of the Query Window</font></h4><p><font face="Times">The Studio pane allows you to search for studios by theirname and budget. It seems unlikely that users want to search onbudget.</font></p><p><font face="Times">Remove <code>budget</code> fromthe query property keys list.</font></p><p><font face="Times">The results table shows the studio name and budget. This seemsfine, so move on to the next pane.</font></p><a name = "TPXREF114"></a><h4><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande">Configuringthe Customer Pane of the Query Window</font></h4><p><font face="Times">The Customer pane allows you to search for customers by theircity, first name, last name, credit card number, and credit cardauthorization. Users should not look up customers by credit cardinformation, so you should remove it.</font></p><ol><p><li>Remove <code>creditCard</code> fromthe query property keys.<p>The <code>creditCard</code> propertyis a to-one relationship that Direct to Java Client expands to theidentify property keys (<code>cardNumber</code> and <code>authorizationNum</code>)of the relationship's destination entity (a CreditCard). By removing <code>creditCard</code> fromthe property keys, you remove the <code>cardNumber</code> and <code>authorizationNum</code> fieldsfrom the query interface.</p></li></p><p><li>Add <code>memberSince</code> and <code>phone</code> tothe property keys.<p>Two other Customer properties, <code>memberSince</code> and <code>phone</code>,seem like reasonable attributes to query on, so add them.</p></li></p><p><li>Order the keys as follows: <code>firstName</code>, <code>lastName</code>, <code>city</code>, <code>phone</code>, <code>memberSince</code>.</li></p><p><li>Modify the list property keys.<p>The results table is fartoo crowded with properties to be useful, so pare down the set oflist property keys. Remove <code>state</code>, <code>streetAddress</code>, <code>zip</code>,and <code>creditCard</code> from thelist property keys. Order the remaining keys as follows: <code>firstName</code>, <code>lastName</code>, <code>city</code>, <code>phone</code>, <code>memberSince</code>.</p></li></p></ol><p><font face="Times">Move on to the next pane.</font></p><a name = "TPXREF115"></a><h4><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande">Configuringthe Unit Pane of the Query Window</font></h4><p><font face="Times">The Unit pane allows you to search for units by unit ID, dateacquired, movie name, and movie release date. It seems unlikelythat users want to search for particular units by movie releasedate, so remove it.</font></p><p><font face="Times">Note that the query property keys for Unit are <code>unitID</code>, <code>dateAcquired</code>,and <code>video</code>. Through the <code>video</code> key,Direct to Java Client gets both a movie name and movie release date,which correspond to the Movie <code>identify</code> propertykeys. You want to keep the movie name in the interface, but notthe movie release date.</font></p><ol><p><li>Remove <code>video</code> fromthe property keys.<p>Using the <code>video</code> key,you can't get one <code>identify</code> Movieproperty without the other one, so remove it. You'll add the Movie <code>name</code> propertyto the query interface another way.</p></li></p><p><li>Add <code>video.movie.title</code> tothe property keys.<p>Type <code>video.movie.title</code> inthe Additional Property Key Path text box at the bottom of the Propertiespane, and click Add.</p></li></p><p><li>Save and restart to observe these changes.<p>Adding keypaths to an entity's property keys flattens attributes into theentity for display purposes: the attribute identified by the keypath is treated in the user-interface as if it's one of the entity'sown attributes rather than an attribute of a related entity.</p></li></p><p><li>Change the label for <code>video.movie.title</code>.<p>Thelabel for <code>video.movie.title</code>,"Video Movie Title", seems unnecessarily wordy. "Movie Title"is better.</p><p>Click the Widgets tab in the Assistant. Setthe Task pull-down list to &lt;ALL&gt; if it isn't already, thenchoose <code>video.movie.title</code> fromthe Property Key pull-down list. In the Label field, delete theword "Video" so the label is simply "Movie Title".</p></li></p><p><li>Save and restart to observe this change.<p>Notice thatthe movie title label is now "Movie Title" for both the searchfield and for the column in the results table. To set one, but notthe other, you would simply set the Task pull-down list to the appropriatetask before making the change.</p></li></p><p><li>Examine Unit's list properties.<p>The <code>notes</code> propertycontains free-form text, and doesn't display well in a list, soremove <code>notes</code> from Unit'slist property keys.</p></li></p></ol><p><font face="Times">Move on to the next pane.</font></p><a name = "TPXREF116"></a><h4><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande">Configuringthe Video Pane of the Query Window</font></h4><p><font face="Times">Video's query interface has the same problem as Unit's.It seems unlikely that users want to search for videos by movierelease date. Remove it from the query interface the same way youdid for Unit. That is, remove the <code>movie</code> relationshipfrom the property keys and add <code>movie.title</code>.</font></p><a name = "TPXREF117"></a><h3><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande">ExaminingForm Windows</font></h3><p><font face="Times">Now that you've configured the panes of the Query Window,move on to the form windows. You've already configured Movie'sform window, so start with Talent.</font></p><p><font face="Times">Open a Talent form. It looks fine, so move on to Studio. It,too, looks fine, so move on to Customer.</font></p><a name = "TPXREF118"></a><h4><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande">Configuringthe Customer Form Window</font></h4><p><font face="Times">All the Customer properties are property keys. This is fine;users need to be able to edit all of a customer's data. However,the properties are ordered poorly. A customer's name should comefirst, and the components of a customer's address should be grouped togetherand ordered so they appear as a proper address.</font></p><ol><p><li>Order theCustomer form property keys as follows: <code>firstName</code>, <code>lastName</code>, <code>memberSince</code>, <code>phone</code>, <code>streetAddress</code>, <code>city</code>, <code>state</code>, <code>zip</code>, <code>creditCard</code>, <code>rentals</code>.</li></p><p><li>Examine the Credit Card pane at the bottom of the Customerwindow.<p>The property keys are poorly ordered, and the "Num"in the "Authorization Num" label should be spelled out.</p></li></p><p><li>Using the Properties Assistant, order CreditCard's formproperty keys as: <code>cardNumber</code>, <code>expirationDate</code>, <code>limit</code>, <code>authorizationNum</code>, <code>authorizationDate</code>, <code>customer</code>.<p>Notethat <code>customer</code> is a to-onerelationship from CreditCard to Customer. Ordinarily, a to-one relationshipis represented in a form, but <code>customer</code> isn'trepresented here. That's because Direct to Java Client filtersthe <code>customer</code> propertykey out of the user interface rather than display it recursively.Since the CreditCard form is contained within a Customer form, Customerinformation is already displayed. This feature is called <i>entity hierarchyfiltering</i>.</p><table border = "0"><tr><td scope="row"><b>WARNING</b></td></tr><tr><td scope="row">Be careful about removing relationships from the setof property keys. Even though a relationship isn't necessary fora window you're looking at, it might be needed by another window.</td></tr></table><p>Asan example, consider the MovieRole entity, which has to-one relationshipsto Movie and Talent. Similarly, Movie and Talent have to-many relationshipsback to their MovieRoles. Since MovieRole is an <em>other</em> entity,MovieRole records are manipulated in a master-detail user interfacein Movie and Talent form windows. In a Movie form window, the interfacefor displaying and setting a MovieRole's value uses only the <code>roleName</code> attributeand the <code>talent</code> relationship.Entity hierarchy filtering prevents the interface from using the <code>movie</code> relationship.When you're looking at the Movie form window, you might considerremoving MovieRole's <code>movie</code> relationshipfrom the form task's property keys. It's filtered out, but youmight think of removing it anyway for clarity. However, if you removeit, the <code>movie</code> relationshipwon't be displayed in the Talent form window either. In the Talent windowa MovieRole's <code>movie</code> relationshipis important information.</p></li></p><p><li>In the Widgets pane of the Assistant, change the <code>authorizationNum</code> labelto "Authorization Number".</li></p><p><li>Examine the Rentals pane.<p>The Rentals pane looks OK,so move on to the next form window.</p></li></p></ol><a name = "TPXREF119"></a><h4><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande">Configuringthe Unit Form Window</font></h4><p><font face="Times">The form property keys for Unit are correct, and their orderis fine, too. However, the notes property should be in a text areainstead of a field.</font></p><ol><p><li>Change the <code>notes</code> widgetto a text area.<p>Click the Widgets tab in the Assistant. Setthe Task pull-down list to form, and choose <code>notes</code> fromthe Property Key pull-down list. Set the Widget Type to EOTextAreaController.Save the change, and open a new Unit form window to see the result.</p></li></p><p><li>Examine the Rentals area of the window.<p>You need to resizethe windows to read the Rental table columns. Each Rental line displaysCustomer identify properties: <code>city</code>, <code>firstName</code>,and <code>lastName</code>. The <code>city</code> attributeisn't really necessary, and it would be more helpful if a customer'slast name were to appear first.</p></li></p><p><li>Modify Customer's identify property keys.<p>Remove <code>city</code> fromCustomer's identify property keys. Order <code>lastName</code> first.Save your changes.</p></li></p></ol><p><font face="Times">Move on to the next form window, Video.
