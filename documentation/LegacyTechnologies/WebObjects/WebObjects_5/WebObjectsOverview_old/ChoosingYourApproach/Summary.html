<p><font face="Times">The advantages and disadvantages of the four WebObjects development
approaches are summarized in the following paragraphs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">The primary advantage of the WebObjects HTML-based approach
is its portability. Any user with a Web-enabled computer and a Web
browser can use the application. Its disadvantages are the limitations
of the HTML-based user interface-delays due to round trips to
the server and a limited widget set.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Direct to Web has the same advantages and limitations of the
WebObjects HTML-based approach. However, it also allows you to develop
data-driven applications extremely quickly. The downside of Direct
to Web is that it generates a particular user interface that may
not be suitable for your application.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Java Client applications provide the rich and fast user interfaces
of client-server desktop applications. The disadvantage of this
approach is portability. You need to install or download the application
on the user's computer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Direct to Java Client allows you to quickly develop data-driven
Java Client applications and therefore has the advantages and disadvantages
of Java Client. However, like Direct to Web, Direct to Java Client
imposes a particular user interface that may not be suitable for
your application.</font></p>
