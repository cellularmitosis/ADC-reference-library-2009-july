Why Was This Archived?This sample was archived because it uses the 'classic' networking APIs (either classic AppleTalk or MacTCP) and all samples that use those APIs have been archived.  While the classic networking APIs are currently emulated by Open Transport on current versions of Mac OS 8.x, they will not be supported in Carbon and are not suitable for new development.Quinn "The Eskimo!"Worldwide Developer Technical Support9 Jun 1999
