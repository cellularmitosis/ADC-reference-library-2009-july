What is QTMP3Player?

The QTMP3Player sample shows how to make a "one-page" MP3 player using QuickTime.
Note that this isn't the most efficient way to play MP3s.  For more in-depth information,
see the other DTS sample MP3Player that shows how to use QuickTime and the Carbon
Sound Manager to play VBR MP3 files.
