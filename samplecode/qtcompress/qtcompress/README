README - QTCompressThis sample code illustrates how to use QuickTime's standard image compression dialog component to get compression settings from the user and to compress an image or image sequence using those settings. See Chapter 3 of Inside Macintosh: QuickTime Components for complete information on the standard image compression dialog routines.This sample also shows how to extend the basic user interface by installing a modal-dialog filter function and a hook function to handle the optional custom button in the dialog box.Enjoy, QuickTime Team
