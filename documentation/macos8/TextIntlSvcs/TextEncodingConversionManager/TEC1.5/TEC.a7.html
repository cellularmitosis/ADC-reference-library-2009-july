Unicode</H1>
<P>
<A NAME="pgfId=6321">
 </A>
Unicode is a universal character set whose goal is to include characters for all of the worlds written languages, plus a large set of technical symbols, math operators, and so on--everything that needs to be encoded in text. It originated in work by Apple and Xerox in 1988, which was in turn based on the Xerox XCCS universal character set. At about the same time, the ISO/IEC joint technical committee JTC1 was developing a separate universal character set. These efforts were merged beginning in 1991 to produce what is essentially a single character set.<P>


<A NAME="pgfId=6322">
 </A>
There are actually two parallel standards. The Unicode Consortium is responsible for Unicode, while ISO/IEC JTC1 is responsible for ISO 10646. The goal is to keep the character repertoire and code point assignments synchronized. However, beyond that there are some differences.<P>


<A NAME="pgfId=6323">
 </A>
The Unicode standard specifies character properties and some rendering behavior, and includes conformance criteria. It clarifies character usage and semantics, and provides a set of guidelines for implementing Unicode. Mapping tables for converting other character sets to Unicode are also provided.<P>


<A NAME="pgfId=6324">
 </A>
ISO/IEC 10646, like most ISO character set standards, does not specify character properties or rendering behavior. On the other hand, it identifies three implementation levels and many subset repertoires to permit software to indicate precisely what it can and cannot support.<P>


<A NAME="pgfId=6325">
 </A>
Basic Unicode uses 16-bit code points. Two ranges, each consisting of 1024 16-bit code points, are reserved for high-half surrogates and low-half surrogates; these can be combined to function as a 32-bit code point. This scheme, known as UTF-16, adds a million additional code points.<P>


<A NAME="pgfId=7646">
 </A>
ISO 10646 supports a 16-bit form (including UTF-16), called UCS-2, as well as a full 32-bit form, called UCS-4. In UCS-4, the high-order byte indicates the group and the next highest order byte indicates the plane. UTF-16 can represent UCS-4 code points from group 0, planes 0 through 16, but uses different numeric values for the characters in planes 1 through 16. Characters that can be represented using a single 16-bit code point are said to be on the Base Multilingual Plane (BMP).<P>


<A NAME="pgfId=6327">
 </A>
All of these forms can use the full range of 16-bit values. No attempt is made to avoid 16-bit values that contain bytes that may be interpreted in special ways on byte-oriented systems. The first 256 Unicode characters parallel ISO 8859-1; but since the Unicode code points are 16 bits, the high-order byte is 0, which might be interpreted as a C-string terminator on a byte-oriented system.<P>


<A NAME="pgfId=6328">
 </A>
To permit transmission of Unicode over byte-oriented 8-bit and 7-bit channels, two transformation formats have been devised.<P>


<A NAME="pgfId=7264">
 </A>
UTF-8 is intended for 8-bit protocols (such as the Web). All of the ASCII repertoire maps to single-byte characters using the ASCII code points. Other Unicode BMP characters map to a sequence of 2 or 3 bytes; the initial bytes of these sequences, as well as the following bytes, are all in distinct ranges so they can be distinguished from each other and from the ASCII range. This makes it relatively easy to process (much easier than Shift-JIS, for example).<P>


<A NAME="pgfId=7265">
 </A>
UTF-7 is intended for 7-bit protocols (such as mail). Certain characters in the ASCII repertoire are preserved intact. Other Unicode characters are mapped using a modified base 64 encoding. The character + is used to switch to modified base 64, and - is used to switch back out.<P>

Unicode provides a single encoding that can be used to represent multilingual text. Using a single encoding is much easier than supporting the multitude of encodings otherwise required for multilingual text. Unicode is also much easier to process than many of the other encodings.<P>


<A NAME="pgfId=6338">
 </A>
The use of Unicode does not by itself imply any particular language or group of languages, unlike the use of, say, ISO 2022-JP, which implies Japanese, or EUC-KR, which implies Korean. A Unicode code point represents a character that may be common to several languages. For example, <A HREF="TEC.a1.html#38579" CLASS="XRef">
Figure&nbsp;B-1</A>
 shows a single Unicode Han character that is used in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. Unicode encodes plain text--that is, the minimum information for preservation of text content and basic text legibility. It does not explicitly encode higher-level information such as language or font. Note, however, that Unicode does distinguish among characters in different scripts that may have the same appearance, such as LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A and GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA; this is necessary for preservation of text content.<P>


<A NAME="pgfId=6339">
 </A>
The Unicode repertoire is a superset of the repertoires of a large number of important standards. Thus, it can also serve as a hub for conversion among multiple encoding systems. For a specific set of source standards, Unicode ensures round-trip fidelity: Every character that is distinct in one of those standards is also distinct in Unicode (for this and other reasons, Unicode includes a number of compatibility characters that would not otherwise have been separately encoded). However, for other standards there may not be a one-to-one mapping from their repertoire onto Unicode; the other standards may include multiple characters that all correspond to the same Unicode character, or they may include characters for which there is no corresponding Unicode character. For example, the Adobe symbol set includes separate code points for upper, center, and lower sections of multiline parentheses, square brackets, and curly brackets; there are no corresponding characters in Unicode.<P>


<A NAME="pgfId=6340">

Unicode provides considerable advantages over other encodings, and Unicode is moving into widespread use. This is especially true on the Internet, where the profusion of character encodings has created the most acute problems. Examples of Unicode use include:</P>
