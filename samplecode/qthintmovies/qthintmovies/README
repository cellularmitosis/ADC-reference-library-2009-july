README - QTHintMoviesA QuickTime movie that is to be streamed should contain a "hint track" for each media track in the movie. A hint track contains information that assists the streaming server in the process of forming and timing network packets. These hint tracks essentially free the server from having to know the details of network protocols or media-specific codecs, thereby reducing run-time processing. This mechanism also allows the server to stream new codec and network protocol types without modification (once they can be hinted).This sample code illustrates how to add hint tracks to a QuickTime movie. It illustrates several methods of doing this, and shows how to either display or not display the settings dialog box. Enjoy,QuickTime Team
