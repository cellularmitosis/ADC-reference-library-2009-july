EOModelfiles are typically stored in a project or a framework.</p><p>To load an EOModel, provide a model file's path to the constructor. Notethat loading an EOModel doesn't have the effect of loading allof its entities. EOModel files can be quite large, so to reduce start-uptime, entity definitions are only loaded as needed. This incrementalmodel loading is possible because an EOModel actually consists ofone index file and two files for each entity. Models have an <tt>.eomodeld</tt> filewrapper (which is actually a directory), and the individual entityfiles within the model are in ASCII format. The index file has thename<tt> index.eomodeld</tt>, and it contains the connection dictionary,the adaptor name, and a list of all of the entities in the model.It is this file that gets loaded when you create a new model froma pathinitWithContentsOfFile:. When anentity is loaded, EOModel posts an  <a frame= "conv" href="../EOModel.html#CHGCCBJD">EntityLoadedNotification</a>.The entity files are a <tt>.plist</tt> file that describesthe entity and a <tt>.fspec</tt> file that describesany named fetch specifications for that entity.</p><p>Some of the EOModel methods contain the string "TableOfContents".An EOModel's "table of contents" corresponds to its <b>index.eomodeld</b> file,which is used to access the model's entities. <b>index.eomodeld</b> isjust the ASCII representation of a model's table of contents.</p><br><a href="../../EOAccessTOC.html"><img src="../../../../../../../images/up.gif" border="0" alt="Table of Contents"></a> </BODY></HTML>
