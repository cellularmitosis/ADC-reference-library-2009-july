These folders contain three very simple SCSI samples that wereoriginally written for the benefit of the documentation writers.They have not been maintained and should not be used as abasis for production software. Instead, you should refer tothe somewhat misnamed "SCSI Simple Sample" if you needto understand how to call the original and asynchronousSCSI Managers. This is especially true if you need to scanthe SCSI bus for devices. Martin MinowDeveloper Technical Support. Compiled by:Think C 7.0MPW 3.3.1 (from Macintosh on Risc SDK)
