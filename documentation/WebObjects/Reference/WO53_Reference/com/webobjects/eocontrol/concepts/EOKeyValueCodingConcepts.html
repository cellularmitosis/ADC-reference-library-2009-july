  <h2>Stored Value Methods</h2>
  <p>The stored value methods, storedValueForKey and takeStoredValueForKey, 
  are used by the framework to store and restore an enterprise object's properties, 
  either from the database or from an in memory snapshot. This access is considered 
  private to the enterprise object and is invoked by the framework to effect 
  persistence on the object's behalf.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, the basic key value coding methods, valueForKey<b> </b>
  and takeValueForKey, are the public API to an enterprise object. They are invoked 
  by clients external to the object, such as for interactions with the user interface 
  or with other enterprise objects.</p>
  <p>All of the key value coding methods access an object's properties by invoking 
  property specific accessor methods or by directly accessing instance variables. 
  The basic methods resolve the specified property key as follows:</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Search for a public accessor method based on the specified key, invoking it if 
  there is one. For example, with a key of &quot;lastName&quot;, <b>takeValueForKey</b>
  looks for a method named <b>set</b><em>Key</em><b>:</b>, and <b>valueForKey</b><b> 
  </b>looks for a method named getLastName or lastName. 
  <li>If a public accessor method isn't found and useStoredAccessor returns true, 
  the basic methods search for a private accessor method based on the key. For example,
  with a key of &quot;lastName&quot;, <b>takeValueForKey</b> looks for a method 
  named <b>_set</b><em>Key</em><b>:</b>, and <b>valueForKey</b><b> </b>looks for a 
  method named _getLastName or _lastName. 
  <li>If an accessor method isn't found, the basic methods search for an instance 
  variable based on the key and set the value directly. For the key &quot;lastName&quot;
  , this would be <b>_lastName </b>or <b>lastName</b>. Note that <b>_lastName</b> 
  is used only if useStoredAccessor returns true. 
  </ol>
  <p>The stored value methods use a different search order for resolving the property 
  key: they search for a private accessor first, then for an instance variable, and 
  finally for a public accessor. Enterprise object classes can take advantage of this 
  distinction to simply set or get values when properties are accessed through the 
  private API (on behalf of a trusted source) and to perform additional processing 
  when properties are accessed through the public API. Put another way, the stored 
  value methods allow you bypass the logic in the public accessor methods, whereas 
  the basic key value coding methods execute that logic.</p>
  <p>The stored value methods are especially useful in cases where property values 
  are interdependent. For example, suppose you need to update a total whenever an 
  object's <b>bonus</b> property is set:</p>
  <pre>
  <blockquote>
   void setBonus(double newBonus) {
       willChange();
       _total += (newBonus   _bonus);
       _bonus = newBonus;
   } </blockquote>
  </pre>
  <p><br>
  <p>This total updating code should be activated when the object is updated with 
  values provided by a user (through the user interface), but not when the 
  <b>bonus</b> property is restored from the database. Since the Framework 
  restores the property using takeStoredValueForKey<b> </b>and since this 
  method accesses the <b>_bonus</b> instance variable in preference to 
  calling the public accessor, the unnecessary (and possibly harmful) 
  recomputation of <b>_total </b>is avoided. If the object actually wants
  to intervene when a property is set from the database, it has two options:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Implement <b>_setBonus.</b> 
  <li>Replace the Framework's default stored value search order with the 
  same search order used by the basic methods by overriding the static 
  method shouldUseStoredAccessors to return false. 
  </ul>
  <p><br>
  <h2>Type Checking and Type Conversion</h2>
  <p>The default implementations of the key value coding methods accept any 
  object as a value, and do no type checking or type conversion among object 
  classes. It's possible, for example, to pass a String to takeValueForKey 
  as the value for a property the receiver expects to be an NSDate. The 
  sender of a key value coding message is thus responsible for ensuring 
  that a value is of the proper class, typically by using the 
  validateValueForKey method to coerce it to the proper type. The interface 
  layer's EODisplayGroup uses this on all values received from interface 
  user objects, for example, as well as relying on number and date formatters 
  to interpret string values typed by the user. </p>
  <p>The key value coding methods handle one special case with regard to value 
  types. For enterprise objects that access numeric values as scalar types, 
  these methods automatically convert between the scalar types and Number 
  objects. For example, suppose the enterprise object defines these accessor
  methods:</p>
  <pre>
  <blockquote>
  public void setSalary(int salary)
  public int salary()</blockquote>
  </pre>
  <p><br>
  <p>For the <b>setSalary</b> method, <b>takeValueForKey</b> converts the 
  object value it receives as the argument for the &quot;salary&quot; key 
  to an <b>int</b> and passes it as <em>salary</em> to <b>setSalary</b>. 
  Similarly, valueForKey converts the return value of the <b>salary</b> 
  method to a Number and returns that.</p>
  <p>The default implementations of the key value coding methods support 
  the scalar types <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>, and <code>double
  </code>. Object values are converted to these types with the standard 
  messages <b>intValue</b>, <b>floatValue</b>, and so on. Note that the 
  key value coding methods don't check that an object value actually responds
  to these messages; this can result in a run time error if the object doesn't 
  respond to the appropriate message.</p>
  <p>One type of conversion these methods can't perform is that from null to 
  a scalar value. Scalar values define no equivalent of a database system's 
  NULL value, so these must be handled by the object itself. Upon encountering 
  null while setting a scalar value, <b>takeValueForKey</b> invokes 
  unableToSetNullForKey, which by default simply throws an exception. Enterprise 
  object classes that use scalar values which may be NULL in the database should 
  override this method to substitute the appropriate scalar value for null, 
  reinvoking <b>takeValueForKey</b> to set the substitute value.</p>
  The remaining methods, handleQueryWithUnboundKey,
  handleTakeValueForUnboundKey, and unableToSetNullForKey, are provided to
  handle error conditions. The default versions of handleQueryWithUnboundKey
  and handleTakeValueForUnboundKey throw an exception.<P>
