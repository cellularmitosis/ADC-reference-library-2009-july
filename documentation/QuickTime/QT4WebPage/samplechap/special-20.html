But there are some things to watch out for. Let's go over the different addressing modes and any QuickTime-related gotchas.</P><DIV><H3 CLASS="FM3Head"><A NAME="pgfId-17588"></A>Absolutely</H3><P CLASS="First-body"><A NAME="pgfId-17439"></A>An absolute address is any URL that begins with a protocol identifier--<TT CLASS="cv">ftp://</TT>,<TT CLASS="cv"> http://</TT>, <TT CLASS="cv">file:///</TT>, <TT CLASS="cv">data:</TT>, and so on. The identifier is normally followed by the domain name, or the literal IP address, of a server for the file or stream. Some protocols, such as RTP and RTSP, can be used only with absolute addresses.</P><P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId-17442"></A>In general, absolute addressing works throughout QuickTime with no quirks. </P><P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId-17563"></A>Macintosh developers will find producing a cross-platform CD that uses absolute addressing with the File: protocol is extremely difficult, however. You just don't know if the CD is MyCD, or D: or E: or F:--Windows developers will already be familiar with this. One solution is to use root-relative addressing, which we'll look at next.</P></DIV><DIV><H3 CLASS="FM3Head"><A NAME="pgfId-17756"></A>Root Relativity</H3><P CLASS="First-body-below"><A NAME="pgfId-17757"></A>Root-relative addressing gives directions to a file from the root directory of the current server--or the current disk, for local files. The protocol is implied: whatever protocol was used to load the current document. Root-relative addresses all begin with a forward slash. For example:</P><P CLASS="Code"><A NAME="pgfId-17758"></A><TT CLASS="cv">&lt;EMBED SRC=&quot;/users/&#126;bob/movies/my.mov&quot;</TT></P><P CLASS="Body-above"><A NAME="pgfId-17759"></A>Depending on the Web server, the &quot;root&quot; directory may be the actual root directory of the disk, or the Web folder that holds all the website files, or even the top-level directory for your user area. </P><P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId-17760"></A>Root-relative addressing is great for CDs. You can link a movie to a particular file using root-relative addressing and use the same movie in any directory. The cross-platform problems of absolute addressing on local disks go away.</P><P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId-17761"></A>QuickTime supports root-relative addressing in any URL.</P></DIV><DIV><H3 CLASS="FM3Head"><A NAME="pgfId-17589"></A>Relatively Speaking</H3><P CLASS="First-body"><A NAME="pgfId-17447"></A>Relative addressing describes the path to a file, relative to another file--generally the file you loaded last. The protocol is implied: same as last time.</P><P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId-17448"></A>With the release of QuickTime 5, relative addressing should now work throughout QuickTime (earlier versions had limited support for relative URLs in QuickTime Player, with full support only in the plug-in).</P><P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId-17461"></A>Using relative addressing in QuickTime can be tricky, however. You specify a relative path in a <TT CLASS="cv">SRC</TT> parameter just as you would expect--relative to the current Web page. But it's the browser that gets the file, not QuickTime. </P><P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId-17655"></A>The browser passes the URL along to QuickTime, but that's the only URL QuickTime gets. The browser doesn't pass along the URL of the current Web page. For QuickTime, the <TT CLASS="cv">SRC</TT> movie is the current document.</P><P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId-17616"></A>Consequently--and I can't stress this enough--all subsequent URLs must be relative to the currently loaded movie<TT CLASS="Emphasis">.</TT> The <TT CLASS="cv">SRC</TT> movie gets downloaded, even if it's not displayed, so a relative URL in the <TT CLASS="cv">QTSRC</TT> parameter must be relative to the <TT CLASS="cv">SRC</TT> URL.</P><P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId-17621"></A>If you have relative addresses in the <TT CLASS="cv">SRC</TT>, <TT CLASS="cv">QTSRC</TT>, and <TT CLASS="cv">HREF</TT> parameters of your <TT CLASS="cv">&lt;EMBED&gt;</TT> tag, <TT CLASS="cv">SRC</TT> is relative to the Web page, <TT CLASS="cv">QTSRC</TT> is relative to <TT CLASS="cv">SRC</TT>, and <TT CLASS="cv">HREF</TT> is relative to <TT CLASS="cv">QTSRC</TT>. This can get very confusing, but there are simple steps you can take that will simplify things.</P><P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId-17624"></A>If you put your movies in the same folder as the Web pages that use the them, any relative path is the same from the Web page or the movie. No more complications. The relative path from Web page to movie is just a filename. If at all possible, organize your site this way.</P><P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId-17688"></A>If you must put your movies in a different directory from your HTML, at least put all the movies that link to each other in one folder. If all your linked movies are in the same folder, the relative path from movie to movie is always just the filename. Only the <TT CLASS="cv">SRC</TT> parameter contains the path from the HTML folder to the movie folder.</P><P CLASS="Body-below"><A NAME="pgfId-17469"></A>For example, if you write this:</P><P CLASS="Code"><A NAME="pgfId-20283"></A><TT CLASS="cv">&lt;EMBED SRC=&quot;../../MOVIES/a.mov&quot; HREF=&quot;b.mov&quot;</TT></P><P CLASS="First-body-above"><A NAME="pgfId-20284"></A>the browser uses the <TT CLASS="cv">SRC</TT> address to find <TT CLASS="cv">a.mov</TT>, then passes the movie's absolute address to QuickTime. If the viewer clicks the movie, QuickTime will look for <TT CLASS="cv">b.mov</TT> in the same folder as <TT CLASS="cv">a.mov</TT>.</P><P CLASS="Body-below"><A NAME="pgfId-17482"></A>Here's the commonest type of mistake:</P><P CLASS="Code"><A NAME="pgfId-20291"></A><TT CLASS="cv">&lt;EMBED SRC=&quot;../../MOVIES/a.mov&quot; HREF=&quot;../../MOVIES/b.mov&quot;</TT></P><P CLASS="First-body-above"><A NAME="pgfId-20292"></A>QuickTime treats the second URL as being relative to the first. This will make QuickTime look for <TT CLASS="cv">b.mov</TT> in <TT CLASS="cv">../../MOVIES</TT>, starting from <TT CLASS="cv">../../MOVIES/</TT>. Can you say, &quot;file not found&quot;?</P><P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId-17590"></A>Similarly, for relative addressing in a series of <TT CLASS="cv">QTNEXT</TT> parameters, each URL is relative to the one before. That's no big deal if the movies are all in the same folder. If they're not, just remember to go slow and check your path to make sure each link goes from the current movie to the new movie.</P><P CLASS="Body"><A NAME="pgfId-17727"></A>Oh, in case you're wondering, if a movie is loaded in-line using the Data protocol, it doesn't have a URL--it's inside one. You can't use relative URLs if the current movie was stuffed inside a URL itself.</P></DIV></td> </tr> </table><hr>| <a href=special-21.html>Next</a> | <a href=special-19.html>Prev</a> | <a href=special.html>Top</a> |<hr>Copyright 2002 by Academic Press<hr><BR><BR> <font size=+1>				<A HREF="../QT4WebBook.htm">Home</A> | <A HREF="../updates.htm">Updates</A> | <A HREF="../corrections.htm">Corrections</A> | <A HREF="../faq.htm">FAQ</A> | <A HREF="../toc.htm">Table of Contents</A> | <A HREF="special.html">Sample Chapter</a>				</font></BODY></HTML>
