       See the <b>options</b> manual entry for details on the standard options.

<b>WIDGET-SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       Command-Line Name:<b>-autoseparators</b>
       Database Name:  <b>autoSeparators</b>
       Database Class: <b>AutoSeparators</b>

              Specifies a boolean that says whether separators are automatically inserted in the undo stack. |
              Only meaningful when the <b>-undo</b> option is true.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-height</b>
       Database Name:  <b>height</b>
       Database Class: <b>Height</b>

              Specifies the desired height for the window, in units of characters in the font given  by  the
              <b>-font</b> option.  Must be at least one.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-maxundo</b>
       Database Name:  <b>maxUndo</b>
       Database Class: <b>MaxUndo</b>

              Specifies  the maximum number of compound undo actions on the undo stack. A zero or a negative |
              value imply an unlimited undo stack.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-spacing1</b>
       Database Name:  <b>spacing1</b>
       Database Class: <b>Spacing1</b>

              Requests additional space above each text line in the widget, using any of the standard  forms
              for screen distances.  If a line wraps, this option only applies to the first line on the dis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">play.&nbsp;display.</font>
              play.  This option may be overriden with <b>-spacing1</b> options in tags.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-spacing2</b>
       Database Name:  <b>spacing2</b>
       Database Class: <b>Spacing2</b>

              For lines that wrap (so that they cover more than one line on the display) this option  speci-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fies&nbsp;specifies</font>
              fies  additional  space  to  provide between the display lines that represent a single line of
              text.  The value may have any of the standard forms for screen distances.  This option may  be
              overriden with <b>-spacing2</b> options in tags.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-spacing3</b>
       Database Name:  <b>spacing3</b>
       Database Class: <b>Spacing3</b>

              Requests  additional space below each text line in the widget, using any of the standard forms
              for screen distances.  If a line wraps, this option only applies to the last line on the  dis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">play.&nbsp;display.</font>
              play.  This option may be overriden with <b>-spacing3</b> options in tags.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-state</b>
       Database Name:  <b>state</b>
       Database Class: <b>State</b>

              Specifies  one  of two states for the text:  <b>normal</b> or <b>disabled</b>.  If the text is disabled then
              characters may not be inserted or deleted and no insertion cursor will be displayed,  even  if
              the input focus is in the widget.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-tabs</b>
       Database Name:  <b>tabs</b>
       Database Class: <b>Tabs</b>

              Specifies  a set of tab stops for the window.  The option's value consists of a list of screen
              distances giving the positions of the tab stops.  Each position may optionally be followed  in
              the  next list element by one of the keywords <b>left</b>, <b>right</b>, <b>center</b>, or <b>numeric</b>, which specifies
              how to justify text relative to the tab stop.  <b>Left</b> is the default; it causes the text follow-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;following</font>
              ing  the  tab  character to be positioned with its left edge at the tab position.  <b>Right</b> means
              that the right edge of the text following the tab character is positioned at the tab position,
              and  <b>center</b> means that the text is centered at the tab position.  <b>Numeric</b> means that the deci-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mal&nbsp;decimal</font>
              mal point in the text is positioned at the tab position;  if there is no  decimal  point  then
              the  least significant digit of the number is positioned just to the left of the tab position;
              if there is no number in the text then the text is right-justified at the tab  position.   For
              example,  <b>-tabs</b>  <b>{2c</b>  <b>left</b>  <b>4c</b> <b>6c</b> <b>center}</b> creates three tab stops at two-centimeter intervals;
              the first two use left justification and the third uses center justification.  If the list  of
              tab  stops  does  not  have  enough  elements to cover all of the tabs in a text line, then Tk
              extrapolates new tab stops using the spacing and alignment from the last tab stop in the list.
              The  value  of the <b>tabs</b> option may be overridden by <b>-tabs</b> options in tags.  If no <b>-tabs</b> option
              is specified, or if it is specified as an empty list, then Tk uses default tabs  spaced  every
              eight (average size) characters.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-undo</b>
       Database Name:  <b>undo</b>
       Database Class: <b>Undo</b>

              Specifies a boolean that says whether the undo mechanism is active or not.                     |

       Command-Line Name:<b>-width</b>
       Database Name:  <b>width</b>
       Database Class: <b>Width</b>

              Specifies  the  desired  width  for the window in units of characters in the font given by the
              <b>-font</b> option.  If the font doesn't have a uniform width then the width of the character  ``0''
              is used in translating from character units to screen units.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-wrap</b>
       Database Name:  <b>wrap</b>
       Database Class: <b>Wrap</b>

              Specifies  how  to handle lines in the text that are too long to be displayed in a single line
              of the text's window.  The value must be <b>none</b> or <b>char</b> or <b>word</b>.  A wrap mode of <b>none</b> means that
              each  line of text appears as exactly one line on the screen;  extra characters that don't fit
              on the screen are not displayed.  In the other modes each line of text will be broken up  into
              several  screen  lines if necessary to keep all the characters visible.  In <b>char</b> mode a screen
              line break may occur after any character; in <b>word</b> mode a line break will only be made at  word
              boundaries.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  <b>text</b> command creates a new window (given by the <u>pathName</u> argument) and makes it into a text wid-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">get.&nbsp;widget.</font>
       get.  Additional options, described above, may be specified on the command  line  or  in  the  option
       database  to configure aspects of the text such as its default background color and relief.  The <b>text</b>
       command returns the path name of the new window.

       A text widget displays one or more lines of text and allows that text to  be  edited.   Text  widgets
       support  four  different  kinds  of  annotations on the text, called tags, marks, embedded windows or
       embedded images.  Tags allow different portions of the text to be displayed with different fonts  and
       colors.   In addition, Tcl commands can be associated with tags so that scripts are invoked when par-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ticular&nbsp;particular</font>
       ticular actions such as keystrokes and mouse button presses occur in particular ranges of  the  text.
       See TAGS below for more details.

       The  second  form of annotation consists of marks, which are floating markers in the text.  Marks are
       used to keep track of various interesting positions in the text as it is edited.  See MARKS below for
       more details.

       The  third form of annotation allows arbitrary windows to be embedded in a text widget.  See EMBEDDED
       WINDOWS below for more details.

       The fourth form of annotation allows Tk images to be embedded in a text widget.  See EMBEDDED  IMAGES
       below for more details.

       The  text widget also has a built-in undo/redo mechanism.  See UNDO MECHANISM below for more details. |


<b>INDICES</b>
       Many of the widget commands for texts take one or more indices as arguments.  An index  is  a  string
       used  to  indicate a particular place within a text, such as a place to insert characters or one end-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">point&nbsp;endpoint</font>
       point of a range of characters to delete.  Indices have the syntax
              <u>base</u> <u>modifier</u> <u>modifier</u> <u>modifier</u> <u>...</u>
       Where <u>base</u> gives a starting point and the <u>modifier</u>s adjust the index from the  starting  point  (e.g.
       move  forward  or  backward  one  character).  Every index must contain a <u>base</u>, but the <u>modifier</u>s are
       optional.

       The <u>base</u> for an index must have one of the following forms:

       <u>line</u><b>.</b><u>char</u>   Indicates <u>char</u>'th character on line <u>line</u>.  Lines are numbered from 1 for consistency with
                   other  UNIX  programs that use this numbering scheme.  Within a line, characters are num-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">bered&nbsp;numbered</font>
                   bered from 0.  If <u>char</u> is <b>end</b> then it refers to the newline character that ends the line.

       <b>@</b><u>x</u><b>,</b><u>y</u>        Indicates the character that covers the pixel whose x and y coordinates within the text's
                   window are <u>x</u> and <u>y</u>.

       <b>end</b>         Indicates the end of the text (the character just after the last newline).

       <u>mark</u>        Indicates the character just after the mark whose name is <u>mark</u>.

       <u>tag</u><b>.first</b>   Indicates the first character in the text that has been tagged with <u>tag</u>.  This form  gen-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">erates&nbsp;generates</font>
                   erates an error if no characters are currently tagged with <u>tag</u>.

       <u>tag</u><b>.last</b>    Indicates  the  character  just  after the last one in the text that has been tagged with
                   <u>tag</u>.  This form generates an error if no characters are currently tagged with <u>tag</u>.

       <u>pathName</u>    Indicates the position of the embedded window whose name is <u>pathName</u>.  This  form  gener-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ates&nbsp;generates</font>
                   ates an error if there is no embedded window by the given name.

       <u>imageName</u>   Indicates  the  position of the embedded image whose name is <u>imageName</u>.  This form gener-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ates&nbsp;generates</font>
                   ates an error if there is no embedded image by the given name.

       If the <u>base</u> could match more than one of the above forms, such as a <u>mark</u> and  <u>imageName</u>  both  having
       the  same  value,  then the form earlier in the above list takes precedence.  If modifiers follow the
       base index, each one of them must have one of the forms listed below.  Keywords  such  as  <b>chars</b>  and
       <b>wordend</b> may be abbreviated as long as the abbreviation is unambiguous.

       <b>+</b> <u>count</u> <b>chars</b>
              Adjust  the index forward by <u>count</u> characters, moving to later lines in the text if necessary.
              If there are fewer than <u>count</u> characters in the text after the current  index,  then  set  the
              index to the last character in the text.  Spaces on either side of <u>count</u> are optional.

       <b>-</b> <u>count</u> <b>chars</b>
              Adjust  the  index backward by <u>count</u> characters, moving to earlier lines in the text if neces-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sary.&nbsp;necessary.</font>
              sary.  If there are fewer than <u>count</u> characters in the text before the current index, then set
              the index to the first character in the text.  Spaces on either side of <u>count</u> are optional.

       <b>+</b> <u>count</u> <b>lines</b>
              Adjust  the  index  forward  by  <u>count</u> lines, retaining the same character position within the
              line.  If there are fewer than <u>count</u> lines after the line containing the current  index,  then
              set  the index to refer to the same character position on the last line of the text.  Then, if
              the line is not long enough to contain a character at the indicated character position, adjust
              the  character  position  to refer to the last character of the line (the newline).  Spaces on
              either side of <u>count</u> are optional.

       <b>-</b> <u>count</u> <b>lines</b>
              Adjust the index backward by <u>count</u> lines, retaining the same  character  position  within  the
              line.   If there are fewer than <u>count</u> lines before the line containing the current index, then
              set the index to refer to the same character position on the first line of the text.  Then, if
              the line is not long enough to contain a character at the indicated character position, adjust
              the character position to refer to the last character of the line (the  newline).   Spaces  on
              either side of <u>count</u> are optional.

       <b>linestart</b>
              Adjust the index to refer to the first character on the line.

       <b>lineend</b>
              Adjust the index to refer to the last character on the line (the newline).

       <b>wordstart</b>
              Adjust  the index to refer to the first character of the word containing the current index.  A
              word consists of any number of adjacent characters that are letters, digits,  or  underscores,
              or a single character that is not one of these.

       <b>wordend</b>
              Adjust  the index to refer to the character just after the last one of the word containing the
              current index.  If the current index refers to the last character of the text then it  is  not
              modified.

       If  more than one modifier is present then they are applied in left-to-right order.  For example, the
       index ``<b>end</b> <b>-</b> <b>1</b> <b>chars</b>'' refers to the next-to-last character in the text and ``<b>insert</b> <b>wordstart</b>  <b>-</b>  <b>1</b>
       <b>c</b>'' refers to the character just before the first one in the word containing the insertion cursor.


<b>TAGS</b>
       The  first form of annotation in text widgets is a tag.  A tag is a textual string that is associated
       with some of the characters in a text.  Tags may contain arbitrary characters,  but  it  is  probably
       best  to avoid using the the characters `` '' (space), <b>+</b>, or <b>-</b>: these characters have special meaning
       in indices, so tags containing them can't be used as indices.  There may be any number of tags  asso-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ciated&nbsp;associated</font>
       ciated  with  characters in a text.  Each tag may refer to a single character, a range of characters,
       or several ranges of characters.  An individual character may have any number of tags associated with
       it.

       A  priority  order  is  defined  among  tags, and this order is used in implementing some of the tag-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">related&nbsp;tagrelated</font>
       related functions described below.  When a tag is defined (by associating it with characters or  set-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ting&nbsp;setting</font>
       ting  its display options or binding commands to it), it is given a priority higher than any existing
       tag.  The priority order of tags may be redefined using the ``<u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b> <b>raise</b>'' and ``<u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b>
       <b>lower</b>'' widget commands.

       Tags  serve  three purposes in text widgets.  First, they control the way information is displayed on
       the screen.  By default, characters are displayed as determined by the <b>background</b>,  <b>font</b>,  and  <b>fore</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ground&nbsp;foreground</font>
       <b>ground</b>  options for the text widget.  However, display options may be associated with individual tags
       using the ``<u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b> <b>configure</b>'' widget command.  If a character has been tagged, then  the  dis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">play&nbsp;display</font>
       play  options  associated with the tag override the default display style.  The following options are
       currently supported for tags:

       <b>-background</b> <u>color</u>
              <u>Color</u> specifies the background color to use for characters associated with the  tag.   It  may
              have any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetColor</b>.

       <b>-bgstipple</b> <u>bitmap</u>
              <u>Bitmap</u>  specifies  a bitmap that is used as a stipple pattern for the background.  It may have
              any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetBitmap</b>.  If <u>bitmap</u> hasn't been specified, or if it is spec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ified&nbsp;specified</font>
              ified as an empty string, then a solid fill will be used for the background.

       <b>-borderwidth</b> <u>pixels</u>
              <u>Pixels</u>  specifies the width of a 3-D border to draw around the background.  It may have any of
              the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.  This option is  used  in  conjunction  with  the  <b>-relief</b>
              option  to  give  a  3-D appearance to the background for characters; it is ignored unless the
              <b>-background</b> option has been set for the tag.

       <b>-elide</b> <u>boolean</u>
              <u>Elide</u> specifies whether the data should be elided.  Elided data is not displayed and takes  no
              space on screen, but further on behaves just as normal data.

       <b>-fgstipple</b> <u>bitmap</u>
              <u>Bitmap</u>  specifies a bitmap that is used as a stipple pattern when drawing text and other fore-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ground&nbsp;foreground</font>
              ground information such as underlines.  It may have any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetBitmap</b>.
              If  <u>bitmap</u>  hasn't been specified, or if it is specified as an empty string, then a solid fill
              will be used.

       <b>-font</b> <u>fontName</u>
              <u>FontName</u> is the name of a font to use for drawing characters.  It may have any  of  the  forms
              accepted by <b>Tk_GetFont</b>.

       <b>-foreground</b> <u>color</u>
              <u>Color</u>  specifies  the  color to use when drawing text and other foreground information such as
              underlines.  It may have any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetColor</b>.

       <b>-justify</b> <u>justify</u>
              If the first character of a display line has a tag for which this option has  been  specified,
              then  <u>justify</u>  determines  how to justify the line.  It must be one of <b>left</b>, <b>right</b>, or <b>center</b>.
              If a line wraps, then the justification for each line on the  display  is  determined  by  the
              first character of that display line.

       <b>-lmargin1</b> <u>pixels</u>
              If the first character of a text line has a tag for which this option has been specified, then
              <u>pixels</u> specifies how much the line should be indented from the left edge of the window.   <u>Pix</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">els&nbsp;Pixels</font>
              <u>els</u>  may  have  any of the standard forms for screen distances.  If a line of text wraps, this
              option only applies to the first line on the  display;   the  <b>-lmargin2</b>  option  controls  the
              indentation for subsequent lines.

       <b>-lmargin2</b> <u>pixels</u>
              If  the  first character of a display line has a tag for which this option has been specified,
              and if the display line is not the first for its text line (i.e., the text line has  wrapped),
              then  <u>pixels</u>  specifies how much the line should be indented from the left edge of the window.
              <u>Pixels</u> may have any of the standard forms for screen distances.  This option is only used when
              wrapping  is  enabled,  and  it  only applies to the second and later display lines for a text
              line.

       <b>-offset</b> <u>pixels</u>
              <u>Pixels</u> specifies an amount by which the text's baseline should be offset vertically  from  the
              baseline  of  the  overall  line,  in  pixels.  For example, a positive offset can be used for
              superscripts and a negative offset can be used for subscripts.  <u>Pixels</u> may  have  any  of  the
              standard forms for screen distances.

       <b>-overstrike</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Specifies  whether or not to draw a horizontal rule through the middle of characters.  <u>Boolean</u>
              may have any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetBoolean</b>.

       <b>-relief</b> <u>relief</u>
              <u>Relief</u> specifies the 3-D relief to use for drawing backgrounds, in any of the  forms  accepted
              by  <b>Tk_GetRelief</b>.   This  option is used in conjunction with the <b>-borderwidth</b> option to give a
              3-D appearance to the background for characters; it is ignored unless the  <b>-background</b>  option
              has been set for the tag.

       <b>-rmargin</b> <u>pixels</u>
              If  the  first character of a display line has a tag for which this option has been specified,
              then <u>pixels</u> specifies how wide a margin to leave between the end of the  line  and  the  right
              edge  of  the  window.   <u>Pixels</u> may have any of the standard forms for screen distances.  This
              option is only used when wrapping is enabled.  If a text line wraps, the right margin for each
              line on the display is determined by the first character of that display line.

       <b>-spacing1</b> <u>pixels</u>
              <u>Pixels</u>  specifies  how much additional space should be left above each text line, using any of
              the standard forms for screen distances.  If a line wraps, this option  only  applies  to  the
              first line on the display.

       <b>-spacing2</b> <u>pixels</u>
              For lines that wrap, this option specifies how much additional space to leave between the dis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">play&nbsp;display</font>
              play lines for a single text line.  <u>Pixels</u> may have any of the standard forms for screen  dis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tances.&nbsp;distances.</font>
              tances.

       <b>-spacing3</b> <u>pixels</u>
              <u>Pixels</u>  specifies  how much additional space should be left below each text line, using any of
              the standard forms for screen distances.  If a line wraps, this option  only  applies  to  the
              last line on the display.

       <b>-tabs</b> <u>tabList</u>
              <u>TabList</u>  specifies  a  set  of tab stops in the same form as for the <b>-tabs</b> option for the text
              widget.  This option only applies to a display line if it applies to the  first  character  on
              that  display  line.   If  this option is specified as an empty string, it cancels the option,
              leaving it unspecified for the tag (the default).  If the option is specified as  a  non-empty
              string  that is an empty list, such as <b>-tags</b> <b>{</b> <b>}</b>, then it requests default 8-character tabs as
              described for the <b>tags</b> widget option.

       <b>-underline</b> <u>boolean</u>
              <u>Boolean</u> specifies whether or not to draw an underline underneath characters.  It may have  any
              of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetBoolean</b>.

       <b>-wrap</b> <u>mode</u>
              <u>Mode</u>  specifies  how  to  handle lines that are wider than the text's window.  It has the same
              legal values as the <b>-wrap</b> option for the text widget:  <b>none</b>,  <b>char</b>,  or  <b>word</b>.   If  this  tag
              option is specified, it overrides the <b>-wrap</b> option for the text widget.

       If  a  character has several tags associated with it, and if their display options conflict, then the
       options of the highest priority tag are used.  If a particular display option hasn't  been  specified
       for  a particular tag, or if it is specified as an empty string, then that option will never be used;
       the next-highest-priority tag's option will used instead.  If no tag specifies a  particular  display
       option, then the default style for the widget will be used.

       The  second  purpose  for  tags is event bindings.  You can associate bindings with a tag in much the
       same way you can associate bindings with a widget class:  whenever particular X events occur on char-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">acters&nbsp;characters</font>
       acters  with  the  given tag, a given Tcl command will be executed.  Tag bindings can be used to give
       behaviors to ranges of characters; among other things, this  allows  hypertext-like  features  to  be
       implemented.  For details, see the description of the <b>tag</b> <b>bind</b> widget command below.

       The third use for tags is in managing the selection.  See THE SELECTION below.


<b>MARKS</b>
       The  second  form of annotation in text widgets is a mark.  Marks are used for remembering particular
       places in a text.  They are something like tags, in that they have names and they refer to places  in
       the file, but a mark isn't associated with particular characters.  Instead, a mark is associated with
       the gap between two characters.  Only a single position may be associated with a mark  at  any  given
       time.  If the characters around a mark are deleted the mark will still remain;  it will just have new
       neighbor characters.  In contrast, if the characters containing a tag are deleted then the  tag  will
       no longer have an association with characters in the file.  Marks may be manipulated with the ``<u>path</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">Name&nbsp;``pathName</font>
       <u>Name</u> <b>mark</b>'' widget command, and their current locations may be determined by using the mark  name  as
       an index in widget commands.

       Each  mark  also has a <u>gravity</u>, which is either <b>left</b> or <b>right</b>.  The gravity for a mark specifies what
       happens to the mark when text is inserted at the point of the mark.  If a mark has left gravity, then
       the  mark  is treated as if it were attached to the character on its left, so the mark will remain to
       the left of any text inserted at the mark position.  If the mark has right gravity, new text inserted
       at  the  mark position will appear to the left of the mark (so that the mark remains rightmost).  The
       gravity for a mark defaults to <b>right</b>.

       The name space for marks is different from that for tags:  the same name may be used for both a  mark
       and a tag, but they will refer to different things.

       Two marks have special significance.  First, the mark <b>insert</b> is associated with the insertion cursor,
       as described under THE INSERTION CURSOR below.  Second, the mark <b>current</b> is associated with the char-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">acter&nbsp;character</font>
       acter  closest to the mouse and is adjusted automatically to track the mouse position and any changes
       to the text in the widget (one exception:  <b>current</b> is not updated in response to mouse motions  if  a
       mouse button is down;  the update will be deferred until all mouse buttons have been released).  Nei-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ther&nbsp;Neither</font>
       ther of these special marks may be deleted.


<b>EMBEDDED</b> <b>WINDOWS</b>
       The third form of annotation in text widgets is an embedded window.  Each embedded window  annotation
       causes  a  window  to  be  displayed  at a particular point in  the text.  There may be any number of
       embedded windows in a text widget, and any widget may be used as an embedded window (subject  to  the
       usual  rules  for geometry management, which require the text window to be the parent of the embedded
       window or a descendant of its parent).  The embedded window's position on the screen will be  updated
       as  the  text is modified or scrolled, and it will be mapped and unmapped as it moves into and out of
       the visible area of the text widget.  Each embedded window occupies one character's  worth  of  index
       space  in  the text widget, and it may be referred to either by the name of its embedded window or by
       its position in the widget's index space.  If the range of text containing  the  embedded  window  is
       deleted then the window is destroyed.

       When an embedded window is added to a text widget with the <b>window</b> <b>create</b> widget command, several con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">figuration&nbsp;configuration</font>
       figuration options may be associated with it.  These options may be  modified later with  the  <b>window</b>
       <b>configure</b> widget command.  The following options are currently supported:

       <b>-align</b> <u>where</u>
              If  the  window  is  not  as tall as the line in which it is displayed, this option determines
              where the window is displayed in the line.  <u>Where</u> must have one of the values <b>top</b>  (align  the
              top of the window with the top of the line), <b>center</b> (center the window within the range of the
              line), <b>bottom</b> (align the bottom of the window with the bottom of the line's area), or <b>baseline</b>
              (align the bottom of the window with the baseline of the line).

       <b>-create</b> <u>script</u>
              Specifies  a  Tcl script that may be evaluated to create the window for the annotation.  If no
              <b>-window</b> option has been specified for the annotation this script will be  evaluated  when  the
              annotation  is about to be displayed on the screen.  <u>Script</u> must create a window for the anno-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tation&nbsp;annotation</font>
              tation and return the name of that window as its result.  If the  annotation's  window  should
              ever be deleted, <u>script</u> will be evaluated again the next time the annotation is displayed.

       <b>-padx</b> <u>pixels</u>
              <u>Pixels</u>  specifies  the amount of extra space to leave on each side of the embedded window.  It
              may have any of the usual forms defined for a screen distance.

       <b>-pady</b> <u>pixels</u>
              <u>Pixels</u> specifies the amount of extra space to leave on the top and on the bottom of the embed-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ded&nbsp;embedded</font>
              ded window.  It may have any of the usual forms defined for a screen distance.

       <b>-stretch</b> <u>boolean</u>
              If the requested height of the embedded window is less than the height of the line in which it
              is displayed, this option can be used to specify whether the window should be stretched verti-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cally&nbsp;vertically</font>
              cally  to  fill  its line.  If the <b>-pady</b> option has been specified as well, then the requested
              padding will be retained even if the window is stretched.

       <b>-window</b> <u>pathName</u>
              Specifies the name of a window to display in the annotation.


<b>EMBEDDED</b> <b>IMAGES</b>
       The final form of annotation in text widgets is an embedded image.  Each  embedded  image  annotation
       causes  an  image  to  be  displayed  at a particular point in  the text.  There may be any number of
       embedded images in a text widget, and a particular image may be embedded in multiple  places  in  the
       same  text  widget.  The embedded image's position on the screen will be updated as the text is modi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fied&nbsp;modified</font>
       fied or scrolled.  Each embedded image occupies one character's worth of index space in the text wid-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">get,&nbsp;widget,</font>
       get,  and it may be referred to either by its position in the widget's index space, or the name it is
       assigned when the image is inserted into the text widget widh <b>image</b> <b>create</b>.  If  the  range  of  text
       containing the embedded image is deleted then that copy of the image is removed from the screen.

       When  an embedded image is added to a text widget with the <b>image</b> <b>create</b> widget command, a name unique
       to this instance of the image is returned.  This name may  then  be  used  to  refer  to  this  image
       instance.   The  name  is  taken to be the value of the <b>-name</b> option (described below).  If the <b>-name</b>
       option is not provided, the <b>-image</b> name is used instead.  If the <u>imageName</u> is already in use  in  the
       text  widget,  then <b>#</b><u>nn</u> is added to the end of the <u>imageName</u>, where <u>nn</u> is an arbitrary integer.  This
       insures the <u>imageName</u> is unique.  Once this name is assigned to this instance of the image,  it  does
       not change, even though the <b>-image</b> or <b>-name</b> values can be changed with <b>image</b> <b>configure</b>.

       When  an  embedded image is added to a text widget with the <b>image</b> <b>create</b> widget command, several con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">figuration&nbsp;configuration</font>
       figuration options may be associated with it.  These options may be modified  later  with  the  <b>image</b>
       <b>configure</b> widget command.  The following options are currently supported:

       <b>-align</b> <u>where</u>
              If the image is not as tall as the line in which it is displayed, this option determines where
              the image is displayed in the line.  <u>Where</u> must have one of the values <b>top</b> (align the  top  of
              the  image  with the top of the line), <b>center</b> (center the image within the range of the line),
              <b>bottom</b> (align the bottom of the image with the bottom of the line's area), or <b>baseline</b>  (align
              the bottom of the image with the baseline of the line).

       <b>-image</b> <u>image</u>
              Specifies  the  name of the Tk image to display in the annotation.  If <u>image</u> is not a valid Tk
              image, then an error is returned.

       <b>-name</b> <u>ImageName</u>
              Specifies the name by which this image instance may be referenced in the text widget. If  <u>Ima</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">geName&nbsp;ImageName</font>
              <u>geName</u>  is  not  supplied, then the name of the Tk image is used instead.  If the <u>imageName</u> is
              already in use, <u>#nn</u> is appended to the end of the name as described above.

       <b>-padx</b> <u>pixels</u>
              <u>Pixels</u> specifies the amount of extra space to leave on each side of the  embedded  image.   It
              may have any of the usual forms defined for a screen distance.

       <b>-pady</b> <u>pixels</u>
              <u>Pixels</u> specifies the amount of extra space to leave on the top and on the bottom of the embed-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ded&nbsp;embedded</font>
              ded image.  It may have any of the usual forms defined for a screen distance.


<b>THE</b> <b>SELECTION</b>
       Selection support is implemented via tags.  If the <b>exportSelection</b> option for the text widget is true
       then the <b>sel</b> tag will be associated with the selection:

       [1]    Whenever characters are tagged with <b>sel</b> the text widget will claim ownership of the selection.

       [2]    Attempts to retrieve the selection will be serviced by the  text  widget,  returning  all  the
              characters with the <b>sel</b> tag.

       [3]    If  the  selection  is  claimed  away  by another application or by another window within this
              application, then the <b>sel</b> tag will be removed from all characters in the text.

       [4]    Whenever the <b>sel</b> tag range changes a virtual event <b>&lt;&lt;Selection&gt;&gt;</b> is generated.

       The <b>sel</b> tag is automatically defined when a text widget is created, and it may not  be  deleted  with
       the  ``<u>pathName</u>  <b>tag</b>  <b>delete</b>'' widget command.  Furthermore, the <b>selectBackground</b>, <b>selectBorderWidth</b>,
       and <b>selectForeground</b> options for the text widget are  tied  to  the  <b>-background</b>,  <b>-borderwidth</b>,  and
       <b>-foreground</b> options for the <b>sel</b> tag:  changes in either will automatically be reflected in the other.


<b>THE</b> <b>INSERTION</b> <b>CURSOR</b>
       The mark named <b>insert</b> has special significance in text widgets.  It is defined automatically  when  a
       text  widget is created and it may not be unset with the ``<u>pathName</u> <b>mark</b> <b>unset</b>'' widget command.  The
       <b>insert</b> mark represents the position of the insertion cursor, and the insertion cursor will  automati-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cally&nbsp;automatically</font>
       cally be drawn at this point whenever the text widget has the input focus.


<b>THE</b> <b>MODIFIED</b> <b>FLAG</b>
       The text widget can keep track of changes to the content of the widget by means of the modified flag.
       Inserting or deleting text will set this flag. The flag can be queried, set and  cleared  programati-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cally&nbsp;programatically</font>
       cally  as  well.  Whenever  the flag changes state a <b>&lt;&lt;Modified&gt;&gt;</b> virtual event is generated. See the
       <b>edit</b> <b>modified</b> widget command for more details.


<b>THE</b> <b>UNDO</b> <b>MECHANISM</b>
       The text widget has an unlimited undo and redo mechanism (when the <b>-undo</b> widget option is true) which |
       records every insert and delete action on a stack.                                                    |

       Boundaries  (called "separators") are inserted between edit actions.  The purpose of these separators |
       is to group inserts and deletes into one compound edit action.   When  undoing  a  change  everything |
       between  two separators will be undone.  The undone changes are then moved to the redo stack, so that |
       an undone edit can be redone again.  The redo stack is cleared whenever new edit actions are recorded |
       on the undo stack.  The undo and redo stacks can be cleared to keep their depth under control.        |

       Separators are inserted automatically when the <b>-autoseparators</b> widget option is true.  You can insert |
       separators programatically as well.  If a separator is already present at the top of the  undo  stack |
       no  other will be inserted.  That means that two separators on the undo stack are always separated by |
       at least one insert or delete action.                                                                 |

       The undo mechanism is also linked to the modified flag.  This means that undoing or  redoing  changes |
       can  take  a modified text widget back to the unmodified state or vice versa.  The modified flag will |
       be set automatically to the appropriate state.  This automatic coupling does not work when the  modi- |
       fied flag has been set by the user, until the flag has been reset again.                              |

       See below for the <b>edit</b> widget command that controls the undo mechanism.


<b>WIDGET</b> <b>COMMAND</b>
       The <b>text</b> command creates a new Tcl command whose name is the same as the path name of the text's win-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dow.&nbsp;window.</font>
       dow.  This command may be used to invoke various operations on the widget.  It has the following gen-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">eral&nbsp;general</font>
       eral form:
              <u>pathName</u> <u>option</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
       <u>PathName</u>  is  the  name of the command, which is the same as the text widget's path name.  <u>Option</u> and
       the <u>arg</u>s determine the exact behavior of the command.  The following commands are possible  for  text
       widgets:

       <u>pathName</u> <b>bbox</b> <u>index</u>
              Returns  a  list  of four elements describing the screen area of the character given by <u>index</u>.
              The first two elements of the list give the x and y coordinates of the  upper-left  corner  of
              the area occupied by the character, and the last two elements give the width and height of the
              area.  If the character is only partially  visible  on  the  screen,  then  the  return  value
              reflects just the visible part.  If the character is not visible on the screen then the return
              value is an empty list.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>cget</b> <u>option</u>
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <u>option</u>.  <u>Option</u> may have any of
              the values accepted by the <b>text</b> command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>compare</b> <u>index1</u> <u>op</u> <u>index2</u>
              Compares  the indices given by <u>index1</u> and <u>index2</u> according to the relational operator given by
              <u>op</u>, and returns 1 if the relationship is satisfied and 0 if it isn't.  <u>Op</u> must be one  of  the
              operators &lt;, &lt;=, ==, &gt;=, &gt;, or !=.  If <u>op</u> is == then 1 is returned if the two indices refer to
              the same character, if <u>op</u> is &lt; then 1 is returned if <u>index1</u> refers to an earlier character  in
              the text than <u>index2</u>, and so on.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>configure</b> ?<u>option</u>? <u>?value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no <u>option</u> is specified, returns a
              list describing all of the available options for <u>pathName</u> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b>  for  informa-
              tion  on  the  format  of  this list).  If <u>option</u> is specified with no <u>value</u>, then the command
              returns a list describing the one named option (this list will be identical to the correspond-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;corresponding</font>
              ing  sublist  of  the  value returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).  If one or more <u>option-value</u>
              pairs are specified, then the command modifies the given widget <!-- a -->option(s)<!-- /a --> to  have  the  given
              <!-- a -->value(s)<!-- /a -->;   in this case the command returns an empty string.  <u>Option</u> may have any of the val-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ues&nbsp;values</font>
              ues accepted by the <b>text</b> command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>debug</b> ?<u>boolean</u>?
              If <u>boolean</u> is specified, then it must have one  of  the  true  or  false  values  accepted  by
              Tcl_GetBoolean.  If the value is a true one then internal consistency checks will be turned on
              in the B-tree code associated with text widgets.  If <u>boolean</u> has a false value then the debug-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ging&nbsp;debugging</font>
              ging  checks  will  be  turned  off.   In either case the command returns an empty string.  If
              <u>boolean</u> is not specified then the command returns <b>on</b> or <b>off</b> to indicate whether or not  debug-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ging&nbsp;debugging</font>
              ging  is  turned  on.  There is a single debugging switch shared by all text widgets:  turning
              debugging on or off in any widget turns it on or off for all widgets.  For widgets with  large
              amounts of text, the consistency checks may cause a noticeable slow-down.

       When debugging is turned on, the drawing routines of the text widget set the global variables <b>tk_tex-</b> |
       <b>tRedraw</b> and <b>tk_textRelayout</b> to the lists of indices that are redrawn.  The values of these  variables |
       are tested by Tk's test suite.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>delete</b> <u>index1</u> ?<u>index2</u> <u>...</u>?
              Delete  a  range  of  characters from the text.  If both <u>index1</u> and <u>index2</u> are specified, then
              delete all the characters starting with the one given  by  <u>index1</u>  and  stopping  just  before
              <u>index2</u>  (i.e.  the  character at <u>index2</u> is not deleted).  If <u>index2</u> doesn't specify a position
              later in the text than <u>index1</u> then no characters are deleted.  If <u>index2</u> isn't specified  then
              the  single character at <u>index1</u> is deleted.  It is not allowable to delete characters in a way
              that would leave the text without a newline as the last character.   The  command  returns  an
              empty  string.   If  more  indices  are  given,  multiple ranges of text will be deleted.  All |
              indices are first checked for validity before any deletions are made.  They are sorted and the |
              text  is removed from the last range to the first range to deleted text does not cause a unde- |
              sired index shifting side-effects.  If multiple ranges with the same start  index  are  given, |
              then  the  longest  range  is used.  If overlapping ranges are given, then they will be merged |
              into spans that do not cause deletion of text outside the given ranges  due  to  text  shifted |
              during deletion.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>dlineinfo</b> <u>index</u>
              Returns  a list with five elements describing the area occupied by the display line containing
              <u>index</u>.  The first two elements of the list give the x and y coordinates of the upper-left cor-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ner&nbsp;corner</font>
              ner  of the area occupied by the line, the third and fourth elements give the width and height
              of the area, and the fifth element gives the position of the baseline for the  line,  measured
              down from the top of the area.  All of this information is measured in pixels.  If the current
              wrap mode is <b>none</b> and the line extends beyond the boundaries of the window, the area  returned
              reflects  the  entire area of the line, including the portions that are out of the window.  If
              the line is shorter than the full width of the window then the area returned reflects just the
              portion  of the line that is occupied by characters and embedded windows.  If the display line
              containing <u>index</u> is not visible on the screen then the return value is an empty list.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>dump</b> ?<u>switches</u>? <u>index1</u> ?<u>index2</u>?
              Return the contents of the text widget from <u>index1</u> up to, but not including <u>index2</u>,  including
              the text and information about marks, tags, and embedded windows.  If <u>index2</u> is not specified,
              then it defaults to one character past <u>index1</u>.  The information is returned in  the  following
              format:

              <u>key1</u> <u>value1</u> <u>index1</u> <u>key2</u> <u>value2</u> <u>index2</u> ...

              The possible <u>key</u> values are <b>text</b>, <b>mark</b>, <b>tagon</b>, <b>tagoff</b>, and <b>window</b>.  The corresponding <u>value</u> is
              the text, mark name, tag name, or window name.  The <u>index</u> information  is  the  index  of  the
              start  of the text, the mark, the tag transition, or the window.  One or more of the following
              switches (or abbreviations thereof) may be specified to control the dump:

              <b>-all</b>   Return information about all elements: text, marks, tags, images and windows.  This  is
                     the default.

              <b>-command</b> <u>command</u>
                     Instead  of  returning  the information as the result of the dump operation, invoke the
                     <u>command</u> on each element of the text widget within the range.   The  command  has  three
                     arguments appended to it before it is evaluated: the <u>key</u>, <u>value</u>, and <u>index</u>.

              <b>-image</b> Include information about images in the dump results.

              <b>-mark</b>  Include information about marks in the dump results.

              <b>-tag</b>   Include  information  about  tag  transitions  in  the dump results. Tag information is
                     returned as <b>tagon</b> and <b>tagoff</b> elements that indicate the begin and end of each range  of
                     each tag, respectively.

              <b>-text</b>  Include  information  about  text in the dump results.  The value is the text up to the
                     next element or the end of range indicated by <u>index2</u>.  A text  element  does  not  span
                     newlines.   A  multi-line  block of text that contains no marks or tag transitions will
                     still be dumped as a set of text seqments that each end with a newline.  The newline is
                     part of the value.

              <b>-window</b>
                     Include  information about embedded windows in the dump results.  The value of a window
                     is its Tk pathname, unless the window has not been created yet.  (It must have a create
                     script.)   In  this  case an empty string is returned, and you must query the window by
                     its index position to get more information.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>edit</b> <u>option</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
              This command controls the undo mechanism and the modified flag.  The  exact  behavior  of  the |
              command depends on the <u>option</u> argument that follows the <b>edit</b> argument.  The following forms of |
              the command are currently supported:                                                           |

              <u>pathName</u> <b>edit</b> <b>modified</b>                                                                         |
              <b>?</b><u>boolean</u>?                                                               |                      |
                     If  <u>boolean</u>  is  not  specified,  returns  the modified flag of the widget. The insert, |
                     delete, edit undo and edit redo commands or the user can  set  or  clear  the  modified |
                     flag.  If <u>boolean</u> is specified, sets the modified flag of the widget to <u>boolean</u>.        |

              <u>pathName</u> <b>edit</b>                                                                                  |
              <b>redo</b>                                                                             |             |
                     When the <b>-undo</b> option is true, reapplies the last undone edits provided no other  edits |
                     were  done  since  then. Generates an error when the redo stack is empty.  Does nothing |
                     when the <b>-undo</b> option is false.                                                         |

              <u>pathName</u> <b>edit</b>                                                                                  |
              <b>reset</b>                                                                            |             |
                     Clears the undo and redo stacks.                                                        |

              <u>pathName</u> <b>edit</b> <b>separa-</b>                                                                          |
              <b>tor</b>                                                                        |                   |
                     Inserts a separator (boundary) on the undo stack. Does nothing when the <b>-undo</b> option is |
                     false.                                                                                  |

              <u>pathName</u> <b>edit</b>                                                                                  |
              <b>undo</b>                                                                             |             |
                     Undoes the last edit action when the <b>-undo</b> option is true.  An edit action  is  defined |
                     as  all  the  insert and delete commands that are recorded on the undo stack in between |
                     two separators. Generates an error when the undo stack is empty.  Does nothing when the |
                     <b>-undo</b> option is false.                                                                  |

       <u>pathName</u> <b>get</b> <u>index1</u> ?<u>index2</u> <u>...</u>?
              Return  a  range  of characters from the text.  The return value will be all the characters in
              the text starting with the one whose index is <u>index1</u> and ending  just  before  the  one  whose
              index is <u>index2</u> (the character at <u>index2</u> will not be returned).  If <u>index2</u> is omitted then the
              single character at <u>index1</u> is returned.  If there are no characters  in  the  specified  range
              (e.g.  <u>index1</u>  is  past the end of the file or <u>index2</u> is less than or equal to <u>index1</u>) then an
              empty string is returned.  If the specified range contains embedded  windows,  no  information
              about  them  is  included in the returned string.  If multiple index pairs are given, multiple |
              ranges of text will be returned in a list.  Invalid ranges will not be represented with  empty |
              strings in the list.  The ranges are returned in the order passed to <b>get</b>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>image</b> <u>option</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
              This  command  is  used to manipulate embedded images.  The behavior of the command depends on
              the <u>option</u> argument that follows the <b>tag</b> argument.  The following forms  of  the  command  are
              currently supported:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>image</b> <b>cget</b> <u>index</u> <u>option</u>
                     Returns  the  value  of a configuration option for an embedded image.  <u>Index</u> identifies
                     the embedded image, and <u>option</u> specifies a particular configuration option, which  must
                     be one of the ones listed in the section EMBEDDED IMAGES.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>image</b> <b>configure</b> <u>index</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
                     Query or modify the configuration options for an embedded image.  If no <u>option</u> is spec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ified,&nbsp;specified,</font>
                     ified, returns a list describing all of the available options for the embedded image at
                     <u>index</u>  (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for information on the format of this list).  If <u>option</u> is
                     specified with no <u>value</u>, then the command returns  a  list  describing  the  one  named
                     option  (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned
                     if no <u>option</u> is specified).  If one or more <u>option-value</u> pairs are specified, then  the
                     command modifies the given <!-- a -->option(s)<!-- /a --> to have the given <!-- a -->value(s)<!-- /a -->;  in this case the com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
                     mand returns an empty string.  See EMBEDDED IMAGES for information on the options  that
                     are supported.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>image</b> <b>create</b> <u>index</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
                     This command creates a new image annotation, which will appear in the text at the posi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;position</font>
                     tion given by <u>index</u>.  Any number of <u>option-value</u> pairs may be  specified  to  configure
                     the  annotation.   Returns a unique identifier that may be used as an index to refer to
                     this image.  See EMBEDDED IMAGES for information on the options that are supported, and
                     a description of the identifier returned.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>image</b> <b>names</b>
                     Returns  a  list whose elements are the names of all image instances currently embedded
                     in <u>window</u>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>index</b> <u>index</u>
              Returns the position corresponding to <u>index</u> in the form <u>line.char</u> where <u>line</u> is the line  num-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ber&nbsp;number</font>
              ber and <u>char</u> is the character number.  <u>Index</u> may have any of the forms described under INDICES
              above.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>insert</b> <u>index</u> <u>chars</u> ?<u>tagList</u> <u>chars</u> <u>tagList</u> <u>...</u>?
              Inserts all of the <u>chars</u> arguments just before the character at <u>index</u>.  If <u>index</u> refers to the
              end  of  the  text  (the  character after the last newline) then the new text is inserted just
              before the last newline instead.  If there is a single <u>chars</u> argument and no <u>tagList</u>, then the
              new text will receive any tags that are present on both the character before and the character
              after the insertion point; if a tag is present on only one of these characters  then  it  will
              not  be  applied  to  the new text.  If <u>tagList</u> is specified then it consists of a list of tag
              names;  the new characters will receive all of the tags in this list and no others, regardless
              of  the tags present around the insertion point.  If multiple <u>chars</u>-<u>tagList</u> argument pairs are
              present, they produce the same effect as if a separate <b>insert</b> widget command had  been  issued
              for each pair, in order.  The last <u>tagList</u> argument may be omitted.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>mark</b> <u>option</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
              This  command  is  used to manipulate marks.  The exact behavior of the command depends on the
              <u>option</u> argument that follows the <b>mark</b> argument.  The following forms of the command  are  cur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rently&nbsp;currently</font>
              rently supported:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>mark</b> <b>gravity</b> <u>markName</u> ?<u>direction</u>?
                     If  <u>direction</u> is not specified, returns <b>left</b> or <b>right</b> to indicate which of its adjacent
                     characters <u>markName</u> is attached to.  If <u>direction</u> is specified,  it  must  be  <b>left</b>  or
                     <b>right</b>; the gravity of <u>markName</u> is set to the given value.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>mark</b> <b>names</b>
                     Returns a list whose elements are the names of all the marks that are currently set.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>mark</b> <b>next</b> <u>index</u>
                     Returns  the name of the next mark at or after <u>index</u>.  If <u>index</u> is specified in numeri-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cal&nbsp;numerical</font>
                     cal form, then the search for the next mark begins at that index.  If <u>index</u> is the name
                     of  a mark, then the search for the next mark begins immediately after that mark.  This
                     can still return a mark at the same position if there are multiple marks  at  the  same
                     index.   These  semantics mean that the <b>mark</b> <b>next</b> operation can be used to step through
                     all the marks in a text widget in the same order as the mark  information  returned  by
                     the  <b>dump</b>  operation.  If a mark has been set to the special <b>end</b> index, then it appears
                     to be <u>after</u> <b>end</b> with respect to the <b>mark</b> <b>next</b> operation.  An empty string  is  returned
                     if there are no marks after <u>index</u>.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>mark</b> <b>previous</b> <u>index</u>
                     Returns  the  name  of the mark at or before <u>index</u>.  If <u>index</u> is specified in numerical
                     form, then the search for the previous mark begins with the character just before  that
                     index.   If <u>index</u> is the name of a mark, then the search for the next mark begins imme-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">diately&nbsp;immediately</font>
                     diately before that mark.  This can still return a mark at the same position  if  there
                     are  multiple  marks  at  the  same index.  These semantics mean that the <b>mark</b> <b>previous</b>
                     operation can be used to step through all the marks in a text  widget  in  the  reverse
                     order  as  the  mark  information  returned  by the <b>dump</b> operation.  An empty string is
                     returned if there are no marks before <u>index</u>.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>mark</b> <b>set</b> <u>markName</u> <u>index</u>
                     Sets the mark named <u>markName</u> to a position just before  the  character  at  <u>index</u>.   If
                     <u>markName</u>  already exists, it is moved from its old position; if it doesn't exist, a new
                     mark is created.  This command returns an empty string.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>mark</b> <b>unset</b> <u>markName</u> ?<u>markName</u> <u>markName</u> <u>...</u>?
                     Remove the mark corresponding to each of the <u>markName</u>  arguments.   The  removed  marks
                     will  not  be  usable in indices and will not be returned by future calls to ``<u>pathName</u>
                     <b>mark</b> <b>names</b>''.  This command returns an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>scan</b> <u>option</u> <u>args</u>
              This command is used to implement scanning on texts.  It has two forms, depending on <u>option</u>:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>scan</b> <b>mark</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u>
                     Records <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> and the current view in the text window, for use  in  conjunction  with
                     later  <b>scan</b>  <b>dragto</b> commands.  Typically this command is associated with a mouse button
                     press in the widget.  It returns an empty string.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>scan</b> <b>dragto</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u>
                     This command computes the difference between its <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> arguments  and  the  <u>x</u>  and  <u>y</u>
                     arguments to the last <b>scan</b> <b>mark</b> command for the widget.  It then adjusts the view by 10
                     times the difference in coordinates.  This command is typically associated  with  mouse
                     motion  events  in the widget, to produce the effect of dragging the text at high speed
                     through the window.  The return value is an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>search</b> ?<u>switches</u>? <u>pattern</u> <u>index</u> ?<u>stopIndex</u>?
              Searches the text in <u>pathName</u> starting at <u>index</u> for a range of characters  that  matches  <u>pat</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tern.&nbsp;pattern.</font>
              <u>tern</u>.   If  a  match  is  found,  the index of the first character in the match is returned as
              result;  otherwise an empty string is returned.  One or more of  the  following  switches  (or
              abbreviations thereof) may be specified to control the search:

              <b>-forwards</b>
                     The  search  will  proceed  forward  through the text, finding the first matching range
                     starting at or after the position given by <u>index</u>.  This is the default.

              <b>-backwards</b>
                     The search will proceed backward through the text, finding the matching  range  closest
                     to <u>index</u> whose first character is before <u>index</u>.

              <b>-exact</b> Use exact matching:  the characters in the matching range must be identical to those in
                     <u>pattern</u>.  This is the default.

              <b>-regexp</b>
                     Treat <u>pattern</u> as a regular expression and match it against the text using the rules for
                     regular expressions (see the <b>regexp</b> command for details).

              <b>-nocase</b>
                     Ignore case differences between the pattern and the text.

              <b>-count</b> <u>varName</u>
                     The  argument  following  <b>-count</b> gives the name of a variable; if a match is found, the
                     number of index positions between beginning and end  of  the  matching  range  will  be
                     stored  in  the  variable.   If there are no embedded images or windows in the matching
                     range, this is equivalent to the number of characters matched.   In  either  case,  the
                     range <u>matchIdx</u> to <u>matchIdx</u> <u>+</u> <u>$count</u> <u>chars</u> will return the entire matched text.

              <b>-elide</b> Find elidden (hidden) text as well. By default only displayed text is searched.

              <b>--</b>     This  switch  has no effect except to terminate the list of switches: the next argument
                     will be treated as <u>pattern</u> even if it starts with <b>-</b>.

              The matching range must be entirely within a single line  of  text.   For  regular  expression
              matching  the newlines are removed from the ends of the lines before matching:  use the <b>$</b> fea-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ture&nbsp;feature</font>
              ture in regular expressions to match the end of a line.  For exact matching the  newlines  are
              retained.  If <u>stopIndex</u> is specified, the search stops at that index: for forward searches, no
              match at or after <u>stopIndex</u> will be considered;  for backward searches, no  match  earlier  in
              the  text than <u>stopIndex</u> will be considered.  If <u>stopIndex</u> is omitted, the entire text will be
              searched: when the beginning or end of the text is reached, the search continues at the  other
              end  until  the starting location is reached again;  if <u>stopIndex</u> is specified, no wrap-around
              will occur.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>see</b> <u>index</u>
              Adjusts the view in the window so that the character given by <u>index</u> is completely visible.  If
              <u>index</u>  is  already visible then the command does nothing.  If <u>index</u> is a short distance out of
              view, the command adjusts the view just enough to make <u>index</u> visible at the edge of  the  win-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dow.&nbsp;window.</font>
              dow.  If <u>index</u> is far out of view, then the command centers <u>index</u> in the window.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b> <u>option</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
              This  command  is  used  to manipulate tags.  The exact behavior of the command depends on the
              <u>option</u> argument that follows the <b>tag</b> argument.  The following forms of the  command  are  cur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rently&nbsp;currently</font>
              rently supported:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b> <b>add</b> <u>tagName</u> <u>index1</u> ?<u>index2</u> <u>index1</u> <u>index2</u> <u>...</u>?
                     Associate  the  tag  <u>tagName</u> with all of the characters starting with <u>index1</u> and ending
                     just before <u>index2</u> (the character at <u>index2</u> isn't tagged).  A single command  may  con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tain&nbsp;contain</font>
                     tain  any number of <u>index1</u>-<u>index2</u> pairs.  If the last <u>index2</u> is omitted then the single
                     character at <u>index1</u> is tagged.  If there are no characters in the specified range (e.g.
                     <u>index1</u>  is past the end of the file or <u>index2</u> is less than or equal to <u>index1</u>) then the
                     command has no effect.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b> <b>bind</b> <u>tagName</u> ?<u>sequence</u>? ?<u>script</u>?
                     This command associates <u>script</u> with the tag  given  by  <u>tagName</u>.   Whenever  the  event
                     sequence  given  by  <u>sequence</u> occurs for a character that has been tagged with <u>tagName</u>,
                     the script will be invoked.  This widget command is similar to the <b>bind</b> command  except
                     that it operates on characters in a text rather than entire widgets.  See the <b>bind</b> man-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ual&nbsp;manual</font>
                     ual entry for complete details on the syntax of <u>sequence</u>  and  the  substitutions  per-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">formed&nbsp;performed</font>
                     formed on <u>script</u> before invoking it.  If all arguments are specified then a new binding
                     is created, replacing any existing binding for the same <u>sequence</u> and  <u>tagName</u>  (if  the
                     first character of <u>script</u> is ``+'' then <u>script</u> augments an existing binding rather than
                     replacing it).  In this case the return value is an empty string.  If <u>script</u> is omitted
                     then  the  command  returns  the  <u>script</u> associated with <u>tagName</u> and <u>sequence</u> (an error
                     occurs if there is no such binding).  If both <u>script</u> and <u>sequence</u> are omitted then  the
                     command  returns  a  list of all the sequences for which bindings have been defined for
                     <u>tagName</u>.

                     The only events for which bindings may be specified are those related to the mouse  and |
                     keyboard  (such  as <b>Enter</b>, <b>Leave</b>, <b>ButtonPress</b>, <b>Motion</b>, and <b>KeyPress</b>) or virtual events. |
                     Event bindings for a text widget use the <b>current</b> mark described under MARKS above.   An |
                     <b>Enter</b>  event triggers for a tag when the tag first becomes present on the current char- |
                     acter, and a <b>Leave</b> event triggers for a tag when it ceases to be present on the current |
                     character.   <b>Enter</b> and <b>Leave</b> events can happen either because the <b>current</b> mark moved or |
                     because the character at that position changed.  Note that these events  are  different |
                     than <b>Enter</b> and <b>Leave</b> events for windows.  Mouse and keyboard events are directed to the |
                     current character.  If a virtual event is used in a binding, that binding  can  trigger |
                     only if the virtual event is defined by an underlying mouse-related or keyboard-related |
                     event.

                     It is possible for the current character to have multiple tags, and for each of them to
                     have  a  binding  for  a  particular  event sequence.  When this occurs, one binding is
                     invoked for each tag, in order from lowest-priority to highest priority.  If there  are
                     multiple  matching  bindings for a single tag, then the most specific binding is chosen
                     (see the manual entry for the <b>bind</b> command for details).  <b>continue</b> and  <b>break</b>  commands
                     within  binding  scripts are processed in the same way as for bindings created with the
                     <b>bind</b> command.

                     If bindings are created for the widget as a whole using the <b>bind</b>  command,  then  those
                     bindings  will  supplement  the  tag bindings.  The tag bindings will be invoked first,
                     followed by bindings for the window as a whole.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b> <b>cget</b> <u>tagName</u> <u>option</u>
                     This command returns the current value of the option named <u>option</u> associated  with  the
                     tag  given by <u>tagName</u>.  <u>Option</u> may have any of the values accepted by the <b>tag</b> <b>configure</b>
                     widget command.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b> <b>configure</b> <u>tagName</u> ?<u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u>? ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
                     This command is similar to the <b>configure</b> widget command except that it modifies options
                     associated  with  the tag given by <u>tagName</u> instead of modifying options for the overall
                     text widget.  If no <u>option</u> is specified, the command returns a list describing  all  of
                     the  available  options for <u>tagName</u> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for information on the format
                     of this list).  If <u>option</u> is specified with no <u>value</u>, then the command returns  a  list
                     describing  the one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding sub-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">list&nbsp;sublist</font>
                     list of the value returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).  If  one  or  more  <u>option-value</u>
                     pairs  are  specified,  then the command modifies the given <!-- a -->option(s)<!-- /a --> to have the given
                     <!-- a -->value(s)<!-- /a --> in <u>tagName</u>; in this case the command returns an empty string.  See TAGS  above
                     for details on the options available for tags.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b> <b>delete</b> <u>tagName</u> ?<u>tagName</u> <u>...</u>?
                     Deletes all tag information for each of the <u>tagName</u> arguments.  The command removes the
                     tags from all characters in the file and also deletes any other information  associated
                     with  the tags, such as bindings and display information.  The command returns an empty
                     string.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b> <b>lower</b> <u>tagName</u> ?<u>belowThis</u>?
                     Changes the priority of tag <u>tagName</u> so that it is just lower in priority than  the  tag
                     whose  name  is <u>belowThis</u>.  If <u>belowThis</u> is omitted, then <u>tagName</u>'s priority is changed
                     to make it lowest priority of all tags.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b> <b>names</b> ?<u>index</u>?
                     Returns a list whose elements are the names of all the tags  that  are  active  at  the
                     character  position  given  by  <u>index</u>.  If <u>index</u> is omitted, then the return value will
                     describe all of the tags that exist for the text (this includes all tags that have been
                     named in a ``<u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b>'' widget command but haven't been deleted by a ``<u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b>
                     <b>delete</b>'' widget command, even if no characters are currently marked with the tag).  The
                     list will be sorted in order from lowest priority to highest priority.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b> <b>nextrange</b> <u>tagName</u> <u>index1</u> ?<u>index2</u>?
                     This  command searches the text for a range of characters tagged with <u>tagName</u> where the
                     first character of the range is no earlier than the character at <u>index1</u>  and  no  later
                     than  the  character just before <u>index2</u> (a range starting at <u>index2</u> will not be consid-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ered).&nbsp;considered).</font>
                     ered).  If several matching ranges exist, the  first  one  is  chosen.   The  command's
                     return  value is a list containing two elements, which are the index of the first char-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">acter&nbsp;character</font>
                     acter of the range and the index of the character just after the last one in the range.
                     If  no  matching range is found then the return value is an empty string.  If <u>index2</u> is
                     not given then it defaults to the end of the text.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b> <b>prevrange</b> <u>tagName</u> <u>index1</u> ?<u>index2</u>?
                     This command searches the text for a range of characters tagged with <u>tagName</u> where  the
                     first  character of the range is before the character at <u>index1</u> and no earlier than the
                     character at <u>index2</u> (a range starting at <u>index2</u> will be considered).  If several match-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;matching</font>
                     ing ranges exist, the one closest to <u>index1</u> is chosen.  The command's return value is a
                     list containing two elements, which are the index of the first character of  the  range
                     and  the  index  of the character just after the last one in the range.  If no matching
                     range is found then the return value is an empty string.  If <u>index2</u> is not  given  then
                     it defaults to the beginning of the text.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b> <b>raise</b> <u>tagName</u> ?<u>aboveThis</u>?
                     Changes  the priority of tag <u>tagName</u> so that it is just higher in priority than the tag
                     whose name is <u>aboveThis</u>.  If <u>aboveThis</u> is omitted, then <u>tagName</u>'s priority  is  changed
                     to make it highest priority of all tags.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b> <b>ranges</b> <u>tagName</u>
                     Returns a list describing all of the ranges of text that have been tagged with <u>tagName</u>.
                     The first two elements of the list describe the first tagged range  in  the  text,  the
                     next two elements describe the second range, and so on.  The first element of each pair
                     contains the index of the first character of the range, and the second element  of  the
                     pair  contains  the  index  of  the character just after the last one in the range.  If
                     there are no characters tagged with <u>tag</u> then an empty string is returned.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b> <b>remove</b> <u>tagName</u> <u>index1</u> ?<u>index2</u> <u>index1</u> <u>index2</u> <u>...</u>?
                     Remove the tag <u>tagName</u> from all of the characters starting at <u>index1</u>  and  ending  just
                     before  <u>index2</u>  (the character at <u>index2</u> isn't affected).  A single command may contain
                     any number of <u>index1</u>-<u>index2</u> pairs.  If the last <u>index2</u> is omitted then the single char-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">acter&nbsp;character</font>
                     acter  at  <u>index1</u>  is  tagged.  If there are no characters in the specified range (e.g.
                     <u>index1</u> is past the end of the file or <u>index2</u> is less than or equal to <u>index1</u>) then  the
                     command has no effect.  This command returns an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>window</b> <u>option</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
              This  command  is used to manipulate embedded windows.  The behavior of the command depends on
              the <u>option</u> argument that follows the <b>tag</b> argument.  The following forms  of  the  command  are
              currently supported:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>window</b> <b>cget</b> <u>index</u> <u>option</u>
                     Returns  the  value of a configuration option for an embedded window.  <u>Index</u> identifies
                     the embedded window, and <u>option</u> specifies a particular configuration option, which must
                     be one of the ones listed in the section EMBEDDED WINDOWS.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>window</b> <b>configure</b> <u>index</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
                     Query  or  modify  the  configuration  options for an embedded window.  If no <u>option</u> is
                     specified, returns a list describing all of the available options for the embedded win-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dow&nbsp;window</font>
                     dow  at  <u>index</u>  (see  <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for information on the format of this list).  If
                     <u>option</u> is specified with no <u>value</u>, then the command returns a list describing  the  one
                     named  option  (this  list  will be identical to the corresponding sublist of the value
                     returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).  If one or more <u>option-value</u> pairs are  specified,
                     then the command modifies the given <!-- a -->option(s)<!-- /a --> to have the given <!-- a -->value(s)<!-- /a -->;  in this case
                     the command returns an empty string.  See  EMBEDDED  WINDOWS  for  information  on  the
                     options that are supported.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>window</b> <b>create</b> <u>index</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
                     This  command  creates  a  new  window annotation, which will appear in the text at the
                     position given by <u>index</u>.  Any number of <u>option-value</u> pairs may be specified to  config-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ure&nbsp;configure</font>
                     ure  the annotation.  See EMBEDDED WINDOWS for information on the options that are sup-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ported.&nbsp;supported.</font>
                     ported.  Returns an empty string.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>window</b> <b>names</b>
                     Returns a list whose elements are the names of all windows currently embedded  in  <u>win</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dow.&nbsp;window.</font>
                     <u>dow</u>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b> <u>option</u> <u>args</u>
              This  command  is used to query and change the horizontal position of the text in the widget's
              window.  It can take any of the following forms:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b>
                     Returns a list containing two elements.  Each element is a real fraction between 0  and
                     1;   together they describe the portion of the document's horizontal span that is visi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ble&nbsp;visible</font>
                     ble in the window.  For example, if the first element is .2 and the second  element  is
                     .6, 20% of the text is off-screen to the left, the middle 40% is visible in the window,
                     and 40% of the text is off-screen to the right.  The fractions refer only to the  lines
                     that  are  actually  visible  in  the  window:  if the lines in the window are all very
                     short, so that they are entirely visible, the returned fractions will be 0 and 1,  even
                     if  there  are  other lines in the text that are much wider than the window.  These are
                     the same values passed to scrollbars via the <b>-xscrollcommand</b> option.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b> <b>moveto</b> <u>fraction</u>
                     Adjusts the view in the window so that <u>fraction</u> of the horizontal span of the  text  is
                     off-screen to the left.  <u>Fraction</u> is a fraction between 0 and 1.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b> <b>scroll</b> <u>number</u> <u>what</u>
                     This  command shifts the view in the window left or right according to <u>number</u> and <u>what</u>.
                     <u>Number</u> must be an integer.  <u>What</u> must be either <b>units</b> or <b>pages</b> or  an  abbreviation  of
                     one of these.  If <u>what</u> is <b>units</b>, the view adjusts left or right by <u>number</u> average-width
                     characters on the display;  if it is <b>pages</b> then the view adjusts by <u>number</u>  screenfuls.
                     If  <u>number</u>  is  negative  then characters farther to the left become visible;  if it is
                     positive then characters farther to the right become visible.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b> <u>?args</u>?
              This command is used to query and change the vertical position of the  text  in  the  widget's
              window.  It can take any of the following forms:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b>
                     Returns  a list containing two elements, both of which are real fractions between 0 and
                     1.  The first element gives the position of the first character in the top line in  the
                     window,  relative to the text as a whole (0.5 means it is halfway through the text, for
                     example).  The second element gives the position of the character just after  the  last
                     one  in  the bottom line of the window, relative to the text as a whole.  These are the
                     same values passed to scrollbars via the <b>-yscrollcommand</b> option.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b> <b>moveto</b> <u>fraction</u>
                     Adjusts the view in the window so that the character given by <u>fraction</u> appears  on  the
                     top line of the window.  <u>Fraction</u> is a fraction between 0 and 1;  0 indicates the first
                     character in the text, 0.33 indicates the character one-third the way through the text,
                     and so on.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b> <b>scroll</b> <u>number</u> <u>what</u>
                     This  command  adjust  the  view in the window up or down according to <u>number</u> and <u>what</u>.
                     <u>Number</u> must be an integer.  <u>What</u> must be either <b>units</b> or <b>pages</b>.  If <u>what</u> is <b>units</b>,  the
                     view  adjusts  up or down by <u>number</u> lines on the display;  if it is <b>pages</b> then the view
                     adjusts by <u>number</u> screenfuls.  If <u>number</u> is negative then earlier positions in the text
                     become visible;  if it is positive then later positions in the text become visible.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b> ?<b>-pickplace</b>? <u>index</u>
                     Changes  the  view  in  the  widget's  window to make <u>index</u> visible.  If the <b>-pickplace</b>
                     option isn't specified then <u>index</u> will appear at the top of the window.  If  <b>-pickplace</b>
                     is specified then the widget chooses where <u>index</u> appears in the window:

                     [1]    If  <u>index</u> is already visible somewhere in the window then the command does noth-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing.&nbsp;nothing.</font>
                            ing.

                     [2]    If <u>index</u> is only a few lines off-screen above the window then it will  be  posi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tioned&nbsp;positioned</font>
                            tioned at the top of the window.

                     [3]    If  <u>index</u>  is only a few lines off-screen below the window then it will be posi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tioned&nbsp;positioned</font>
                            tioned at the bottom of the window.

                     [4]    Otherwise, <u>index</u> will be centered in the window.

                     The <b>-pickplace</b> option has been obsoleted by the <b>see</b> widget command (<b>see</b> handles both x-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">and&nbsp;xand</font>
                     and  y-motion to make a location visible, whereas <b>-pickplace</b> only handles motion in y).

              <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b> <u>number</u>
                     This command makes the first character on the line after the one given by <u>number</u>  visi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ble&nbsp;visible</font>
                     ble at the top of the window.  <u>Number</u> must be an integer.  This command used to be used
                     for scrolling, but now it is obsolete.


<b>BINDINGS</b>
       Tk automatically creates class bindings for texts that give them the following default behavior.   In
       the  descriptions  below,  ``word''  is  dependent  on  the value of the <b>tcl_wordchars</b> variable.  See
       <a href="tclvars.ntcl.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/n/tclvars">tclvars(n)</a>.

       [1]    Clicking mouse button 1 positions the insertion cursor just before  the  character  underneath
              the mouse cursor, sets the input focus to this widget, and clears any selection in the widget.
              Dragging with mouse button 1 strokes out a selection between  the  insertion  cursor  and  the
              character under the mouse.

       [2]    Double-clicking  with mouse button 1 selects the word under the mouse and positions the inser-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;insertion</font>
              tion cursor at the end of the word.  Dragging after a double click will stroke out a selection
              consisting of whole words.

       [3]    Triple-clicking  with mouse button 1 selects the line under the mouse and positions the inser-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;insertion</font>
              tion cursor at the end of the line.  Dragging after a triple click will stroke out a selection
              consisting of whole lines.

       [4]    The  ends of the selection can be adjusted by dragging with mouse button 1 while the Shift key
              is down;  this will adjust the end of the selection that was nearest to the mouse cursor  when
              button 1 was pressed.  If the button is double-clicked before dragging then the selection will
              be adjusted in units of whole words;  if it is  triple-clicked  then  the  selection  will  be
              adjusted in units of whole lines.

       [5]    Clicking mouse button 1 with the Control key down will reposition the insertion cursor without
              affecting the selection.

       [6]    If any normal printing characters are typed, they are inserted at the point of  the  insertion
              cursor.

       [7]    The  view in the widget can be adjusted by dragging with mouse button 2.  If mouse button 2 is
              clicked without moving the mouse, the selection is copied into the text at the position of the
              mouse cursor.  The Insert key also inserts the selection, but at the position of the insertion
              cursor.

       [8]    If the mouse is dragged out of the widget while button 1 is pressed, the entry will  automati-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cally&nbsp;automatically</font>
              cally scroll to make more text visible (if there is more text off-screen on the side where the
              mouse left the window).

       [9]    The Left and Right keys move the insertion cursor one character to the left  or  right;   they
              also clear any selection in the text.  If Left or Right is typed with the Shift key down, then
              the insertion cursor moves and the selection is extended to include the new  character.   Con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">trol-Left&nbsp;Control-Left</font>
              trol-Left  and  Control-Right  move  the insertion cursor by words, and Control-Shift-Left and
              Control-Shift-Right move the insertion cursor by words and also extend  the  selection.   Con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">trol-b&nbsp;Control-b</font>
              trol-b  and  Control-f  behave  the  same  as Left and Right, respectively.  Meta-b and Meta-f
              behave the same as Control-Left and Control-Right, respectively.

       [10]   The Up and Down keys move the insertion cursor one line up or down and clear any selection  in
              the  text.   If  Up or Right is typed with the Shift key down, then the insertion cursor moves
              and the selection is extended to include the new character.  Control-Up and Control-Down  move
              the  insertion  cursor  by paragraphs (groups of lines separated by blank lines), and Control-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">Shift-Up&nbsp;ControlShift-Up</font>
              Shift-Up and Control-Shift-Down move the insertion cursor by paragraphs and  also  extend  the
              selection.  Control-p and Control-n behave the same as Up and Down, respectively.

       [11]   The  Next  and  Prior keys move the insertion cursor forward or backwards by one screenful and
              clear any selection in the text.  If the Shift key is held down while Next or Prior is  typed,
              then  the  selection  is extended to include the new character.  Control-v moves the view down
              one screenful without moving the insertion cursor or adjusting the selection.

       [12]   Control-Next and Control-Prior scroll the view right or left by one page  without  moving  the
              insertion cursor or affecting the selection.

       [13]   Home and Control-a move the insertion cursor to the beginning of its line and clear any selec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;selection</font>
              tion in the widget.  Shift-Home moves the insertion cursor to the beginning of  the  line  and
              also extends the selection to that point.

       [14]   End  and Control-e move the insertion cursor to the end of the line and clear any selection in
              the widget.  Shift-End moves the cursor to the end of the line and extends  the  selection  to
              that point.

       [15]   Control-Home  and  Meta-&lt; move the insertion cursor to the beginning of the text and clear any
              selection in the widget.  Control-Shift-Home moves the insertion cursor to  the  beginning  of
              the text and also extends the selection to that point.

       [16]   Control-End  and  Meta-&gt; move the insertion cursor to the end of the text and clear any selec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;selection</font>
              tion in the widget.  Control-Shift-End moves the cursor to the end of the text and extends the
              selection to that point.

       [17]   The  Select  key  and  Control-Space set the selection anchor to the position of the insertion
              cursor.  They don't affect the current selection.  Shift-Select and Control-Shift-Space adjust
              the  selection  to  the current position of the insertion cursor, selecting from the anchor to
              the insertion cursor if there was not any selection previously.

       [18]   Control-/ selects the entire contents of the widget.

       [19]   Control-\ clears any selection in the widget.

       [20]   The F16 key (labelled Copy on many Sun workstations) or Meta-w copies  the  selection  in  the
              widget  to  the clipboard, if there is a selection.  This action is carried out by the command |
              <b>tk_textCopy</b>.

       [21]   The F20 key (labelled Cut on many Sun workstations) or Control-w copies the selection  in  the
              widget  to the clipboard and deletes the selection.  This action is carried out by the command |
              <b>tk_textCut</b>.  If there is no selection in the widget then these keys have no effect.

       [22]   The F18 key (labelled Paste on many Sun workstations) or Control-y inserts the contents of the
              clipboard  at the position of the insertion cursor.  This action is carried out by the command |
              <b>tk_textPaste</b>.

       [23]   The Delete key deletes the selection, if there is one in the widget.  If there  is  no  selec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion,&nbsp;selection,</font>
              tion, it deletes the character to the right of the insertion cursor.

       [24]   Backspace  and  Control-h delete the selection, if there is one in the widget.  If there is no
              selection, they delete the character to the left of the insertion cursor.

       [25]   Control-d deletes the character to the right of the insertion cursor.

       [26]   Meta-d deletes the word to the right of the insertion cursor.

       [27]   Control-k deletes from the insertion cursor to the end of its line; if the insertion cursor is
              already at the end of a line, then Control-k deletes the newline character.

       [28]   Control-o  opens  a new line by inserting a newline character in front of the insertion cursor
              without moving the insertion cursor.

       [29]   Meta-backspace and Meta-Delete delete the word to the left of the insertion cursor.

       [30]   Control-x deletes whatever is selected in the text widget.

       [31]   Control-t reverses the order of the two characters to the right of the insertion cursor.

       [32]   Control-z (and Control-underscore on UNIX when <b>tk_strictMotif</b> is true) undoes  the  last  edit |
              action if the <b>-undo</b> option is true.  Does nothing otherwise.                                   |

       [33]                                                                                                  ||
              Control-Z (or Control-y on Windows) reapplies the last undone edit action if the <b>-undo</b>  option |
              is true. Does nothing otherwise.

       If  the  widget is disabled using the <b>-state</b> option, then its view can still be adjusted and text can
       still be selected, but no insertion cursor will be displayed and  no  text  modifications  will  take
       place.

       The behavior of texts can be changed by defining new bindings for individual widgets or by redefining
       the class bindings.


<b>PERFORMANCE</b> <b>ISSUES</b>
       Text widgets should run efficiently under a variety of conditions.  The text widget  uses  about  2-3
       bytes  of main memory for each byte of text, so texts containing a megabyte or more should be practi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cal&nbsp;practical</font>
       cal on most workstations.  Text is represented internally with a modified B-tree structure that makes
       operations  relatively efficient even with large texts.  Tags are included in the B-tree structure in
       a way that allows tags to span large ranges or have many disjoint  smaller  ranges  without  loss  of
       efficiency.   Marks  are also implemented in a way that allows large numbers of marks.  In most cases
       it is fine to have large numbers of unique tags, or a tag that has many distinct ranges.

       One performance problem can arise if you have hundreds or thousands of different tags that  all  have
       the  following  characteristics: the first and last ranges of each tag are near the beginning and end
       of the text, respectively, or a single tag range covers most of the text widget.  The cost of  adding
       and deleting tags like this is proportional to the number of other tags with the same properties.  In
       contrast, there is no problem with having thousands of distinct tags  if  their  overall  ranges  are
       localized and spread uniformly throughout the text.

       Very long text lines can be expensive, especially if they have many marks and tags within them.

       The display line with the insert cursor is redrawn each time the cursor blinks, which causes a steady
       stream of graphics traffic.  Set the <b>insertOffTime</b> attribute to 0 avoid this.
