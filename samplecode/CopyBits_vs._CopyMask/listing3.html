<pre class="sourcecodebox">/*  File:    SampleInit.c  Contains:  Sample is an example application that demonstrates how to        initialize the commonly used toolbox managers, operate         successfully under MultiFinder, handle desk accessories,         and create, grow, and zoom windows.          It does not by any means demonstrate all the techniques         you need for a large application. In particular, Sample         does not cover exception handling, multiple windows/documents,         sophisticated memory management, printing, or undo. All of         these are vital parts of a normal full-sized application.          This application is an example of the form of a Macintosh         application; it is NOT a template. It is NOT intended to be         used as a foundation for the next world-class, best-selling,         600K application. A stick figure drawing of the human body may         be a good example of the form for a painting, but that does not         mean it should be used as the basis for the next Mona Lisa.          We recommend that you review this program or TESample before         beginning a new application.        SetPort strategy:           Toolbox routines do not change the current port. In spite of this, in this          program we use a strategy of calling SetPort whenever we want to draw or           make calls which depend on the current port. This makes us less vulnerable           to bugs in other software which might alter the current port (such as the           bug (feature?) in many desk accessories which change the port on OpenDeskAcc).           Hopefully, this also makes the routines from this program more self-contained,           since they don't depend on the current port setting.  Written by:     Copyright:  Copyright &copy; 1989-1999 by Apple Computer, Inc., All Rights Reserved.        You may incorporate this Apple sample source code into your program(s) without        restriction.

We also create our one application window at this time.  Since window storage is non-relocateable, how and when to allocate space  for windows is very important so that heap fragmentation does not occur.  Because Sample has only one window and it is only disposed when the application  quits, we will allocate its space here, before anything that might be a locked  relocatable object gets into the heap. This way, we can force the storage to be  in the lowest memory available in the heap. Window storage can differ widely  amongst applications depending on how many windows are created and disposed. *//*  1.01 - The code that used to be part of ForceEnvirons has been moved into  this module. If an error is detected, instead of merely doing an ExitToShell,  which leaves the user without much to go on, we call AlertUser, which puts  up a simple alert that just says an error occurred and then calls ExitToShell.  Since there is no other cleanup needed at this point if an error is detected,  this form of error- handling is acceptable. If more sophisticated error recovery  is needed, an exception mechanism, such as is provided by Signals, can be used. */void Initialize(){  Handle    menuBar;  DialogPtr  newDialogP;  long    total, contig;  EventRecord event;  short    count;  gInBackground = false;  InitGraf((Ptr) &amp;qd.thePort);  InitFonts();  InitWindows();  InitMenus();  TEInit();  InitDialogs(nil);  InitCursor();    /*  Call MPPOpen and ATPLoad at this point to initialize AppleTalk,     if you are using it. */  /*  NOTE -- It is no longer necessary, and actually unhealthy, to check    PortBUse and SPConfig before opening AppleTalk.
