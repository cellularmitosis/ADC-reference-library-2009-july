PERLFAQ2(1)                           Perl Programmers Reference Guide                           PERLFAQ2(1)



<b>NAME</b>
       perlfaq2 - Obtaining and Learning about Perl ($Revision: 1.39 $, $Date: 2006/01/08 14:27:07 $)

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       This section of the FAQ answers questions about where to find source and documentation for Perl, sup-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">port,&nbsp;support,</font>
       port, and related matters.

       <b>What</b> <b>machines</b> <b>support</b> <b>perl?</b>  <b>Where</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>it?</b>

       The standard release of perl (the one maintained by the perl development team) is distributed only in
       source code form.  You can find this at <a href="http://www.cpan.org/src/latest.tar.gz">http://www.cpan.org/src/latest.tar.gz</a> , which is in a stan-
       dard Internet format (a gzipped archive in POSIX tar format).

       Perl builds and runs on a bewildering number of platforms.  Virtually all known and current Unix de-
       rivatives are supported (perl's native platform), as are other systems like VMS, DOS, OS/2, Windows,
       QNX, BeOS, OS X, MPE/iX and the Amiga.

       Binary distributions for some proprietary platforms, including Apple systems, can be found
       <a href="http://www.cpan.org/ports/">http://www.cpan.org/ports/</a> directory.  Because these are not part of the standard distribution, they
       may and in fact do differ from the base perl port in a variety of ways.  You'll have to check their
       respective release notes to see just what the differences are.  These differences can be either posi-
       tive (e.g. extensions for the features of the particular platform that are not supported in the
       source release of perl) or negative (e.g.  might be based upon a less current source release of
       perl).

       <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>binary</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>perl?</b>

       If you don't have a C compiler because your vendor for whatever reasons did not include one with your
       system, the best thing to do is grab a binary version of gcc from the net and use that to compile
       perl with.  CPAN only has binaries for systems that are terribly hard to get free compilers for, not
       for Unix systems.

       Some URLs that might help you are:

           <a href="http://www.cpan.org/ports/">http://www.cpan.org/ports/</a>
           <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/language/info/software.html">http://www.perl.com/pub/language/info/software.html</a>

       Someone looking for a perl for Win16 might look to Laszlo Molnar's djgpp port in
       <a href="http://www.cpan.org/ports/#msdos">http://www.cpan.org/ports/#msdos</a> , which comes with clear installation instructions.  A simple
       installation guide for MS-DOS using Ilya Zakharevich's OS/2 port is available at
       <a href="http://www.cs.ruu.nl/%7Epiet/perl5dos.html">http://www.cs.ruu.nl/%7Epiet/perl5dos.html</a> and similarly for Windows 3.1 at
       <a href="http://www.cs.ruu.nl/%7Epiet/perlwin3.html">http://www.cs.ruu.nl/%7Epiet/perlwin3.html</a> .

       <b>I</b> <b>don't</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>C</b> <b>compiler.</b> <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>build</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>interpreter?</b>

       Since you don't have a C compiler, you're doomed and your vendor should be sacrificed to the Sun
       gods.  But that doesn't help you.

       What you need to do is get a binary version of gcc for your system first.  Consult the Usenet FAQs
       for your operating system for information on where to get such a binary version.

       <b>I</b> <b>copied</b> <b>the</b> <b>perl</b> <b>binary</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>machine</b> <b>to</b> <b>another,</b> <b>but</b> <b>scripts</b> <b>don't</b> <b>work.</b>

       That's probably because you forgot libraries, or library paths differ.  You really should build the
       whole distribution on the machine it will eventually live on, and then type "make install".  Most
       other approaches are doomed to failure.

       One simple way to check that things are in the right place is to print out the hard-coded @INC that
       perl looks through for libraries:

           % perl -le 'print for @INC'

       If this command lists any paths that don't exist on your system, then you may need to move the appro-
       priate libraries to these locations, or create symbolic links, aliases, or shortcuts appropriately.
       @INC is also printed as part of the output of

           % perl -V

       You might also want to check out "How do I keep my own module/library directory?" in perlfaq8.

       <b>I</b> <b>grabbed</b> <b>the</b> <b>sources</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>compile</b> <b>but</b> <b>gdbm/dynamic</b> <b>loading/malloc/linking/...</b> <b>failed.</b>  <b>How</b>
       <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>work?</b>

       Read the <u>INSTALL</u> file, which is part of the source distribution.  It describes in detail how to cope
       with most idiosyncrasies that the Configure script can't work around for any given system or archi-
       tecture.

       <b>What</b> <b>modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>extensions</b> <b>are</b> <b>available</b> <b>for</b> <b>Perl?</b>  <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>CPAN?</b>  <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>CPAN/src/...</b> <b>mean?</b>

       CPAN stands for Comprehensive Perl Archive Network, a ~1.2Gb archive replicated on nearly 200
       machines all over the world.  CPAN contains source code, non-native ports, documentation, scripts,
       and many third-party modules and extensions, designed for everything from commercial database inter-
       faces to keyboard/screen control to web walking and CGI scripts.  The master web site for CPAN is
       <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">http://www.cpan.org/</a> and there is the CPAN Multiplexer at <a href="http://www.cpan.org/CPAN.html">http://www.cpan.org/CPAN.html</a> which will
       choose a mirror near you via DNS.  See <a href="http://www.perl.com/CPAN">http://www.perl.com/CPAN</a> (without a slash at the end) for how
       this process works. Also, <a href="http://mirror.cpan.org/">http://mirror.cpan.org/</a> has a nice interface to the
       <a href="http://www.cpan.org/MIRRORED.BY">http://www.cpan.org/MIRRORED.BY</a> mirror directory.

       See the CPAN FAQ at <a href="http://www.cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html">http://www.cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html</a> for answers to the most frequently asked
       questions about CPAN including how to become a mirror.

       CPAN/path/... is a naming convention for files available on CPAN sites.  CPAN indicates the base
       directory of a CPAN mirror, and the rest of the path is the path from that directory to the file.
       For instance, if you're using <a href="ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN">ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN</a> as your CPAN site, the file
       CPAN/misc/japh is downloadable as <a href="ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN/misc/japh">ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN/misc/japh</a> .

       Considering that there are close to two thousand existing modules in the archive, one probably exists
       to do nearly anything you can think of.  Current categories under CPAN/modules/by-category/ include
       Perl core modules; development support; operating system interfaces; networking, devices, and inter-
       process communication; data type utilities; database interfaces; user interfaces; interfaces to other
       languages; filenames, file systems, and file locking; internationalization and locale; world wide web
       support; server and daemon utilities; archiving and compression; image manipulation; mail and news;
       control flow utilities; filehandle and I/O; Microsoft Windows modules; and miscellaneous modules.

       See <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/00modlist.long.html">http://www.cpan.org/modules/00modlist.long.html</a> or <a href="http://search.cpan.org/">http://search.cpan.org/</a> for a more complete
       list of modules by category.

       CPAN is not affiliated with O'Reilly Media.

       <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>an</b> <b>ISO</b> <b>or</b> <b>ANSI</b> <b>certified</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>Perl?</b>

       Certainly not.  Larry expects that he'll be certified before Perl is.

       <b>Where</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>Perl?</b>

       The complete Perl documentation is available with the Perl distribution.  If you have Perl installed
       locally, you probably have the documentation installed as well: type "man perl" if you're on a system
       resembling Unix.  This will lead you to other important man pages, including how to set your $MAN-
       PATH.  If you're not on a Unix system, access to the documentation will be different; for example,
       documentation might only be in HTML format.  All proper perl installations have fully-accessible doc-
       umentation.

       You might also try "perldoc perl" in case your system doesn't have a proper man command, or it's been
       misinstalled.  If that doesn't work, try looking in /usr/local/lib/perl5/pod for documentation.

       If all else fails, consult <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/">http://perldoc.perl.org/</a> which has the complete documentation in HTML and
       PDF format.

       Many good books have been written about Perl--see the section below for more details.

       Tutorial documents are included in current or upcoming Perl releases include perltoot for objects or
       perlboot for a beginner's approach to objects, perlopentut for file opening semantics, perlreftut for
       managing references, perlretut for regular expressions, perlthrtut for threads, perldebtut for debug-
       ging, and perlxstut for linking C and Perl together.  There may be more by the time you read this.
       These URLs might also be useful:

       <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>newsgroups</b> <b>on</b> <b>Usenet?</b>  <b>Where</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>post</b> <b>questions?</b>

       Several groups devoted to the Perl language are on Usenet:

           comp.lang.perl.announce             Moderated announcement group
           comp.lang.perl.misc                 High traffic general Perl discussion
           comp.lang.perl.moderated        Moderated discussion group
           comp.lang.perl.modules              Use and development of Perl modules
           comp.lang.perl.tk                   Using Tk (and X) from Perl

           comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi  Writing CGI scripts for the Web.

       Some years ago, comp.lang.perl was divided into those groups, and comp.lang.perl itself officially
       removed.  While that group may still be found on some news servers, it is unwise to use it, because
       postings there will not appear on news servers which honour the official list of group names.  Use
       comp.lang.perl.misc for topics which do not have a more-appropriate specific group.

       There is also a Usenet gateway to Perl mailing lists sponsored by perl.org at nntp://nntp.perl.org ,
       a web interface to the same lists at <a href="http://nntp.perl.org/group/">http://nntp.perl.org/group/</a> and these lists are also available
       under the "perl.*" hierarchy at <a href="http://groups.google.com">http://groups.google.com</a> . Other groups are listed at
       <a href="http://lists.perl.org/">http://lists.perl.org/</a> ( also known as <a href="http://lists.cpan.org/">http://lists.cpan.org/</a> ).

       A nice place to ask questions is the PerlMonks site, <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/">http://www.perlmonks.org/</a> , or the Perl Begin-
       ners mailing list <a href="http://lists.perl.org/showlist.cgi?name=beginners">http://lists.perl.org/showlist.cgi?name=beginners</a> .

       Note that none of the above are supposed to write your code for you: asking questions about particu-
       lar problems or general advice is fine, but asking someone to write your code for free is not very
       cool.

       <b>Where</b> <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>post</b> <b>source</b> <b>code?</b>

       You should post source code to whichever group is most appropriate, but feel free to cross-post to
       comp.lang.perl.misc.  If you want to cross-post to alt.sources, please make sure it follows their
       posting standards, including setting the Followup-To header line to NOT include alt.sources; see
       their FAQ ( <a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/alt-sources-intro/">http://www.faqs.org/faqs/alt-sources-intro/</a> ) for details.

       If you're just looking for software, first use Google ( <a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a> ), Google's usenet
       search interface ( <a href="http://groups.google.com">http://groups.google.com</a> ),  and CPAN Search ( <a href="http://search.cpan.org">http://search.cpan.org</a> ).  This is
       faster and more productive than just posting a request.

       <b>Perl</b> <b>Books</b>

       A number of books on Perl and/or CGI programming are available.  A few of these are good, some are
       OK, but many aren't worth your money.  There is a list of these books, some with extensive reviews,
       at <a href="http://books.perl.org/">http://books.perl.org/</a> . If you don't see your book listed here, you can write to perlfaq-work-
       ers@perl.org .

       The incontestably definitive reference book on Perl, written by the creator of Perl, is Programming
       Perl:

               Programming Perl (the "Camel Book"):
               by Larry Wall, Tom Christiansen, and Jon Orwant
               ISBN 0-596-00027-8  [3rd edition July 2000]

               (English, translations to several languages are also available)

       The companion volume to the Camel containing thousands of real-world examples, mini-tutorials, and
       complete programs is:

               The Perl Cookbook (the "Ram Book"):
               by Tom Christiansen and Nathan Torkington,

       If you're already a seasoned programmer, then the Camel Book might suffice for you to learn Perl.  If
       you're not, check out the Llama book:

               Learning Perl

       If you're not an accidental programmer, but a more serious and possibly even degreed computer scien-
       tist who doesn't need as much hand-holding as we try to provide in the Llama, please check out the
       delightful book

       <b>Which</b> <b>magazines</b> <b>have</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>content?</b>

       The first (and for a long time, only) periodical devoted to All Things Perl, <u>The</u> <u>Perl</u> <u>Journal</u> con-
       tains tutorials, demonstrations, case studies, announcements, contests, and much more.  <u>TPJ</u> has col-
       umns on web development, databases, Win32 Perl, graphical programming, regular expressions, and net-
       working, and sponsors the Obfuscated Perl Contest and the Perl Poetry Contests.  Beginning in Novem-
       ber 2002, TPJ moved to a reader-supported monthly e-zine format in which subscribers can download
       issues as PDF documents. For more details on TPJ, see <a href="http://www.tpj.com/">http://www.tpj.com/</a>

       Beyond this, magazines that frequently carry quality articles on Perl are <u>The</u> <u>Perl</u> <u>Review</u> (
       <a href="http://www.theperlreview.com">http://www.theperlreview.com</a> ), <u>Unix</u> <u>Review</u> ( <a href="http://www.unixreview.com/">http://www.unixreview.com/</a> ), <u>Linux</u> <u>Magazine</u> (
       <a href="http://www.linuxmagazine.com/">http://www.linuxmagazine.com/</a> ), and Usenix's newsletter/magazine to its members, <u>login:</u> (
       <a href="http://www.usenix.org/">http://www.usenix.org/</a> )

       The Perl columns of Randal L. Schwartz are available on the web at <a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/WebTechniques/">http://www.stonehenge.com/mer-</a>
       <a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/WebTechniques/">lyn/WebTechniques/</a> , <a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/UnixReview/">http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/UnixReview/</a> , and <a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/LinuxMag/">http://www.stone-</a>

       <b>What</b> <b>mailing</b> <b>lists</b> <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>Perl?</b>

       Most of the major modules (Tk, CGI, libwww-perl) have their own mailing lists.  Consult the documen-
       tation that came with the module for subscription information.

       A comprehensive list of Perl related mailing lists can be found at:

               <a href="http://lists.perl.org/">http://lists.perl.org/</a>

       <b>Where</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>archives</b> <b>for</b> <b>comp.lang.perl.misc?</b>

       The Google search engine now carries archived and searchable newsgroup content.

       <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?group=comp.lang.perl.misc">http://groups.google.com/groups?group=comp.lang.perl.misc</a>

       If you have a question, you can be sure someone has already asked the same question at some point on
       c.l.p.m. It requires some time and patience to sift through all the content but often you will find
       the answer you seek.

       <b>Where</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>perl?</b>

       In a real sense, perl already <u>is</u> commercial software: it has a license that you can grab and care-
       fully read to your manager. It is distributed in releases and comes in well-defined packages. There
       is a very large user community and an extensive literature.  The comp.lang.perl.*  newsgroups and
       several of the mailing lists provide free answers to your questions in near real-time.  Perl has tra-
       ditionally been supported by Larry, scores of software designers and developers, and myriad program-
       mers, all working for free to create a useful thing to make life better for everyone.

       However, these answers may not suffice for managers who require a purchase order from a company whom
       they can sue should anything go awry.  Or maybe they need very serious hand-holding and contractual
       obligations.  Shrink-wrapped CDs with perl on them are available from several sources if that will
       help.  For example, many Perl books include a distribution of perl, as do the O'Reilly Perl Resource
       Kits (in both the Unix flavor and in the proprietary Microsoft flavor); the free Unix distributions
       also all come with perl.

       <b>Where</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>send</b> <b>bug</b> <b>reports?</b>

       If you are reporting a bug in the perl interpreter or the modules shipped with Perl, use the <u>perlbug</u>
       program in the Perl distribution or mail your report to perlbug@perl.org or at
       <a href="http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/">http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/</a> .

       For Perl modules, you can submit bug reports to the Request Tracker set up at <a href="http://rt.cpan.org">http://rt.cpan.org</a> .

       If you are posting a bug with a non-standard port (see the answer to "What platforms is perl avail-
       able for?"), a binary distribution, or a non-standard module (such as Tk, CGI, etc), then please see
       the documentation that came with it to determine the correct place to post bugs.

       Read the <a href="perlbug.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/perlbug"><u>perlbug</u>(1)</a> man page (perl5.004 or later) for more information.

       <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>perl.com?</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>Mongers?</b> <b>pm.org?</b> <b>perl.org?</b> <b>cpan.org?</b>
