/*	File:		Color Search Procs.h	Contains:	This file defines a number of commonly used color search procs.  For the encoder,				we only use one of the procs, which returns white if the color of a pixel is within				a certain delta of a key color, and returns black for all other cases.  We can use				this to quickly create masks of an image.	   	Written by: Timothy Carroll		Copyright:	Copyright © 1996-1999 by Apple Computer, Inc., All Rights Reserved.				You may incorporate this Apple sample source code into your program(s) without				restriction.
