PERLMOD(1)                            Perl Programmers Reference Guide                            PERLMOD(1)



<b>NAME</b>
       perlmod - Perl modules (packages and symbol tables)

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       <b>Packages</b>

       Perl provides a mechanism for alternative namespaces to protect packages from stomping on each
       other's variables.  In fact, there's really no such thing as a global variable in Perl.  The package
       statement declares the compilation unit as being in the given namespace.  The scope of the package
       declaration is from the declaration itself through the end of the enclosing block, "eval", or file,
       whichever comes first (the same scope as the <u>my()</u> and <u>local()</u> operators).  Unqualified dynamic iden-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tifiers&nbsp;identifiers</font>
       tifiers will be in this namespace, except for those few identifiers that if unqualified, default to
       the main package instead of the current one as described below.  A package statement affects only
       dynamic variables--including those you've used <u>local()</u> on--but <u>not</u> lexical variables created with
       <u>my()</u>.  Typically it would be the first declaration in a file included by the "do", "require", or
       "use" operators.  You can switch into a package in more than one place; it merely influences which
       symbol table is used by the compiler for the rest of that block.  You can refer to variables and
       filehandles in other packages by prefixing the identifier with the package name and a double colon:
       $Package::Variable.  If the package name is null, the "main" package is assumed.  That is, $::sail is
       equivalent to $main::sail.

       The old package delimiter was a single quote, but double colon is now the preferred delimiter, in
       part because it's more readable to humans, and in part because it's more readable to <b>emacs</b> macros.
       It also makes C++ programmers feel like they know what's going on--as opposed to using the single
       quote as separator, which was there to make Ada programmers feel like they knew what was going on.
       Because the old-fashioned syntax is still supported for backwards compatibility, if you try to use a
       string like "This is $owner's house", you'll be accessing $owner::s; that is, the $s variable in
       package "owner", which is probably not what you meant.  Use braces to disambiguate, as in "This is
       ${owner}'s house".

       Packages may themselves contain package separators, as in $OUTER::INNER::var.  This implies nothing
       about the order of name lookups, however.  There are no relative packages: all symbols are either
       local to the current package, or must be fully qualified from the outer package name down.  For
       instance, there is nowhere within package "OUTER" that $INNER::var refers to $OUTER::INNER::var.
       "INNER" refers to a totally separate global package.

       Only identifiers starting with letters (or underscore) are stored in a package's symbol table.  All
       other symbols are kept in package "main", including all punctuation variables, like $_.  In addition,
       when unqualified, the identifiers STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR, ARGV, ARGVOUT, ENV, INC, and SIG are forced
       to be in package "main", even when used for other purposes than their built-in ones.  If you have a
       package called "m", "s", or "y", then you can't use the qualified form of an identifier because it
       would be instead interpreted as a pattern match, a substitution, or a transliteration.

       Variables beginning with underscore used to be forced into package main, but we decided it was more
       useful for package writers to be able to use leading underscore to indicate private variables and
       method names.  However, variables and functions named with a single "_", such as $_ and "sub _", are
       still forced into the package "main".  See also "Technical Note on the Syntax of Variable Names" in
       perlvar.

       "eval"ed strings are compiled in the package in which the <u>eval()</u> was compiled.  (Assignments to
       $SIG{}, however, assume the signal handler specified is in the "main" package.  Qualify the signal
       handler name if you wish to have a signal handler in a package.)  For an example, examine <u>perldb.pl</u>
       in the Perl library.  It initially switches to the "DB" package so that the debugger doesn't inter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fere&nbsp;interfere</font>
       fere with variables in the program you are trying to debug.  At various points, however, it temporar-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ily&nbsp;temporarily</font>
       ily switches back to the "main" package to evaluate various expressions in the context of the "main"
       package (or wherever you came from).  See perldebug.

       The special symbol "__PACKAGE__" contains the current package, but cannot (easily) be used to con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">struct&nbsp;construct</font>
       struct variable names.

       See perlsub for other scoping issues related to <u>my()</u> and <u>local()</u>, and perlref regarding closures.

       <b>Symbol</b> <b>Tables</b>

       The symbol table for a package happens to be stored in the hash of that name with two colons
       appended.  The main symbol table's name is thus %main::, or %:: for short.  Likewise the symbol table
       for the nested package mentioned earlier is named %OUTER::INNER::.

       The value in each entry of the hash is what you are referring to when you use the *name typeglob
       notation.  In fact, the following have the same effect, though the first is more efficient because it
       does the symbol table lookups at compile time:

           local *main::foo    = *main::bar;
           local $main::{foo}  = $main::{bar};

       (Be sure to note the <b>vast</b> difference between the second line above and "local $main::foo =
       $main::bar". The former is accessing the hash %main::, which is the symbol table of package "main".
       The latter is simply assigning scalar $bar in package "main" to scalar $foo of the same package.)

       You can use this to print out all the variables in a package, for instance.  The standard but anti-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">quated&nbsp;antiquated</font>
       quated <u>dumpvar.pl</u> library and the CPAN module Devel::Symdump make use of this.

       Assignment to a typeglob performs an aliasing operation, i.e.,

           *dick = *richard;

       causes variables, subroutines, formats, and file and directory handles accessible via the identifier
       "richard" also to be accessible via the identifier "dick".  If you want to alias only a particular
       variable or subroutine, assign a reference instead:

           *dick = \$richard;

       Which makes $richard and $dick the same variable, but leaves @richard and @dick as separate arrays.
       Tricky, eh?

       There is one subtle difference between the following statements:

           *foo = *bar;
           *foo = \$bar;

       "*foo = *bar" makes the typeglobs themselves synonymous while "*foo = \$bar" makes the SCALAR por-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tions&nbsp;portions</font>
       tions of two distinct typeglobs refer to the same scalar value. This means that the following code:

           $bar = 1;
           *foo = \$bar;       # Make $foo an alias for $bar

           {
               local $bar = 2; # Restrict changes to block
               print $foo;     # Prints '1'!
           }

       Would print '1', because $foo holds a reference to the <u>original</u> $bar -- the one that was stuffed away
       by "local()" and which will be restored when the block ends. Because variables are accessed through
       the typeglob, you can use "*foo = *bar" to create an alias which can be localized. (But be aware that
       this means you can't have a separate @foo and @bar, etc.)

       What makes all of this important is that the Exporter module uses glob aliasing as the import/export
       mechanism. Whether or not you can properly localize a variable that has been exported from a module
       depends on how it was exported:

           @EXPORT = qw($FOO); # Usual form, can't be localized
           @EXPORT = qw(*FOO); # Can be localized

       You can work around the first case by using the fully qualified name ($Package::FOO) where you need a
       local value, or by overriding it by saying "*FOO = *Package::FOO" in your script.

       The "*x = \$y" mechanism may be used to pass and return cheap references into or from subroutines if
       you don't want to copy the whole thing.  It only works when assigning to dynamic variables, not lexi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cals.&nbsp;lexicals.</font>
       cals.

           %some_hash = ();                    # can't be my()
           *some_hash = fn( \%another_hash );
           sub fn {
               local *hashsym = shift;
               # now use %hashsym normally, and you
               # will affect the caller's %another_hash
               my %nhash = (); # do what you want
               return \%nhash;
           }

       On return, the reference will overwrite the hash slot in the symbol table specified by the *some_hash
       typeglob.  This is a somewhat tricky way of passing around references cheaply when you don't want to
       have to remember to dereference variables explicitly.

       Another use of symbol tables is for making "constant" scalars.

           *PI = \3.14159265358979;

       Now you cannot alter $PI, which is probably a good thing all in all.  This isn't the same as a con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">stant&nbsp;constant</font>
       stant subroutine, which is subject to optimization at compile-time.  A constant subroutine is one
       prototyped to take no arguments and to return a constant expression.  See perlsub for details on
       these.  The "use constant" pragma is a convenient shorthand for these.

       You can say *foo{PACKAGE} and *foo{NAME} to find out what name and package the *foo symbol table
       entry comes from.  This may be useful in a subroutine that gets passed typeglobs as arguments:

           sub identify_typeglob {
               my $glob = shift;
               print 'You gave me ', *{$glob}{PACKAGE}, '::', *{$glob}{NAME}, "\n";
           }
           identify_typeglob *foo;
           identify_typeglob *bar::baz;

       This prints

           You gave me main::foo
           You gave me bar::baz

       The *foo{THING} notation can also be used to obtain references to the individual elements of *foo.
       See perlref.

       Subroutine definitions (and declarations, for that matter) need not necessarily be situated in the
       package whose symbol table they occupy.  You can define a subroutine outside its package by explic-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">itly&nbsp;explicitly</font>
       itly qualifying the name of the subroutine:

           package main;
           sub Some_package::foo { ... }   # &amp;foo defined in Some_package

       This is just a shorthand for a typeglob assignment at compile time:

           BEGIN { *Some_package::foo = sub { ... } }

       and is <u>not</u> the same as writing:

           {
               package Some_package;
               sub foo { ... }
           }

       In the first two versions, the body of the subroutine is lexically in the main package, <u>not</u> in
       Some_package. So something like this:

           package main;

           $Some_package::name = "fred";
           $main::name = "barney";

           sub Some_package::foo {
               print "in ", __PACKAGE__, ": \$name is '$name'\n";
           }

           Some_package::foo();

       prints:

           in main: $name is 'barney'

       rather than:

           in Some_package: $name is 'fred'

       This also has implications for the use of the SUPER:: qualifier (see perlobj).

       <b>BEGIN,</b> <b>CHECK,</b> <b>INIT</b> <b>and</b> <b>END</b>

       Four specially named code blocks are executed at the beginning and at the end of a running Perl pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">gram.&nbsp;program.</font>
       gram.  These are the "BEGIN", "CHECK", "INIT", and "END" blocks.

       These code blocks can be prefixed with "sub" to give the appearance of a subroutine (although this is
       not considered good style).  One should note that these code blocks don't really exist as named sub-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">routines&nbsp;subroutines</font>
       routines (despite their appearance). The thing that gives this away is the fact that you can have
       <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> of these code blocks in a program, and they will get <b>all</b> executed at the appropriate
       moment.  So you can't execute any of these code blocks by name.

       A "BEGIN" code block is executed as soon as possible, that is, the moment it is completely defined,
       even before the rest of the containing file (or string) is parsed.  You may have multiple "BEGIN"
       blocks within a file (or eval'ed string) -- they will execute in order of definition.  Because a
       "BEGIN" code block executes immediately, it can pull in definitions of subroutines and such from
       other files in time to be visible to the rest of the compile and run time.  Once a "BEGIN" has run,
       it is immediately undefined and any code it used is returned to Perl's memory pool.

       It should be noted that "BEGIN" code blocks <b>are</b> executed inside string "eval()"'s.  The "CHECK" and
       "INIT" code blocks are <b>not</b> executed inside a string eval, which e.g. can be a problem in a mod_perl
       environment.

       An "END" code block is executed as late as possible, that is, after perl has finished running the
       program and just before the interpreter is being exited, even if it is exiting as a result of a <u>die()</u>
       function.  (But not if it's morphing into another program via "exec", or being blown out of the water
       by a signal--you have to trap that yourself (if you can).)  You may have multiple "END" blocks within
       a file--they will execute in reverse order of definition; that is: last in, first out (LIFO).  "END"
       blocks are not executed when you run perl with the "-c" switch, or if compilation fails.

       Note that "END" code blocks are <b>not</b> executed at the end of a string "eval()": if any "END" code
       blocks are created in a string "eval()", they will be executed just as any other "END" code block of
       that package in LIFO order just before the interpreter is being exited.

       Inside an "END" code block, $? contains the value that the program is going to pass to "exit()".  You
       can modify $? to change the exit value of the program.  Beware of changing $? by accident (e.g. by
       running something via "system").

       "CHECK" and "INIT" code blocks are useful to catch the transition between the compilation phase and
       the execution phase of the main program.

       "CHECK" code blocks are run just after the <b>initial</b> Perl compile phase ends and before the run time
       begins, in LIFO order.  "CHECK" code blocks are used in the Perl compiler suite to save the compiled
       state of the program.

       "INIT" blocks are run just before the Perl runtime begins execution, in "first in, first out" (FIFO)
       order. For example, the code generators documented in perlcc make use of "INIT" blocks to initialize
       and resolve pointers to XSUBs.

       When you use the <b>-n</b> and <b>-p</b> switches to Perl, "BEGIN" and "END" work just as they do in <b>awk</b>, as a
       degenerate case.  Both "BEGIN" and "CHECK" blocks are run when you use the <b>-c</b> switch for a compile-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">only&nbsp;compileonly</font>
       only syntax check, although your main code is not.

       The <b>begincheck</b> program makes it all clear, eventually:

         #!/usr/bin/perl

         # begincheck

         print         " 8. Ordinary code runs at runtime.\n";

         END { print   "14.   So this is the end of the tale.\n" }
         INIT { print  " 5. INIT blocks run FIFO just before runtime.\n" }
         CHECK { print " 4.   So this is the fourth line.\n" }

         print         " 9.   It runs in order, of course.\n";

         BEGIN { print " 1. BEGIN blocks run FIFO during compilation.\n" }
         END { print   "13.   Read perlmod for the rest of the story.\n" }
         CHECK { print " 3. CHECK blocks run LIFO at compilation's end.\n" }
         INIT { print  " 6.   Run this again, using Perl's -c switch.\n" }

         print         "10.   This is anti-obfuscated code.\n";

         END { print   "12. END blocks run LIFO at quitting time.\n" }
         BEGIN { print " 2.   So this line comes out second.\n" }
         INIT { print  " 7.   You'll see the difference right away.\n" }

         print         "11.   It merely _looks_ like it should be confusing.\n";

         __END__

       <b>Perl</b> <b>Classes</b>

       There is no special class syntax in Perl, but a package may act as a class if it provides subroutines
       to act as methods.  Such a package may also derive some of its methods from another class (package)
       by listing the other package <!-- a -->name(s)<!-- /a --> in its global @ISA array (which must be a package global, not a
       lexical).

       For more on this, see perltoot and perlobj.

       <b>Perl</b> <b>Modules</b>

       A module is just a set of related functions in a library file, i.e., a Perl package with the same
       name as the file.  It is specifically designed to be reusable by other modules or programs.  It may
       do this by providing a mechanism for exporting some of its symbols into the symbol table of any pack-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">age&nbsp;package</font>
       age using it, or it may function as a class definition and make its semantics available implicitly
       through method calls on the class and its objects, without explicitly exporting anything.  Or it can
       do a little of both.

       For example, to start a traditional, non-OO module called Some::Module, create a file called
       <u>Some/Module.pm</u> and start with this template:

           package Some::Module;  # assumes Some/Module.pm

           use strict;
           use warnings;

           BEGIN {
               use Exporter   ();
               our ($VERSION, @ISA, @EXPORT, @EXPORT_OK, %EXPORT_TAGS);

               # set the version for version checking
               $VERSION     = 1.00;
               # if using RCS/CVS, this may be preferred
               $VERSION = sprintf "%d.%03d", q$Revision: 1.1 $ =~ /(\d+)/g;

               @ISA         = qw(Exporter);
               @EXPORT      = qw(&amp;func1 &amp;func2 &amp;func4);
               %EXPORT_TAGS = ( );     # eg: TAG =&gt; [ qw!name1 name2! ],

       Then go on to declare and use your variables in functions without any qualifications.  See Exporter
       and the perlmodlib for details on mechanics and style issues in module creation.

       Perl modules are included into your program by saying

           use Module;

       or

           use Module LIST;

       This is exactly equivalent to

           BEGIN { require Module; import Module; }

       or

           BEGIN { require Module; import Module LIST; }

       As a special case

           use Module ();

       is exactly equivalent to

           BEGIN { require Module; }

       All Perl module files have the extension <u>.pm</u>.  The "use" operator assumes this so you don't have to
       spell out "<u>Module.pm</u>" in quotes.  This also helps to differentiate new modules from old <u>.pl</u> and <u>.ph</u>
       files.  Module names are also capitalized unless they're functioning as pragmas; pragmas are in
       effect compiler directives, and are sometimes called "pragmatic modules" (or even "pragmata" if
       you're a classicist).

       The two statements:

           require SomeModule;
           require "SomeModule.pm";

       differ from each other in two ways.  In the first case, any double colons in the module name, such as
       "Some::Module", are translated into your system's directory separator, usually "/".   The second case
       does not, and would have to be specified literally.  The other difference is that seeing the first
       "require" clues in the compiler that uses of indirect object notation involving "SomeModule", as in
       "$ob = purge SomeModule", are method calls, not function calls.  (Yes, this really can make a differ-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ence.)&nbsp;difference.)</font>
       ence.)

       Because the "use" statement implies a "BEGIN" block, the importing of semantics happens as soon as
       the "use" statement is compiled, before the rest of the file is compiled.  This is how it is able to
       function as a pragma mechanism, and also how modules are able to declare subroutines that are then
       visible as list or unary operators for the rest of the current file.  This will not work if you use
       "require" instead of "use".  With "require" you can get into this problem:

           require Cwd;                # make Cwd:: accessible
           $here = Cwd::getcwd();

           use Cwd;                    # import names from Cwd::
           $here = getcwd();

           require Cwd;                # make Cwd:: accessible
           $here = getcwd();           # oops! no main::getcwd()

       In general, "use Module ()" is recommended over "require Module", because it determines module avail-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ability&nbsp;availability</font>
       ability at compile time, not in the middle of your program's execution.  An exception would be if two
       modules each tried to "use" each other, and each also called a function from that other module.  In
       that case, it's easy to use "require" instead.

       Perl packages may be nested inside other package names, so we can have package names containing "::".
       But if we used that package name directly as a filename it would make for unwieldy or impossible
       filenames on some systems.  Therefore, if a module's name is, say, "Text::Soundex", then its defini-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;definition</font>
       tion is actually found in the library file <u>Text/Soundex.pm</u>.

       Perl modules always have a <u>.pm</u> file, but there may also be dynamically linked executables (often end-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;ending</font>
       ing in <u>.so</u>) or autoloaded subroutine definitions (often ending in <u>.al</u>) associated with the module.
       If so, these will be entirely transparent to the user of the module.  It is the responsibility of the
       <u>.pm</u> file to load (or arrange to autoload) any additional functionality.  For example, although the
       POSIX module happens to do both dynamic loading and autoloading, the user can say just "use POSIX" to
       get it all.

       <b>Making</b> <b>your</b> <b>module</b> <b>threadsafe</b>

       Since 5.6.0, Perl has had support for a new type of threads called interpreter threads (ithreads).
       These threads can be used explicitly and implicitly.

       Ithreads work by cloning the data tree so that no data is shared between different threads. These
       threads can be used by using the "threads" module or by doing <u>fork()</u> on win32 (fake <u>fork()</u> support).
       When a thread is cloned all Perl data is cloned, however non-Perl data cannot be cloned automati-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cally.&nbsp;automatically.</font>
       cally.  Perl after 5.7.2 has support for the "CLONE" special subroutine.  In "CLONE" you can do what-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ever&nbsp;whatever</font>
       ever you need to do, like for example handle the cloning of non-Perl data, if necessary.  "CLONE"
       will be called once as a class method for every package that has it defined (or inherits it).  It
       will be called in the context of the new thread, so all modifications are made in the new area.  Cur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rently&nbsp;Currently</font>
       rently CLONE is called with no parameters other than the invocant package name, but code should not
       assume that this will remain unchanged, as it is likely that in future extra parameters will be
       passed in to give more information about the state of cloning.

       If you want to CLONE all objects you will need to keep track of them per package. This is simply done
       using a hash and <u>Scalar::Util::weaken()</u>.

       Perl after 5.8.7 has support for the "CLONE_SKIP" special subroutine.  Like "CLONE", "CLONE_SKIP" is
       called once per package; however, it is called just before cloning starts, and in the context of the
       parent thread. If it returns a true value, then no objects of that class will be cloned; or rather,
       they will be copied as unblessed, undef values.  This provides a simple mechanism for making a module
       threadsafe; just add "sub CLONE_SKIP { 1 }" at the top of the class, and "DESTROY()" will be now only
       be called once per object. Of course, if the child thread needs to make use of the objects, then a
       more sophisticated approach is needed.

       Like "CLONE", "CLONE_SKIP" is currently called with no parameters other than the invocant package
       name, although that may change. Similarly, to allow for future expansion, the return value should be
       a single 0 or 1 value.
