<P>If you make a syntax error when writing a method, WebObjects Builder displays a message box describing the error when you try to close the script window or to save the component.

<P>As further error checking, you can use the Check Consistency command to verify that the component's elements are bound to variables and methods that actually exist in the script file.

<P>The Check Consistency command also tells you if it detects a method that is declared but is not bound to anything. This is not necessarily an error---for example, you would never bind <B>awake</B> or <B>sleep</B> to any element in a component, but these two methods are used. They are invoked at the beginning and end of each request-response loop.
