Step 5 in your Carbonizing project further continues the modernization process.  This version adds support for the data browser control.  This required a major rewrite, as much of the project was based around the List Manager.  The window and dialog use the same interface element (a data browser control) which handles category switching itself and allowed for a significant reduction in window/dialog specific code.  Another addition is using .icns and .strings files instead of 'icns' and 'STR#' resources, and locating them using Bundle Services.  This allows us to flatten the the resources for both the PEF and Mach-O versions and build a single bundle with both executables.  In order to keep the Platinum and Aqua theme resources separate, a post linker shell tool was added the the CodeWarrior project.  The window and dialog are now fairly similar except that the window is resizable and the dialog has OK and Cancel buttons.  This brings the window method down to 384 (-395 from 4.0) lines, making for a drastic code reduction.  The dialog method is down to 241 (-98 from 4.0) lines.}
