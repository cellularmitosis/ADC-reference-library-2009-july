be performed on a set of files. Each build phase specializes in
a specific kind of file, such as header files, source files, resource
files, and frameworks and libraries. Also, each build phase performs
specific operations on the files associated with it. That way, changes
in the way files of the same kind are processed can be made by customizing
the operations that the build phase performs.</p>
<p>This chapter provides an overview of build phases, explains
how Xcode determines the order in which build phases should be processed
to build a product, describes in detail some of the build phases

<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH228-DontLinkElementID_20" title="Overview of Build Phases"></a><h2>Overview of Build Phases</h2>
<p>A build phase collects a group of files and performs a set
of operations on them in the process of building a product. To illustrate
this, think of the tasks you would take to prepare for and deliver
a presentation; many of the required tasks contain a set of inputs and
outputs:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><p>Specify the
purpose of the presentation and identify the audience.</p><p>This
task has no prerequisites but produces a set of criteria that serve
as the guiding principles for the presentation.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Gather the appropriate data, such as articles, reports, and
surveys.</p><p>Information gathering requires a set of criteria that
specifies what to look for and where to look for it. The outcome
are a set of documents containing the data gathered.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Purchase a business suit.</p><p>This task has no inputs or
outputs that directly relate to the presentation.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Analyze the data by collating facts, extrapolating trends,
and summarizing representative opinions.</p><p>This task uses the
data gathered in task 2 and produces one document containing the information
on which the presentation is based</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Develop a set of slides, including compelling illustrations,
from the information produced by your analysis.</p><p>This task requires
the information produced in task 4 and produces a set of slides
and illustrations, which could be presented using Keynote.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Deliver the presentation by showing the slides and illustrations
in sequence and engaging the audience with a loud, clear voice and
maintaining eye contact.</p></li></ol>
<p>The order in which build phases are executed in a target depends
on their inputs and outputs. Most of the tasks shown earlier contain
a set of inputs and outputs that associate them with each other
in an anterior/posterior relationship. Tasks that contain inputs that are
the outputs of other tasks or outputs that are the inputs of other
tasks are <strong>ordered tasks</strong>. These are tasks that
are executed in the order determined by their inputs and outputs. <strong>Unordered
tasks</strong>, on the other hand, are tasks with no inputs and
outputs, tasks whose inputs are not the outputs of other tasks,
or tasks whose outputs are not the inputs of other tasks. <span class="content_text">Figure 24-1</span> shows
the presentation tasks shown earlier categorized as ordered and
unordered.</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH228-BBCJJFIJ" title="Figure 24-1Presentation tasks"></a><p><strong>Figure 24-1&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Presentation tasks</p>
<img src = "../Art/presentation_tasks.gif" alt = "" width="289" height="360"></div><br/>
<p>Most of the tasks illustrated depend on another task&#8217;s outputs.
The Specify Purpose task is the only task among the ordered tasks
that doesn&#8217;t depend on the output of any other task; therefore,
it&#8217;s performed first. The Purchase Suit task is the only unordered
task; that is, it&#8217;s neither the anterior nor the posterior of
other tasks. Therefore, it can be executed at any time during the
preparation of the presentation.</p>

<p>To build an application, you typically compile source files
and link them to system frameworks and libraries. <span class="content_text">Figure 24-2</span> shows
some of the operations needed to build the CircleView application
(the CircleView project is located in <code>/Developer/Examples/AppKit</code>).</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH228-BBCHBDEC" title="Figure 24-2Building an application"></a><p><strong>Figure 24-2&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Building an application</p>
<img src = "../Art/file_centric_tasks.gif" alt = "" width="419" height="181"></div><br/>
<p>This simple project shows that there are many things to take
into account when building a product. You have to copy resource
files to the appropriate places, compile implementation files into
object files, and link object files with the appropriate frameworks to
produce a binary file. If you modify an implementation file, you
would have to compile it, and link the generated object file with
the other object files and the necessary frameworks.</p>
<p>If you analyze the files and the operations illustrated in <span class="content_text">Figure 24-2</span>,
you notice that the project contains three types of files: files
that are copied or installed; files that are processed or compiled
to produce intermediate files, such as object files; and frameworks
that are linked with the object files to produce a binary file.
To build a product, appropriate operations need to be performed
on the files depending on their type.</p>
<p>Build phases associate groups of files with operations to
be performed on them in order to build a product; for example, installing
header files within frameworks, compiling source files, linking
object files with system libraries or frameworks, and so on. As
you add files to a project, Xcode associates them with the appropriate
build phase, based on the files&#8217; type (specified by each file&#8217;s
extension). If you want to compile implementation files with a different
compiler, you make the change once, at the build phase level (see <span class="content_text"><a href="bs_build_phases.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH228-BBCEIFIF">“Compile Sources Build Phase”</a></span> and <span class="content_text"><a href="bs_build_phases.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH228-BBCCFEDJ">“Build Rules”</a></span> for
details). Therefore, build phases help make the process of building
an application, plug-in, library, or framework, understandable and
easy to customize, as illustrated in <span class="content_text">Figure 24-3</span>.</p>

phases</p><img src = "../Art/bphase_centric_tasks.gif" alt = "" width="545" height="279"></div><br/>
<p>A build phase operates on its inputs, which are the files
associated with it (either by you or intrinsically by Xcode), and
outputs, which are the files produced after the build phase is executed.
Each build phase executes its task by invoking tools to perform
the operations needed to accomplish the task.</p>
<p>Xcode offers several build phases, which are shown in <span class="content_text">Table 24-1</span>. The
name of the build phase reflects the task performed by that build
phase.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH228-BBCDIFFC" title="Table 24-1Build phases available in Xcode"></a><div class="tableholder"><table class="graybox" border = "0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">

<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH228-CJAIFHHC" title="Adding and Deleting Build Phases"></a><h2>Adding and Deleting Build Phases</h2>
<p>New targets&#8212;whether created through the New Target Assistant
or as part of creating a new project&#8212;already include a set of
default build phases. The default build phases for a target vary,
depending on the type of product created by the target. For example,
a target that builds an application typically includes a Copy Bundle
Resources build phase to copy resources over to the application
bundle; however, a target that builds a shell tool does not include
this build phase. The default build phases work for most simple
targets; however, you can accommodate more complex products and
build steps by adding your own build phases.To add a build phase:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Select the
target to add the build phase to; otherwise, Xcode adds the build
phase to the active target.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Choose a build phase from the Project &gt; New Build Phase
menu or from the Add &gt; New Build Phase menu in the contextual
menu that Xcode displays when you Control-click the target. <span class="content_text"><a href="bs_build_phases.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH228-BBCDIFFC">Table 24-1</a></span> shows
the available build phases.</p></li></ul>
<p>Xcode adds the new build phase after the currently selected
build phase, or, if no build phase is selected, adds it as the last
build phase in the target. Many types of build phases can only appear
once in a target; for example, there can be only one Compile Sources
build phase. If they already exist in the target, the menu items
to add these build phases are dimmed. However, a target can contain
multiple instances of the Copy Files and Run Script build phases.</p>
<p>To delete a build phase, select it in the Groups &amp; Files
list and press Delete or choose Edit &gt; Delete. Deleting a build
phase does delete the files in the build phase from the project
or from the disk. </p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH228-CJAFCFEG" title="Adding Files to a Build Phase"></a><h2>Adding Files to a Build Phase</h2>
<p>When you add a file to a project, Xcode lets you choose whether
to also add the file to any targets in the project. When you add
files to a target in this way, Xcode automatically assigns the files
to build phases, based on each file&#8217;s type. To view the inputs
to a particular build phase, you can do either of the following:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Select the
build phase in the Groups &amp; Files list and, if necessary, open
a detail view. The files assigned to the build phase are displayed
in the detail view.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Click the disclosure triangle next to the build phase in the
Groups &amp; Files list.</p></li></ul>
<p>Intermediate files&#8212;files generated by Xcode in other build
phases&#8212;are not listed. Xcode handles these intermediate files
automatically. </p>
<p>If Xcode&#8217;s default file placement is not sufficient for
your needs, you can easily move files among build phases by dragging
the file or files from their current build phase to the new build
phase. You can also add files that are already in your project to
a build phase by dragging the files from the project source group
to the appropriate build phase in the Groups &amp; Files list. To
delete a file from a build phase, select the file and press Delete.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH228-BBCEIBFA" title="Processing Order"></a><h2>Processing Order</h2>
<p>The order in which the build system executes build phases
is important because some build phases produce files that are part
of the inputs of other build phases. Therefore, the former must
be executed before the latter. In native targets, dependencies between
build phases determine the order of execution. In Jam-based targets,
you must ensure that the build phases within a target are ordered
appropriately. </p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH228-DontLinkElementID_22" title="In Native Targets"></a><h3>In Native Targets</h3>
<p>In some cases, a build phase inherently includes the outputs
of other build phases as its inputs. For example, the outputs of
the Compile Sources build phase (<code>.o</code> files)
are part of the inputs of the Link Binary With Libraries build phase.
This makes the Compile Sources build phase an antecedent of the Link
Binary With Libraries build phase. Therefore, the order in which
build phases are executed in a target depends on their inputs and
outputs.</p>
<p>Most build phases have their inputs and outputs defined implicitly.
However, Run Script build phases may have neither. In that case,
the build system tries to run the associated script in the order
specified within the target, but the actual point in the build process
at which the script is run is undetermined. If you assign either
input or output files to a Run Script build phase, the script&#8217;s
point of execution in the build process is determined by other targets
having the build phase&#8217;s outputs as their inputs, or the inputs
of the build phase being the outputs of other build phases.</p>
<p><span class="content_text"><a href="bs_build_phases.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH228-BBCDBCGE">Figure 24-3</a></span> illustrates this. Regardless of the order of the Compile Sources
and the Link Binary With Libraries build phases in the target, the Compile Sources
build phase is executed before the Link Binary With Libraries build
phase because part the latter&#8217;s inputs is constituted by the former&#8217;s
outputs.</p>
<p>In the Compile Sources build phase, the build system determines
the order in which files are processed through the inputs and outputs
of the target&#8217;s build rules, in a similar way in which the order
of build phases is determined.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH228-BBCCFIDD" title="In Jam-Based Targets"></a><h3>In Jam-Based Targets</h3>
<p>In Jam-based targets, the order of build phases within a target
and the input files within the build phase determines the order
in which the build system executes the build phases and processes
each file within each build phase.</p>
<p>You must make sure that build phases that produce files required
by other build phases are listed first within the target. For example,
the Compile Sources build phase must always be listed before the Link
Binary With Libraries build phase. </p>
<p>Within the Compile Sources build phase, you must ensure that
source files that generate derived files are placed above dependent
files. For example, if a target has Yacc (<code>.y</code>)
and Lex files (<code>.l</code>) files
and processing the Lex files requires the C (<code>.c</code>)
files generated from the Yacc files, the Yacc files must be listed
before the Lex files within the target.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH228-DontLinkElementID_23" title="Reordering Build Phases"></a><h3>Reordering Build Phases</h3>
<p>Typically, there is no need to change the order of build phases
in a target; the default arrangement works for the majority of cases.
If, however, you find that you need to change the position of a
build phase&#8212;for example, when adding custom build phases to a
Jam-based target&#8212;you can reorder a build phase by dragging the
build phase&#8217;s icon to its new location in the target.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH228-BBCEIFIF" title="Compile Sources Build Phase"></a><h2>Compile Sources Build Phase</h2>
<p>The Compile Sources build phase is one of the most customizable
build phases (the other one being the Run Script build phase). The
reason is that this build phase must handle a wide variety of input-file
types. Xcode is preconfigured to process several types of source files,
but you may have to compile source files that Xcode doesn&#8217;t know
about.</p>
<p>The feature that makes the Compile Sources build phase so
flexible is its support of <strong>build rules</strong>. They
specify the tool or script the build system invokes to process files
in Compile Sources and Build ResourceManager Resources build phases
when building a product. For details on build rules, see <span class="content_text"><a href="bs_build_phases.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH228-BBCCFEDJ">“Build Rules.”</a></span></p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH228-CJAHHAJI" title="Copy Files Build Phase"></a><h2>Copy Files Build Phase</h2>
<p>A Copy Files build phase allows you to copy and install files
and resources of any type to specific locations as part of the build
process. It complements the build phases that copy and install specific
types of files, such as the Copy Headers build phase, which deals
only with header files. You can have as many Copy Files build phases
as you need in a target.</p>
<p>For example, using a Copy Files build phase, you can copy
fonts to<code>/Library/Fonts</code>.
Or, if you&#8217;re developing a plug-in, a Copy Files build phase can
copy the generated plug-in to the appropriate location. You can
have as many Copy Files build phases in a target as you need.</p>
<p>To create a Copy Files build phase:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><p>In the project
window, click the disclosure triangle next to the target you want
to add the build phase to and select the build phase after which
to add the new build phase.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Choose Project &gt; New Build Phase &gt; New Copy Files Build
Phase. Xcode adds the new Copy Files build phase after the build
phase selected in the Groups &amp; Files list.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Drag the files you want to copy from the Groups &amp; Files
list to the Copy Files build phase.</p></li></ol>
<p>To configure the new Copy Files build phase, select it and
open an Info or inspector window. You should see a window similar
to the one shown here.</p>

<p>The Path field specifies the path, relative to the location

<p>The &#8220;Copy only when installing&#8221; option lets you specify
whether the build phase copies the files only in <strong>install
builds</strong> of the product. That is, when using the <code>install</code> option
of <code>xcodebuild</code> or when
the Deployment Location (DEPLOYMENT_LOCATION) build setting is turned
on. For more on <code>xcodebuild</code>,

<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH228-CJABHEIB" title="Run Script Build Phase"></a><h2>Run Script Build Phase</h2>
<p>A Run Script build phase lets you execute any commands you
need to perform a task. You can archive files using <code>tar</code>,
send mail, write messages to a log file, execute AppleScript scripts,
and so on. You can use any of the shell languages available in your
system. You can have any number of Run Script build phases in a
target.</p>
<p>Before executing your script, Xcode assigns the values of
most build settings to environment variables. In particular, it
sets the environment variables listed in <span class="content_text">Table 24-4</span>,
as well as any build settings that are defined at the target and
build style layers for the active target and build style. However,
keep in mind that Xcode does not recognize changes made to those
environment variables during the script&#8217;s execution and that shell scripts
are independent of each other. If you change the value of environment
variables in one script, the change is not visible in another script.
For details on the build settings that are reflected in the script&#8217;s
environment variables, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../bs_build_settings/bs_build_settings.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH229-CJBGCGCH">“Using Build Settings With Run Script Build Phases.”</a></span></p>

<p>To create a Run Script build phase: </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><p>In the project

similar to the one shown here.</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH228-DontLinkElementID_242" title="Figure 24-6The Info window for a Run Script build phase"></a><p><strong>Figure 24-6&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The

<p>The Shell field specifies the path to the appropriate shell.
Specify the script itself in the Script text field. You can type
the contents of the script directly in the text field or invoke it
from a file, as in the example shown above.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Run script only during deployment builds&#8221; option
lets you specify that the script be run only during install builds;
that is, when using the <code>install</code> option
of <code>xcodebuild</code> or when the
build settings Deployment Location (DEPLOYMENT_LOCATION) and Deployment Postprocessing
(DEPLOYMENT_POSTPROCESSING) are on.</p>
<p>The Input Files and Output Files tables specify the names
of input files and output files the script uses and produces. The
Input Files table specifies the files that the script operates on;
the Output Files table specifies the files that the script produces. To
add an entry to either of these tables, click the &#8220;+&#8221; button
below the table and type the name of the input or output file in
the resulting text field. File paths are interpreted relative to
the project directory.</p>
<p>Xcode uses the input and output files to determine whether
to run the script, and to determine the order in which the script
is executed. Specifying input and output files ensures that Xcode
runs the script only when the modification date of any of the input
files is later than the modification date of any of the output files
(reducing the time it takes to build your product), and that the
files the script produces are included in the dependency analysis
the build system performs before building your product. If you provide
no outputs, Xcode runs the script every time you build the target.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH228-BBCCFEDJ" title="Build Rules"></a><h2>Build Rules</h2>
<p>Build rules specify how particular types of files are processed
in Compile Sources build phases and specify the tool used to process
files in Build ResourcesManager Resources build phases. For example,
a build rule may indicate that all C source files be processed with
the GCC 3.3 compiler.Each build rule consists of a condition and
an action. The condition determines whether a source file is processed
with the associated action. Usually, the condition specifies a file
type. </p>
<p>Xcode provides default build rules that process C-based files,
assembly files, Rez files, and so on. You can add rules to process
other types of files to each target. You can see the build rules
in effect for a target in the Rules pane of the target inspector,
shown below.</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH228-DontLinkElementID_243" title="Figure 24-7The Rules pane of the Info window"></a><p><strong>Figure 24-7&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The
Rules pane of the Info window</p><img src = "../Art/rulespane.gif" alt = "" width="431" height="493"></div><br/>
<p>There are two types of rules:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>System rules.
These are predefined and unmodifiable, although you can override them. They
include rules for processing C-based, Assembler, and Rez source
files. See <span class="content_text"><a href="bs_build_phases.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH228-BBCHFFFE">“System Rules”</a></span> for details. System rules are the same for all
targets in a project.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Target-specific rules. These are custom rules that you have
defined for a particular target.</p></li></ul>
<p>Target-specific rules can specify files that the system rules
do not directly address or override the existing system rules. For
example, there&#8217;s a system rule for the processing of C-based source
files, which means that <code>.c</code> and <code>.m</code> files
are processed by the same rule. You can, however, add a target-specific
rule indicating that <code>.m</code> files
be processed by a different compiler. In addition, instead of specifying
a particular type of file, you can set the rule&#8217;s condition to
a pattern that matches a set of files. See <span class="content_text"><a href="bs_build_phases.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH228-CJACIIHG">“Creating a Custom Build Rule.”</a></span></p>
<p>You can view all rules for a target, including available system
rules, by choosing All Rules from the pop-up menu at the top of
the Rules pane. To see only those build rules defined for the target,
choose Rules Specific to Target.</p>
<p>A build rule&#8217;s action typically specifies the tool or compiler
to use when processing files that meet the given condition. But
you can also specify a build-rule script. The default interpreter
is <code>/bin/sh</code>. However,
you can specify any script interpreter by entering <code>#!&lt;interpreter_path&gt;</code> as
the first line of the script. When you use a build-rule script,
you must specify the files the script produces as the build rule&#8217;s
output files. See <span class="content_text"><a href="bs_build_phases.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH228-CJAEACAD">“Creating a Custom Build Rule Script.”</a></span></p>
<p>When processing a source file, Xcode evaluates the build rules
from top to bottom and chooses the first one whose condition matches
the source file being processed. Because custom build rules appear
above the built-in system rules, the custom build rules can override
the system build rules.</p>

<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH228-CJACIIHG" title="Creating a Custom Build Rule"></a><h3>Creating a Custom Build Rule</h3>
<p>In addition to the system build rules, Xcode lets you define
custom build rules on a per-target basis. Custom build rules allow
you to change the way files of a particular type are processed or
add support for types of files not directly addressed by the system
rules. </p>
<p>To add a new build rule to a target, click the plus (+) button
at the bottom of the Rules pane in the target inspector. Likewise,
you can delete any rule&#8212;other than the system rules&#8212;by selecting
the rule and clicking the minus (-) button.</p>
<p>To define a build rule&#8217;s condition, choose a file type from
the Process pop-up menu. You can also define rules that match arbitrary
file names by choosing the last item in the pop-up menu (&#8220;Source
files with names matching:&#8221;) and specifying a filename pattern
in the text field that appears. This field accepts the same kinds
of file patterns that a Terminal shell accepts. For example, to
match all files whose names start with a capital letter and end with
a <code>.def</code> suffix, you specify <code>[A-Z]*.def</code> as
the pattern.</p>
<p>You define the build rule's action by choosing one of the
available compilers from the &#8220;using&#8221; pop-up menu. Xcode provides
a number of built-in compilers for you to choose from. Alternatively,
you can define your own custom script for processing files that
meet the build rule&#8217;s condition, as described in <span class="content_text"><a href="bs_build_phases.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH228-CJAEACAD">“Creating a Custom Build Rule Script.”</a></span> </p>
<p>When processing a source file in the target, Xcode evaluates
the build rules from top to bottom and chooses the first one whose
condition matches the source file being processed. For this reason,
you should put the most specific build rules above the more general
ones. For example, a rule that matches only C++ files should appear
above a rule that matches all C-like files&#8212;that is, C, C++, Objective-C,
and Objective-C++ files. You can reorder custom rules by clicking
in their background and dragging them. System rules cannot be reordered.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH228-CJAEACAD" title="Creating a Custom Build Rule Script"></a><h3>Creating a Custom Build Rule
Script</h3>
<p>Instead of choosing one of Xcode&#8217;s built-in compilers to
process the files specified by a build rule&#8217;s condition, you can
create a custom script to process those files. To do so, choose
the &#8220;Custom script:&#8221; menu item. You can enter your script in
the text field that appears, or you can store your script as a separate
file in your project and invoke it from the text field using its
project-relative path. In this case, you are actually defining a
one-line script that calls the script in your project. </p>
<p>In addition to defining the script, you also need to tell
Xcode the paths of any output files that the script produces. Enter
the path to each separate output file that is produced by the script
in the &#8220;with output files&#8221; table below the script text field.
For each file, create a new row by clicking the plus (+) button.
In this row, specify either the full (absolute) path or the project-relative
path to the file. You can use any of the environment variables listed
in <span class="content_text"><a href="bs_build_phases.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH228-BBCEIIHH">Table 24-6</a></span>.</p>
<p>For example, suppose that you need to define a build rule
to process files with the extension <code>.abcdef</code>.
Also suppose that the build-rule script produces a <code>.c</code> file
for each <code>.abcdef</code> file
and that the generated <code>.c</code> files
are placed in the default directory for intermediate files. In this
case, the output-files specification could look like this:</p>
<div class="codesample"><table><tr><td scope="row"><pre>$(DERIVED_FILES_DIR)/$(INPUT_FILE_BASE).c<span></span></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<p>The generated files are automatically fed back to the rule-processing
engine. For example, continuing the <code>.abcdef</code> example
rule, Xcode processes the <code>.c</code> files
the script produces using the rule that processes <code>.c</code> files.</p>
