PERLPORT(1)                           Perl Programmers Reference Guide                           PERLPORT(1)



<b>NAME</b>
       perlport - Writing portable Perl

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       Perl runs on numerous operating systems.  While most of them share much in common, they also have
       their own unique features.

       This document is meant to help you to find out what constitutes portable Perl code.  That way once
       you make a decision to write portably, you know where the lines are drawn, and you can stay within
       them.

       There is a tradeoff between taking full advantage of one particular type of computer and taking
       advantage of a full range of them.  Naturally, as you broaden your range and become more diverse, the
       common factors drop, and you are left with an increasingly smaller area of common ground in which you
       can operate to accomplish a particular task.  Thus, when you begin attacking a problem, it is impor-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tant&nbsp;important</font>
       tant to consider under which part of the tradeoff curve you want to operate.  Specifically, you must
       decide whether it is important that the task that you are coding have the full generality of being
       portable, or whether to just get the job done right now.  This is the hardest choice to be made.  The
       rest is easy, because Perl provides many choices, whichever way you want to approach your problem.

       Looking at it another way, writing portable code is usually about willfully limiting your available
       choices.  Naturally, it takes discipline and sacrifice to do that.  The product of portability and
       convenience may be a constant.  You have been warned.

       Be aware of two important points:

       Not all Perl programs have to be portable
           There is no reason you should not use Perl as a language to glue Unix tools together, or to pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">totype&nbsp;prototype</font>
           totype a Macintosh application, or to manage the Windows registry.  If it makes no sense to aim
           for portability for one reason or another in a given program, then don't bother.

       Nearly all of Perl already <u>is</u> portable
           Don't be fooled into thinking that it is hard to create portable Perl code.  It isn't.  Perl
           tries its level-best to bridge the gaps between what's available on different platforms, and all
           the means available to use those features.  Thus almost all Perl code runs on any machine without
           modification.  But there are some significant issues in writing portable code, and this document
           is entirely about those issues.

       Here's the general rule: When you approach a task commonly done using a whole range of platforms,
       think about writing portable code.  That way, you don't sacrifice much by way of the implementation
       choices you can avail yourself of, and at the same time you can give your users lots of platform
       choices.  On the other hand, when you have to take advantage of some unique feature of a particular
       platform, as is often the case with systems programming (whether for Unix, Windows, Mac OS, VMS,
       etc.), consider writing platform-specific code.

       When the code will run on only two or three operating systems, you may need to consider only the dif-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ferences&nbsp;differences</font>
       ferences of those particular systems.  The important thing is to decide where the code will run and
       to be deliberate in your decision.

       The material below is separated into three main sections: main issues of portability ("ISSUES"),
       platform-specific issues ("PLATFORMS"), and built-in perl functions that behave differently on vari-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ous&nbsp;various</font>
       ous ports ("FUNCTION IMPLEMENTATIONS").

       This information should not be considered complete; it includes possibly transient information about
       idiosyncrasies of some of the ports, almost all of which are in a state of constant evolution.  Thus,
       this material should be considered a perpetual work in progress ("&lt;IMG SRC="yellow_sign.gif"
       ALT="Under Construction"&gt;").

<b>ISSUES</b>
       <b>Newlines</b>

       In most operating systems, lines in files are terminated by newlines.  Just what is used as a newline
       may vary from OS to OS.  Unix traditionally uses "\012", one type of DOSish I/O uses "\015\012", and
       Mac OS uses "\015".

       Perl uses "\n" to represent the "logical" newline, where what is logical may depend on the platform
       in use.  In MacPerl, "\n" always means "\015".  In DOSish perls, "\n" usually means "\012", but when
       accessing a file in "text" mode, STDIO translates it to (or from) "\015\012", depending on whether
       you're reading or writing.  Unix does the same thing on ttys in canonical mode.  "\015\012" is com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">monly&nbsp;commonly</font>
       monly referred to as CRLF.

       A common cause of unportable programs is the misuse of <u>chop()</u> to trim newlines:

           # XXX UNPORTABLE!
           while(&lt;FILE&gt;) {
               chop;
               @array = split(/:/);
               #...
           }

       You can get away with this on Unix and Mac OS (they have a single character end-of-line), but the
       same program will break under DOSish perls because you're only <u>chop()</u>ing half the end-of-line.
       Instead, <u>chomp()</u> should be used to trim newlines.  The Dunce::Files module can help audit your code
       for misuses of <u>chop()</u>.

       When dealing with binary files (or text files in binary mode) be sure to explicitly set $/ to the
       appropriate value for your file format before using <u>chomp()</u>.

       Because of the "text" mode translation, DOSish perls have limitations in using "seek" and "tell" on a
       file accessed in "text" mode.  Stick to "seek"-ing to locations you got from "tell" (and no others),
       and you are usually free to use "seek" and "tell" even in "text" mode.  Using "seek" or "tell" or
       other file operations may be non-portable.  If you use "binmode" on a file, however, you can usually
       "seek" and "tell" with arbitrary values in safety.

       A common misconception in socket programming is that "\n" eq "\012" everywhere.  When using protocols
       such as common Internet protocols, "\012" and "\015" are called for specifically, and the values of
       the logical "\n" and "\r" (carriage return) are not reliable.

           print SOCKET "Hi there, client!\r\n";      # WRONG
           print SOCKET "Hi there, client!\015\012";  # RIGHT

       However, using "\015\012" (or "\cM\cJ", or "\x0D\x0A") can be tedious and unsightly, as well as con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fusing&nbsp;confusing</font>
       fusing to those maintaining the code.  As such, the Socket module supplies the Right Thing for those
       who want it.

           use Socket qw(:DEFAULT :crlf);
           print SOCKET "Hi there, client!$CRLF"      # RIGHT

       When reading from a socket, remember that the default input record separator $/ is "\n", but robust
       socket code will recognize as either "\012" or "\015\012" as end of line:

           while (&lt;SOCKET&gt;) {
               # ...
           }

       Because both CRLF and LF end in LF, the input record separator can be set to LF and any CR stripped
       later.  Better to write:

           use Socket qw(:DEFAULT :crlf);
           local($/) = LF;      # not needed if $/ is already \012

           while (&lt;SOCKET&gt;) {
               s/$CR?$LF/\n/;   # not sure if socket uses LF or CRLF, OK
           #   s/\015?\012/\n/; # same thing
           }

       This example is preferred over the previous one--even for Unix platforms--because now any "\015"'s
       ("\cM"'s) are stripped out (and there was much rejoicing).

       Similarly, functions that return text data--such as a function that fetches a web page--should some-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">times&nbsp;sometimes</font>
       times translate newlines before returning the data, if they've not yet been translated to the local
       newline representation.  A single line of code will often suffice:

           $data =~ s/\015?\012/\n/g;
           return $data;

       Some of this may be confusing.  Here's a handy reference to the ASCII CR and LF characters.  You can
       print it out and stick it in your wallet.

           LF  eq  \012  eq  \x0A  eq  \cJ  eq  <!-- a -->chr(10)<!-- /a -->  eq  ASCII 10
           CR  eq  \015  eq  \x0D  eq  \cM  eq  <!-- a -->chr(13)<!-- /a -->  eq  ASCII 13

                    | Unix | DOS  | Mac  |
               ---------------------------<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">\n&nbsp;--------------------------\n</font>
               \n   |  LF  |  LF  |  CR  |
               \r   |  CR  |  CR  |  LF  |
               \n * |  LF  | CRLF |  CR  |
               \r * |  CR  |  CR  |  LF  |
               ---------------------------<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">*&nbsp;--------------------------*</font>
               * text-mode STDIO

       The Unix column assumes that you are not accessing a serial line (like a tty) in canonical mode.  If
       you are, then CR on input becomes "\n", and "\n" on output becomes CRLF.

       These are just the most common definitions of "\n" and "\r" in Perl.  There may well be others.  For
       example, on an EBCDIC implementation such as z/OS (OS/390) or OS/400 (using the ILE, the PASE is
       ASCII-based) the above material is similar to "Unix" but the code numbers change:

           LF  eq  \025  eq  \x15  eq  \cU  eq  <!-- a -->chr(21)<!-- /a -->  eq  CP-1047 21
           LF  eq  \045  eq  \x25  eq           <!-- a -->chr(37)<!-- /a -->  eq  CP-0037 37
           CR  eq  \015  eq  \x0D  eq  \cM  eq  <!-- a -->chr(13)<!-- /a -->  eq  CP-1047 13
           CR  eq  \015  eq  \x0D  eq  \cM  eq  <!-- a -->chr(13)<!-- /a -->  eq  CP-0037 13

                    | z/OS | OS/400 |
               ----------------------<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">\n&nbsp;---------------------\n</font>
               \n   |  LF  |  LF    |
               \r   |  CR  |  CR    |
               \n * |  LF  |  LF    |
               \r * |  CR  |  CR    |
               ----------------------<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">*&nbsp;---------------------*</font>
               * text-mode STDIO

       <b>Numbers</b> <b>endianness</b> <b>and</b> <b>Width</b>

       Different CPUs store integers and floating point numbers in different orders (called <u>endianness</u>) and
       widths (32-bit and 64-bit being the most common today).  This affects your programs when they attempt
       to transfer numbers in binary format from one CPU architecture to another, usually either "live" via
       network connection, or by storing the numbers to secondary storage such as a disk file or tape.

       Conflicting storage orders make utter mess out of the numbers.  If a little-endian host (Intel, VAX)
       stores 0x12345678 (305419896 in decimal), a big-endian host (Motorola, Sparc, PA) reads it as
       0x78563412 (2018915346 in decimal).  Alpha and MIPS can be either: Digital/Compaq used/uses them in
       little-endian mode; SGI/Cray uses them in big-endian mode.  To avoid this problem in network (socket)
       connections use the "pack" and "unpack" formats "n" and "N", the "network" orders.  These are guaran-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">teed&nbsp;guaranteed</font>
       teed to be portable.

       As of perl 5.8.5, you can also use the "&gt;" and "&lt;" modifiers to force big- or little-endian
       byte-order.  This is useful if you want to store signed integers or 64-bit integers, for example.

       You can explore the endianness of your platform by unpacking a data structure packed in native format
       such as:

           print unpack("h*", pack("s2", 1, 2)), "\n";
           # '10002000' on e.g. Intel x86 or Alpha 21064 in little-endian mode
           # '00100020' on e.g. Motorola 68040

       If you need to distinguish between endian architectures you could use either of the variables set
       like so:

           $is_big_endian   = unpack("h*", pack("s", 1)) =~ /01/;
           $is_little_endian = unpack("h*", pack("s", 1)) =~ /^1/;

       Differing widths can cause truncation even between platforms of equal endianness.  The platform of
       shorter width loses the upper parts of the number.  There is no good solution for this problem except
       to avoid transferring or storing raw binary numbers.

       One can circumnavigate both these problems in two ways.  Either transfer and store numbers always in
       text format, instead of raw binary, or else consider using modules like Data::Dumper (included in the
       standard distribution as of Perl 5.005) and Storable (included as of perl 5.8).  Keeping all data as
       text significantly simplifies matters.

       The v-strings are portable only up to v2147483647 (0x7FFFFFFF), that's how far EBCDIC, or more pre-
       cisely UTF-EBCDIC will go.

       <b>Files</b> <b>and</b> <b>Filesystems</b>

       Most platforms these days structure files in a hierarchical fashion.  So, it is reasonably safe to
       assume that all platforms support the notion of a "path" to uniquely identify a file on the system.
       How that path is really written, though, differs considerably.

       Although similar, file path specifications differ between Unix, Windows, Mac OS, OS/2, VMS, VOS,
       RISC OS, and probably others.  Unix, for example, is one of the few OSes that has the elegant idea of
       a single root directory.

       DOS, OS/2, VMS, VOS, and Windows can work similarly to Unix with "/" as path separator, or in their
       own idiosyncratic ways (such as having several root directories and various "unrooted" device files
       such NIL: and LPT:).

       Mac OS uses ":" as a path separator instead of "/".

       The filesystem may support neither hard links ("link") nor symbolic links ("symlink", "readlink",
       "lstat").

       The filesystem may support neither access timestamp nor change timestamp (meaning that about the only
       portable timestamp is the modification timestamp), or one second granularity of any timestamps (e.g.
       the FAT filesystem limits the time granularity to two seconds).

       The "inode change timestamp" (the "-C" filetest) may really be the "creation timestamp" (which it is
       not in UNIX).

       VOS perl can emulate Unix filenames with "/" as path separator.  The native pathname characters
       greater-than, less-than, number-sign, and percent-sign are always accepted.

       RISC OS perl can emulate Unix filenames with "/" as path separator, or go native and use "." for path
       separator and ":" to signal filesystems and disk names.

       Don't assume UNIX filesystem access semantics: that read, write, and execute are all the permissions
       there are, and even if they exist, that their semantics (for example what do r, w, and x mean on a
       directory) are the UNIX ones.  The various UNIX/POSIX compatibility layers usually try to make inter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">faces&nbsp;interfaces</font>
       faces like <u>chmod()</u> work, but sometimes there simply is no good mapping.

       If all this is intimidating, have no (well, maybe only a little) fear.  There are modules that can
       help.  The File::Spec modules provide methods to do the Right Thing on whatever platform happens to
       be running the program.

           use File::Spec::Functions;
           chdir(updir());        # go up one directory
           $file = catfile(curdir(), 'temp', 'file.txt');
           # on Unix and Win32, './temp/file.txt'
           # on Mac OS, ':temp:file.txt'
           # on VMS, '[.temp]file.txt'

       File::Spec is available in the standard distribution as of version 5.004_05.  File::Spec::Functions
       is only in File::Spec 0.7 and later, and some versions of perl come with version 0.6.  If File::Spec
       is not updated to 0.7 or later, you must use the object-oriented interface from File::Spec (or
       upgrade File::Spec).

       In general, production code should not have file paths hardcoded.  Making them user-supplied or read
       from a configuration file is better, keeping in mind that file path syntax varies on different
       machines.

       This is especially noticeable in scripts like Makefiles and test suites, which often assume "/" as a
       path separator for subdirectories.

       Also of use is File::Basename from the standard distribution, which splits a pathname into pieces
       (base filename, full path to directory, and file suffix).

       Even when on a single platform (if you can call Unix a single platform), remember not to count on the
       existence or the contents of particular system-specific files or directories, like <u>/etc/passwd</u>,
       <u>/etc/sendmail.conf</u>, <u>/etc/resolv.conf</u>, or even <u>/tmp/</u>.  For example, <u>/etc/passwd</u> may exist but not con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tain&nbsp;contain</font>
       tain the encrypted passwords, because the system is using some form of enhanced security.  Or it may
       not contain all the accounts, because the system is using NIS.  If code does need to rely on such a
       file, include a description of the file and its format in the code's documentation, then make it easy
       for the user to override the default location of the file.

       Don't assume a text file will end with a newline.  They should, but people forget.

       Do not have two files or directories of the same name with different case, like <u>test.pl</u> and <u>Test.pl</u>,
       as many platforms have case-insensitive (or at least case-forgiving) filenames.  Also, try not to
       have non-word characters (except for ".") in the names, and keep them to the 8.3 convention, for max-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">imum&nbsp;maximum</font>
       imum portability, onerous a burden though this may appear.

       Likewise, when using the AutoSplit module, try to keep your functions to 8.3 naming and case-insensi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tive&nbsp;case-insensitive</font>
       tive conventions; or, at the least, make it so the resulting files have a unique (case-insensitively)
       first 8 characters.

       Whitespace in filenames is tolerated on most systems, but not all, and even on systems where it might
       be tolerated, some utilities might become confused by such whitespace.

       Many systems (DOS, VMS) cannot have more than one "." in their filenames.

       Don't assume "&gt;" won't be the first character of a filename.  Always use "&lt;" explicitly to open a
       file for reading, or even better, use the three-arg version of open, unless you want the user to be
       able to specify a pipe open.

           open(FILE, '&lt;', $existing_file) or die $!;

       If filenames might use strange characters, it is safest to open it with "sysopen" instead of "open".
       "open" is magic and can translate characters like "&gt;", "&lt;", and "|", which may be the wrong thing to
       do.  (Sometimes, though, it's the right thing.)  Three-arg open can also help protect against this
       translation in cases where it is undesirable.

       Don't use ":" as a part of a filename since many systems use that for their own semantics (Mac OS
       Classic for separating pathname components, many networking schemes and utilities for separating the
       nodename and the pathname, and so on).  For the same reasons, avoid "@", ";" and "|".

       Don't assume that in pathnames you can collapse two leading slashes "//" into one: some networking
       and clustering filesystems have special semantics for that.  Let the operating system to sort it out.

       The <u>portable</u> <u>filename</u> <u>characters</u> as defined by ANSI C are

        a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r t u v w x y z
        A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R T U V W X Y Z
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
        . _ -

       and the "-" shouldn't be the first character.  If you want to be hypercorrect, stay case-insensitive
       and within the 8.3 naming convention (all the files and directories have to be unique within one
       directory if their names are lowercased and truncated to eight characters before the ".", if any, and
       to three characters after the ".", if any).  (And do not use "."s in directory names.)

       <b>System</b> <b>Interaction</b>

       Not all platforms provide a command line.  These are usually platforms that rely primarily on a
       Graphical User Interface (GUI) for user interaction.  A program requiring a command line interface
       might not work everywhere.  This is probably for the user of the program to deal with, so don't stay
       up late worrying about it.

       Some platforms can't delete or rename files held open by the system, this limitation may also apply
       to changing filesystem metainformation like file permissions or owners.  Remember to "close" files
       when you are done with them.  Don't "unlink" or "rename" an open file.  Don't "tie" or "open" a file
       already tied or opened; "untie" or "close" it first.

       Don't open the same file more than once at a time for writing, as some operating systems put manda-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tory&nbsp;mandatory</font>
       tory locks on such files.

       Don't assume that write/modify permission on a directory gives the right to add or delete
       files/directories in that directory.  That is filesystem specific: in some filesystems you need
       write/modify permission also (or even just) in the file/directory itself.  In some filesystems (AFS,
       DFS) the permission to add/delete directory entries is a completely separate permission.

       Don't assume that a single "unlink" completely gets rid of the file: some filesystems (most notably
       the ones in VMS) have versioned filesystems, and <u>unlink()</u> removes only the most recent one (it
       doesn't remove all the versions because by default the native tools on those platforms remove just
       the most recent version, too).  The portable idiom to remove all the versions of a file is

           1 while unlink "file";

       This will terminate if the file is undeleteable for some reason (protected, not there, and so on).

       Don't count on a specific environment variable existing in %ENV.  Don't count on %ENV entries being
       case-sensitive, or even case-preserving.  Don't try to clear %ENV by saying "%ENV = ();", or, if you
       really have to, make it conditional on "$^O ne 'VMS'" since in VMS the %ENV table is much more than a
       per-process key-value string table.

       Don't count on signals or %SIG for anything.

       Don't count on filename globbing.  Use "opendir", "readdir", and "closedir" instead.

       Don't count on per-program environment variables, or per-program current directories.

       Don't count on specific values of $!, neither numeric nor especially the strings values-- users may
       switch their locales causing error messages to be translated into their languages.  If you can trust
       a POSIXish environment, you can portably use the symbols defined by the Errno module, like ENOENT.
       And don't trust on the values of $!  at all except immediately after a failed system call.

       <b>Command</b> <b>names</b> <b>versus</b> <b>file</b> <b>pathnames</b>

       Don't assume that the name used to invoke a command or program with "system" or "exec" can also be
       used to test for the existence of the file that holds the executable code for that command or pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">gram.&nbsp;program.</font>
       gram.  First, many systems have "internal" commands that are built-in to the shell or OS and while
       these commands can be invoked, there is no corresponding file.  Second, some operating systems (e.g.,
       Cygwin, DJGPP, OS/2, and VOS) have required suffixes for executable files; these suffixes are gener-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ally&nbsp;generally</font>
       ally permitted on the command name but are not required.  Thus, a command like "perl" might exist in
       a file named "perl", "perl.exe", or "perl.pm", depending on the operating system.  The variable
       "_exe" in the Config module holds the executable suffix, if any.  Third, the VMS port carefully sets
       up $^X and $Config{perlpath} so that no further processing is required.  This is just as well,
       because the matching regular expression used below would then have to deal with a possible trailing
       version number in the VMS file name.

       To convert $^X to a file pathname, taking account of the requirements of the various operating system
       possibilities, say:

         use Config;
         $thisperl = $^X;
         if ($^O ne 'VMS')
            {$thisperl .= $Config{_exe} unless $thisperl =~ m/$Config{_exe}$/i;}

       To convert $Config{perlpath} to a file pathname, say:

         use Config;
         $thisperl = $Config{perlpath};
         if ($^O ne 'VMS')
            {$thisperl .= $Config{_exe} unless $thisperl =~ m/$Config{_exe}$/i;}

       <b>Networking</b>

       Don't assume that you can reach the public Internet.

       Don't assume that there is only one way to get through firewalls to the public Internet.

       Don't assume that you can reach outside world through any other port than 80, or some web proxy.  ftp
       is blocked by many firewalls.

       Don't assume that you can send email by connecting to the local SMTP port.

       Don't assume that you can reach yourself or any node by the name 'localhost'.  The same goes for
       '127.0.0.1'.  You will have to try both.

       Don't assume that the host has only one network card, or that it can't bind to many virtual IP
       addresses.

       Don't assume a particular network device name.

       Don't assume a particular set of <u>ioctl()</u>s will work.

       Don't assume that you can ping hosts and get replies.

       Don't assume that any particular port (service) will respond.

       Don't assume that Sys::Hostname (or any other API or command) returns either a fully qualified host-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">name&nbsp;hostname</font>
       name or a non-qualified hostname: it all depends on how the system had been configured.  Also remem-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ber&nbsp;remember</font>
       ber things like DHCP and NAT-- the hostname you get back might not be very useful.

       All the above "don't":s may look daunting, and they are -- but the key is to degrade gracefully if
       one cannot reach the particular network service one wants.  Croaking or hanging do not look very pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fessional.&nbsp;professional.</font>
       fessional.

       <b>Interprocess</b> <b>Communication</b> <b>(IPC)</b>

       In general, don't directly access the system in code meant to be portable.  That means, no "system",
       "exec", "fork", "pipe", ``, "qx//", "open" with a "|", nor any of the other things that makes being a
       perl hacker worth being.

       Commands that launch external processes are generally supported on most platforms (though many of
       them do not support any type of forking).  The problem with using them arises from what you invoke
       them on.  External tools are often named differently on different platforms, may not be available in
       the same location, might accept different arguments, can behave differently, and often present their
       results in a platform-dependent way.  Thus, you should seldom depend on them to produce consistent
       results. (Then again, if you're calling <u>netstat</u> <u>-a</u>, you probably don't expect it to run on both Unix
       and CP/M.)

       One especially common bit of Perl code is opening a pipe to <b>sendmail</b>:

           open(MAIL, '|/usr/lib/sendmail -t')
               or die "cannot fork sendmail: $!";

       This is fine for systems programming when sendmail is known to be available.  But it is not fine for
       many non-Unix systems, and even some Unix systems that may not have sendmail installed.  If a porta-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ble&nbsp;portable</font>
       ble solution is needed, see the various distributions on CPAN that deal with it.  Mail::Mailer and
       Mail::Send in the MailTools distribution are commonly used, and provide several mailing methods,
       including mail, sendmail, and direct SMTP (via Net::SMTP) if a mail transfer agent is not available.
       Mail::Sendmail is a standalone module that provides simple, platform-independent mailing.

       The Unix System V IPC ("msg*(), sem*(), shm*()") is not available even on all Unix platforms.

       Do not use either the bare result of "pack("N", 10, 20, 30, 40)" or bare v-strings (such as
       "v10.20.30.40") to represent IPv4 addresses: both forms just pack the four bytes into network order.
       That this would be equal to the C language "in_addr" struct (which is what the socket code internally
       uses) is not guaranteed.  To be portable use the routines of the Socket extension, such as
       "inet_aton()", "inet_ntoa()", and "sockaddr_in()".

       The rule of thumb for portable code is: Do it all in portable Perl, or use a module (that may inter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nally&nbsp;internally</font>
       nally implement it with platform-specific code, but expose a common interface).

       <b>External</b> <b>Subroutines</b> <b>(XS)</b>

       XS code can usually be made to work with any platform, but dependent libraries, header files, etc.,
       might not be readily available or portable, or the XS code itself might be platform-specific, just as
       Perl code might be.  If the libraries and headers are portable, then it is normally reasonable to
       make sure the XS code is portable, too.

       A different type of portability issue arises when writing XS code: availability of a C compiler on
       the end-user's system.  C brings with it its own portability issues, and writing XS code will expose
       you to some of those.  Writing purely in Perl is an easier way to achieve portability.

       <b>Standard</b> <b>Modules</b>

       In general, the standard modules work across platforms.  Notable exceptions are the CPAN module
       (which currently makes connections to external programs that may not be available), platform-specific
       modules (like ExtUtils::MM_VMS), and DBM modules.

       There is no one DBM module available on all platforms.  SDBM_File and the others are generally avail-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able&nbsp;available</font>
       able on all Unix and DOSish ports, but not in MacPerl, where only NBDM_File and DB_File are avail-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able.&nbsp;available.</font>
       able.

       The good news is that at least some DBM module should be available, and AnyDBM_File will use which-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ever&nbsp;whichever</font>
       ever module it can find.  Of course, then the code needs to be fairly strict, dropping to the great-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">est&nbsp;greatest</font>
       est common factor (e.g., not exceeding 1K for each record), so that it will work with any DBM module.
       See AnyDBM_File for more details.

       <b>Time</b> <b>and</b> <b>Date</b>

       The system's notion of time of day and calendar date is controlled in widely different ways.  Don't
       assume the timezone is stored in $ENV{TZ}, and even if it is, don't assume that you can control the
       timezone through that variable.  Don't assume anything about the three-letter timezone abbreviations
       (for example that MST would be the Mountain Standard Time, it's been known to stand for Moscow Stan-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dard&nbsp;Standard</font>
       dard Time).  If you need to use timezones, express them in some unambiguous format like the exact
       number of minutes offset from UTC, or the POSIX timezone format.

       Don't assume that the epoch starts at 00:00:00, January 1, 1970, because that is OS- and implementa-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion-specific.&nbsp;implementation-specific.</font>
       tion-specific.  It is better to store a date in an unambiguous representation.  The ISO 8601 standard
       defines YYYY-MM-DD as the date format, or YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS (that's a literal "T" separating the
       date from the time).  Please do use the ISO 8601 instead of making us to guess what date 02/03/04
       might be.  ISO 8601 even sorts nicely as-is.  A text representation (like "1987-12-18") can be easily
       converted into an OS-specific value using a module like Date::Parse.  An array of values, such as
       those returned by "localtime", can be converted to an OS-specific representation using Time::Local.

       When calculating specific times, such as for tests in time or date modules, it may be appropriate to
       calculate an offset for the epoch.

           require Time::Local;
           $offset = Time::Local::timegm(0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 70);

       The value for $offset in Unix will be 0, but in Mac OS will be some large number.  $offset can then
       be added to a Unix time value to get what should be the proper value on any system.

       On Windows (at least), you shouldn't pass a negative value to "gmtime" or "localtime".

       <b>Character</b> <b>sets</b> <b>and</b> <b>character</b> <b>encoding</b>

       Assume very little about character sets.

       Assume nothing about numerical values ("ord", "chr") of characters.  Do not use explicit code point
       ranges (like \xHH-\xHH); use for example symbolic character classes like "[:print:]".

       Do not assume that the alphabetic characters are encoded contiguously (in the numeric sense).  There
       may be gaps.

       Do not assume anything about the ordering of the characters.  The lowercase letters may come before
       or after the uppercase letters; the lowercase and uppercase may be interlaced so that both "a" and
       "A" come before "b"; the accented and other international characters may be interlaced so that ae
       comes before "b".

       <b>Internationalisation</b>

       If you may assume POSIX (a rather large assumption), you may read more about the POSIX locale system
       from perllocale.  The locale system at least attempts to make things a little bit more portable, or
       at least more convenient and native-friendly for non-English users.  The system affects character
       sets and encoding, and date and time formatting--amongst other things.

       If you really want to be international, you should consider Unicode.  See perluniintro and perluni-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">code&nbsp;perlunicode</font>
       code for more information.

       If you want to use non-ASCII bytes (outside the bytes 0x00..0x7f) in the "source code" of your code,
       to be portable you have to be explicit about what bytes they are.  Someone might for example be using
       your code under a UTF-8 locale, in which case random native bytes might be illegal ("Malformed UTF-8
       ...")  This means that for example embedding ISO 8859-1 bytes beyond 0x7f into your strings might
       cause trouble later.  If the bytes are native 8-bit bytes, you can use the "bytes" pragma.  If the
       bytes are in a string (regular expression being a curious string), you can often also use the "\xHH"
       notation instead of embedding the bytes as-is.  If they are in some particular legacy encoding (ether
       single-byte or something more complicated), you can use the "encoding" pragma.  (If you want to write
       your code in UTF-8, you can use either the "utf8" pragma, or the "encoding" pragma.)  The "bytes" and
       "utf8" pragmata are available since Perl 5.6.0, and the "encoding" pragma since Perl 5.8.0.

       <b>System</b> <b>Resources</b>

       If your code is destined for systems with severely constrained (or missing!) virtual memory systems
       then you want to be <u>especially</u> mindful of avoiding wasteful constructs such as:

           # NOTE: this is no longer "bad" in perl5.005
           for (0..10000000) {}                       # bad
           for (my $x = 0; $x &lt;= 10000000; ++$x) {}   # good

           @lines = &lt;VERY_LARGE_FILE&gt;;                # bad

           while (&lt;FILE&gt;) {$file .= $_}               # sometimes bad
           $file = join('', &lt;FILE&gt;);                  # better

       The last two constructs may appear unintuitive to most people.  The first repeatedly grows a string,
       whereas the second allocates a large chunk of memory in one go.  On some systems, the second is more
       efficient that the first.

       <b>Security</b>

       Most multi-user platforms provide basic levels of security, usually implemented at the filesystem
       level.  Some, however, do not-- unfortunately.  Thus the notion of user id, or "home" directory, or
       even the state of being logged-in, may be unrecognizable on many platforms.  If you write programs
       that are security-conscious, it is usually best to know what type of system you will be running under
       so that you can write code explicitly for that platform (or class of platforms).

       Don't assume the UNIX filesystem access semantics: the operating system or the filesystem may be
       using some ACL systems, which are richer languages than the usual rwx.  Even if the rwx exist, their
       semantics might be different.

       (From security viewpoint testing for permissions before attempting to do something is silly anyway:
       if one tries this, there is potential for race conditions-- someone or something might change the
       permissions between the permissions check and the actual operation.  Just try the operation.)

       Don't assume the UNIX user and group semantics: especially, don't expect the $&lt; and $&gt; (or the $( and
       $)) to work for switching identities (or memberships).

       Don't assume set-uid and set-gid semantics. (And even if you do, think twice: set-uid and set-gid are
       a known can of security worms.)

       <b>Style</b>

       For those times when it is necessary to have platform-specific code, consider keeping the platform-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">specific&nbsp;platformspecific</font>
       specific code in one place, making porting to other platforms easier.  Use the Config module and the
       special variable $^O to differentiate platforms, as described in "PLATFORMS".

       Be careful in the tests you supply with your module or programs.  Module code may be fully portable,
       but its tests might not be.  This often happens when tests spawn off other processes or call external
       programs to aid in the testing, or when (as noted above) the tests assume certain things about the
       filesystem and paths.  Be careful not to depend on a specific output style for errors, such as when
       checking $! after a failed system call.  Using $! for anything else than displaying it as output is
       doubtful (though see the Errno module for testing reasonably portably for error value). Some plat-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">forms&nbsp;platforms</font>
       forms expect a certain output format, and Perl on those platforms may have been adjusted accordingly.
       Most specifically, don't anchor a regex when testing an error value.

<b>CPAN</b> <b>Testers</b>
       Modules uploaded to CPAN are tested by a variety of volunteers on different platforms.  These CPAN
       testers are notified by mail of each new upload, and reply to the list with PASS, FAIL, NA (not
       applicable to this platform), or UNKNOWN (unknown), along with any relevant notations.

       The purpose of the testing is twofold: one, to help developers fix any problems in their code that
       crop up because of lack of testing on other platforms; two, to provide users with information about
       whether a given module works on a given platform.

       Also see:

          Mailing list: cpan-testers@perl.org

          Testing results: <a href="http://testers.cpan.org/">http://testers.cpan.org/</a>

<b>PLATFORMS</b>
       As of version 5.002, Perl is built with a $^O variable that indicates the operating system it was
       built on.  This was implemented to help speed up code that would otherwise have to "use Config" and
       use the value of $Config{osname}.  Of course, to get more detailed information about the system,
       looking into %Config is certainly recommended.

       %Config cannot always be trusted, however, because it was built at compile time.  If perl was built
       in one place, then transferred elsewhere, some values may be wrong.  The values may even have been
       edited after the fact.

       <b>Unix</b>

       Perl works on a bewildering variety of Unix and Unix-like platforms (see e.g. most of the files in
       the <u>hints/</u> directory in the source code kit).  On most of these systems, the value of $^O (hence
       $Config{'osname'}, too) is determined either by lowercasing and stripping punctuation from the first
       field of the string returned by typing "uname -a" (or a similar command) at the shell prompt or by
       testing the file system for the presence of uniquely named files such as a kernel or header file.
       Here, for example, are a few of the more popular Unix flavors:

           uname         $^O        $Config{'archname'}

       Because the value of $Config{archname} may depend on the hardware architecture, it can vary more than

       <b>DOS</b> <b>and</b> <b>Derivatives</b>

       Perl has long been ported to Intel-style microcomputers running under systems like PC-DOS, MS-DOS,
       OS/2, and most Windows platforms you can bring yourself to mention (except for Windows CE, if you
       count that).  Users familiar with <u>COMMAND.COM</u> or <u>CMD.EXE</u> style shells should be aware that each of
       these file specifications may have subtle differences:

           $filespec0 = "c:/foo/bar/file.txt";
           $filespec1 = "c:\\foo\\bar\\file.txt";
           $filespec2 = 'c:\foo\bar\file.txt';
           $filespec3 = 'c:\\foo\\bar\\file.txt';

       System calls accept either "/" or "\" as the path separator.  However, many command-line utilities of
       DOS vintage treat "/" as the option prefix, so may get confused by filenames containing "/".  Aside
       from calling any external programs, "/" will work just fine, and probably better, as it is more con-
       sistent with popular usage, and avoids the problem of remembering what to backwhack and what not to.

       The DOS FAT filesystem can accommodate only "8.3" style filenames.  Under the "case-insensitive, but
       case-preserving" HPFS (OS/2) and NTFS (NT) filesystems you may have to be careful about case returned
       with functions like "readdir" or used with functions like "open" or "opendir".

       DOS also treats several filenames as special, such as AUX, PRN, NUL, CON, COM1, LPT1, LPT2, etc.
       Unfortunately, sometimes these filenames won't even work if you include an explicit directory prefix.
       It is best to avoid such filenames, if you want your code to be portable to DOS and its derivatives.
       It's hard to know what these all are, unfortunately.

       Users of these operating systems may also wish to make use of scripts such as <u>pl2bat.bat</u> or <u>pl2cmd</u> to
       put wrappers around your scripts.

       Newline ("\n") is translated as "\015\012" by STDIO when reading from and writing to files (see "New-
       lines").  "binmode(FILEHANDLE)" will keep "\n" translated as "\012" for that filehandle.  Since it is
       a no-op on other systems, "binmode" should be used for cross-platform code that deals with binary
       data.  That's assuming you realize in advance that your data is in binary.  General-purpose programs
       should often assume nothing about their data.

       The $^O variable and the $Config{archname} values for various DOSish perls are as follows:

            OS            $^O      $Config{archname}   ID    Version
            --------------------------------------------------------

       The various MSWin32 Perl's can distinguish the OS they are running on via the value of the fifth ele-
       ment of the list returned from <u>Win32::GetOSVersion()</u>.  For example:

           if ($^O eq 'MSWin32') {
               my @os_version_info = Win32::GetOSVersion();
               print +('3.1','95','NT')[$os_version_info[4]],"\n";
           }

       There are also <u>Win32::IsWinNT()</u> and <u>Win32::IsWin95()</u>, try "perldoc Win32", and as of libwin32 0.19
       (not part of the core Perl distribution) <u>Win32::GetOSName()</u>.  The very portable <u>POSIX::uname()</u> will
       work too:

           c:\&gt; perl -MPOSIX -we "print join '|', uname"
           Windows NT|moonru|5.0|Build 2195 (Service Pack 2)|x86

       <b>Mac</b> <b>OS</b>

       Any module requiring XS compilation is right out for most people, because MacPerl is built using non-
       free (and non-cheap!) compilers.  Some XS modules that can work with MacPerl are built and distrib-
       uted in binary form on CPAN.

       Directories are specified as:

           volume:folder:file              for absolute pathnames
           volume:folder:                  for absolute pathnames
           :folder:file                    for relative pathnames
           :folder:                        for relative pathnames
           :file                           for relative pathnames
           file                            for relative pathnames

       Files are stored in the directory in alphabetical order.  Filenames are limited to 31 characters, and
       may include any character except for null and ":", which is reserved as the path separator.

       Instead of "flock", see "FSpSetFLock" and "FSpRstFLock" in the Mac::Files module, or "chmod(0444,
       ...)" and "chmod(0666, ...)".

       In the MacPerl application, you can't run a program from the command line; programs that expect @ARGV
       to be populated can be edited with something like the following, which brings up a dialog box asking
       for the command line arguments.

           if (!@ARGV) {
               @ARGV = split /\s+/, MacPerl::Ask('Arguments?');
           }

       A MacPerl script saved as a "droplet" will populate @ARGV with the full pathnames of the files
       dropped onto the script.

       Mac users can run programs under a type of command line interface under MPW (Macintosh Programmer's
       Workshop, a free development environment from Apple).  MacPerl was first introduced as an MPW tool,
       and MPW can be used like a shell:

           perl myscript.plx some arguments

       ToolServer is another app from Apple that provides access to MPW tools from MPW and the MacPerl app,
       which allows MacPerl programs to use "system", backticks, and piped "open".

       "Mac OS" is the proper name for the operating system, but the value in $^O is "MacOS".  To determine
       architecture, version, or whether the application or MPW tool version is running, check:

           $is_app    = $MacPerl::Version =~ /App/;
           $is_tool   = $MacPerl::Version =~ /MPW/;
           ($version) = $MacPerl::Version =~ /^(\S+)/;
           $is_ppc    = $MacPerl::Architecture eq 'MacPPC';
           $is_68k    = $MacPerl::Architecture eq 'Mac68K';

       Mac OS X, based on NeXT's OpenStep OS, runs MacPerl natively, under the "Classic" environment.  There
       is no "Carbon" version of MacPerl to run under the primary Mac OS X environment.  Mac OS X and its
       Open Source version, Darwin, both run Unix perl natively.

       <b>VMS</b>

       Perl on VMS is discussed in perlvms in the perl distribution.  Perl on VMS can accept either VMS- or
       Unix-style file specifications as in either of the following:

           $ perl -ne "print if /perl_setup/i" SYS$LOGIN:LOGIN.COM
           $ perl -ne "print if /perl_setup/i" /sys$login/login.com

       but not a mixture of both as in:

           $ perl -ne "print if /perl_setup/i" sys$login:/login.com
           Can't open sys$login:/login.com: file specification syntax error

       Interacting with Perl from the Digital Command Language (DCL) shell often requires a different set of
       quotation marks than Unix shells do.  For example:

           $ perl -e "print ""Hello, world.\n"""
           Hello, world.

       There are several ways to wrap your perl scripts in DCL <u>.COM</u> files, if you are so inclined.  For
       example:

           $ write sys$output "Hello from DCL!"
           $ if p1 .eqs. ""
           $ then perl -x 'f$environment("PROCEDURE")
           $ else perl -x - 'p1 'p2 'p3 'p4 'p5 'p6 'p7 'p8
           $ deck/dollars="__END__"
           #!/usr/bin/perl

           print "Hello from Perl!\n";

           __END__
           $ endif

       Do take care with "$ ASSIGN/nolog/user SYS$COMMAND: SYS$INPUT" if your perl-in-DCL script expects to
       do things like "$read = &lt;STDIN&gt;;".

       Filenames are in the format "name.extension;version".  The maximum length for filenames is 39 charac-
       ters, and the maximum length for extensions is also 39 characters.  Version is a number from 1 to
       32767.  Valid characters are "/[A-Z0-9$_-]/".

       VMS's RMS filesystem is case-insensitive and does not preserve case.  "readdir" returns lowercased
       filenames, but specifying a file for opening remains case-insensitive.  Files without extensions have
       a trailing period on them, so doing a "readdir" with a file named <u>A.;5</u> will return <u>a.</u> (though that
       file could be opened with "open(FH, 'A')").

       RMS had an eight level limit on directory depths from any rooted logical (allowing 16 levels overall)
       prior to VMS 7.2.  Hence "PERL_ROOT:[LIB.2.3.4.5.6.7.8]" is a valid directory specification but
       "PERL_ROOT:[LIB.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9]" is not.  <u>Makefile.PL</u> authors might have to take this into account,
       but at least they can refer to the former as "/PERL_ROOT/lib/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/".

       The VMS::Filespec module, which gets installed as part of the build process on VMS, is a pure Perl
       module that can easily be installed on non-VMS platforms and can be helpful for conversions to and
       from RMS native formats.

       What "\n" represents depends on the type of file opened.  It usually represents "\012" but it could
       also be "\015", "\012", "\015\012", "\000", "\040", or nothing depending on the file organization and
       record format.  The VMS::Stdio module provides access to the special <u>fopen()</u> requirements of files
       with unusual attributes on VMS.

       TCP/IP stacks are optional on VMS, so socket routines might not be implemented.  UDP sockets may not
       be supported.

       The value of $^O on OpenVMS is "VMS".  To determine the architecture that you are running on without
       resorting to loading all of %Config you can examine the content of the @INC array like so:

           if (grep(/VMS_AXP/, @INC)) {
               print "I'm on Alpha!\n";

           } elsif (grep(/VMS_VAX/, @INC)) {
               print "I'm on VAX!\n";

           } else {
               print "I'm not so sure about where $^O is...\n";
           }

       On VMS, perl determines the UTC offset from the "SYS$TIMEZONE_DIFFERENTIAL" logical name.  Although
       the VMS epoch began at 17-NOV-1858 00:00:00.00, calls to "localtime" are adjusted to count offsets
       from 01-JAN-1970 00:00:00.00, just like Unix.

       <b>VOS</b>

       Perl on VOS is discussed in <u>README.vos</u> in the perl distribution (installed as perlvos).  Perl on VOS
       can accept either VOS- or Unix-style file specifications as in either of the following:

           C&lt;&lt; $ perl -ne "print if /perl_setup/i" &gt;system&gt;notices &gt;&gt;
           C&lt;&lt; $ perl -ne "print if /perl_setup/i" /system/notices &gt;&gt;

       or even a mixture of both as in:

           C&lt;&lt; $ perl -ne "print if /perl_setup/i" &gt;system/notices &gt;&gt;

       Even though VOS allows the slash character to appear in object names, because the VOS port of Perl
       interprets it as a pathname delimiting character, VOS files, directories, or links whose names con-
       tain a slash character cannot be processed.  Such files must be renamed before they can be processed
       by Perl.  Note that VOS limits file names to 32 or fewer characters.

       Perl on VOS can be built using two different compilers and two different versions of the POSIX run-
       time.  The recommended method for building full Perl is with the GNU C compiler and the generally-
       available version of VOS POSIX support.  See <u>README.vos</u> (installed as perlvos) for restrictions that
       apply when Perl is built using the VOS Standard C compiler or the alpha version of VOS POSIX support.

       The value of $^O on VOS is "VOS".  To determine the architecture that you are running on without
       resorting to loading all of %Config you can examine the content of the @INC array like so:

           if ($^O =~ /VOS/) {
               print "I'm on a Stratus box!\n";
           } else {
               print "I'm not on a Stratus box!\n";
               die;
           }

           if (grep(/860/, @INC)) {
               print "This box is a Stratus XA/R!\n";

           } elsif (grep(/7100/, @INC)) {
               print "This box is a Stratus HP 7100 or 8xxx!\n";

           } elsif (grep(/8000/, @INC)) {
               print "This box is a Stratus HP 8xxx!\n";

           } else {
               print "This box is a Stratus 68K!\n";

       <b>EBCDIC</b> <b>Platforms</b>

       Recent versions of Perl have been ported to platforms such as OS/400 on AS/400 minicomputers as well
       as OS/390, VM/ESA, and BS2000 for S/390 Mainframes.  Such computers use EBCDIC character sets inter-
       nally (usually Character Code Set ID 0037 for OS/400 and either 1047 or POSIX-BC for S/390 systems).
       On the mainframe perl currently works under the "Unix system services for OS/390" (formerly known as
       OpenEdition), VM/ESA OpenEdition, or the BS200 POSIX-BC system (BS2000 is supported in perl 5.6 and
       greater).  See perlos390 for details.  Note that for OS/400 there is also a port of Perl 5.8.1/5.9.0
       or later to the PASE which is ASCII-based (as opposed to ILE which is EBCDIC-based), see perlos400.

       As of R2.5 of USS for OS/390 and Version 2.3 of VM/ESA these Unix sub-systems do not support the "#!"
       shebang trick for script invocation.  Hence, on OS/390 and VM/ESA perl scripts can be executed with a
       header similar to the following simple script:

           : # use perl
               eval 'exec /usr/local/bin/perl -S $0 ${1+"$@"}'
                   if 0;
           #!/usr/local/bin/perl     # just a comment really

           print "Hello from perl!\n";

       OS/390 will support the "#!" shebang trick in release 2.8 and beyond.  Calls to "system" and back-
       ticks can use POSIX shell syntax on all S/390 systems.

       On the AS/400, if PERL5 is in your library list, you may need to wrap your perl scripts in a CL pro-
       cedure to invoke them like so:

           BEGIN
             CALL PGM(PERL5/PERL) PARM('/QOpenSys/hello.pl')
           ENDPGM

       This will invoke the perl script <u>hello.pl</u> in the root of the QOpenSys file system.  On the AS/400
       calls to "system" or backticks must use CL syntax.

       On these platforms, bear in mind that the EBCDIC character set may have an effect on what happens
       with some perl functions (such as "chr", "pack", "print", "printf", "ord", "sort", "sprintf",
       "unpack"), as well as bit-fiddling with ASCII constants using operators like "^", "&amp;" and "|", not to
       mention dealing with socket interfaces to ASCII computers (see "Newlines").

       Fortunately, most web servers for the mainframe will correctly translate the "\n" in the following
       statement to its ASCII equivalent ("\r" is the same under both Unix and OS/390 &amp; VM/ESA):

           print "Content-type: text/html\r\n\r\n";

       The values of $^O on some of these platforms includes:

           uname         $^O        $Config{'archname'}
           --------------------------------------------
           OS/390        os390      os390
           OS400         os400      os400
           POSIX-BC      posix-bc   BS2000-posix-bc
           VM/ESA        vmesa      vmesa

       Some simple tricks for determining if you are running on an EBCDIC platform could include any of the
       following (perhaps all):

       One thing you may not want to rely on is the EBCDIC encoding of punctuation characters since these
       may differ from code page to code page (and once your module or script is rumoured to work with
       EBCDIC, folks will want it to work with all EBCDIC character sets).

       <b>Acorn</b> <b>RISC</b> <b>OS</b>

       Because Acorns use ASCII with newlines ("\n") in text files as "\012" like Unix, and because Unix
       filename emulation is turned on by default, most simple scripts will probably work "out of the box".
       The native filesystem is modular, and individual filesystems are free to be case-sensitive or insen-
       sitive, and are usually case-preserving.  Some native filesystems have name length limits, which file
       and directory names are silently truncated to fit.  Scripts should be aware that the standard
       filesystem currently has a name length limit of <b>10</b> characters, with up to 77 items in a directory,
       but other filesystems may not impose such limitations.

       Native filenames are of the form

           Filesystem#Special_Field::DiskName.$.Directory.Directory.File

       where

           Special_Field is not usually present, but may contain . and $ .
           Filesystem =~ m|[A-Za-z0-9_]|
           DsicName   =~ m|[A-Za-z0-9_/]|
           $ represents the root directory
           . is the path separator
           @ is the current directory (per filesystem but machine global)
           ^ is the parent directory
           Directory and File =~ m|[^\0- "\.\$\%\&amp;:\@\\^\|\177]+|

       The default filename translation is roughly "tr|/.|./|;"

       Note that ""ADFS::HardDisk.$.File" ne 'ADFS::HardDisk.$.File'" and that the second stage of "$"
       interpolation in regular expressions will fall foul of the $. if scripts are not careful.

       Logical paths specified by system variables containing comma-separated search lists are also allowed;
       hence "System:Modules" is a valid filename, and the filesystem will prefix "Modules" with each sec-
       tion of "System$Path" until a name is made that points to an object on disk.  Writing to a new file
       "System:Modules" would be allowed only if "System$Path" contains a single item list.  The filesystem
       will also expand system variables in filenames if enclosed in angle brackets, so "&lt;System$Dir&gt;.Mod-
       ules" would look for the file "$ENV{'System$Dir'} . 'Modules'".  The obvious implication of this is
       that <b>fully</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>filenames</b> <b>can</b> <b>start</b> <b>with</b> <b>"&lt;&gt;"</b> and should be protected when "open" is used for
       input.

       Because "." was in use as a directory separator and filenames could not be assumed to be unique after
       10 characters, Acorn implemented the C compiler to strip the trailing ".c" ".h" ".s" and ".o" suffix
       from filenames specified in source code and store the respective files in subdirectories named after
       the suffix.  Hence files are translated:

           foo.h           h.foo
           C:foo.h         C:h.foo        (logical path variable)
           sys/os.h        sys.h.os       (C compiler groks Unix-speak)
           10charname.c    c.10charname
           10charname.o    o.10charname
           11charname_.c   c.11charname   (assuming filesystem truncates at 10)

       The Unix emulation library's translation of filenames to native assumes that this sort of translation
       is required, and it allows a user-defined list of known suffixes that it will transpose in this fash-
       ion.  This may seem transparent, but consider that with these rules "foo/bar/baz.h" and
       "foo/bar/h/baz" both map to "foo.bar.h.baz", and that "readdir" and "glob" cannot and do not attempt
       to emulate the reverse mapping.  Other "."'s in filenames are translated to "/".

       As implied above, the environment accessed through %ENV is global, and the convention is that program
       specific environment variables are of the form "Program$Name".  Each filesystem maintains a current
       directory, and the current filesystem's current directory is the <b>global</b> current directory.  Conse-
       quently, sociable programs don't change the current directory but rely on full pathnames, and pro-
       grams (and Makefiles) cannot assume that they can spawn a child process which can change the current
       directory without affecting its parent (and everyone else for that matter).

       Because native operating system filehandles are global and are currently allocated down from 255,
       with 0 being a reserved value, the Unix emulation library emulates Unix filehandles.  Consequently,
       you can't rely on passing "STDIN", "STDOUT", or "STDERR" to your children.

       The desire of users to express filenames of the form "&lt;Foo$Dir&gt;.Bar" on the command line unquoted
       causes problems, too: `` command output capture has to perform a guessing game.  It assumes that a
       string "&lt;[^&lt;&gt;]+\$[^&lt;&gt;]&gt;" is a reference to an environment variable, whereas anything else involving
       "&lt;" or "&gt;" is redirection, and generally manages to be 99% right.  Of course, the problem remains
       that scripts cannot rely on any Unix tools being available, or that any tools found have Unix-like
       command line arguments.

       Extensions and XS are, in theory, buildable by anyone using free tools.  In practice, many don't, as
       users of the Acorn platform are used to binary distributions.  MakeMaker does run, but no available
       make currently copes with MakeMaker's makefiles; even if and when this should be fixed, the lack of a
       Unix-like shell will cause problems with makefile rules, especially lines of the form "cd sdbm &amp;&amp;
       make all", and anything using quoting.

       "RISC OS" is the proper name for the operating system, but the value in $^O is "riscos" (because we
       don't like shouting).

       <b>Other</b> <b>perls</b>

       Perl has been ported to many platforms that do not fit into any of the categories listed above.
       Some, such as AmigaOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, HP MPE/iX, QNX, Plan 9, and VOS, have been well-integrated
       into the standard Perl source code kit.  You may need to see the <u>ports/</u> directory on CPAN for infor-
       mation, and possibly binaries, for the likes of: aos, Atari ST, lynxos, riscos, Novell Netware, Tan-
       dem Guardian, <u>etc.</u>  (Yes, we know that some of these OSes may fall under the Unix category, but we
       are not a standards body.)

       Some approximate operating system names and their $^O values in the "OTHER" category include:

           OS            $^O        $Config{'archname'}

<b>FUNCTION</b> <b>IMPLEMENTATIONS</b>
       Listed below are functions that are either completely unimplemented or else have been implemented
       differently on various platforms.  Following each description will be, in parentheses, a list of
       platforms that the description applies to.

       The list may well be incomplete, or even wrong in some places.  When in doubt, consult the platform-
       specific README files in the Perl source distribution, and any other documentation resources accompa-
       nying a given port.

       Be aware, moreover, that even among Unix-ish systems there are variations.

       For many functions, you can also query %Config, exported by default from the Config module.  For
       example, to check whether the platform has the "lstat" call, check $Config{d_lstat}.  See Config for
       a full description of available variables.

       <b>Alphabetical</b> <b>Listing</b> <b>of</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>Functions</b>


       -X      "-r", "-w", and "-x" have a limited meaning only; directories and applications are exe-
               cutable, and there are no uid/gid considerations.  "-o" is not supported.  (Mac OS)

               "-r", "-w", "-x", and "-o" tell whether the file is accessible, which may not reflect UIC-
               based file protections.  (VMS)

               "-s" returns the size of the data fork, not the total size of data fork plus resource fork.
               (Mac OS).

               "-s" by name on an open file will return the space reserved on disk, rather than the current
               extent.  "-s" on an open filehandle returns the current size.  (RISC OS)

               "-R", "-W", "-X", "-O" are indistinguishable from "-r", "-w", "-x", "-o". (Mac OS, Win32,
               VMS, RISC OS)

               "-b", "-c", "-k", "-g", "-p", "-u", "-A" are not implemented.  (Mac OS)

               "-g", "-k", "-l", "-p", "-u", "-A" are not particularly meaningful.  (Win32, VMS, RISC OS)

               "-d" is true if passed a device spec without an explicit directory.  (VMS)

               "-T" and "-B" are implemented, but might misclassify Mac text files with foreign characters;
               this is the case will all platforms, but may affect Mac OS often.  (Mac OS)

               "-x" (or "-X") determine if a file ends in one of the executable suffixes.  "-S" is meaning-
               less.  (Win32)

               "-x" (or "-X") determine if a file has an executable file type.  (RISC OS)

               Does not automatically flush output handles on some platforms.  (SunOS, Solaris, HP-UX)

       exit    Emulates UNIX <u>exit()</u> (which considers "exit 1" to indicate an error) by mapping the 1 to
               SS$_ABORT (44).  This behavior may be overridden with the pragma "use vmsish 'exit'".  As
               with the CRTL's <u>exit()</u> function, "exit 0" is also mapped to an exit status of SS$_NORMAL (1);
               this mapping cannot be overridden.  Any other argument to <u>exit()</u> is used directly as Perl's
               exit status. (VMS)

               if $sig is 0 and the specified process exists, it returns true without actually terminating
               it. (Win32)

               Hard links are implemented on Win32 (Windows NT and Windows 2000) under NTFS only.

       localtime
               Because Perl currently relies on the native standard C <u>localtime()</u> function, it is only safe
               to use times between 0 and (2**31)-1.  Times outside this range may result in unexpected
               behavior depending on your operating system's implementation of <u>localtime()</u>.

       sysopen The traditional "0", "1", and "2" MODEs are implemented with different numeric values on some
               systems.  The flags exported by "Fcntl" (O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, O_RDWR) should work everywhere
               though.  (Mac OS, OS/390, VM/ESA)

       system  In general, do not assume the UNIX/POSIX semantics that you can shift $? right by eight to
               get the exit value, or that "$? &amp; 127" would give you the number of the signal that termi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nated&nbsp;terminated</font>
               nated the program, or that "$? &amp; 128" would test true if the program was terminated by a
               coredump.  Instead, use the POSIX W*() interfaces: for example, use WIFEXITED($?) and WEXIT-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">VALUE($?)&nbsp;WEXITVALUE($?)</font>
               VALUE($?) to test for a normal exit and the exit value, WIFSIGNALED($?) and WTERMSIG($?) for
               a signal exit and the signal.  Core dumping is not a portable concept, so there's no portable
               way to test for that.

               Only implemented if ToolServer is installed. (Mac OS)

               As an optimization, may not call the command shell specified in $ENV{PERL5SHELL}.  "system(1,
               @args)" spawns an external process and immediately returns its process designator, without
               waiting for it to terminate.  Return value may be used subsequently in "wait" or "waitpid".
               Failure to <u>spawn()</u> a subprocess is indicated by setting $? to "255 &lt;&lt; 8".  $? is set in a way
               compatible with Unix (i.e. the exitstatus of the subprocess is obtained by "$? &gt;&gt; 8", as
               described in the documentation).  (Win32)

               There is no shell to process metacharacters, and the native standard is to pass a command
               line terminated by "\n" "\r" or "\0" to the spawned program.  Redirection such as "&gt; foo" is
               performed (if at all) by the run time library of the spawned program.  "system" <u>list</u> will
               call the Unix emulation library's "exec" emulation, which attempts to provide emulation of
               the stdin, stdout, stderr in force in the parent, providing the child program uses a compati-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ble&nbsp;compatible</font>
               ble version of the emulation library.  <u>scalar</u> will call the native command line direct and no
               such emulation of a child Unix program will exists.  Mileage <b>will</b> vary.  (RISC OS)

               Far from being POSIX compliant.  Because there may be no underlying /bin/sh tries to work
               around the problem by forking and execing the first token in its argument string.  Handles
               basic redirection ("&lt;" or "&gt;") on its own behalf. (MiNT)

               Does not automatically flush output handles on some platforms.  (SunOS, Solaris, HP-UX)

               The return value is POSIX-like (shifted up by 8 bits), which only allows room for a made-up
               value derived from the severity bits of the native 32-bit condition code (unless overridden
               by "use vmsish 'status'").  For more details see "$?" in perlvms. (VMS)

       times   Only the first entry returned is nonzero. (Mac OS)

               "cumulative" times will be bogus.  On anything other than Windows NT or Windows 2000, "sys-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tem"&nbsp;"system"</font>
               tem" time will be bogus, and "user" time is actually the time returned by the <u>clock()</u> func-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;function</font>
               tion in the C runtime library. (Win32)

               Not useful. (RISC OS)

       truncate
               Not implemented. (Older versions of VMS)

               Truncation to zero-length only. (VOS)

               If a FILEHANDLE is supplied, it must be writable and opened in append mode (i.e., use
               "open(FH, '&gt;&gt;filename')" or "sysopen(FH,...,O_APPEND|O_RDWR)".  If a filename is supplied, it
               should not be held open elsewhere. (Win32)

       umask   Returns undef where unavailable, as of version 5.005.

               "umask" works but the correct permissions are set only when the file is finally closed. (Ami-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">gaOS)&nbsp;(AmigaOS)</font>
               gaOS)

       utime   Only the modification time is updated. (BeOS, Mac OS, VMS, RISC OS)

               May not behave as expected.  Behavior depends on the C runtime library's implementation of
               <u>utime()</u>, and the filesystem being used.  The FAT filesystem typically does not support an
               "access time" field, and it may limit timestamps to a granularity of two seconds. (Win32)

       wait
       waitpid Not implemented. (Mac OS, VOS)

               Can only be applied to process handles returned for processes spawned using "system(1, ...)"
               or pseudo processes created with "fork()". (Win32)

               Not useful. (RISC OS)

       The following platforms worked with the previous releases (5.6 and 5.7), but we did not manage either
       to fix or to test these in time for the 5.8.1 release.  There is a very good chance that many of
       these will work fine with the 5.8.1.

       The following platforms have been known to build Perl from source in the past (5.005_03 and earlier),
       but we haven't been able to verify their status for the current release, either because the hard-
       ware/software platforms are rare or because we don't have an active champion on these platforms--or
       both.  They used to work, though, so go ahead and try compiling them, and let perlbug@perl.org of any
       trouble.
