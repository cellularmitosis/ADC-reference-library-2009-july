The purpose of the reopen    application Apple event is to allow the application to provide    visual feedback to the user.</P>        <P>User testing has indicated that when a user double-clicks on an    application's icon, or in some other way causes the application to    be launched, they expect to see some visual feedback that the    application has in fact started and is ready for use. This visual    feedback is often a new untitled document window or a document    creation dialog when a document file has not been opened. Users    associate this feedback with the action of double-clicking on the    application icon.</P>        <P>It was discovered that when users double-clicked on the icon    for a running application, and there was no visual feedback from    the application (such as a document window or tool pallet), they    would often think that something was wrong because nothing    happened. Testing showed that the menu bar change (including the    application menu icon) when the running application came to the    front was not enough of a visual clue for novice users. They    didn't realize that the application whose icon they had just    opened was in the front ready for their use.</P>        <P>The idea behind sending the reopen application Apple event to the     running application is to let the application know that the user    has attempted to open it. When handling the reopen application    Apple event, the application has an opportunity to provide visual    feedback to the user. What the application does will depend on the    application itself, and on the current state of the application.    The action taken should also take into consideration any startup    options the user has set in the preferences for the    application.</P>        <P>In general, if no windows are open in the application, the    action taken should be similar to what happens when the open    application (<CODE>kAEOpenApplication == 'oapp'</CODE>) Apple    event is received after the application is launched. This could be    opening an untitled document, or perhaps displaying a document    creation dialog. If the application already has windows open -- be    they document, tool pallet, dialog, etc. -- this will most likely    be enough feedback and nothing further needs to be done.</P>        <P>Application frameworks should provide support for the reopen    application Apple event. In many cases, the framework will be able    to leverage the support it already provides for the open    application Apple event. It could, for example, provide a global    flag to indicate that the first Apple event has been handled at    application startup time. After the flag is set, the open    application Apple event handler would behave as the reopen    application Apple event handler.</P>    </td></tr></table></center><BR><BR><center><table border="0" width="600" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td align="left" scope="row">    <H4>Determining Item at Screen Location</H4>        <P>Finder 8 provides a mechanism which allows applications to    determine what icon or window, if any, is located at a particular point on    the screen.

The Finder event <CODE>'fopn'</CODE> contains the followingparameters:</P><UL><LI>A parameter with <CODE>keySelection</CODE> and<CODE>keyData</CODE> of object specifier for the selected item or an<CODE>AERecord</CODE> of object specifiers for the selected items (ifmore than one item is in the selection being opened).</li><LI>An optional parameter with the key <CODE>'APPL'</CODE> and<CODE>keyData</CODE> containing an object specifier for theapplication the Finder plans to use to open the documents. There aretwo different cases where this optional parameter will be present.First, when documents are dropped directly into an application, theapplication will appear in this parameter and the Finder will sendthe <CODE>'fopn'</CODE> Apple event only once. And second, if one ormore documents are double-clicked or opened from the file menu, thenthe Finder will send the <CODE>'fopn'</CODE> event twice, both timesspecifying the entire selection, once without the 'APPL' parameterand once with the 'APPL' parameter when the application Finder plansto use has been determined.</li></ul><P>Developers wishing to override the Finder's normal documenthandling behavior must install a global Apple Event handler for the<CODE>'fopn'</CODE> Apple event. Once installed, the handler candistinguish between the files it wishes to process and the files theFinder should process normally by returning a <CODE>Boolean</CODE>value in the reply event. A value of <CODE>true</CODE> in the<CODE>keyAEData</CODE> parameter of the reply tells the Finder todiscontinue all processing of the open request, and a value of<CODE>false</CODE> tells the Finder to continue processing the openrequest as it normally would.</P><P>If there are several documents in the selection being opened bythe Finder, it is possible that the documents will not be all of thesame type. As such, the entire group may not be appropriate for usein one particular application. In these cases, the Finder groups thedocuments by type and sends each group separately (first without the<CODE>'APPL'</CODE> parameter, and once with the <CODE>'APPL'</CODE>parameter). For example, if a selection contains both a SimpleTextdocument and a MoviePlayer document, then the Finder first sends a<CODE>'fopn'</CODE> event with the SimpleText document followed by a<CODE>'fopn'</CODE> event with both the SimpleText document and the<CODE>'APPL'</CODE> parameter referring to the applicationSimpleText. Finder would then repeat the same process for theMoviePlayer document using the MoviePlayer application in the<CODE>'APPL'</CODE> parameter. This behavior of the<CODE>'fopn'</CODE> Apple Event allows your handler to override theprocessing of particular document types while allowing the Finder toopen other documents in the normal way.</P></td></tr></table></center><BR><BR><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=4 width=500> <TR><td bgcolor="#e6e6e6" align=left><p><B>Note:</B><BR>Since the Finder discontinues all processing of documents ifthe global Apple Event handler for the <CODE>'fopn'</CODE> AppleEvent returns a <CODE>Boolean</CODE> value of <CODE>true</CODE>, anysuch handler should provide appropriate user feedback for anyexceptional circumstances that may arise while attempting to open thefiles (failed opens, insufficient memory, etc.)</p></TD></TR></TABLE></center><BR><BR><BR><BR><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=4 width=500> <TR><td bgcolor="#e6e6e6" align=left><p><B>Compatibility Note:</B><BR>This event is not present in the Finder's <CODE>AETE</CODE>   dictionary, and as such it is not officially supported by the   Finder and may not be present in future versions of the Finder.</p></TD></TR></TABLE></center><BR><BR><TABLE WIDTH="600" ALIGN="center">	<TR>		<td align="left"><H4>SendToSelf Apple Events</H4><P>Beginning with Finder 8, all Apple events are handled in separatethreads.

Theappearance of any of these new flavors attached to any drag item in a<CODE>DragReference</CODE> will direct the Finder to provide thefollowing behaviors when accepting the drag:</P><H4>Limiting Valid Drop Targets to the Trash</H4><P>Adding the <code>'fdtt'</code> (drag to trash) flavor to any item in a<CODE>DragReference</CODE> tells the Finder not to accept the draganywhere except to the Trash icon. No other icons of windows willhighlight. If the <code>'fdtt'</code> flavor appears anywhere in a<CODE>DragReference</CODE>, then it applies to all of the items inthe <CODE>DragReference</CODE>. The <code>'fdtt'</code> flavor providesan opportunity for applications to utilize the 'drag to trash' modelfor, say, allowing users to delete selections by dragging them to thetrash.  <code>'fdtt'</code> flavors do not contain any data.</P><H4>Disabling Finder Tracking Behavior</H4><P>Adding the <code>'fntb'</code> (no tracking behavior) flavor to any item in a<CODE>DragReference</CODE> instructs the Finder to ignore the dragentirely.  Neither windows or icons will highlight to accept drags, nor will anyspring-opening occur in the Finder when the <code>'fntb'</code> flavor is included ina <CODE>DragReference</CODE>.  If the <code>'fntb'</code> flavor appearsanywhere in a <CODE>DragReference</CODE>, then it applies to all ofthe items in the <CODE>DragReference</CODE>.  <code>'fntb'</code> flavorsdo not contain any data.</P><H4>Controlling Clipping File Names</H4><P>The <code>'clnm'</code> and <code>'clfn'</code> flavors have been added toprovide applications with better control over the naming of clippingfiles. These flavors are used by the Finder in the following stepsthat it uses to determine the name for a clipping file:</P><OL>   <LI>If the item contains a <code>'clnm'</code> flavor   (<CODE>flavorTypeClippingName</CODE>), then this value (a pascal   string) is used in the template "^0 clipping" to name the file.   This is the preferred method for new applications. Usually, the   application should provide the name of the document from which the   clipping was dragged.</li>      <LI>If the file name was not assigned in the above and the item   contains a <code>'clfn'</code> flavor, then this value (a pascal   string) is used as the complete file name.</li>      <LI>If the clipping file name was not established by either of the   above methods, then the flavors are examined in order until a   <code>'TEXT'</code>, <code>'PICT'</code>, or <code>'snd '</code> flavor is   found. If one of these flavors is found, then the clipping file is   named either "text clipping", "picture clipping", or "sound   clipping" respectively.</li>      <LI>as a last resort, the name "untitled clipping" is used.</li>      <LI>If the name assigned by the above steps is already in use,   then a number is appended to the name (or appended and incremented   until a unique name is established). Also, if the resulting name   is longer than 31 characters, the name is truncated in the middle   and an ellipsis is added. For example, "A Very Long Doc...   clipping 100".</li></OL><BR><BR><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=550><TR><td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><P><B>Note:</B><BR> Developers utilizing the <code>'fdtt'</code>, <code>'fntb'</code>,      <code>'clnm'</code>, and <code>'clfn'</code> flavors are not required      to create additional drag items to attach them to when      including them in a <CODE>DragReference</CODE>.

To avoid this condition developers can      place their temporary files in the "Cleanup at Startup" folder (type <code>'flnt'</code> )      who's contents are automatically deleted at system startup.

These file types   may be used as targets for AppleScripts.</li>      <LI>The AppleScript symbol table in version 1.1.1 and earlier   accommodated a maximum of 1,024 symbols. In version 1.1.2 this is   expanded to 4,096 symbols.</li></ul>       <P><B>Corrections:</B></P>     <UL>   <LI>Concatenating a record with an empty vector, e.g. {a:1, b:2}   &amp; {}, caused a crash in version 1.1.1. This is fixed in 1.1.2.</li>      <LI>Execution of an applet caused, under certain conditions,   memory location $0006 to be overwritten, causing incompatibility   problems with specific third party applications. Applets that are   reopened and saved with AppleScript 1.1.2 will no longer overwrite   this address.</li>      <LI>Multiple-character text item delimiters caused the machine to   hang in an infinite loop on operations like "count text items of"   and "text item 2 of". This has been fixed in AppleScript 1.1.2.</li>      <LI>In AppleScript 1.1.1, the test to see whether a script could   be reloaded into memory was faulty, and would not allow loading of   scripts that had been created and saved under identical   circumstances. This has been fixed in 1.1.2.</li>      <LI>Certain numbers (such as 1310.4) cannot be represented with   full accuracy as floating point numbers. AppleScript 1.1.1 was   displaying these numbers with too much precision, so compilation   and dec of "1310.4" returned "1310.400000000001". An   attempt has been made to fix some of these cases in AppleScript   1.1.2, and efforts are being made to remove this problem   altogether in AppleScript 1.2. NOTE that this change in behavior   may break some scripts that relied on the inaccurate numbers   returned by AppleScript 1.1.1, or require precision beyond the   12th significant digit.</li>      <LI>The method of locking handles holding scripting addition data   was not suited for re-entrance. This has been fixed in 1.1.2, so   that a scripting addition may be called while it is being called   by another process.</li>      <LI>The English syntax for AppleScript required the possessive   property form (for example: "AppleScript's version") to be   lower-case. AppleScript 1.1.2 allows an uppercase S (for example:   "APPLESCRIPT'S VERSION"), to be accepted. It also supports   case-insensitivity for "DOESN'T".</li>      <LI>In AppleScript 1.1.1, the bytecode Program Counter for the   runtime engine was left uninitialized, and a routine to set its   new value calculated the offset between the new value and the old.   In machines with &gt;768Mb of memory, this offset overflowed a   30-bit signed integer and resulted in a numeric overflow error,   preventing anything from being compiled. The program counter is   now initialized to 0, and the offset is not calculated when the PC   is 0, so this error should not happen in AppleScript 1.1.2 and   later.</li>      <LI>The month property of a date type should be one of {January,   February...} Setting this to a number mistakenly resulted in a   Stack Overflow error.

To   find the network printers, the assistant searches each available   AppleTalk port, starting with the default port, until one or more   supported printers are found. If network printers are found on any   port other than the default, AppleTalk is redirected to that port.<BR><BR>With the exception of Regional Preferences and Date/Time/DST,   no changes are made until the user selects "Go Ahead" at the end   of the interview. Any port change made during the network printer   search is undone if the user quits the assistant prior to   selecting "Go Ahead". If AppleTalk is turned on during the   interview but no AppleTalk dependent options are selected in the   interview, AppleTalk will be turned off after the interview is   completed and serial port connections will be unaffected.</li></UL><hr width=500 align=center><A NAME="DevUtil"></a><H2>Apple Developer Utilities</H2><P>Mac OS 8 requires updated copies of the followingApple Developer Utilities:</P><A NAME="debugger"></A><TABLE BORDER=0>   <TR>      <td width=46 align=left>         <img src="images/tn1102_073.gif" width=32 height=32 align=middle alt="Debugger">      </TD><td align="left">         <H4>MacsBug 6.5.4</H4>      </TD></TR></TABLE><BR><P>MacsBug is Apple's low level debugger providinginterface facilities for the disassembly and perusal of assembler andmachine level instructions.</P><BR><BR><center><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=550><TR><td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><P><B>Note:</B><BR>      MacsBug 6.5.4 or later should be used with Mac OS 8.      Versions of MacsBug earlier than 6.5.4 will not work with Mac      OS 8.</p>      </TD></TR></TABLE></center><BR>    <P>Related Materials:</P>      <UL>      <LI><a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/">MacsBug</A></li>   </UL><A NAME="syspicker"></A><TABLE BORDER=0>   <TR>      <td width=46 align=left>         <img src="images/tn1102_074.gif" width=32 height=32 align=middle alt="Syspicker">      </TD><td align="left">         <H4>System Picker 1.1</H4>      </TD></TR></TABLE><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH="600"><TR> <td align="left"> <P>System Picker is an Apple utility providing facilitiesfor switching the active system between different system foldersinstalled on a Mac OS compatible computer.</P><UL>   <LI>System Picker 1.0.1 does not work with Mac OS 8.
