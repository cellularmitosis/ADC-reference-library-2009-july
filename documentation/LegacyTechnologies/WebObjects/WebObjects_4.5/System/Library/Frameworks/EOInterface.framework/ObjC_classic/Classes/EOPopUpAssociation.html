They are described below.</p><br><h2>Selecting a String from a Static List</h2><p>Suppose you have a Movie display group and you want to providea pop-up list for setting the rating from a static list of strings.In this example, a Movie object's rating is a string propertyrather than a relationship to a Rating object. To do this, in InterfaceBuilder, type the list of ratings into the pop-up list. Control-draga connection from the pop-up list to the Movie display group. Choose EOPopUpAssociationin the Connections inspector, and bind the selectedTitle aspectto the "rating" key. With this configuration, if an object'sstring attribute value isn't in the pop-up list, it's temporarily addedwhile the object is selected.</p><br><h2>Selecting a String from a Dynamic List</h2><p>This example is similar to the previous one, except in thisexample, a Movie object's rating is chosen from strings in a Ratingdatabase table. There's a Rating EODisplayGroup that fetches theratings into Rating objects, and the pop-up list is filled fromthe "ratingString" property of the rating display group'sRating objects. To do this, in Interface Builder, control-drag aconnection from the pop-up list to the Ratings display group. ChooseEOPopUpAssociation in the Connections inspector, and bind the titlesaspect to the "ratingString" key. Similarly, control-drag aconnection from the pop-up list to the Movie display group. Againchoose EOComboBoxAssociation in the Connections inspector, and bind theselectedTitle aspect to the "rating" key.</p><br><h2>Selecting an Integer Tag from a Static List</h2><p>Suppose you have a Customer enterprise object whose creditcard type (Visa, MasterCard, and so on) is indicated by an integertag. You want a user to be able to choose a customer's card typefrom a pop-up list. To do this, in Interface Builder, set the creditcard names and tags for the pop-up list. Control-drag a connectionfrom the pop-up list to the Customer display group. Choose EOPopUpAssociationin the Connections inspector, and bind the selectedTag aspect tothe "cardType" key. You can also allow for a general "other"value by defining a special tag and setting it in the EOPopUpAssociationusing  <a frame= "conv" href="#//apple_ref/occ/instm/EOPopUpAssociation/setTagValueForOther:">setTagValueForOther:</a>.Credit card tags from the database not matching any in the pop-uplist are then displayed as the "other" value. (It would alsomake sense to disable the pop-up list in this case, to avoid writingthe meaningless tag back to the database.)</p><br><h2>Selecting the Destination of a To-One Relationship</h2><p>Suppose you have a list of employees and want to assign eachemployee a department. In terms of the object model, you want toassign a Department object as the destination of an Employee object's <b>department</b> relationship.To do this, in Interface Builder, control-drag a connection fromthe pop-up list to a Department display group. Choose EOComboBoxAssociationin the Connections inspector, and bind the titles aspect to the"name" key. Similarly, control-drag a connection from the pop-uplist to the Employee display group. Again choose EOComboBoxAssociationin the Connections inspector, and bind the selectedObject to the"department" key. This fills the pop-up list with the namesof departments, and causes the name of the selected Employee'sDepartment to be selected in the pop-up list.</p><br><BR><BR><h2>Instance Methods</h2><hr><a name = "setTagValueForOther_"><BR><h3><a name="//apple_ref/occ/instm/EOPopUpAssociation/setTagValueForOther:">setTagValueForOther:</a></h3></a><p><code>- (void)<b>setTagValueForOther:</b>(int)<em>tag</em></code></p>Records <em>tag</em> asthe "unknown" tag. When a property value doesn't match anyother tag in the pop-up list, the EOPopUpAssociation automaticallyselects the item for this tag. If there's no item for this tag, thepop-up list's selection isn't changed. This tag value is bydefault -1.<hr WIDTH=25% ALIGN=LEFT><BR><h3><a name="//apple_ref/occ/instm/EOPopUpAssociation/tagValueForOther">tagValueForOther</a></h3><p><code>- (int)<b>tagValueForOther</b></code></p>Returns the "unknown" tag.<hr WIDTH=25% ALIGN=LEFT><BR><br><a href="../EOInterfaceTOC.html"><img src="../../../../../../images/up.gif" border="0" alt="Table of Contents"></a> </BODY></HTML>
