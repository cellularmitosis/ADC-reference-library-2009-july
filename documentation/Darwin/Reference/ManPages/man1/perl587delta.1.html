PERL587DELTA(1)                       Perl Programmers Reference Guide                       PERL587DELTA(1)



<b>NAME</b>
       perldelta - what is new for perl v5.8.7

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       This document describes differences between the 5.8.6 release and the 5.8.7 release.

<b>Incompatible</b> <b>Changes</b>
       There are no changes incompatible with 5.8.6.

<b>Core</b> <b>Enhancements</b>
       <b>Unicode</b> <b>Character</b> <b>Database</b> <b>4.1.0</b>

       The copy of the Unicode Character Database included in Perl 5.8 has been updated to 4.1.0 from 4.0.1.
       See &lt;<a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode4.1.0/#NotableChanges">http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode4.1.0/#NotableChanges</a> for the notable changes.

       <b>suidperl</b> <b>less</b> <b>insecure</b>

       A pair of exploits in "suidperl" involving debugging code have been closed.

       For new projects the core perl team strongly recommends that you use dedicated, single purpose secu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rity&nbsp;security</font>
       rity tools such as "sudo" in preference to "suidperl".

       <b>Optional</b> <b>site</b> <b>customization</b> <b>script</b>

       The perl interpreter can be built to allow the use of a site customization script. By default this is
       not enabled, to be consistent with previous perl releases. To use this, add "-Dusesitecustomize" to
       the command line flags when running the "Configure" script. See also "-f" in perlrun.

       <b>"Config.pm"</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>much</b> <b>smaller.</b>

       "Config.pm" is now about 3K rather than 32K, with the infrequently used code and %Config values
       loaded on demand. This is transparent to the programmer, but means that most code will save parsing
       and loading 29K of script (for example, code that uses "File::Find").

<b>Utility</b> <b>Changes</b>
       <b>find2perl</b> <b>enhancements</b>

       "find2perl" has new options "-iname", "-path" and "-ipath".

<b>Performance</b> <b>Enhancements</b>
       The internal pointer mapping hash used during ithreads cloning now uses an arena for memory alloca-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion.&nbsp;allocation.</font>
       tion. In tests this reduced ithreads cloning time by about 10%.

<b>Installation</b> <b>and</b> <b>Configuration</b> <b>Improvements</b>
          The Win32 "dmake" makefile.mk has been updated to make it compatible with the latest versions of
           dmake.

          "PERL_MALLOC", "DEBUG_MSTATS", "PERL_HASH_SEED_EXPLICIT" and "NO_HASH_SEED" should now work in
           Win32 makefiles.

<b>Selected</b> <b>Bug</b> <b>Fixes</b>
          The <u>socket()</u> function on Win32 has been fixed so that it is able to use transport providers which
           specify a protocol of 0 (meaning any protocol is allowed) once more.  (This was broken in 5.8.6,
           and typically caused the use of ICMP sockets to fail.)

          Another obscure bug involving "substr" and UTF-8 caused by bad internal offset caching has been
           identified and fixed.

          A bug involving the loading of UTF-8 tables by the regexp engine has been fixed - code such as
           ""\x{100}" =~ /[[:print:]]/" will no longer give corrupt results.

          Case conversion operations such as "uc" on a long Unicode string could exhaust memory. This has
           been fixed.

          "index"/"rindex" were buggy for some combinations of Unicode and non-Unicode data. This has been
           fixed.

          "read" (and presumably "sysread") would expose the UTF-8 internals when reading from a byte ori-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ented&nbsp;oriented</font>
           ented file handle into a UTF-8 scalar. This has been fixed.

          Several "pack"/"unpack" bug fixes:

              Checksums with "b" or "B" formats were broken.

              "unpack" checksums could overflow with the "C" format.

              "U0" and "C0" are now scoped to "()" "pack" sub-templates.

              Counted length prefixes now don't change "C0"/"U0" mode.

              "pack" "Z0" used to destroy the preceding character.

              "P"/"p" "pack" formats used to only recognise literal "undef"

          Using closures with ithreads could cause perl to crash. This was due to failure to correctly lock
           internal OP structures, and has been fixed.

          The return value of "close" now correctly reflects any file errors that occur while flushing the
           handle's data, instead of just giving failure if the actual underlying file close operation
           failed.

          "not() || 1" used to segfault. "not()" now behaves like not(0), which was the pre 5.6.0 behav-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">iour.&nbsp;behaviour.</font>
           iour.

          "h2ph" has various enhancements to cope with constructs in header files that used to result in
           incorrect or invalid output.

<b>New</b> <b>or</b> <b>Changed</b> <b>Diagnostics</b>
       There is a new taint error, "%ENV is aliased to %s". This error is thrown when taint checks are
       enabled and when *ENV has been aliased, so that %ENV has no env-magic anymore and hence the environ-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment&nbsp;environment</font>
       ment cannot be verified as taint-free.

       The internals of "pack" and "unpack" have been updated. All legitimate templates should work as
       before, but there may be some changes in the error reported for complex failure cases. Any behaviour
       changes for non-error cases are bugs, and should be reported.

<b>Changed</b> <b>Internals</b>
       There has been a fair amount of refactoring of the "C" source code, partly to make it tidier and more
       maintainable. The resulting object code and the "perl" binary may well be smaller than 5.8.6, and
       hopefully faster in some cases, but apart from this there should be no user-detectable changes.

       "${^UTF8LOCALE}" has been added to give perl space access to "PL_utf8locale".

       The size of the arenas used to allocate SV heads and most SV bodies can now be changed at compile
       time. The old size was 1008 bytes, the new default size is 4080 bytes.

<b>Known</b> <b>Problems</b>
       Unicode strings returned from overloaded operators can be buggy. This is a long standing bug reported
       since 5.8.6 was released, but we do not yet have a suitable fix for it.

<b>Platform</b> <b>Specific</b> <b>Problems</b>
       On UNICOS, lib/Math/BigInt/t/bigintc.t hangs burning CPU.  ext/B/t/bytecode.t and ext/Socket/t/sock-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">etpair.t&nbsp;ext/Socket/t/socketpair.t</font>
       etpair.t both fail tests.  These are unlikely to be resolved, as our valiant UNICOS porter's last
       Cray is being decommissioned.

<b>Reporting</b> <b>Bugs</b>
       If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently posted to the
       comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at <a href="http://bugs.perl.org">http://bugs.perl.org</a>  There may also be
       information at <a href="http://www.perl.org">http://www.perl.org</a> the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the <b>perlbug</b> program included with your release.
       Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
       output of "perl -V", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.
       You can browse and search the Perl 5 bugs at <a href="http://bugs.perl.org/">http://bugs.perl.org/</a>
