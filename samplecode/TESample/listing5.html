The fundamental TextEdit #  toolbox calls and TextEdit autoscroll are demonstrated. It #  also shows how to create and maintain scrollbar controls.##  It does not by any means demonstrate all the techniques you #  need for a large application. In particular, Sample does not #  cover exception handling, multiple windows/documents, #  sophisticated memory management, printing, or undo. All of #  these are vital parts of a normal full-sized application.##  This application is an example of the form of a Macintosh #  application; it is NOT a template. It is NOT intended to be #  used as a foundation for the next world-class, best-selling, #  600K application. A stick figure drawing of the human body may #  be a good example of the form for a painting, but that does not #  mean it should be used as the basis for the next Mona Lisa.##  We recommend that you review this program or Sample before #  beginning a new application. Sample is a simple app. which doesnUt #  use TextEdit or the Control Manager.#------------------------------------------------------------------------------*//* Segmentation strategy:   This program consists of three segments.   1. &quot;Main&quot; contains most of the code, including the MPW libraries, and the      main program.  This segment is in the file Sample.c   2. &quot;Initialize&quot; contains code that is only used once, during startup, and      can be unloaded after the program starts.  This segment is in the file    SampleInit.c.   3. &quot;%A5Init&quot; is automatically created by the Linker to initialize globals      for the MPW libraries and is unloaded right away. *//* SetPort strategy:   Toolbox routines do not change the current port. In spite of this, in this   program we use a strategy of calling SetPort whenever we want to draw or   make calls which depend on the current port. This makes us less vulnerable   to bugs in other software which might alter the current port (such as the   bug (feature?) in many desk accessories which change the port on OpenDeskAcc).   Hopefully, this also makes the routines from this program more self-contained,   since they don't depend on the current port setting. *//* Clipboard strategy:   This program does not maintain a private scrap. Whenever a cut, copy, or paste   occurs, we import/export from the public scrap to TextEdit's scrap right away,   using the TEToScrap and TEFromScrap routines. If we did use a private scrap,   the import/export would be in the activate/deactivate event and suspend/resume   event routines. *//* A/UX is case sensitive, so use correct case for include file names */#include &lt;Limits.h&gt;#include &lt;types.h&gt;#include &lt;quickdraw.h&gt;#include &lt;fonts.h&gt;#include &lt;events.h&gt;#include &lt;controls.h&gt;#include &lt;windows.h&gt;#include &lt;menus.h&gt;#include &lt;textedit.h&gt;#include &lt;dialogs.h&gt;#include &lt;desk.h&gt;#include &lt;scrap.h&gt;#include &lt;toolutils.h&gt;#include &lt;memory.h&gt;#include &lt;segload.h&gt;#include &lt;files.h&gt;#include &lt;osutils.h&gt;#ifndef AUX#  include &lt;diskinit.h&gt;#endif#include &lt;packages.h&gt;#include &quot;TESample.h&quot;    /* bring in all the #defines for TESample */#include &lt;traps.h&gt;/* A/UX C understands neither #pragma, nor segments, so don't pragma */#ifndef AUX  #pragma segment Initialize#endif/* The &quot;g&quot; prefix is used to emphasize that a variable is global. *//* All are extern since the variables are declared in the main segment. *//* GMac is used to hold the result of a SysEnvirons call.
