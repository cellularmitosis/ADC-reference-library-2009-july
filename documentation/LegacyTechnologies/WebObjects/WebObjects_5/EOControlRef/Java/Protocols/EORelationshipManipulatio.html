EOCustomObject and EOGenericRecord provide default implementations of EORelationshipManipulation, which you rarely (if ever) need to override.</p>		<p>The primitive methods <a href="#//apple_ref/java/intfm/EORelationshipManipulation/addObjectToPropertyWithKey">addObjectToPropertyWithKey</a> and <a href="#//apple_ref/java/intfm/EORelationshipManipulation/removeObjectFromPropertyWithKey">removeObjectFromPropertyWithKey</a> add and remove single objects from to-many relationship arrays. The two other methods in the interface, <a href="#//apple_ref/java/intfm/EORelationshipManipulation/addObjectToBothSidesOfRelationshipWithKey">addObjectToBothSidesOfRelationshipWithKey</a> and <a href="#//apple_ref/java/intfm/EORelationshipManipulation/removeObjectFromBothSidesOfRelationshipWithKey">removeObjectFromBothSidesOfRelationshipWithKey</a>, are implemented in terms of the two primitives to handle reciprocal relationships. These methods find the inverse relationship to the one identified by the specified key (if there is such an inverse relationship) and use <b>addObjectToPropertyWithKey</b> and <b>removeObjectFromPropertyWithKey</b> to alter both relationships, whether they're to-one or to-many.</p>		<p>The primitive methods check first for a method you might implement, <b>addTo</b><em>Key</em> or <b>removeFrom</b><em>Key</em>, invoking that method if it's implemented, otherwise using the basic key-value coding methods to do the work. Consequently, you rarely need to provide your own implementations of EORelationshipManipulation. Rather, you can provide relationship accessors (<b>addTo</b><em>Key</em> or <b>removeFrom</b><em>Key</em>) whenever you need to implement custom business logic.</p>		<br>		<br>		<h2>Instance Methods</h2>		<hr alt="">		<a name="CJFCEGIB"></a><br>		<h3><a name="//apple_ref/java/intfm/EORelationshipManipulation/addObjectToBothSidesOfRelationshipWithKey">addObjectToBothSidesOfRelationshipWithKey</a></h3>		<p><code>public abstract void <b>addObjectToBothSidesOfRelationshipWithKey</b>( EORelationshipManipulation <em>anObject</em>, String <em>key</em>)</code></p>		Sets or adds <em>anObject</em> as the destination for the receiver's relationship identified by <em>key</em>, and also sets or adds the receiver for <em>anObject</em>'s reciprocal relationship if there is one. For a to-one relationship, <em>anObject</em> is set using takeValueForKey. For a to-many relationship, <em>anObject</em> is added using <a href="#//apple_ref/java/intfm/EORelationshipManipulation/addObjectToBothSidesOfRelationshipWithKey">addObjectToBothSidesOfRelationshipWithKey</a>. 		<p>This method also properly handles removing <code>this </code>and <em>anObject</em> from their previous relationship as needed. For example, if an Employee object belongs to the Research department, invoking this method with the Maintenance department removes the Employee from the Research department as well as setting the Employee's department to Maintenance.</p>		<hr width="25%" align="LEFT">		<a name="CJFCIDAG"></a><br>		<h3><a name="//apple_ref/java/intfm/EORelationshipManipulation/addObjectToPropertyWithKey">addObjectToPropertyWithKey</a></h3>		<p><code>public abstract void <b>addObjectToPropertyWithKey</b>( Object <em>anObject</em>, String <em>key</em>)</code></p>		Adds <em>anObject</em> to the receiver's to-many relationship identified by <em>key</em>, without setting a reciprocal relationship. Similar to the implementation of takeValueForKey, EOCustomObject's implementation of this method first attempts to invoke a method of the form <b>addTo</b><em>Key</em>:. If the receiver doesn't have such a method, this method gets the property array using valueForKey and operates directly on that. For a to-many relationship, this method adds <em>anObject</em> to the array if it is not already in the array. For a to-one relationship, this method replaces the previous value with <em>anObject</em>. 		<hr width="25%" align="LEFT">		<a name="CJFCBCHF"></a><br>		<h3><a name="//apple_ref/java/intfm/EORelationshipManipulation/removeObjectFromBothSidesOfRelationshipWithKey">removeObjectFromBothSidesOfRelationshipWithKey</a></h3>		<p><code>public abstract void <b>removeObjectFromBothSidesOfRelationshipWithKey</b>( EORelationshipManipulation <em>anObject</em>, String <em>key</em>)</code></p>		Removes <em>anObject</em> from the receiver's relationship identified by <em>key</em>, and also removes the receiver from <em>anObject</em>'s reciprocal relationship if there is one. For a to-one relationship, <em>anObject</em> is removed using takeValueForKey with <code>null</code> as the value.
