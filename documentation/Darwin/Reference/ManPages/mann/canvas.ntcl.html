       See the <b>options</b> manual entry for details on the standard options.

<b>WIDGET-SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       Command-Line Name:<b>-closeenough</b>
       Database Name:  <b>closeEnough</b>
       Database Class: <b>CloseEnough</b>

              Specifies  a  floating-point  value  indicating  how close the mouse cursor must be to an item
              before it is considered to be ``inside'' the item.  Defaults to 1.0.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-confine</b>
       Database Name:  <b>confine</b>
       Database Class: <b>Confine</b>

              Specifies a boolean value that indicates whether or not it should be allowable to set the can-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">vas's&nbsp;canvas's</font>
              vas's  view  outside the region defined by the <b>scrollRegion</b> argument.  Defaults to true, which
              means that the view will be constrained within the scroll region.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-height</b>
       Database Name:  <b>height</b>
       Database Class: <b>Height</b>

              Specifies a desired window height that the canvas widget should request from its geometry man-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ager.&nbsp;manager.</font>
              ager.   The  value  may  be specified in any of the forms described in the COORDINATES section
              below.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-scrollregion</b>
       Database Name:  <b>scrollRegion</b>
       Database Class: <b>ScrollRegion</b>

              Specifies a list with four coordinates describing the left, top, right, and bottom coordinates
              of  a  rectangular region.  This region is used for scrolling purposes and is considered to be
              the boundary of the information in the canvas.  Each of the coordinates may  be  specified  in
              any of the forms given in the COORDINATES section below.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-state</b>
       Database Name:  <b>state</b>
       Database Class: <b>State</b>

              Modifies  the  default state of the canvas where <u>state</u> may be set to one of: <b>normal</b>, <b>disabled</b>,
              or <b>hidden</b>. Individual canvas objects all have their own state option which  may  override  the
              default  state.  Many options can take separate specifications such that the appearance of the
              item can be different in different situations. The options that start with <b>active</b> control  the
              appearence when the mouse pointer is over it, while the option starting with <b>disabled</b> controls
              the appearence when the state is disabled.  Canvas items which are <b>disabled</b> will not react  to
              canvas bindings.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-width</b>
       Database Name:  <b>width</b>
       Database Class: <b>width</b>

              Specifies  a desired window width that the canvas widget should request from its geometry man-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ager.&nbsp;manager.</font>
              ager.  The value may be specified in any of the forms described  in  the  COORDINATES  section
              below.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-xscrollincrement</b>
       Database Name:  <b>xScrollIncrement</b>
       Database Class: <b>ScrollIncrement</b>

              Specifies  an  increment  for  horizontal  scrolling,  in any of the usual forms permitted for
              screen distances.  If the value of this option is greater than zero, the  horizontal  view  in
              the  window will be constrained so that the canvas x coordinate at the left edge of the window
              is always an even multiple of <b>xScrollIncrement</b>;  furthermore, the units for  scrolling  (e.g.,
              the  change  in  view when the left and right arrows of a scrollbar are selected) will also be
              <b>xScrollIncrement</b>.  If the value of this option is less than or equal to zero, then  horizontal
              scrolling is unconstrained.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-yscrollincrement</b>
       Database Name:  <b>yScrollIncrement</b>
       Database Class: <b>ScrollIncrement</b>

              Specifies  an increment for vertical scrolling, in any of the usual forms permitted for screen
              distances.  If the value of this option is greater than zero, the vertical view in the  window
              will be constrained so that the canvas y coordinate at the top edge of the window is always an
              even multiple of <b>yScrollIncrement</b>;  furthermore, the units for scrolling (e.g., the change  in
              view  when  the  top and bottom arrows of a scrollbar are selected) will also be <b>yScrollIncre</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment.&nbsp;yScrollIncrement.</font>
              <b>ment</b>.  If the value of this option is less than or equal to zero, then vertical  scrolling  is
              unconstrained.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
       The  <b>canvas</b>  command creates a new window (given by the <u>pathName</u> argument) and makes it into a canvas
       widget.  Additional options, described above, may be specified on the command line or in  the  option
       database  to  configure  aspects of the canvas such as its colors and 3-D relief.  The <b>canvas</b> command
       returns its <u>pathName</u> argument.  At the time this command is invoked, there must not  exist  a  window
       named <u>pathName</u>, but <u>pathName</u>'s parent must exist.

       Canvas  widgets  implement  structured graphics.  A canvas displays any number of <u>items</u>, which may be
       things like rectangles, circles, lines, and text.  Items may be manipulated (e.g.  moved  or  re-col-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ored)&nbsp;re-colored)</font>
       ored)  and  commands  may  be associated with items in much the same way that the <b>bind</b> command allows
       commands to be bound to widgets.  For example, a particular command may be associated with the  &lt;But-
       ton-1&gt;  event  so that the command is invoked whenever button 1 is pressed with the mouse cursor over
       an item.  This means that items in a canvas can have behaviors defined by the Tcl  scripts  bound  to
       them.


<b>DISPLAY</b> <b>LIST</b>
       The  items  in  a canvas are ordered for purposes of display, with the first item in the display list
       being displayed first, followed by the next item in the list, and so on.  Items later in the  display
       list  obscure  those that are earlier in the display list and are sometimes referred to as being ``on
       top'' of earlier items.  When a new item is created it is placed at the end of the display  list,  on
       top of everything else.  Widget commands may be used to re-arrange the order of the display list.

       Window  items are an exception to the above rules.  The underlying window systems require them always
       to be drawn on top of other items.  In addition, the stacking order of window items is  not  affected
       by any of the canvas widget commands; you must use the <b>raise</b> and <b>lower</b> Tk commands instead.


<b>ITEM</b> <b>IDS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>TAGS</b>
       Items in a canvas widget may be named in either of two ways: by id or by tag.  Each item has a unique
       identifying number which is assigned to that item when it is  created.   The  id  of  an  item  never
       changes and id numbers are never re-used within the lifetime of a canvas widget.

       Each item may also have any number of <u>tags</u> associated with it.  A tag is just a string of characters,
       and it may take any form except that of an integer.  For example, ``x123'' is OK but  ``123''  isn't.
       The  same  tag  may be associated with many different items.  This is commonly done to group items in
       various interesting ways;  for example, all selected items might be given the tag ``selected''.

       The tag <b>all</b> is implicitly associated with every item in the canvas;  it may be used to invoke  opera-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tions&nbsp;operations</font>
       tions on all the items in the canvas.

       The  tag <b>current</b> is managed automatically by Tk; it applies to the <u>current</u> <u>item</u>, which is the topmost
       item whose drawn area covers the position of the mouse cursor.  If the mouse is  not  in  the  canvas
       widget or is not over an item, then no item has the <b>current</b> tag.

       When specifying items in canvas widget commands, if the specifier is an integer then it is assumed to
       refer to the single item with that id.  If the specifier is not an integer, then  it  is  assumed  to
       refer  to  all of the items in the canvas that have a tag matching the specifier.  The symbol <u>tagOrId</u>
       is used below to indicate that an argument specifies either an id that selects a single item or a tag
       that selects zero or more items.

       <u>tagOrId</u> may contain a logical expressions of tags by using operators: '&amp;&amp;', '||', '^' '!', and paren-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">thezised&nbsp;parenthezised</font>
       thezised subexpressions.  For example:
                    .c find withtag {(a&amp;&amp;!b)||(!a&amp;&amp;b)}
       or equivalently:
                    .c find withtag {a^b}
       will find only those items with either "a" or "b" tags, but not both.

       Some widget commands only operate on a single item at a time;  if <u>tagOrId</u> is specified in a way  that
       names  multiple items, then the normal behavior is for the command to use the first (lowest) of these
       items in the display list that is suitable for the command.  Exceptions are noted in the widget  com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
       mand descriptions below.


<b>COORDINATES</b>
       All  coordinates related to canvases are stored as floating-point numbers.  Coordinates and distances
       are specified in screen units, which are floating-point numbers optionally followed by one of several
       letters.   If no letter is supplied then the distance is in pixels.  If the letter is <b>m</b> then the dis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tance&nbsp;distance</font>
       tance is in millimeters on the screen;  if it is <b>c</b> then the  distance  is  in  centimeters;  <b>i</b>  means
       inches,  and  <b>p</b> means printers points (1/72 inch).  Larger y-coordinates refer to points lower on the
       screen;  larger x-coordinates refer to points farther to the right.   Coordinates  can  be  specified |
       either  as an even number of parameters, or as a single list parameter containing an even number of x |
       and y coordinate values.


<b>TRANSFORMATIONS</b>
       Normally the origin of the canvas coordinate system is at the upper-left corner of  the  window  con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">taining&nbsp;containing</font>
       taining  the canvas.  It is possible to adjust the origin of the canvas coordinate system relative to
       the origin of the window using the <b>xview</b> and <b>yview</b> widget  commands;   this  is  typically  used  for
       scrolling.   Canvases  do not support scaling or rotation of the canvas coordinate system relative to
       the window coordinate system.

       Individual items may be moved or scaled using widget commands described below, but they  may  not  be
       rotated.


<b>INDICES</b>
       Text items support the notion of an <u>index</u> for identifying particular positions within the item.  In a
       similar fashion, line and polygon items support <u>index</u> for identifying, inserting and deleting subsets
       of their coordinates.  Indices are used for commands such as inserting or deleting a range of charac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ters&nbsp;characters</font>
       ters or coordinates, and setting the insertion cursor position. An index may be specified in any of a
       number  of  ways,  and  different  types of items may support different forms for specifying indices.
       Text items support the following forms for an index;  if you define new types of text-like items,  it
       would be advisable to support as many of these forms as practical.  Note that it is possible to refer
       to the character just after the last one in the text item;  this  is  necessary  for  such  tasks  as
       inserting new text at the end of the item.  Lines and Polygons don't support the insertion cursor and
       the selection. Their indixes are supposed to be even always, because  coordinates  always  appear  in
       pairs.

       <u>number</u>    A  decimal  number  giving  the  position of the desired character within the text item.  0
                 refers to the first character, 1 to the next character, and so on. If indexes are  odd  for
                 lines and polygons, they will be automatically decremented by one.  A number less than 0 is
                 treated as if it were zero, and a number greater than  the  length  of  the  text  item  is
                 treated as if it were equal to the length of the text item. For polygons, numbers less than
                 0 or greater then the length of the coordinate list will be  adjusted  by  adding  or  sub-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">stracting&nbsp;substracting</font>
                 stracting the length until the result is between zero and the length, inclusive.

       <b>end</b>       Refers to the character or coordinate just after the last one in the item (same as the num-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ber&nbsp;number</font>
                 ber of characters or coordinates in the item).

       <b>insert</b>    Refers to the character just before which the insertion cursor is drawn in this  item.  Not
                 valid for lines and polygons.

       <b>sel.first</b> Refers  to  the  first selected character in the item.  If the selection isn't in this item
                 then this form is illegal.

       <b>sel.last</b>  Refers to the last selected character in the item.  If the selection  isn't  in  this  item
                 then this form is illegal.

       <b>@</b><u>x,y</u>      Refers  to  the  character  or  coordinate at the point given by <u>x</u> and <u>y</u>, where <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> are
                 specified in the coordinate system of the canvas.  If <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> lie outside  the  coordinates
                 covered  by  the text item, then they refer to the first or last character in the line that
                 is closest to the given point.


<b>DASH</b> <b>PATTERNS</b>
       Many items support the notion of an dash pattern for outlines.

       The first possible syntax is a list of integers. Each element represents the number of  pixels  of  a
       line segment. Only the odd segments are drawn using the "outline" color. The other segments are drawn
       transparant.

       The second possible syntax is a character list containing only 5 possible  characters  <b>[.,-_</b>  <b>]</b>.  The
       space  can  be  used to enlarge the space between other line elements, and can not occur as the first
       position in the string. Some examples:
           -dash .= -dash {2 4}
           -dash -     = -dash {6 4}
           -dash -.    = -dash {6 4 2 4}
           -dash -..   = -dash {6 4 2 4 2 4}
           -dash {. }  = -dash {2 8}
           -dash ,= -dash {4 4}

       The main difference of this syntax with the previous is that it it shape-conserving. This means  that
       all  values  in  the dash list will be multiplied by the line width before display. This assures that
       "." will always be displayed as a dot and "-" always as a dash regardless of the line width.

       On systems which support only a limited set of dash patterns, the dash pattern will be  displayed  as
       the  closest  dash  pattern that is available.  For example, on Windows only the first 4 of the above
       examples are available.  The last 2 examples will be displayed identically to the first one.


<b>WIDGET</b> <b>COMMAND</b>
       The <b>canvas</b> command creates a new Tcl command whose name is <u>pathName</u>.  This command  may  be  used  to
       invoke various operations on the widget.  It has the following general form:
              <u>pathName</u> <u>option</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
       <u>Option</u>  and  the <u>arg</u>s determine the exact behavior of the command.  The following widget commands are
       possible for canvas widgets:

       <u>pathName</u> <b>addtag</b> <u>tag</u> <u>searchSpec</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
              For each item that meets the constraints specified by <u>searchSpec</u> and the <u>arg</u>s, add <u>tag</u> to  the
              list  of tags associated with the item if it isn't already present on that list.  It is possi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ble&nbsp;possible</font>
              ble that no items will satisfy the constraints given by <u>searchSpec</u> and <u>arg</u>s, in which case the
              command  has no effect.  This command returns an empty string as result.  <u>SearchSpec</u> and <u>arg</u>'s
              may take any of the following forms:

              <b>above</b> <u>tagOrId</u>
                     Selects the item just after (above) the one given by <u>tagOrId</u> in the display  list.   If
                     <u>tagOrId</u>  denotes more than one item, then the last (topmost) of these items in the dis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">play&nbsp;display</font>
                     play list is used.

              <b>all</b>    Selects all the items in the canvas.

              <b>below</b> <u>tagOrId</u>
                     Selects the item just before (below) the one given by <u>tagOrId</u> in the display list.   If
                     <u>tagOrId</u>  denotes more than one item, then the first (lowest) of these items in the dis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">play&nbsp;display</font>
                     play list is used.

              <b>closest</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u> ?<u>halo</u>? ?<u>start</u>?
                     Selects the item closest to the point given by <u>x</u> and <u>y</u>.  If more than one  item  is  at
                     the  same  closest  distance  (e.g.  two items overlap the point), then the top-most of
                     these items (the last one in the display list) is used.  If <u>halo</u> is specified, then  it
                     must  be a non-negative value.  Any item closer than <u>halo</u> to the point is considered to
                     overlap it.  The <u>start</u> argument may be used to step circularly through all the  closest
                     items.   If  <u>start</u>  is  specified,  it  names  an item using a tag or id (if by tag, it
                     selects the first item in the display list with the given tag).  Instead  of  selecting
                     the  topmost closest item, this form will select the topmost closest item that is below
                     <u>start</u> in the display list;  if no such item exists, then the selection  behaves  as  if
                     the <u>start</u> argument had not been specified.

              <b>enclosed</b> <u>x1</u> <u>y1</u> <u>x2</u> <u>y2</u>
                     Selects  all  the  items completely enclosed within the rectangular region given by <u>x1</u>,
                     <u>y1</u>, <u>x2</u>, and <u>y2</u>.  <u>X1</u> must be no greater then <u>x2</u> and <u>y1</u> must be no greater than <u>y2</u>.

              <b>overlapping</b> <u>x1</u> <u>y1</u> <u>x2</u> <u>y2</u>
                     Selects all the items that overlap or are enclosed within the rectangular region  given
                     by  <u>x1</u>,  <u>y1</u>,  <u>x2</u>, and <u>y2</u>.  <u>X1</u> must be no greater then <u>x2</u> and <u>y1</u> must be no greater than
                     <u>y2</u>.

              <b>withtag</b> <u>tagOrId</u>
                     Selects all the items given by <u>tagOrId</u>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>bbox</b> <u>tagOrId</u> ?<u>tagOrId</u> <u>tagOrId</u> <u>...</u>?
              Returns a list with four elements giving an approximate bounding box for all the  items  named
              by  the <u>tagOrId</u> arguments.  The list has the form ``<u>x1</u> <u>y1</u> <u>x2</u> <u>y2</u>'' such that the drawn areas of
              all the named elements are within the region bounded by <u>x1</u> on the left, <u>x2</u> on the right, <u>y1</u> on
              the top, and <u>y2</u> on the bottom.  The return value may overestimate the actual bounding box by a
              few pixels.  If no items match any of the <u>tagOrId</u> arguments or  if  the  matching  items  have
              empty bounding boxes (i.e. they have nothing to display) then an empty string is returned.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>bind</b> <u>tagOrId</u> ?<u>sequence</u>? ?<u>command</u>?
              This  command  associates  <u>command</u>  with all the items given by <u>tagOrId</u> such that whenever the
              event sequence given by <u>sequence</u> occurs for one of the items  the  command  will  be  invoked.
              This  widget command is similar to the <b>bind</b> command except that it operates on items in a can-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">vas&nbsp;canvas</font>
              vas rather than entire widgets.  See the <b>bind</b> manual entry for complete details on the  syntax
              of  <u>sequence</u>  and the substitutions performed on <u>command</u> before invoking it.  If all arguments
              are specified then a new binding is created, replacing  any  existing  binding  for  the  same
              <u>sequence</u>  and  <u>tagOrId</u>  (if  the  first character of <u>command</u> is ``+'' then <u>command</u> augments an
              existing binding rather than replacing it).  In this case the return value is an empty string.
              If  <u>command</u>  is  omitted  then  the  command  returns  the <u>command</u> associated with <u>tagOrId</u> and
              <u>sequence</u> (an error occurs if there is no such binding).  If  both  <u>command</u>  and  <u>sequence</u>  are
              omitted  then  the  command  returns  a list of all the sequences for which bindings have been
              defined for <u>tagOrId</u>.

              The only events for which bindings may be specified are those related to the  mouse  and  key-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">board&nbsp;keyboard</font>
              board  (such  as <b>Enter</b>, <b>Leave</b>, <b>ButtonPress</b>, <b>Motion</b>, and <b>KeyPress</b>) or virtual events.  The han-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dling&nbsp;handling</font>
              dling of events in canvases uses the current item defined in ITEM IDS AND TAGS  above.   <b>Enter</b>
              and <b>Leave</b> events trigger for an item when it becomes the current item or ceases to be the cur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rent&nbsp;current</font>
              rent item; note that these events are different than  <b>Enter</b>  and  <b>Leave</b>  events  for  windows.
              Mouse-related  events  are  directed to the current item, if any.  Keyboard-related events are
              directed to the focus item, if any (see the <b>focus</b> widget command below for more on this).   If
              a  virtual  event  is used in a binding, that binding can trigger only if the virtual event is
              defined by an underlying mouse-related or keyboard-related event.

              It is possible for multiple bindings to match a particular event.  This could occur, for exam-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ple,&nbsp;example,</font>
              ple, if one binding is associated with the item's id and another is associated with one of the
              item's tags.  When this occurs, all of the matching bindings are invoked.  A  binding  associ-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ated&nbsp;associated</font>
              ated  with  the  <b>all</b> tag is invoked first, followed by one binding for each of the item's tags
              (in order), followed by a binding associated with the item's id.  If there are multiple match-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;matching</font>
              ing  bindings  for  a  single tag, then only the most specific binding is invoked.  A <b>continue</b>
              command in a binding script terminates that script, and a <b>break</b> command terminates that script
              and skips any remaining scripts for the event, just as for the <b>bind</b> command.

              If  bindings  have  been  created  for  a  canvas window using the <b>bind</b> command, then they are
              invoked in addition to bindings created for the canvas's items using the <b>bind</b> widget  command.
              The bindings for items will be invoked before any of the bindings for the window as a whole.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>canvasx</b> <u>screenx</u> ?<u>gridspacing</u>?
              Given  a  window x-coordinate in the canvas <u>screenx</u>, this command returns the canvas x-coordi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nate&nbsp;x-coordinate</font>
              nate that is displayed at that location.  If <u>gridspacing</u> is specified, then the canvas coordi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nate&nbsp;coordinate</font>
              nate is rounded to the nearest multiple of <u>gridspacing</u> units.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>canvasy</b> <u>screeny</u> ?<u>gridspacing</u>?
              Given a window y-coordinate in the canvas <u>screeny</u> this command returns the canvas y-coordinate
              that is displayed at that location.  If <u>gridspacing</u> is specified, then the  canvas  coordinate
              is rounded to the nearest multiple of <u>gridspacing</u> units.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>cget</b> <u>option</u>
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <u>option</u>.  <u>Option</u> may have any of
              the values accepted by the <b>canvas</b> command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>configure</b> <b>?</b><u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u>? ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no <u>option</u> is specified, returns a
              list  describing  all of the available options for <u>pathName</u> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for informa-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;information</font>
              tion on the format of this list).  If <u>option</u> is specified with  no  <u>value</u>,  then  the  command
              returns a list describing the one named option (this list will be identical to the correspond-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;corresponding</font>
              ing sublist of the value returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).  If  one  or  more  <u>option-value</u>
              pairs  are  specified,  then the command modifies the given widget <!-- a -->option(s)<!-- /a --> to have the given
              <!-- a -->value(s)<!-- /a -->;  in this case the command returns an empty string.  <u>Option</u> may have any of the  val-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ues&nbsp;values</font>
              ues accepted by the <b>canvas</b> command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>coords</b> <u>tagOrId</u> ?<u>x0</u> <u>y0</u> <u>...</u>?

       <u>pathName</u> <b>coords</b> <u>tagOrId</u> ?<u>coordList</u>?
              Query  or  modify  the coordinates that define an item.  If no coordinates are specified, this
              command returns a list whose elements are the coordinates of the item named  by  <u>tagOrId</u>.   If
              coordinates  are  specified, then they replace the current coordinates for the named item.  If
              <u>tagOrId</u> refers to multiple items, then the first one in the display list is used.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>create</b> <u>type</u> <u>x</u> <u>y</u> ?<u>x</u> <u>y</u> <u>...</u>? ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?

       <u>pathName</u> <b>create</b> <u>type</u> <u>coordList</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Create a new item in <u>pathName</u> of type <u>type</u>.  The exact format  of  the  arguments  after  <b>type</b>
              depends  on <b>type</b>, but usually they consist of the coordinates for one or more points, followed
              by specifications for zero or more item options.  See the subsections on individual item types
              below for more on the syntax of this command.  This command returns the id for the new item.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>dchars</b> <u>tagOrId</u> <u>first</u> ?<u>last</u>?
              For  each  item given by <u>tagOrId</u>, delete the characters, or coordinates, in the range given by
              <u>first</u> and <u>last</u>, inclusive.  If some of the items given by <u>tagOrId</u> don't support indexing oper-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ations&nbsp;operations</font>
              ations  then  they ignore dchars.  Text items interpret <u>first</u> and <u>last</u> as indices to a charac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ter,&nbsp;character,</font>
              ter, line and polygon items interpret them indices to a coordinate (an x,y pair).  Indices are
              described  in  INDICES above.  If <u>last</u> is omitted, it defaults to <u>first</u>.  This command returns
              an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>delete</b> ?<u>tagOrId</u> <u>tagOrId</u> <u>...</u>?
              Delete each of the items given by each <u>tagOrId</u>, and return an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>dtag</b> <u>tagOrId</u> ?<u>tagToDelete</u>?
              For each of the items given by <u>tagOrId</u>, delete the tag given by <u>tagToDelete</u> from the  list  of
              those  associated with the item.  If an item doesn't have the tag <u>tagToDelete</u> then the item is
              unaffected by the command.  If <u>tagToDelete</u> is omitted then it defaults to <u>tagOrId</u>.  This  com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
              mand returns an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>find</b> <u>searchCommand</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
              This command returns a list consisting of all the items that meet the constraints specified by
              <u>searchCommand</u> and <u>arg</u>'s.  <u>SearchCommand</u> and <u>args</u> have any of the forms accepted by the  <b>addtag</b>
              command.  The items are returned in stacking order, with the lowest item first.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>focus</b> ?<u>tagOrId</u>?
              Set  the keyboard focus for the canvas widget to the item given by <u>tagOrId</u>.  If <u>tagOrId</u> refers
              to several items, then the focus is set to the first such item in the display list  that  sup-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ports&nbsp;supports</font>
              ports the insertion cursor.  If <u>tagOrId</u> doesn't refer to any items, or if none of them support
              the insertion cursor, then the focus isn't changed.  If <u>tagOrId</u> is an empty string,  then  the
              focus  item is reset so that no item has the focus.  If <u>tagOrId</u> is not specified then the com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
              mand returns the id for the item that currently has the focus, or an empty string if  no  item
              has the focus.

              Once  the  focus  has  been set to an item, the item will display the insertion cursor and all
              keyboard events will be directed to that item.  The focus item within a canvas and  the  focus
              window  on  the  screen  (set  with  the  <b>focus</b> command) are totally independent: a given item
              doesn't actually have the input focus unless (a) its canvas is the focus window  and  (b)  the
              item  is  the focus item within the canvas.  In most cases it is advisable to follow the <b>focus</b>
              widget command with the <b>focus</b> command to set the focus window to  the  canvas  (if  it  wasn't
              there already).

       <u>pathName</u> <b>gettags</b> <u>tagOrId</u>
              Return  a  list  whose  elements  are  the tags associated with the item given by <u>tagOrId</u>.  If
              <u>tagOrId</u> refers to more than one item, then the tags are returned from the first such  item  in
              the  display  list.   If  <u>tagOrId</u> doesn't refer to any items, or if the item contains no tags,
              then an empty string is returned.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>icursor</b> <u>tagOrId</u> <u>index</u>
              Set the position of the insertion cursor for the <!-- a -->item(s)<!-- /a --> given by <u>tagOrId</u> to just  before  the
              character  whose  position  is  given  by <u>index</u>.  If some or all of the items given by <u>tagOrId</u>
              don't support an insertion cursor then this command has no effect on them.  See INDICES  above
              for a description of the legal forms for <u>index</u>.  Note:  the insertion cursor is only displayed
              in an item if that item currently has the  keyboard  focus  (see  the  widget  command  <b>focus</b>,
              below),  but  the  cursor position may be set even when the item doesn't have the focus.  This
              command returns an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>index</b> <u>tagOrId</u> <u>index</u>
              This command returns a decimal string giving the numerical index within <u>tagOrId</u>  corresponding
              to  <u>index</u>.   <u>Index</u> gives a textual description of the desired position as described in INDICES
              above.  Text items interpret <u>index</u> as an index to a  character, line and polygon items  inter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pret&nbsp;interpret</font>
              pret  it  as  an  index  to a coordinate (an x,y pair).  The return value is guaranteed to lie
              between 0 and the number of characters,  or  coordinates,  within  the  item,  inclusive.   If
              <u>tagOrId</u> refers to multiple items, then the index is processed in the first of these items that
              supports indexing operations (in display list order).

       <u>pathName</u> <b>insert</b> <u>tagOrId</u> <u>beforeThis</u> <u>string</u>
              For each of the items given by <u>tagOrId</u>, if the item supports  text  or  coordinate,  insertion
              then  <u>string</u>  is inserted into the item's text just before the character, or coordinate, whose
              index is <u>beforeThis</u>.  Text items interpret <u>beforethis</u> as an index to a   character,  line  and
              polygon  items interpret it as an index to a coordinate (an x,y pair).  For lines and polygons
              the <u>string</u> must be a valid coordinate sequence.  See INDICES above for information  about  the
              forms allowed for <u>beforeThis</u>.  This command returns an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>itemcget</b> <u>tagOrId</u> <u>option</u>
              Returns the current value of the configuration option for the item given by <u>tagOrId</u> whose name
              is <u>option</u>.  This command is similar to the <b>cget</b> widget command except that  it  applies  to  a
              particular item rather than the widget as a whole.  <u>Option</u> may have any of the values accepted
              by the <b>create</b> widget command when the item was created.  If <u>tagOrId</u> is a tag  that  refers  to
              more than one item, the first (lowest) such item is used.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>itemconfigure</b> <u>tagOrId</u> ?<u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u>? ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              This  command is similar to the <b>configure</b> widget command except that it modifies item-specific
              options for the items given by <u>tagOrId</u> instead of modifying options  for  the  overall  canvas
              widget.  If no <u>option</u> is specified, returns a list describing all of the available options for
              the first item given by <u>tagOrId</u> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for information on the  format  of  this
              list).   If  <u>option</u> is specified with no <u>value</u>, then the command returns a list describing the
              one named option (this list will be identical  to  the  corresponding  sublist  of  the  value
              returned  if  no  <u>option</u> is specified).  If one or more <u>option-value</u> pairs are specified, then
              the command modifies the given widget <!-- a -->option(s)<!-- /a --> to have the given  <!-- a -->value(s)<!-- /a -->  in  each  of  the
              items  given  by  <u>tagOrId</u>;  in this case the command returns an empty string.  The <u>option</u>s and
              <u>value</u>s are the same as those permissible in the <b>create</b> widget command when  the  <!-- a -->item(s)<!-- /a -->  were
              created;  see  the  sections  describing  individual item types below for details on the legal
              options.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>lower</b> <u>tagOrId</u> ?<u>belowThis</u>?
              Move all of the items given by <u>tagOrId</u> to a new position in the display list just  before  the
              item  given  by <u>belowThis</u>.  If <u>tagOrId</u> refers to more than one item then all are moved but the
              relative order of the moved items will not be changed.  <u>BelowThis</u> is  a  tag  or  id;   if  it
              refers  to  more  than  one item then the first (lowest) of these items in the display list is
              used as the destination location for the moved items.  Note: this command  has  no  effect  on
              window  items.  Window items always obscure other item types, and the stacking order of window
              items is determined by the <b>raise</b> and <b>lower</b> commands, not the <b>raise</b> and <b>lower</b>  widget  commands
              for canvases.  This command returns an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>move</b> <u>tagOrId</u> <u>xAmount</u> <u>yAmount</u>
              Move  each  of  the items given by <u>tagOrId</u> in the canvas coordinate space by adding <u>xAmount</u> to
              the x-coordinate of each point associated with the item and <u>yAmount</u>  to  the  y-coordinate  of
              each point associated with the item.  This command returns an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>postscript</b> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Generate  a  Postscript  representation for part or all of the canvas.  If the <b>-file</b> option is
              specified then the Postscript is written to a file and an empty string is returned;  otherwise
              the  Postscript  is  returned  as the result of the command.  If the interpreter that owns the
              canvas is marked as safe, the operation will fail because safe interpreters are not allowed to
              write  files.  If the <b>-channel</b> option is specified, the argument denotes the name of a channel
              already opened for writing. The Postscript is written to that channel, and the channel is left
              open  for  further writing at the end of the operation.  The Postscript is created in Encapsu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lated&nbsp;Encapsulated</font>
              lated Postscript form using version 3.0 of the Document  Structuring  Conventions.   Note:  by
              default  Postscript  is  only generated for information that appears in the canvas's window on
              the screen.  If the canvas is freshly created it may still have its initial size of 1x1  pixel
              so  nothing  will  appear  in  the  Postscript.   To get around this problem either invoke the
              "update" command to wait for the canvas window to reach its final size, or else use the <b>-width</b>
              and  <b>-height</b>  options  to  specify the area of the canvas to print.  The <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> argument
              pairs provide additional information to control the generation of Postscript.   The  following
              options are supported:

              <b>-colormap</b> <u>varName</u>
                     <u>VarName</u>  must be the name of an array variable that specifies a color mapping to use in
                     the Postscript.  Each element of <u>varName</u> must consist of Postscript code to set a  par-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ticular&nbsp;particular</font>
                     ticular color value (e.g. ``<b>1.0</b> <b>1.0</b> <b>0.0</b> <b>setrgbcolor</b>'').  When outputting color informa-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;information</font>
                     tion in the Postscript, Tk checks to see if there is an element  of  <u>varName</u>  with  the
                     same name as the color.  If so, Tk uses the value of the element as the Postscript com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
                     mand to set the color.  If this option hasn't been specified,  or  if  there  isn't  an
                     entry  in  <u>varName</u> for a given color, then Tk uses the red, green, and blue intensities
                     from the X color.

              <b>-colormode</b> <u>mode</u>
                     Specifies how to output color information.  <u>Mode</u> must be either <b>color</b> (for  full  color
                     output), <b>gray</b> (convert all colors to their gray-scale equivalents) or <b>mono</b> (convert all
                     colors to black or white).

              <b>-file</b> <u>fileName</u>
                     Specifies the name of the file in which to write the Postscript.  If this option  isn't
                     specified then the Postscript is returned as the result of the command instead of being
                     written to a file.

              <b>-fontmap</b> <u>varName</u>
                     <u>VarName</u> must be the name of an array variable that specifies a font mapping to  use  in
                     the  Postscript.  Each element of <u>varName</u> must consist of a Tcl list with two elements,
                     which are the name and point size of a Postscript  font.   When  outputting  Postscript
                     commands  for  a  particular font, Tk checks to see if <u>varName</u> contains an element with
                     the same name as the font.  If there is such an element, then the font information con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tained&nbsp;contained</font>
                     tained  in that element is used in the Postscript.  Otherwise Tk attempts to guess what
                     Postscript font to use.  Tk's guesses generally only work for well-known fonts such  as
                     Times  and  Helvetica and Courier, and only if the X font name does not omit any dashes
                     up through the point size.  For example,  <b>-*-Courier-Bold-R-Normal--*-120-*</b>  will  work
                     but <b>*Courier-Bold-R-Normal*120*</b> will not;  Tk needs the dashes to parse the font name).

              <b>-height</b> <u>size</u>
                     Specifies the height of the area of the canvas to print.  Defaults to the height of the
                     canvas window.

              <b>-pageanchor</b> <u>anchor</u>
                     Specifies  which  point  of the printed area of the canvas should appear over the posi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tioning&nbsp;positioning</font>
                     tioning point on the page (which is given by the <b>-pagex</b> and <b>-pagey</b> options).  For exam-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ple,&nbsp;example,</font>
                     ple,  <b>-pageanchor</b>  <b>n</b>  means that the top center of the area of the canvas being printed
                     (as it appears in the canvas window) should be over the positioning point. Defaults  to
                     <b>center</b>.

              <b>-pageheight</b> <u>size</u>
                     Specifies that the Postscript should be scaled in both x and y so that the printed area
                     is <u>size</u> high on the Postscript page.  <u>Size</u> consists of a floating-point number followed
                     by  <b>c</b>  for  centimeters, <b>i</b> for inches, <b>m</b> for millimeters, or <b>p</b> or nothing for printer's
                     points (1/72 inch).  Defaults to the height of the printed area on the screen.  If both
                     <b>-pageheight</b>  and <b>-pagewidth</b> are specified then the scale factor from <b>-pagewidth</b> is used
                     (non-uniform scaling is not implemented).

              <b>-pagewidth</b> <u>size</u>
                     Specifies that the Postscript should be scaled in both x and y so that the printed area
                     is  <u>size</u>  wide  on  the  Postscript  page.   <u>Size</u> has the same form as for <b>-pageheight</b>.
                     Defaults to the width of the printed area on  the  screen.   If  both  <b>-pageheight</b>  and
                     <b>-pagewidth</b>  are  specified  then the scale factor from <b>-pagewidth</b>  is used (non-uniform
                     scaling is not implemented).

              <b>-pagex</b> <u>position</u>
                     <u>Position</u> gives the x-coordinate of the positioning point on the Postscript page,  using
                     any  of  the  forms  allowed  for <b>-pageheight</b>.  Used in conjunction with the <b>-pagey</b> and
                     <b>-pageanchor</b> options to determine where the printed area appears on the Postscript page.
                     Defaults to the center of the page.

              <b>-pagey</b> <u>position</u>
                     <u>Position</u>  gives the y-coordinate of the positioning point on the Postscript page, using
                     any of the forms allowed for <b>-pageheight</b>.  Used in  conjunction  with  the  <b>-pagex</b>  and
                     <b>-pageanchor</b> options to determine where the printed area appears on the Postscript page.
                     Defaults to the center of the page.

              <b>-rotate</b> <u>boolean</u>
                     <u>Boolean</u> specifies whether the printed area is to be rotated 90 degrees.  In non-rotated
                     output  the  x-axis  of  the  printed  area  runs along the short dimension of the page
                     (``portrait'' orientation); in rotated output the x-axis runs along the long  dimension
                     of the page (``landscape'' orientation).  Defaults to non-rotated.

              <b>-width</b> <u>size</u>
                     Specifies  the  width of the area of the canvas to print.  Defaults to the width of the
                     canvas window.

              <b>-x</b> <u>position</u>
                     Specifies the x-coordinate of the left edge of the area of the canvas  that  is  to  be
                     printed,  in canvas coordinates, not window coordinates.  Defaults to the coordinate of
                     the left edge of the window.

              <b>-y</b> <u>position</u>
                     Specifies the y-coordinate of the top edge of the area of the  canvas  that  is  to  be
                     printed,  in canvas coordinates, not window coordinates.  Defaults to the coordinate of
                     the top edge of the window.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>raise</b> <u>tagOrId</u> ?<u>aboveThis</u>?
              Move all of the items given by <u>tagOrId</u> to a new position in the display list  just  after  the
              item  given  by <u>aboveThis</u>.  If <u>tagOrId</u> refers to more than one item then all are moved but the
              relative order of the moved items will not be changed.  <u>AboveThis</u> is  a  tag  or  id;   if  it
              refers  to  more  than  one item then the last (topmost) of these items in the display list is
              used as the destination location for the moved items.  Note: this command  has  no  effect  on
              window  items.  Window items always obscure other item types, and the stacking order of window
              items is determined by the <b>raise</b> and <b>lower</b> commands, not the <b>raise</b> and <b>lower</b>  widget  commands
              for canvases.  This command returns an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>scale</b> <u>tagOrId</u> <u>xOrigin</u> <u>yOrigin</u> <u>xScale</u> <u>yScale</u>
              Rescale  all  of  the  items given by <u>tagOrId</u> in canvas coordinate space.  <u>XOrigin</u> and <u>yOrigin</u>
              identify the origin for the scaling operation and <u>xScale</u> and <u>yScale</u> identify the scale factors
              for  x- and y-coordinates, respectively (a scale factor of 1.0 implies no change to that coor-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dinate).&nbsp;coordinate).</font>
              dinate).  For each of the points defining each item, the x-coordinate is  adjusted  to  change
              the  distance from <u>xOrigin</u> by a factor of <u>xScale</u>.  Similarly, each y-coordinate is adjusted to
              change the distance from <u>yOrigin</u> by a factor of <u>yScale</u>.  This command returns an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>scan</b> <u>option</u> <u>args</u>
              This  command  is  used  to  implement  scanning  on canvases.  It has two forms, depending on
              <u>option</u>:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>scan</b> <b>mark</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u>
                     Records <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> and the canvas's current view;  used in  conjunction  with  later  <b>scan</b>
                     <b>dragto</b> commands.  Typically this command is associated with a mouse button press in the
                     widget and <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> are the coordinates of the mouse.  It returns an empty string.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>scan</b> <b>dragto</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u> <u>?gain?</u>.
                     This command computes the difference between its <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> arguments (which are typically
                     mouse coordinates) and the <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> arguments to the last <b>scan</b> <b>mark</b> command for the wid-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">get.&nbsp;widget.</font>
                     get.  It then adjusts the view by <u>gain</u> times the difference in coordinates, where  <u>gain</u>
                     defaults  to  10.  This command is typically associated with mouse motion events in the
                     widget, to produce the effect of dragging the canvas at high speed through its  window.
                     The return value is an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>select</b> <u>option</u> ?<u>tagOrId</u> <u>arg</u>?
              Manipulates  the  selection in one of several ways, depending on <u>option</u>.  The command may take
              any of the forms described below.  In all of the descriptions below, <u>tagOrId</u> must refer to  an
              item  that  supports indexing and selection;  if it refers to multiple items then the first of
              these that supports indexing and the selection is used.  <u>Index</u> gives a textual description  of
              a position within <u>tagOrId</u>, as described in INDICES above.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>select</b> <b>adjust</b> <u>tagOrId</u> <u>index</u>
                     Locate the end of the selection in <u>tagOrId</u> nearest to the character given by <u>index</u>, and
                     adjust that end of the selection to be at <u>index</u> (i.e. including but  not  going  beyond
                     <u>index</u>).   The  other end of the selection is made the anchor point for future <b>select</b> <b>to</b>
                     commands.  If the selection isn't currently in <u>tagOrId</u> then this  command  behaves  the
                     same as the <b>select</b> <b>to</b> widget command.  Returns an empty string.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>select</b> <b>clear</b>
                     Clear  the  selection  if  it is in this widget.  If the selection isn't in this widget
                     then the command has no effect.  Returns an empty string.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>select</b> <b>from</b> <u>tagOrId</u> <u>index</u>
                     Set the selection anchor point for the widget to be just before the character given  by
                     <u>index</u>  in  the  item  given by <u>tagOrId</u>.  This command doesn't change the selection;  it
                     just sets the fixed end of the selection for future <b>select</b>  <b>to</b>  commands.   Returns  an
                     empty string.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>select</b> <b>item</b>
                     Returns the id of the selected item, if the selection is in an item in this canvas.  If
                     the selection is not in this canvas then an empty string is returned.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>select</b> <b>to</b> <u>tagOrId</u> <u>index</u>
                     Set the selection to consist of those  characters  of  <u>tagOrId</u>  between  the  selection
                     anchor  point  and <u>index</u>.  The new selection will include the character given by <u>index</u>;
                     it will include the character given by the anchor point only if <u>index</u> is  greater  than
                     or equal to the anchor point.  The anchor point is determined by the most recent <b>select</b>
                     <b>adjust</b> or <b>select</b> <b>from</b> command for this widget.  If the selection anchor point  for  the
                     widget isn't currently in <u>tagOrId</u>, then it is set to the same character given by <u>index</u>.
                     Returns an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>type</b> <u>tagOrId</u>
              Returns the type of the item given by <u>tagOrId</u>, such as <b>rectangle</b> or <b>text</b>.  If  <u>tagOrId</u>  refers
              to  more  than  one item, then the type of the first item in the display list is returned.  If
              <u>tagOrId</u> doesn't refer to any items at all then an empty string is returned.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b>  ?<u>args</u>?
              This command is used to query and change the horizontal position of the information  displayed
              in the canvas's window.  It can take any of the following forms:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b>
                     Returns  a list containing two elements.  Each element is a real fraction between 0 and
                     1;  together they describe the horizontal span that is  visible  in  the  window.   For
                     example,  if  the first element is .2 and the second element is .6, 20% of the canvas's
                     area (as defined by the <b>-scrollregion</b> option) is off-screen to the left, the middle 40%
                     is  visible in the window, and 40% of the canvas is off-screen to the right.  These are
                     the same values passed to scrollbars via the <b>-xscrollcommand</b> option.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b> <b>moveto</b> <u>fraction</u>
                     Adjusts the view in the window so that <u>fraction</u> of the total width  of  the  canvas  is
                     off-screen to the left.  <u>Fraction</u> must be a fraction between 0 and 1.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b> <b>scroll</b> <u>number</u> <u>what</u>
                     This  command shifts the view in the window left or right according to <u>number</u> and <u>what</u>.
                     <u>Number</u> must be an integer.  <u>What</u> must be either <b>units</b> or <b>pages</b> or  an  abbreviation  of
                     one  of  these.   If  <u>what</u>  is  <b>units</b>,  the  view adjusts left or right in units of the
                     <b>xScrollIncrement</b> option, if it is greater than zero, or in units of one-tenth the  win-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dow's&nbsp;window's</font>
                     dow's  width otherwise.  If <u>what</u> <u>is</u> <b>pages</b> then the view adjusts in units of nine-tenths
                     the window's width.  If <u>number</u> is negative then information farther to the left becomes
                     visible;  if it is positive then information farther to the right becomes visible.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b> <u>?args</u>?
              This command is used to query and change the vertical position of the information displayed in
              the canvas's window.  It can take any of the following forms:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b>
                     Returns a list containing two elements.  Each element is a real fraction between 0  and
                     1;   together they describe the vertical span that is visible in the window.  For exam-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ple,&nbsp;example,</font>
                     ple, if the first element is .6 and the second element is 1.0, the lowest  40%  of  the
                     canvas's area (as defined by the <b>-scrollregion</b> option) is visible in the window.  These
                     are the same values passed to scrollbars via the <b>-yscrollcommand</b> option.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b> <b>moveto</b> <u>fraction</u>
                     Adjusts the view in the window so that <u>fraction</u> of the canvas's area is  off-screen  to
                     the top.  <u>Fraction</u> is a fraction between 0 and 1.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b> <b>scroll</b> <u>number</u> <u>what</u>
                     This  command  adjusts  the view in the window up or down according to <u>number</u> and <u>what</u>.
                     <u>Number</u> must be an integer.  <u>What</u> must be either <b>units</b> or <b>pages</b>.  If <u>what</u> is <b>units</b>,  the
                     view  adjusts up or down in units of the <b>yScrollIncrement</b> option, if it is greater than
                     zero, or in units of one-tenth the window's height otherwise.  If <u>what</u>  is  <b>pages</b>  then
                     the  view  adjusts  in units of nine-tenths the window's height.  If <u>number</u> is negative
                     then higher information becomes visible;  if it  is  positive  then  lower  information
                     becomes visible.


<b>OVERVIEW</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ITEM</b> <b>TYPES</b>
       The  sections  below describe the various types of items supported by canvas widgets.  Each item type
       is characterized by two things: first, the form of the <b>create</b> command used to create instances of the
       type;   and  second,  a set of configuration options for items of that type, which may be used in the
       <b>create</b> and <b>itemconfigure</b> widget commands.  Most items don't support indexing or selection or the com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mands&nbsp;commands</font>
       mands  related  to  them,  such  as <b>index</b> and <b>insert</b>.  Where items do support these facilities, it is
       noted explicitly in the descriptions below.  At present, text, line and polygon  items  provide  this
       support.   For  lines and polygons the indexing facility is used to manipulate the coordinates of the
       item.


<b>COMMON</b> <b>ITEM</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       Many items share a common set of options.  These options are explained here, and then referred to  be
       each widget type for brevity.


       <b>-dash</b> <u>pattern</u>

       <b>-activedash</b> <u>pattern</u>

       <b>-disableddash</b> <u>pattern</u>
              This  option  specifies  dash  patterns for the normal, active state, and disabled state of an
              item.  <u>pattern</u> may have any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetDash</b>.   If  the  dash  options  are
              omitted then the default is a solid outline.  See "DASH PATTERNS" for more information.

       <b>-dashoffset</b> <u>offset</u>
              The  starting  <u>offset</u> in pixels into the pattern provided by the <b>-dash</b> option.  <b>-dashoffset</b> is
              ignored if there is no <b>-dash</b> pattern.  The <u>offset</u> may have any of the forms described  in  the
              COORDINATES section above.

       <b>-fill</b> <u>color</u>

       <b>-activefill</b> <u>color</u>

       <b>-disabledfill</b> <u>color</u>
              Specifies  the  color  to  be  used  to fill item's area.  in its normal, active, and disabled
              states, <u>Color</u> may have any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetColor</b>.  If <u>color</u> is an empty  string
              (the  default),  then  then  the item will not be filled.  For the line item, it specifies the
              color of the line drawn.  For the text item, it specifies the foreground color of the text.

       <b>-outline</b> <u>color</u>

       <b>-activeoutline</b> <u>color</u>

       <b>-disabledoutline</b> <u>color</u>
              This option specifies the color that should be used to draw the outline of  the  item  in  its
              normal,  active and disabled states.  <u>Color</u> may have any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetColor</b>.
              This option defaults to <b>black</b>.  If <u>color</u> is specified as an empty string then  no  outline  is
              drawn for the item.

       <b>-offset</b> <u>offset</u>
              Specifies the offset of stipples.  The offset value can be of the form <b>x,y</b> or <b>side</b>, where side
              can be <b>n</b>, <b>ne</b>, <b>e</b>, <b>se</b>, <b>s</b>, <b>sw</b>, <b>w</b>, <b>nw</b>, or <b>center</b>. In the first case the origin is  the  origin  of
              the  toplevel  of  the current window.  For the canvas itself and canvas objects the origin is
              the canvas origin, but putting <b>#</b> in front of the coordinate pair indicates using the  toplevel
              origin instead. For canvas objects, the <b>-offset</b> option is used for stippling as well.  For the
              line and polygon canvas items you can also specify an index as argument,  which  connects  the
              stipple origin to one of the coordinate points of the line/polygon.

       <b>-outlinestipple</b> <u>bitmap</u>

       <b>-activeoutlinestipple</b> <u>bitmap</u>

       <b>-disabledoutlinestipple</b> <u>bitmap</u>
              This  option specifies stipple patterns that should be used to draw the outline of the item in
              its normal, active and disabled states.  Indicates that the outline for  the  item  should  be
              drawn with a stipple pattern; <u>bitmap</u> specifies the stipple pattern to use, in any of the forms
              accepted by <b>Tk_GetBitmap</b>.  If the <b>-outline</b> option hasn't been specified then this  option  has
              no  effect.   If <u>bitmap</u> is an empty string (the default), then the outline is drawn in a solid
              fashion.

       <b>-stipple</b> <u>bitmap</u>

       <b>-activestipple</b> <u>bitmap</u>

       <b>-disabledstipple</b> <u>bitmap</u>
              This option specifies stipple patterns that should be used to fill the the item in its normal,
              active  and disabled states.  <u>bitmap</u> specifies the stipple pattern to use, in any of the forms
              accepted by <b>Tk_GetBitmap</b>.  If the <b>-fill</b> option hasn't been specified then this option  has  no
              effect.   If <u>bitmap</u> is an empty string (the default), then filling is done in a solid fashion.
              For the text item, it affects the actual text.

       <b>-state</b> <u>state</u>
              This allows an item to override the canvas widget's global <u>state</u> option.  It  takes  the  same
              values: <u>normal</u>, <u>disabled</u> or <u>hidden</u>.

       <b>-tags</b> <u>tagList</u>
              Specifies  a set of tags to apply to the item.  <u>TagList</u> consists of a list of tag names, which
              replace any existing tags for the item.  <u>TagList</u> may be an empty list.

       <b>-width</b> <u>outlineWidth</u>

       <b>-activewidth</b> <u>outlineWidth</u>

       <b>-disabledwidth</b> <u>outlineWidth</u>
              Specifies the width of the outline to be drawn around the item's region, in its normal, active
              and  disabled  states.   <u>outlineWidth</u>  may be in any of the forms described in the COORDINATES
              section above.  If the <b>-outline</b> option has been specified as an empty string then this  option
              has  no  effect.  This option defaults to 1.0.  For arcs, wide outlines will be drawn centered
              on the edges of the arc's region.


<b>ARC</b> <b>ITEMS</b>
       Items of type <b>arc</b> appear on the display as arc-shaped regions.  An arc is a section of an oval delim-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ited&nbsp;delimited</font>
       ited by two angles (specified by the <b>-start</b> and <b>-extent</b> options) and displayed in one of several ways
       (specified by the <b>-style</b> option).  Arcs are created with widget commands of the following form:
              <u>pathName</u> <b>create</b> <b>arc</b> <u>x1</u> <u>y1</u> <u>x2</u> <u>y2</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              <u>pathName</u> <b>create</b> <b>arc</b> <u>coordList</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
       The arguments <u>x1</u>, <u>y1</u>, <u>x2</u>, and <u>y2</u> or <u>coordList</u> give the coordinates of two diagonally opposite corners
       of  a rectangular region enclosing the oval that defines the arc.  After the coordinates there may be
       any number of <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs, each of which sets one of the configuration options for  the  item.
       These  same <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs may be used in <b>itemconfigure</b> widget commands to change the item's con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">figuration.&nbsp;configuration.</font>
       figuration.
       The following standard options are supported by arcs:
              -dash
              -activedash
              -disableddash
              -dashoffset
              -fill
              -activefill
              -disabledfill
              -offset
              -outline
              -activeoutline
              -disabledoutline
              -outlinestipple
              -activeoutlinestipple
              -disabledoutlinestipple
              -stipple
              -activestipple
              -disabledstipple
              -state
              -tags
              -width
              -activewidth
              -disabledwidth
       The following extra options are supported for arcs:

       <b>-extent</b> <u>degrees</u>
              Specifies the size of the angular range occupied by the arc.   The  arc's  range  extends  for
              <u>degrees</u> degrees counter-clockwise from the starting angle given by the <b>-start</b> option.  <u>Degrees</u>
              may be negative.  If it is greater than 360 or less than -360, then <u>degrees</u> modulo 360 is used
              as the extent.

       <b>-start</b> <u>degrees</u>
              Specifies  the  beginning of the angular range occupied by the arc.  <u>Degrees</u> is given in units
              of degrees measured counter-clockwise from the 3-o'clock position;  it may be either  positive
              or negative.

       <b>-style</b> <u>type</u>
              Specifies  how  to  draw  the arc.  If <u>type</u> is <b>pieslice</b> (the default) then the arc's region is
              defined by a section of the oval's perimeter plus two line segments, one between the center of
              the  oval  and  each  end of the perimeter section.  If <u>type</u> is <b>chord</b> then the arc's region is
              defined by a section of the oval's perimeter plus a single line segment connecting the two end
              points  of  the perimeter section.  If <u>type</u> is <b>arc</b> then the arc's region consists of a section
              of the perimeter alone.  In this last case the <b>-fill</b> option is ignored.


<b>BITMAP</b> <b>ITEMS</b>
       Items of type <b>bitmap</b> appear on the display as images with  two  colors,  foreground  and  background.
       Bitmaps are created with widget commands of the following form:
              <u>pathName</u> <b>create</b> <b>bitmap</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              <u>pathName</u> <b>create</b> <b>bitmap</b> <u>coordList</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
       The  arguments <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> or <u>coordList</u> specify the coordinates of a point used to position the bitmap on
       the display (see the <b>-anchor</b> option below for more information on how bitmaps are displayed).   After
       the coordinates there may be any number of <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs, each of which sets one of the configu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ration&nbsp;configuration</font>
       ration options for the item.  These same <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs may be used in <b>itemconfigure</b> widget  com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mands&nbsp;commands</font>
       mands to change the item's configuration.
       The following standard options are supported by bitmaps:
              -state
              -tags
       The following extra options are supported for bitmaps:

       <b>-anchor</b> <u>anchorPos</u>
              <u>AnchorPos</u> tells how to position the bitmap relative to the positioning point for the item;  it
              may have any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetAnchor</b>.  For example, if <u>anchorPos</u> is <b>center</b>  then
              the  bitmap is centered on the point;  if <u>anchorPos</u> is <b>n</b> then the bitmap will be drawn so that
              its top center point is at the positioning point.  This option defaults to <b>center</b>.

       <b>-background</b> <u>color</u>

       <b>-activebackground</b> <u>bitmap</u>

       <b>-disabledbackground</b> <u>bitmap</u>
              Specifies the color to use for each of the bitmap's '0' valued pixels in  its  normal,  active
              and disabled states.  <u>Color</u> may have any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetColor</b>.  If this option
              isn't specified, or if it is specified as an empty string, then nothing is displayed where the
              bitmap pixels are 0;  this produces a transparent effect.

       <b>-bitmap</b> <u>bitmap</u>

       <b>-activebitmap</b> <u>bitmap</u>

       <b>-disabledbitmap</b> <u>bitmap</u>
              Specifies  the bitmaps to display in the item in its normal, active and disabled states.  <u>Bit</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">map&nbsp;Bitmap</font>
              <u>map</u> may have any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetBitmap</b>.

       <b>-foreground</b> <u>color</u>

       <b>-activeforeground</b> <u>bitmap</u>

       <b>-disabledforeground</b> <u>bitmap</u>
              Specifies the color to use for each of the bitmap's '1' valued pixels in  its  normal,  active
              and  disabled states.  <u>Color</u> may have any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetColor</b> and defaults to
              <b>black</b>.


<b>IMAGE</b> <b>ITEMS</b>
       Items of type <b>image</b> are used to display images on a canvas.  Images are created with widget  commands
       of the following form:
              <u>pathName</u> <b>create</b> <b>image</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              <u>pathName</u> <b>create</b> <b>image</b> <u>coordList</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
       The  arguments  <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> or <u>coordList</u> specify the coordinates of a point used to position the image on
       the display (see the <b>-anchor</b> option below for more information).  After the coordinates there may  be
       any  number  of <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs, each of which sets one of the configuration options for the item.
       These same <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs may be used in <b>itemconfigure</b> widget commands to change the item's  con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">figuration.&nbsp;configuration.</font>
       figuration.
       The following standard options are supported by images:
              -state
              -tags
       The following extra options are supported for images:

       <b>-anchor</b> <u>anchorPos</u>
              <u>AnchorPos</u>  tells how to position the image relative to the positioning point for the item;  it
              may have any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetAnchor</b>.  For example, if <u>anchorPos</u> is <b>center</b>  then
              the  image  is  centered on the point;  if <u>anchorPos</u> is <b>n</b> then the image will be drawn so that
              its top center point is at the positioning point.  This option defaults to <b>center</b>.

       <b>-image</b> <u>name</u>

       <b>-activeimage</b> <u>name</u>

       <b>-disabledimage</b> <u>name</u>
              Specifies the name of the images to display in the item in  is  normal,  active  and  disabled
              states.  This image must have been created previously with the <b>image</b> <b>create</b> command.


<b>LINE</b> <b>ITEMS</b>
       Items  of  type  <b>line</b>  appear  on the display as one or more connected line segments or curves.  Line
       items support coordinate indexing operations using the canvas widget commands: <b>dchars,</b> <b>index,</b> <b>insert.</b>
       Lines are created with widget commands of the following form:
              <u>pathName</u> <b>create</b> <b>line</b> <u>x1</u> <u>y1...</u> <u>xn</u> <u>yn</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              <u>pathName</u> <b>create</b> <b>line</b> <u>coordList</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
       The arguments <u>x1</u> through <u>yn</u> or <u>coordList</u> give the coordinates for a series of two or more points that
       describe a series of connected line segments.  After the coordinates  there  may  be  any  number  of
       <u>option</u>-<u>value</u>  pairs,  each  of  which sets one of the configuration options for the item.  These same
       <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs may be used in <b>itemconfigure</b> widget commands to change the item's configuration.
       The following standard options are supported by lines:
              -dash
              -activedash
              -disableddash
              -dashoffset
              -fill
              -activefill
              -disabledfill
              -stipple
              -activestipple
              -disabledstipple
              -state
              -tags
              -width
              -activewidth
              -disabledwidth
       The following extra options are supported for lines:

       <b>-arrow</b> <u>where</u>
              Indicates whether or not arrowheads are to be drawn at one or both ends of  the  line.   <u>Where</u>
              must  have  one  of  the values <b>none</b> (for no arrowheads), <b>first</b> (for an arrowhead at the first
              point of the line), <b>last</b> (for an arrowhead at the last point of the line), or <b>both</b> (for arrow-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">heads&nbsp;arrowheads</font>
              heads at both ends).  This option defaults to <b>none</b>.

       <b>-arrowshape</b> <u>shape</u>
              This  option  indicates  how to draw arrowheads.  The <u>shape</u> argument must be a list with three
              elements, each specifying a distance in any of the forms described in the COORDINATES  section
              above.   The  first element of the list gives the distance along the line from the neck of the
              arrowhead to its tip.  The second element gives the distance along the line from the  trailing
              points  of the arrowhead to the tip, and the third element gives the distance from the outside
              edge of the line to the trailing points.  If this option  isn't  specified  then  Tk  picks  a
              ``reasonable'' shape.

       <b>-capstyle</b> <u>style</u>
              Specifies the ways in which caps are to be drawn at the endpoints of the line.  <u>Style</u> may have
              any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetCapStyle</b> (<b>butt</b>, <b>projecting</b>,  or  <b>round</b>).   If  this  option
              isn't  specified  then  it  defaults  to  <b>butt</b>.   Where  arrowheads are drawn the cap style is
              ignored.

       <b>-joinstyle</b> <u>style</u>
              Specifies the ways in which joints are to be drawn at the vertices of  the  line.   <u>Style</u>  may
              have  any  of  the  forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetCapStyle</b> (<b>bevel</b>, <b>miter</b>, or <b>round</b>).  If this option
              isn't specified then it defaults to <b>miter</b>.  If the line only contains  two  points  then  this
              option is irrelevant.

       <b>-smooth</b> <u>smoothMethod</u>
              <u>smoothMethod</u>  must have one of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetBoolean</b> or a line smoothing method.
              Only <b>bezier</b> is supported in the core, but more can be added at runtime.  If  a  boolean  false
              value  or empty string is given, no smoothing is applied.  A boolean truth value assume <b>bezier</b>
              smoothing.  It indicates whether or not the line should be drawn as a curve.  If so, the  line
              is  rendered  as a set of parabolic splines: one spline is drawn for the first and second line
              segments, one for the second and third, and so on.  Straight-line segments  can  be  generated
              within a curve by duplicating the end-points of the desired line segment.

       <b>-splinesteps</b> <u>number</u>
              Specifies  the degree of smoothness desired for curves:  each spline will be approximated with
              <u>number</u> line segments.  This option is ignored unless the <b>-smooth</b> option is true.


<b>OVAL</b> <b>ITEMS</b>
       Items of type <b>oval</b> appear as circular or oval regions on the display.  Each oval may have an outline,
       a fill, or both.  Ovals are created with widget commands of the following form:
              <u>pathName</u> <b>create</b> <b>oval</b> <u>x1</u> <u>y1</u> <u>x2</u> <u>y2</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              <u>pathName</u> <b>create</b> <b>oval</b> <u>coordList</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
       The arguments <u>x1</u>, <u>y1</u>, <u>x2</u>, and <u>y2</u> or <u>coordList</u> give the coordinates of two diagonally opposite corners
       of a rectangular region enclosing the oval.  The oval will include the top and left edges of the rec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tangle&nbsp;rectangle</font>
       tangle  not  the  lower or right edges.  If the region is square then the resulting oval is circular;
       otherwise it is elongated in shape.  After the coordinates there may be any  number  of  <u>option</u>-<u>value</u>
       pairs,  each  of  which  sets one of the configuration options for the item.  These same <u>option</u>-<u>value</u>
       pairs may be used in <b>itemconfigure</b> widget commands to change the item's configuration.
       The following standard options are supported by ovals:
              -dash
              -activedash
              -disableddash
              -dashoffset
              -fill
              -activefill
              -disabledfill
              -offset
              -outline
              -activeoutline
              -disabledoutline
              -outlinestipple
              -activeoutlinestipple

              -width
              -activewidth
              -disabledwidth


<b>POLYGON</b> <b>ITEMS</b>
       Items of type <b>polygon</b> appear as polygonal or curved filled regions on  the  display.   Polygon  items
       support  coordinate  indexing  operations  using  the  canvas widget commands: <b>dchars,</b> <b>index,</b> <b>insert.</b>
       Polygons are created with widget commands of the following form:
              <u>pathName</u> <b>create</b> <b>polygon</b> <u>x1</u> <u>y1</u> <u>...</u> <u>xn</u> <u>yn</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              <u>pathName</u> <b>create</b> <b>polygon</b> <u>coordList</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
       The arguments <u>x1</u> through <u>yn</u> or <u>coordList</u> specify the coordinates for three or more points that define
       a  polygon.  The first point should not be repeated as the last to close the shape; Tk will automati-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cally&nbsp;automatically</font>
       cally close the periphery between the first and last points.  After the coordinates there may be  any
       number  of  <u>option</u>-<u>value</u>  pairs,  each  of  which sets one of the configuration options for the item.
       These same <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs may be used in <b>itemconfigure</b> widget commands to change the item's  con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">figuration.&nbsp;configuration.</font>

       The following extra options are supported for polygons:

       <b>-joinstyle</b> <u>style</u>
              Specifies  the ways in which joints are to be drawn at the vertices of the outline.  <u>Style</u> may
              have any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetCapStyle</b> (<b>bevel</b>, <b>miter</b>, or  <b>round</b>).   If  this  option
              isn't specified then it defaults to <b>miter</b>.

       <b>-smooth</b> <u>boolean</u>
              <u>Boolean</u>  must  have one of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetBoolean</b> It indicates whether or not the
              polygon should be drawn with a curved perimeter.  If so, the outline of the polygon becomes  a
              set  of parabolic splines, one spline for the first and second line segments, one for the sec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ond&nbsp;second</font>
              ond and third, and so on.  Straight-line segments can be generated in a  smoothed  polygon  by
              duplicating the end-points of the desired line segment.

       <b>-splinesteps</b> <u>number</u>
              Specifies  the degree of smoothness desired for curves:  each spline will be approximated with
              <u>number</u> line segments.  This option is ignored unless the <b>-smooth</b> option is true.

       Polygon items are different from other items such as rectangles, ovals  and  arcs  in  that  interior
       points  are  considered  to  be  ``inside'' a polygon (e.g. for purposes of the <b>find</b> <b>closest</b> and <b>find</b>
       <b>overlapping</b> widget commands) even if it is not filled.  For most other item types, an interior  point
       is  considered  to  be  inside the item only if the item is filled or if it has neither a fill nor an
       outline.  If you would like an unfilled polygon whose interior points are not considered to be inside
       the polygon, use a line item instead.


<b>RECTANGLE</b> <b>ITEMS</b>
       Items  of  type  <b>rectangle</b>  appear as rectangular regions on the display.  Each rectangle may have an
       outline, a fill, or both.  Rectangles are created with widget commands of the following form:
              <u>pathName</u> <b>create</b> <b>rectangle</b> <u>x1</u> <u>y1</u> <u>x2</u> <u>y2</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              <u>pathName</u> <b>create</b> <b>rectangle</b> <u>coordList</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
       The arguments <u>x1</u>, <u>y1</u>, <u>x2</u>, and <u>y2</u> or <u>coordList</u> give the coordinates of two diagonally opposite corners
       of  the  rectangle  (the  rectangle  will include its upper and left edges but not its lower or right
       edges).  After the coordinates there may be any number of <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs, each of which sets  one
       of  the configuration options for the item.  These same <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs may be used in <b>itemconfig</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ure&nbsp;itemconfigure</font>
       <b>ure</b> widget commands to change the item's configuration.
       The following standard options are supported by rectangles:
              -dash
              -activedash
              -disableddash
              -dashoffset
              -fill
              -activefill
              -disabledfill

              -width
              -activewidth
              -disabledwidth


<b>TEXT</b> <b>ITEMS</b>
       A text item displays a string of characters on the screen in one or more lines.  Text  items  support
       indexing and selection, along with the following text-related canvas widget commands:  <b>dchars</b>, <b>focus</b>,
       <b>icursor</b>, <b>index</b>, <b>insert</b>, <b>select</b>.  Text items are created with widget commands of the following form:
              <u>pathName</u> <b>create</b> <b>text</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              <u>pathName</u> <b>create</b> <b>text</b> <u>coordList</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
       The arguments <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> or <u>coordList</u> specify the coordinates of a point used to position  the  text  on
       the display (see the options below for more information on how text is displayed).  After the coordi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nates&nbsp;coordinates</font>
       nates there may be any number of <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs, each of which  sets  one  of  the  configuration
       options  for the item.  These same <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs may be used in <b>itemconfigure</b> widget commands to
       change the item's configuration.
       The following standard options are supported by text items:
              -fill
              -activefill
              -disabledfill
              -stipple
              -activestipple
              -disabledstipple
              -state
              -tags
       The following extra options are supported for text items:

       <b>-anchor</b> <u>anchorPos</u>
              <u>AnchorPos</u> tells how to position the text relative to the positioning point for the  text;   it
              may  have any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetAnchor</b>.  For example, if <u>anchorPos</u> is <b>center</b> then
              the text is centered on the point;  if <u>anchorPos</u> is <b>n</b> then the text will be  drawn  such  that
              the top center point of the rectangular region occupied by the text will be at the positioning
              point.  This option defaults to <b>center</b>.

       <b>-font</b> <u>fontName</u>
              Specifies the font to use for the text item.  <u>FontName</u> may be any string acceptable to <b>Tk_Get</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">Font.&nbsp;Tk_GetFont.</font>
              <b>Font</b>.  If this option isn't specified, it defaults to a system-dependent font.

       <b>-justify</b> <u>how</u>
              Specifies  how  to justify the text within its bounding region.  <u>How</u> must be one of the values
              <b>left</b>, <b>right</b>, or <b>center</b>.  This option will only matter if the text  is  displayed  as  multiple
              lines.  If the option is omitted, it defaults to <b>left</b>.

       <b>-text</b> <u>string</u>
              <u>String</u>  specifies  the  characters to be displayed in the text item.  Newline characters cause
              line breaks.  The characters in the item may also be changed with the <b>insert</b> and <b>delete</b> widget
              commands.  This option defaults to an empty string.

       <b>-width</b> <u>lineLength</u>
              Specifies a maximum line length for the text, in any of the forms described in the COORDINATES
              section above.  If this option is zero (the default) the text is broken  into  lines  only  at
              newline  characters.   However,  if this option is non-zero then any line that would be longer
              than <u>lineLength</u> is broken just before a space character to make the line  shorter  than  <u>line</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">Length;&nbsp;lineLength;</font>
              <u>Length</u>;  the space character is treated as if it were a newline character.


<b>WINDOW</b> <b>ITEMS</b>
       Items  of  type  <b>window</b>  cause a particular window to be displayed at a given position on the canvas.
       Window items are created with widget commands of the following form:
              <u>pathName</u> <b>create</b> <b>window</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              <u>pathName</u> <b>create</b> <b>window</b> <u>coordList</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
       The arguments <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> or <u>coordList</u> specify the coordinates of a point used to position the window  on
       the  display (see the <b>-anchor</b> option below for more information on how bitmaps are displayed).  After
       the coordinates there may be any number of <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs, each of which sets one of the configu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ration&nbsp;configuration</font>
       ration  options for the item.  These same <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs may be used in <b>itemconfigure</b> widget com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mands&nbsp;commands</font>
       mands to change the item's configuration.
       The following standard options are supported by window items:
              -state
              -tags
       The following extra options are supported for window items:

       <b>-anchor</b> <u>anchorPos</u>
              <u>AnchorPos</u> tells how to position the window relative to the positioning point for the item;  it
              may  have any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetAnchor</b>.  For example, if <u>anchorPos</u> is <b>center</b> then
              the window is centered on the point;  if <u>anchorPos</u> is <b>n</b> then the window will be drawn so  that
              its top center point is at the positioning point.  This option defaults to <b>center</b>.

       <b>-height</b> <u>pixels</u>
              Specifies  the  height  to  assign  to  the  item's  window.  <u>Pixels</u> may have any of the forms
              described in the COORDINATES section above.  If this option isn't specified, or if it is spec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ified&nbsp;specified</font>
              ified as an empty string, then the window is given whatever height it requests internally.

       <b>-width</b> <u>pixels</u>
              Specifies  the  width  to  assign  to  the  item's  window.   <u>Pixels</u> may have any of the forms
              described in the COORDINATES section above.  If this option isn't specified, or if it is spec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ified&nbsp;specified</font>
              ified as an empty string, then the window is given whatever width it requests internally.

       <b>-window</b> <u>pathName</u>
              Specifies  the  window  to  associate  with  this item.  The window specified by <u>pathName</u> must
              either be a child of the canvas widget or a child of  some  ancestor  of  the  canvas  widget.
              <u>PathName</u> may not refer to a top-level window.

       Note:   due  to  restrictions  in the ways that windows are managed, it is not possible to draw other
       graphical items (such as lines and images) on top of window items.  A window item always obscures any
       graphics that overlap it, regardless of their order in the display list.


<b>APPLICATION-DEFINED</b> <b>ITEM</b> <b>TYPES</b>
       It  is possible for individual applications to define new item types for canvas widgets using C code.
       See the documentation for <b>Tk_CreateItemType</b>.


<b>BINDINGS</b>
       In the current implementation, new canvases are not given any default behavior:  you'll have to  exe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cute&nbsp;execute</font>
       cute explicit Tcl commands to give the canvas its behavior.


<b>CREDITS</b>
       Tk's  canvas  widget  is  a  blatant  ripoff of ideas from Joel Bartlett's <u>ezd</u> program.  <u>Ezd</u> provides
       structured graphics in a Scheme environment and preceded canvases by a year or two.  Its simple mech-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">anisms&nbsp;mechanisms</font>
       anisms for placing and animating graphical objects inspired the functions of canvases.
