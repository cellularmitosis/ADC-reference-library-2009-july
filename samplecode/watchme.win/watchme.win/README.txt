README - WatchMe

WatchMe is a custom application intended to support the WatchMe.mov movie on the
QuickTime 3 SDK (Software Development Kit). Its sole reason for existing is to
convert relative URLs (contained in wired sprite actions) to absolute URLs (for
consumption by the movie controller).  Currently the movie controller cannot handle
relative URLs.

WatchMe is just like most other QuickTime movie players, except that it intercepts
movie controller actions of type mcActionLinkToURL. (In the WatchMe.mov movie, these
actions are generated by wired sprite actions). It inspects the URL passed with the action
and, if it's a relative URL, converts it into an absolute URL before passing it on to the
movie controller.

Most of the code unique to WatchMe is contained in the file WatchMe.c.

Enjoy,
