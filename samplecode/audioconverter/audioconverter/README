README - AudioConverterAudioConverter is a sample application that illustrates how to use the Sound Manager's SoundConverter routines to convert AIFF and AIFC files (hereafter referred to as "AIFF/AIFC files") into either AIFF/AIFC files or QuickTime movies. It also illustrates how to parse AIFF/AIFC files.You should note in particular that the AudioConverter source code shows how to handle the compression parameters chunk that might be present in an AIFF/AIFC file. The compression parameters chunk contains parameters that are required to decompress the audio data in the file. See the electronic document MacOS_Sound.pdf for more information about the compression parameters chunk and the audio atoms list it contains.NOTE FOR BUILDING WINDOWS APPLICATION USING CODEWARRIORIf you use the CodeWarrior project (AudioConvert.mcp) to build a Windows target, you need to add the Macintosh resources to the .exe file built by CodeWarrior. Do it like this:(1) Build the .exe file using CW on the Mac.(2) Copy AudioConvert.exe, AudioConvert.r, and AudioConvert.rez.bat to a Windows machine. Put them in the folder that contains the QuickTimeSDK folder.(3) Run the batch file AudioConvert.rez.bat. If all goes successfully, the resulting file AudioConvert.exe will be your final application.Enjoy!QuickTime team07 July 1999
