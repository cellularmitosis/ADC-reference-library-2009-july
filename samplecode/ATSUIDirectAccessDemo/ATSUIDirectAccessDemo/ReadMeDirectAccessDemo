DirectAccessDemo 1.0

The DirectAccessDemo sample code demonstrates some basic manipulations of the Mac OS X 10.2.x (and beyond) Apple Type Services for Unicode Imaging (ATSUI) DirectAccess api. The DirectAccess api allows direct access to glyph data during the ATSUI layout process via callbacks. The ATSUI DirectAccess api is only available in Mac OS X 10.2.x (and beyond). This sample will not run as is on systems prior to Mac OS X 10.2.x.
