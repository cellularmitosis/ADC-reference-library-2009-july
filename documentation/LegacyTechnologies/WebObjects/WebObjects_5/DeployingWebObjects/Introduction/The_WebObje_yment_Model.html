Theadaptor does this while performing <b>load balancing</b> todistribute an application's users among its active instances.Load balancing helps to spread the user load of your site evenlyacross your application hosts.</font></li><li><b>Application instances</b> individual processesthat receive requests from the HTTP adaptor and send responses backto it. To create a response, an instance can perform calculations,or save or retrieve data from a datasource.</font></li><li><b>Datasource adaptor</b> interface betweenan application instance and your datasource. WebObjects includesa <b>JDBC</b> (Java Database Connectivity) adaptor,allowing your applications to connect to any JDBC-compliant database.<p>ForJDBC connectivity, your database needs a JDBC driver, which youobtain from your database vendor. WebObjects applications can connectto databases that use Type 2 (partly Java) or Type 4 (all Java)JDBC drivers. The JDBC adaptor included with WebObjects Deploymenthas been certified to work adequately with Type 4 drivers. Type2 drivers may require special configuration for them to work properlywith the adaptor. If your database provides a Type 2 driver, consultwith your database vendor to determine how it needs to be configuredto work properly with a JDBC adaptor.</p></font></li><li><b>Datasource</b> the mechanism that yourapplications use to store persistent data. Consult with your datasourcevendor to obtain configuration and optimization details.</font></li></ul><p>When an application user sends a request through a Web browserto your Web server, the server forwards the request to the HTTPadaptor. The adaptor then determines which application instanceshould process the request and forwards the request to it. Whenthe application instance receives the request, it performs all thenecessary processing to produce a response (a new Web page). Theinstance then sends the response page to the adaptor, which forwardsit to the Web server. The Web server then forwards the response pageto the user's Web browser. This process is illustrated in  <a href="#BAJCHIID">Figure 2-1</a>.</p><br><a name = "BAJCHIID"></a><p><b><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">Figure2-1 WebObjects deployment model</font></b></p> <img src = "../Art/deploymentmodel.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/deploymentmodel.gif]"><p>Notice that both the application instance and the Web servercontribute to the response page's content. The instance uses templatesand logic to generate the HTML code for dynamic pages, while theWeb server provides the content of images contained in those pages.The server can also dispense static pages.</p><p>The number of instances of your application necessary to supportits users depends on the number of users that connect to your applicationconcurrently. In some cases a single instance is adequate. Whenone instance is not able to process requests in a timely manner, additionalinstances can solve the problem. This way, the amount of user-stateinformation that a single instance stores is reduced. In addition,with less state to keep track of, an instance can process requestsfaster.  <a href="#BAJJCEGA">Figure 2-2</a> shows a site with one host running multiple instancesof an application.</p><br><a name = "BAJJCEGA"></a><p><b><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">Figure2-2 WebObjects deployment model&#151;multipleinstances of an application</font></b></p> <img src = "../Art/deploymentmodel2.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/deploymentmodel2.gif]"><p>However, adding instances of your application to a host maynot be the most effective solution. Eventually a point of diminishingreturns will be reached, where adding instances actually decreasesyour application's performance. In such a case, you should consideradding additional application hosts that run the extra instancesrequired to handle the increased traffic to your site.  <a href="#BBCGJGGA">Figure 2-3</a> showshow a site with two computers, one acting as a Web server and applicationhost, and the other just as an application host would look.</p><br><a name = "BBCGJGGA"></a><p><b><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">Figure2-3 Deployment using two computers</font></b></p> <img src = "../Art/twomachines.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/twomachines.gif]"><br>    <br><a href="Introductio__Deployment.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/previous.gif" border="0"></a><a href="The_WebObje_Environment.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/next.gif" border="0"></a>&nbsp;<br><hr><p><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">&#169; 2001 Apple Computer, Inc.
