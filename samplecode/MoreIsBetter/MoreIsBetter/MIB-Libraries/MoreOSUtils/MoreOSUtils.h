	Change History (most recent first):

$Log: MoreOSUtils.h,v $
Revision 1.10  2003/04/09 19:45:07         
Moved a bunch of low-level Gestalt routines from MoreToolbox to MoreOSUtils.

Revision 1.9  2002/11/08 23:52:12         
When using framework includes, explicitly include the frameworks we need. Only include <CFString.h> when building Carbon.

Revision 1.8  2001/11/07 15:54:38         
Tidy up headers, add CVS logs, update copyright.


         <7>     28/9/01    Quinn   Added MoreCSCopyUserName and MoreCSCopyMachineName.
         <6>     21/9/01    Quinn   Changes for CWPro7 Mach-O build.
         <5>    24/11/00    Quinn   Make interrupt mask handling stuff CALL_NOT_IN_CARBON.
         <4>    24/11/00    Quinn   Correct routine name in previous checkin comment.
         <3>    24/11/00    Quinn   Carbon does not support 68K code generation, so I've made
                                    MakeData68KExecutable CALL_NOT_IN_CARBON. I could have made
                                    this work, at least on Mac OS 9, but I don't see the need right
                                    now.
         <2>     16/3/99    Quinn   Rolled in InterfaceDisableLib from DTS Technote 1137.
         <1>      1/3/99    Quinn   First checked in.
