// ABOUT MOCompletionManager
//
// MOCompletionManager provides a small framework for implementing 
// various types of escape completion.  The delegate of an NSTextView 
// or editable NSControl can use an instance of MOCompletionManager 
// to handle escape completion merely by calling a couple of methods
// at appropriate times.
//
// To use MOCompletionManager just alloc/init one.  Usually one 
// instance will serve a single NSTextView or editable NSControl.  
// You will need to create an array of completion strategies and 
// pass it to setCompletionStrategies:.  MOKit comes with one 
// strategy: MOFilenameCompletionStrategy.  You can create others 
// by subclass MOCompletionStrategy.  If MOCompletionManager is 
// the delegate of an NSTextView, then everything will just work, 
// but usually this is not possible because you have a controller 
// object that needs to be delegate.  Usually the controller object 
// "has-a" MOCompletionManager.  In this case, you just need to 
// implement a couple of the delegate messages to call into the 
// MOCompletionManager.
//
//         textDidChange:
//         textDidEndEditing:
//         textView:doCommandBySelector:
//
// For the first two methods, you should call dumpCompletionState in 
// the MOCompletionManager.  For the last one, you should call 
// doCompletionInTextView:startLimit:basePath: if the command 
// selector is @selector(complete:).  For controls, of course, the
// control variants of these methods would be used.
