Navigation controls.</P><P>Navigation controls provide a 'memory' function allowing you tobrowse back and forth between pages. As you click on different pages,they are accumulated into a history. At any time it is possible to goback to a previously visited page. Detailed descriptions of thecontrols shown in figure 1 follow:</P><UL>   <LI><B>Go back</B>. This command allows you to return to the most   recently visited page. That is, the page that was being displayed   before currently showing page was displayed.</LI>      <LI><B>Go back to beginning</B>. This command allows you to return   to the very first page visited. This page will be the first one   that was displayed when the window was opened.</LI>      <LI><B>Go forward</B>. After clicking 'go back' this command   allows you to return to the page that was being displayed before   the 'go back' command was clicked. Together, the 'go back' and 'go   forward' commands allow you to walk through the display   history.</LI>      <LI><B>Help</B>.
