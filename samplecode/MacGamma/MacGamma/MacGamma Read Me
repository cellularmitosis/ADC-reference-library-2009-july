What is MacGamma?MacGamma is code that one can drop into their application which provides easy access to gamma control for all system displays.  It provides safe saving and restoring of original system gamma so one does not upset users and/or other applications.The code is based on a simple 3 channel, 256 entry, 8 bit gamma ramp.  This ramp is basically an array of 256 byte size element red, green and blue channels.  All routines provided use this structure to pass information to and from the systems displays, this was chosen to simplify application usage.  Some displays may represent gamma data differently, gamma ramps are internally converted internally to what ever format the monitor requires.A few usage notes for the source:SetDeviceGammaRampXX may not return until the VBL following the call, depending on the display driver, this is due to the handling of the Control call by the driver.Startup and Shutdown:GetSystemGammas (...) must be called to save the system gammas prior to using MacGamma.RestoreSystemGamms (...)  must be called before exiting to restore original gamma.DisposeSystemGammas (...) can then be used to dispose of the system gammas.Suspend and Resume:RestoreSystemGamms (...); DisposeSystemGammas (...); should also be called prior to suspend.GetSystemGammas (...) should be called when resuming.  This architecture prevents users from unknowingly saving display settings with your modified gammas.Also provided is an interesting example application that shows the getting and setting of a system's gamma.
