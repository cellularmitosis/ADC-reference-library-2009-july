This sample demonstrates how to use the SGGetChannelDeviceList function with QuickTime 6 to build and parse the list of devices returned by this call. The data structures for this device list have changed in QuickTime 6 - they now return a list of device inputs for each device. This sample code shows how to parse these new data structures. The resulting device list along with the corresponding inputs are conveniently displayed using a Cocoa NSOutlineView.
