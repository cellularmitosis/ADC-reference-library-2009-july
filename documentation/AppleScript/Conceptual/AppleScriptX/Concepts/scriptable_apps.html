<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001569-1156165" title="Specifying Scripting Terminology"></a><h2>Specifying Scripting Terminology</h2><p>Scriptable applications describe the scripting terminology they support by supplying a scripting dictionary. A dictionary specifies the commands and objects an application supports, as well as other information that is used by AppleScript or the application itself, and possibly by other applications or scripts that want to take advantage of the application’s scriptability. For information on designing a scripting terminology, see Technical Note TN2106, <span class="content_text"><a href="http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2002/tn2106.html" target="_top">Scripting Interface Guidelines</a></span>.</p><p>Users typically examine a dictionary for information on how to control an application in their scripts. You can display the dictionary for a scriptable application or scripting addition with Script Editor, as described in <span class="content_text"><a href="work_with_as.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001568-1153006">“Displaying Scripting Dictionaries.”</a></span></p><p>There are currently three dictionary formats:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p><strong>sdef:</strong> “sdef” is short for “scripting definition.” This XML-based format is a superset of the two formats described next and supports new and improved features. Although prior to Mac OS X version 10.4, you could not use an sdef directly in your application, you could convert an sdef into either of the other formats with the <code>sdp</code> tool. Starting in Mac OS X v10.4, Cocoa applications can work natively with the sdef format, as described in <span class="content_text"><a href="../../../../Cocoa/Conceptual/ScriptableCocoaApplications/SApps_creating_sdef/SAppsCreateSdef.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001979" target="_top">Creating a Scripting Definition File</a></span> and other chapters in <em><a href="../../../../Cocoa/Conceptual/ScriptableCocoaApplications/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002164" target="_top">Cocoa Scripting Guide</a></em>.</p><p>In Mac OS X v10.5 (Leopard), it’s possible to create applications that provide dictionary information solely in sdef format, both for Carbon and Cocoa applications. You can read about additional refinements to sdef usage in Cocoa applications for Leopard in the Scripting section of <em><a href="../../../../../releasenotes/Cocoa/Foundation.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000742" target="_top">Foundation Release Notes</a></em>.</p><p>For documentation on the sdef format, including a change history, see the <code>sdef</code>(5) man page. <span class="content_text"><a href="http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2002/tn2106.html" target="_top">Scripting Interface Guidelines</a></span> also includes information on working with sdefs. For documentation on the <code>sdp</code> tool, see the man page for <code>sdp</code>(1), as well as <span class="content_text"><a href="../../../../Cocoa/Conceptual/ScriptableCocoaApplications/SApps_evolution/SAppsEvolution.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002164-CH19" target="_top">Evolution of Cocoa Scriptability Information</a></span> in <em><a href="../../../../Cocoa/Conceptual/ScriptableCocoaApplications/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002164" target="_top">Cocoa Scripting Guide</a></em>. For an example of how to use an sdef file, see the Sketch sample application.

A script suite contains a pair of information property list (plist) files that provide both AppleScript information and information used by the application.

The name comes from the Resource Manager resource type in which the information is stored (<code>'aete'</code>). An aete is useful in 10.4 and earlier, in both Carbon and Cocoa applications, to provide a dictionary that scripting languages can use without launching the application.</p></li></ul><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001571-1155730" title="Determining What to Make Scriptable"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001569-1155730-BAJEGIED" title="Determining What to Make Scriptable"></a><h2>Determining What to Make Scriptable</h2><p>In designing a scriptable application, it’s a good idea to provide access to all of the application’s main features, though it may make sense to start with just a key subset. You don’t typically make your application’s user interface directly scriptable. A good design allows users to script your application’s model objects (which represent data and basic behaviors) rather than its user interface (which presents information to the user).</p><p>For example, the scripting support for a drawing application might allow a script to rotate an image, but not to perform the user interface operation of clicking a Rotate button. Some applications provide additional capabilities through their scripting interface that aren’t otherwise available.</p><p>For design information, see “Learning How to Make an Application Scriptable” in <em><a href="../../../../../referencelibrary/GettingStarted/GS_AppleScript/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001085" target="_top">Getting Started with AppleScript</a></em> and Technical Note TN2106, <span class="content_text"><a href="http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2002/tn2106.html" target="_top">Scripting Interface Guidelines</a></span>.</p><p>For information on how to support printing in a scriptable application, see <em><a href="../../../../../technotes/tn2002/tn2082.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS10003113" target="_top">The Enhanced Print Apple Event</a></em>.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001569-DontLinkElementID_2" title="Registering to Receive Apple Events"></a><h2>Registering to Receive Apple Events</h2><p>A scriptable application typically responds to a set of common commands, such as <code>get data</code>, <code>set data</code>, <code>delete</code>, and <code>save</code>, as well as to other commands that support operations specific to the application. Commands are represented in Apple events by constants defined in framework or application headers. To support a command, an application registers an event handler routine with the Apple Event Manager to handle Apple events it receives that specify that command. The Apple Event Manager dispatches received events to the handlers registered for them.</p><div class="notebox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001569-DontLinkElementID_7" title="Note"></a><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;For Cocoa applications, commands are registered automatically, so that developers rarely need to register apple event handlers directly.</p></div><p>For more information on creating and registering event handlers, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../../AppleEvents/dispatch_aes_aepg/dispatch_aes_aepg.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001449-CH204" target="_top">Apple Event Dispatching</a></span> and <span class="content_text"><a href="../../AppleEvents/responding_aepg/responding_aepg.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001449-CH206" target="_top">Responding to Apple Events</a></span> in <em><a href="../../AppleEvents/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001449" target="_top">Apple Events Programming Guide</a></em>.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001569-1153769" title="Resolving Objects in the Application"></a><h2>Resolving Objects in the Application</h2><p>Apple events often specify items in the application. For example, a <code>get data</code> event might ask for the text of a paragraph in an open document. A distinct item in an application that can be specified in an Apple event is known as an <strong>Apple event object</strong>. (The term object does not imply that the items must be represented internally as objects in an object-oriented programming language.) All such objects are considered to be contained in other objects, with the application itself serving as the ultimate container. For a given application, the <strong>AppleScript object model</strong> (also called the Apple event object model) specifies the classes of objects a scripter can work with in scripts, the accessible properties of those objects, and the inheritance and containment relationships for those objects.</p><p>The structures within an Apple event that identify objects are referred to as <strong>object specifiers</strong>. Finding the Apple event objects they specify is known as resolving the object specifiers. To resolve object specifiers, an application must include functions that are able to find objects within their containers. The application registers these functions with the Apple Event Manager, and works with the Apple Event Manager to call them at the appropriate time to obtain the objects they specify.</p><p>For Cocoa applications, Cocoa scripting support does much of the work of resolving object specifiers, but a scriptable application must still supply methods that can locate an object within its object model containment hierarchy.</p><p>For an example of an AppleScript object model, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../../../../Cocoa/Conceptual/ScriptableCocoaApplications/SApps_about_apps/SAppsAboutApps.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001976" target="_top">About Scriptable Cocoa Applications</a></span>; for information on how Cocoa applications resolve objects, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../../../../Cocoa/Conceptual/ScriptableCocoaApplications/SApps_object_specifiers/SAppsObjectSpecifiers.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002164-CH3" target="_top">Object Specifiers</a></span>; both are in <em><a href="../../../../Cocoa/Conceptual/ScriptableCocoaApplications/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002164" target="_top">Cocoa Scripting Guide</a></em>.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001571-1153888" title="Recording"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001569-1153888-BAJICJEG" title="Recording"></a><h2>Recording</h2><p>A recordable application is one that sends Apple events to itself when a user performs actions with the application. If the user has turned on recording in the Script Editor application (with Script > Record), actions that generate Apple events are recorded into an AppleScript script.</p><p>Applications that support recording typically:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Factor code that implements the user interface from code that actually performs operations (a standard approach for applications that follow the model-view-controller design paradigm).</p></li><li class="li"><p>Send Apple events within the application to connect those two parts of the application. The Apple Event Manager provides a mechanism for doing this with a minimum of overhead, described in “Addressing an Apple Event for Direct Dispatching” in <span class="content_text"><a href="../../AppleEvents/create_send_aepg/create_send_aepg.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001449-CH209" target="_top">Creating and Sending Apple Events</a></span> in <em><a href="../../AppleEvents/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001449" target="_top">Apple Events Programming Guide</a></em>.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Make sure that any significant action or series of related actions within the application generates an Apple event.</p></li></ul><p>The Finder application in Mac OS X is recordable.

These topics are described in detail in <em><a href="../../AppleEvents/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001449" target="_top">Apple Events Programming Guide</a></em>.</p><p>For information on making your Carbon application scriptable, see previous sections in this chapter, as well as the learning paths in <em><a href="../../../../../referencelibrary/GettingStarted/GS_AppleScript/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001085" target="_top">Getting Started with AppleScript</a></em>.</p><p>Carbon applications can use functions such as <code>OSACompile</code> and <code>OSAExecute</code> from <code>OpenScripting.framework</code> to compile and execute scripts. Keep in mind, however, that if you are executing a script merely to send a simple command to another application, it is more efficient to create and send an Apple event directly.</p><p>If the purpose for executing a script is just to perform a <code>do shell script</code> command, Carbon applications can do so more efficiently using one of the BSD calls <code>system(3)</code>, <code>popen(3)</code>, or <code>exec(3)</code>, which you can read about at their respective man pages.</p>

<p>The Foundation and Application Kit frameworks provide Cocoa applications with automated handling for certain Apple events. This includes events that may be sent by the Mac OS, such as the  <code>open application</code>, <code>open documents</code>, <code>print documents</code>, and <code>quit</code> Apple events.</p><p>In addition, Cocoa provides substantial support for creating scriptable applications. To take advantage of it, applications provide scriptability information in one of the formats described in <span class="content_text"><a href="scriptable_apps.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001569-1156165">“Specifying Scripting Terminology.”</a></span> They also create KVC-compliant accessors for scriptable properties in their scriptable classes. (Key-value coding, or KVC, is described in <em><a href="../../../../Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueCoding/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000107i" target="_top">Key-Value Coding Programming Guide</a></em>.) Though creating a fully scriptable application is a non-trivial task, an application can support many standard AppleScript commands, such as those for getting and setting properties of application objects, with a relatively small number of additional steps.</p>
<p>Cocoa applications can also use any of the Open Scripting Architecture APIs available to Carbon applications, and in fact, Cocoa links with the Carbon framework. For example, a Cocoa Application might call an Apple Event Manager function to send an Apple event directly (there currently is no Cocoa API to do that).</p><p>Starting in Mac OS X version 10.5, the <span class="content_text"><a href="scripting_bridge.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006467-SW1">“Scripting Bridge”</a></span> technology provides an efficient way for Cocoa applications to interact with scriptable applications at a high level—that is, without having to construct or parse individual Apple events.</p>
<p>Cocoa provides the <code><a href="../../../../Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSAppleScript_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSAppleScript" target="_top">NSAppleScript</a></code> class for tasks such as compiling and executing scripts. This gives applications another mechanism to control scriptable applications and take advantage of services they provide. However, you should not use <code>NSAppleScript</code> to execute a script merely to result in sending an Apple event, because it is far more expensive than using Scripting Bridge or creating and sending an Apple event directly. And if the purpose for executing a script is to perform a <code>do shell script</code> command, Cocoa applications can execute shell commands more efficiently using <code><a href="../../../../Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSTask_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSTask" target="_top">NSTask</a></code>.</p>
<p>The Cocoa framework also includes classes such as <code><a href="../../../../Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSAppleEventDescriptor_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSAppleEventDescriptor" target="_top">NSAppleEventDescriptor</a></code>, for working with underlying Apple event data structures, and <code><a href="../../../../Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSAppleEventManager_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSAppleEventManager" target="_top">NSAppleEventManager</a></code>, for accessing certain Apple Event Manager functions.</p>
<p>Cocoa support for handling Apple events and creating scriptable applications is documented in <em><a href="../../../../Cocoa/Conceptual/ScriptableCocoaApplications/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002164" target="_top">Cocoa Scripting Guide</a></em>.
