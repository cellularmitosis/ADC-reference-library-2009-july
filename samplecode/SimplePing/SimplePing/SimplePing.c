 * SimplePing
 *****************************************************
 * Purpose:  This function uses the above functions to ping a given remote host with
 * a given number of packets and with a given timeout to wait for responses on each packet.
 * Note this function does not require root permissions since on MacOSX 10.2.x pings are
 * possible using non-privileged datagram sockets.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *	HostToPing 		A C-String describing the remote host.  On calling
 * SimplePing this variable will hold a description of the host as a C-String.  The string
 * can either be a hostname (e.g. www.google.com) or an IP address (e.g. 17.203.23.111)
 *
 * 	NumberOfPacketsToSend	An integer.  On calling SimplePing this variable holds
 * the number of ping packets to send to the host before stopping.
 *
 * 	PingTimeoutInSeconds	An integer.  On calling Simple Ping this variable holds
 * the amount of time SimplePing will wait for responses from the ping before going onto the next packet.
 *
 * 	ReturnimmediatelyAfterReply An integer.  On calling Simple Ping if this variable is zero then 
 * we will wait for the timeout to occur even if we get the appropriate ping reply (waiting for any other packets).
 * If this variable is non-zero then simple ping will return immediately after getting the appropriate ping reply to
 * the request.
 *
 * 	*Function Result* 	A UNIX error integer return value as described in:
 *				/usr/include/sys/errno.h on a BSD system.
 * 				Note: This value will be zero on success.
