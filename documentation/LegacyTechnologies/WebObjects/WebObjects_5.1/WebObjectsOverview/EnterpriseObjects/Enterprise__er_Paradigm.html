Forexample, model objects can hold a company's data and define thelogic that manipulates that data. Model objects are not directlydisplayed. They often are reusable, distributed, persistent, andportable to a variety of platforms.</p><br><table border = "0" BGCOLOR="#E6E6E6"><tr><td scope="row"><b>Note: </b>WebObjectsuses the term <em>model</em> differently from MVC. InWebObjects, a model establishes and maintains a correspondence betweenan enterprise object class and data stored in a relational database.In MVC, model objects represent the special knowledge of the application.</td></tr></table><br><p>View objects represent things visible on the user interface(for example, windows, buttons, and so on). A view object is ignorantof the data it displays. View objects in general are reusable, whichhelps in providing consistency between applications.</p><p>Acting as a mediator between model and view objects in anapplication is the controller object. There is usually one per applicationor window. A controller object communicates data back and forthbetween the model objects and view objects. Since what a controller doesis very specific to an application, it is generally not reusableeven though it often constitutes much of an application's code.</p><p>Because of the controller's central mediating role, modelobjects need not know about the state and events of the user interface,and view objects need not know about the programmatic interfacesof model objects.</p><p>From the perspective of this paradigm, enterprise objectsare model objects. However, WebObjects also extends the MVC paradigm.Enterprise objects are also independent of their persistent storagemechanism. Enterprise objects do not need to know about the databasethat holds their data, and the database doesn't need to know aboutthe enterprise objects.</p><br>    <br><a href="What_Is_an__ise_Object_.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/previous.gif" border="0"></a><a href="Mapping_You_base_Tables.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/next.gif" border="0"></a>&nbsp;<br><br><p><hr><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">&#169; 2002 Apple Computer, Inc.
