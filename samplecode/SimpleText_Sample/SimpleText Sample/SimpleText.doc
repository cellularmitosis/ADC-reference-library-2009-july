Hey!  What the Heck is this?!Sample: SimpleTextLanguage: MWC 10 & MPWFeedback to: devsupport@apple.comThis example is SimpleText 1.4d16. It's the same source that Apple's building (at least as I write this). We decided that enough developers had asked for SimpleText source so it was time to actually release it. Note that this code is copyright Apple Computer. The standard disclaimers apply. Here's the copyright information again for your reading enjoyment:You may incorporate this sample code into your applications without restriction, though the sample code has been provided "AS IS" and the responsibility for its operation is 100% yours.  However, what you are not permitted to do is to redistribute the source as "DSC Sample Code" after having made changes. If you're going to re-distribute the source, we require that you make it clear in the source that the code was descended from Apple Sample Code, but that you've made changes.Build notes:The CodeWarrior projects are in the CW BuildFolder folder. There are a few things to note when building SimpleText with CodeWarrior. The first is that there is the "TextFile.a.o" file, which is built from the TextFile.a source. Since CodeWarrior doesn't have an assembler, this file has been assembled with MPW asm and is included in the CW Build Folder. There are also three libraries which are included (AGFileLib.o, AGFileLib.xcoff and AppleGuideGlue.xcoff) which are also in the AppleGuide SDK, but are included with the project for your convenience.Changes since version 1.3.1:The changes (in last to first order) since version 1.3.1 are listed below.fixed bug relating to disabling of menus during printnative/FAT version nowfixed some bugs having to do with menu adjusting and hilighting.AppleGuide 2.x supportconverted to D11 headers, new SC compileropen 'ttro' documents read only even first timesupport for high res PICTs displaying correctly sizedoptimized scrolling of PICTs in ttro filesform feed support for text doc printingfixed text rotation hilight in PDDsannotation in PDDs first implementationsupport for new "Contents" menuimplemented movable modal dialog boxesselect all turns into select noneimplementing PDD find autoscrollfind now working for PDDs, minus wrap and autoscrollfixed 1272735, page down key wrappingstarted find dialog work for PDDsPICT files now support drag outPDDs support Copy, drag outPDDs now support selection, fixed some bugs in zoomingtext documents now have undo, fixed a minor bug in findPDDs now have better page browsing, proxy support, and zooming.now always respect stationary bit (112137)UpdateResFile() on save of text doc (1246237)increased RAM for new document to 64k (1249917)added find/replace for text documentsadded GX style font menuadded support for next page/prev page for text windowsadded support for all 3d button typesdisabled drag and drop for 3d views, as we don't allow edit
