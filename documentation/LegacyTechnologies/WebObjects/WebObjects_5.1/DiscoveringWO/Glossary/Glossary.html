The applicationobject's main role is to coordinate the handling of HTTP requests,but it can also maintain application-wide state information.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>attribute</b></dt><dd>In Entity-Relationship modeling, an identifiablecharacteristic of an entity. For example, <code>lastName</code> canbe an attribute of an Employee entity. An attribute typically correspondsto a column in a database table. See also <b>entity</b>; <b>relationship</b>.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>business logic</b></dt><dd>The rules associated with the data in a databasethat typically encode business policies. An example is automaticallyadding late fees for overdue items.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>CGI</b></dt><dd>A standard for communication between externalapplications and information servers, such as HTTP or Web servers.Short for Common Gateway Interface.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>class</b></dt><dd>In object-oriented languages such as Java, aprototype for a particular kind of object. A class definition declaresinstance variables and defines methods for all members of the class. Objectsthat have the same types of instance variables and have access tothe same methods belong to the same class.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>class property</b></dt><dd>An instance variable in an enterprise objectthat meets two criteria: it's based on an attribute in your model,and it can be fetched from the database. A class property can bean attribute, a relationship, a method, or an instance variable.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>column</b></dt><dd>In a relational database, the dimension ofa table that holds values for a particular attribute. For example,a table that contains employee records might have a LAST_NAME columnthat contains the values for each employee's last name. See also <b>attribute</b>.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>component</b></dt><dd>An object (of the WOComponent class) that representsa Web page or a reusable portion of one. </dd></dl><dl><dt><b>context</b></dt><dd>An object that encapsulates state informationfor a given transaction (one cycle of the request-response loop).Context objects are implemented with the WOContext class. They encapsulateinformation about the URL, context ID, application, session, component,request, and response items. WebObjects maintains a cache of WOContextobjects to support the back function of Web browsers. See also <b>request-responseloop</b>.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>cookie</b></dt><dd>General mechanism used by Web servers to storeand retrieve persistent data on a client system (Web browser).

See also <b>key-valuecoding</b>; <b>property</b>.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>entity</b></dt><dd>In Entity-Relationship modeling, a distinguishableobject about which data is kept. For example, you can have an Employeeentity with attributes such as <code>lastName</code>, <code>firstName</code>, <code>address</code>,and so on. An entity typically corresponds to a table in a relationaldatabase; an entity's attributes, in turn, correspond to a table'scolumns. See also <b>attribute</b>; <b>table</b>.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>Entity-Relationship modeling</b></dt><dd>A Discipline for examining and representingthe components and interrelationships in a database system.

This attribute must be the primary keyof the related entity. For example, an Employee entity can containthe foreign key <code>deptID</code>,which matches the primary key in the entity Department. You canthen use <code>deptID</code> as thesource attribute in Employee and as the destination attribute inDepartment to form a relationship between the entities. See also <b>primarykey</b>; <b>relationship</b>.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>HTML-based applicationapproach</b></dt><dd>A WebObjects developmentapproach that allows you to create HTML-based Web applications.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>inheritance</b></dt><dd>In object-oriented programming, the abilityof a superclass to pass its characteristics (methods and instancevariables) on to its subclasses.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>instance</b></dt><dd>In object-oriented languages such as Java,an object that belongs to (is a member of) a particular class.

For example, an employee can workon many projects, and a project can be staffed by many employees.See also <b>relationship</b>.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>method</b></dt><dd>In object-oriented programming, a procedurethat can be executed by an object.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>model</b></dt><dd>An object (of the EOModel class) that defines,in Entity-Relationship terms, the mapping between enterprise objectclasses and the database schema. This definition is typically storedin a file created with the EOModeler application. A model also includesthe information needed to connect to a particular database server.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>object</b></dt><dd>A programming unit that groups together a datastructure (instance variables) and the operations (methods) thatcan use or affect that data. Objects are the principal building blocksof object-oriented programs.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>primary key</b></dt><dd>An attribute in an entity that uniquely identifiesrows of that entity. For example, the Employee entity can containan <code>EmpID</code> attribute thatuniquely identifies each employee.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>Project Builder</b></dt><dd>A tool used to manage the development of aWebObjects application or framework.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>property</b></dt><dd>In Entity-Relationship modeling, an attributeor relationship.

For example, the Department and Employeeentities can have a relationship based on the <code>deptID</code> attributeas a foreign key in Employee and as the primary key in Department(note that although the join attribute <code>deptID</code> isthe same for the source and destination entities in this example,it doesn't have to be). This relationship would make it possibleto find the employees for a given department. See also <b>foreignkey</b>: <b>many-to-many relationship</b>; <b>primarykey</b>; <b>to-many relationship</b>; <b>to-onerelationship</b>.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>reusable component</b></dt><dd>A component that can be nested within othercomponents and acts like a dynamic element.

In WebObjects, the Web serverlies between the browser and a WebObjects application. When theWeb server receives a request from a browser, it passes the requestto the WebObjects adaptor, which generates a response and returns itto the Web server. The Web server then sends the response to thebrowser.
