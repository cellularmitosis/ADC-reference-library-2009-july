 *  Generic pbuffer header for both the shared sample and the 1 context sample
 *  The routines used are called in the same way but have different functionality depending
 *  on which sample.  The 1 context sample moves a single context between the pbuffer and 
 *  the window using the shared state for rendering.  The shared pbuffer sample uses a single
 *  pbuffer, with its own context and pixel format as the source to texture into all the windows
 *  drawn by the sample.  This header attempts to break down the use of the pbuffer to a reasonably
 *  consustent set of operations.
