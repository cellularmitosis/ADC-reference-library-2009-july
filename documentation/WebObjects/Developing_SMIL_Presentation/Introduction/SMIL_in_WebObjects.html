WebObjects uses version1.0 of the SMIL specification.</p><p>SMIL allows you to place media objects anywhere in a windowand determine when each object is displayed using a timeline. Italso lets you tailor the display of media objects according to thecapabilities of a user's computer, Internet connection speed,and preferred language, among other criteria. The specificationalso provides for linking presentations with each other throughhyperlinks.</p><p>An important feature of SMIL documents (which are writtenin XML) is that they reference media objects using URLs. This way,you can set the object that a SMIL element applies to dynamically.For example, you can use a database containing the names and URLsof movies to dynamically create a presentation that the user canuse to choose which movie to watch.</p><p>SMIL documents can be viewed with multimedia players likeQuickTime Player and RealPlayer. This is an example of a SMIL document:</p><pre>&lt;smil&gt;    &lt;head&gt;        &lt;layout&gt;            &lt;root-layout background-color="#FFFFFF"                width="100" height="200" id="window" /&gt;            &lt;region id=&quot;text_rgn&quot; top=&quot;5&quot; /&gt;        &lt;/layout&gt;    &lt;/head&gt;    &lt;body&gt;        &lt;text region=&quot;text_rgn&quot; src=&quot;text.html&quot; dur=&quot;10s&quot; /&gt;    &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/smil&gt;</pre><p>Notice that a SMIL document has two main sections: the layoutsection and the body section. The layout section specifies the dimensionsand background color of the presentation's window and the regionsinto which the window is divided. Additionally, it can provide metadatadescribing the presentation. The body section is where information aboutthe media objects that make up the presentation is placed. It includesthe physical location of the file as well as display properties,such as when to show the object and for how long.</p><p>WebObjects provides the tools you need to create SMIL presentationsthat take advantage of WebObjects technologies such as EnterpriseObjects. For example, you can create an application with a SMILcomponent that displays a list of movies from a database and a secondcomponent that shows the movie the user selected in the first one.</p><p>To design SMIL presentations in WebObjects, you create standardWebObjects applications in Project Builder and SMIL components inWebObjects Builder. You don't create SMIL documents directly.Rather, you use WebObjects Builder to graphically lay out SMIL elements.To provide data for SMIL attributes you enter values for the bindingsof each SMIL element.</p><p>After designing a SMIL component, or presentation, you buildand run the application like you normally would. However, insteadof using a Web browser to view the application's output, you usea multimedia player. When the player connects to a WebObjects applicationthat serves a SMIL presentation, it receives a standard SMIL document.See  <a href="../Reference/iSMIL_Elemen_BCHIBCI.html" target="_top">Chapter 4, "SMIL Elements",</a> fordetails on the SMIL elements used in WebObjects.</p><p>You can use the <code>curl</code> command-linetool to view the SMIL source code that WebObjects generates whenyour multimedia viewer connects to a SMIL application. Simply enterthe command in your shell editor followed by the URL used to connectto the presentation.</p><!-- insert Show/Hide frames --><script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript"><!--function loadFrames(){if (top == self || (parent.frames[1].name != doc))    top.location.href = 'index.html?' + location.href;}if (self != top) {  // loaded in frames  document.write('<a href="'+self.location+'" target="_top"><img src="../images/hideframes.gif" border="0" alt="Hide Frames"></a>');  }else {  // not loaded frames	document.write('<a href="JavaScript:loadFrames()"><img src="../images/showframes.gif" border="0" alt="Show Frames"></a>');}//--></script><!-- end Show/Hide frames --><a href="../AboutThisBook/pAbout_This_Book.html" target="_top"><img src="../images/previous.gif" border="0"></a>&nbsp;<a href="../CreatingPresentations/index.html" target="_top"><img src="../images/next.gif" border="0"></a>&nbsp;<!-- apple_doc:infillMarkerBottom --> <br><br><p><hr><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">&#169; 2002 Apple Computer, Inc.
