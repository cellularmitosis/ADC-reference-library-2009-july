README - SoundSnippetsSoundSnippets.c defines functions that perform some common sound-related operations,such as saving a movie's sound track into a separate file or playing a continuous sound usingthe bufferCmd sound command. This is not really a library of utilities, but more a grab-bagof "how-to" recipes.Here's a partial list of what's illustrated here:	*Save a sound-only QuickTime movie as a WAVE file.	*Save a sound-only QuickTime movie as a file whose type the user selects.	*Save a sound track in a QuickTime movie as a file whose type the user selects.	*Create a handle that contains the first sound track in a QuickTime movie.	*Open and play a WAVE file using the QuickTime API.	*Set the volume level of a sound track in a QuickTime movie.	*Use the bufferCmd sound command to continuously play a large buffer of audio data.	*Get the current hardware settings.	*Get the settings for a sound track in a QuickTime movie.	*Get and set the current left and right volumes of a sound channel.	*Let the user select an audio file and select its compression settings; then compress it.Enjoy,QuickTime Team
