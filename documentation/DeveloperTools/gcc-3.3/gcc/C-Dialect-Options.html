<h3 class="section">3.4 Options Controlling C Dialect</h3>

<p><a name="index-dialect-options-85"></a><a name="index-language-dialect-options-86"></a><a name="index-options_002c-dialect-87"></a>
The following options control the dialect of C (or languages derived
from C, such as C++ and Objective-C) that the compiler accepts:

     
<a name="index-ANSI-support-88"></a>
<a name="index-ISO-support-89"></a>
<dl><dt><code>-ansi</code><dd><a name="index-ansi-90"></a>In C mode, support all ISO C90 programs.  In C++ mode,
remove GNU extensions that conflict with ISO C++.

     <p>This turns off certain features of GCC that are incompatible with ISO
C90 (when compiling C code), or of standard C++ (when compiling C++ code),
such as the <code>asm</code> and <code>typeof</code> keywords, and
predefined macros such as <code>unix</code> and <code>vax</code> that identify the
type of system you are using.  It also enables the undesirable and
rarely used ISO trigraph feature.  For the C compiler,
it disables recognition of C++ style <span class="samp">//</span> comments as well as
the <code>inline</code> keyword.

     <p>The alternate keywords <code>__asm__</code>, <code>__extension__</code>,
<code>__inline__</code> and <code>__typeof__</code> continue to work despite
<span class="option">-ansi</span>.  You would not want to use them in an ISO C program, of
course, but it is useful to put them in header files that might be included
in compilations done with <span class="option">-ansi</span>.  Alternate predefined macros
such as <code>__unix__</code> and <code>__vax__</code> are also available, with or
without <span class="option">-ansi</span>.

     <p>The <span class="option">-ansi</span> option does not cause non-ISO programs to be
rejected gratuitously.  For that, <span class="option">-pedantic</span> is required in
addition to <span class="option">-ansi</span>.  See <a href="Warning-Options.html#Warning-Options">Warning Options</a>.

     <p>The macro <code>__STRICT_ANSI__</code> is predefined when the <span class="option">-ansi</span>
option is used.  Some header files may notice this macro and refrain
from declaring certain functions or defining certain macros that the
ISO standard doesn't call for; this is to avoid interfering with any
programs that might use these names for other things.

     <p>Functions which would normally be built in but do not have semantics
defined by ISO C (such as <code>alloca</code> and <code>ffs</code>) are not built-in
functions with <span class="option">-ansi</span> is used.  See <a href="Other-Builtins.html#Other-Builtins">Other built-in functions provided by GCC</a>, for details of the functions
affected.

     <br><dt><code>-std=</code><dd><a name="index-std-91"></a>Determine the language standard.  This option is currently only
supported when compiling C or C++.  A value for this option must be
provided; possible values are

          <dl>
<dt><span class="samp">c89</span><dt><span class="samp">iso9899:1990</span><dd>ISO C90 (same as <span class="option">-ansi</span>).

          <br><dt><span class="samp">iso9899:199409</span><dd>ISO C90 as modified in amendment 1.

          <br><dt><span class="samp">c99</span><dt><span class="samp">c9x</span><dt><span class="samp">iso9899:1999</span><dt><span class="samp">iso9899:199x</span><dd>ISO C99.  Note that this standard is not yet fully supported; see
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-3.3/c99status.html">http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-3.3/c99status.html</a><!-- /@w --> for more information.  The
names <span class="samp">c9x</span> and <span class="samp">iso9899:199x</span> are deprecated.

          <br><dt><span class="samp">gnu89</span><dd>Default, ISO C90 plus GNU extensions (including some C99 features).

          <br><dt><span class="samp">gnu99</span><br><dt><span class="samp">gnu9x</span><dd>ISO C99 plus GNU extensions.  When ISO C99 is fully implemented in GCC,
this will become the default.  The name <span class="samp">gnu9x</span> is deprecated.

          <br><dt><span class="samp">c++98</span><dd>The 1998 ISO C++ standard plus amendments.

          <br><dt><span class="samp">gnu++98</span><dd>The same as <span class="option">-std=c++98</span> plus GNU extensions.  This is the
default for C++ code. 
</dl>

     <p>Even when this option is not specified, you can still use some of the
features of newer standards in so far as they do not conflict with
previous C standards.  For example, you may use <code>__restrict__</code> even
when <span class="option">-std=c99</span> is not specified.

     <p>The <span class="option">-std</span> options specifying some version of ISO C have the same
effects as <span class="option">-ansi</span>, except that features that were not in ISO C90
but are in the specified version (for example, <span class="samp">//</span> comments and
the <code>inline</code> keyword in ISO C99) are not disabled.

     <p>See <a href="Standards.html#Standards">Language Standards Supported by GCC</a>, for details of
these standard versions.

     <br><dt><code>-aux-info </code><var>filename</var><dd><a name="index-aux_002dinfo-92"></a>Output to the given filename prototyped declarations for all functions
declared and/or defined in a translation unit, including those in header
files.  This option is silently ignored in any language other than C.

     <p>Besides declarations, the file indicates, in comments, the origin of
each declaration (source file and line), whether the declaration was
implicit, prototyped or unprototyped (<span class="samp">I</span>, <span class="samp">N</span> for new or
<span class="samp">O</span> for old, respectively, in the first character after the line
number and the colon), and whether it came from a declaration or a
definition (<span class="samp">C</span> or <span class="samp">F</span>, respectively, in the following
character).  In the case of function definitions, a K&amp;R-style list of
arguments followed by their declarations is also provided, inside
comments, after the declaration.

     <!-- APPLE LOCAL begin AltiVec -->
<br><dt><code>-faltivec</code><dd>Enable the AltiVec language extensions, as defined in Motorola's AltiVec
PIM.  This includes the recognition of <code>vector</code> and <code>pixel</code> as
(context-dependent) keywords, the definition of built-in functions such
as <code>vec_add</code>, and other extensions.  Note that unlike the option
<span class="samp">-maltivec</span>, the extensions do not require the inclusion of any
special header files. (APPLE ONLY)
<!-- APPLE LOCAL end AltiVec -->

     <!-- APPLE LOCAL begin CW asm blocks -->
<br><dt><code>-fasm-blocks</code><dd>Enable the use of blocks and entire functions of assembly code within
a C or C++ file.  The syntax follows that used in CodeWarrior. (APPLE
ONLY)
<!-- APPLE LOCAL end CW asm blocks -->

     <br><dt><code>-fno-asm</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dasm-93"></a>Do not recognize <code>asm</code>, <code>inline</code> or <code>typeof</code> as a
keyword, so that code can use these words as identifiers.  You can use
the keywords <code>__asm__</code>, <code>__inline__</code> and <code>__typeof__</code>
instead.  <span class="option">-ansi</span> implies <span class="option">-fno-asm</span>.

     <p>In C++, this switch only affects the <code>typeof</code> keyword, since
<code>asm</code> and <code>inline</code> are standard keywords.  You may want to
use the <span class="option">-fno-gnu-keywords</span> flag instead, which has the same
effect.  In C99 mode (<span class="option">-std=c99</span> or <span class="option">-std=gnu99</span>), this
switch only affects the <code>asm</code> and <code>typeof</code> keywords, since
<code>inline</code> is a standard keyword in ISO C99.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-builtin</code><dt><code>-fno-builtin-</code><var>function</var><dd><a name="index-fno_002dbuiltin-94"></a><a name="index-built_002din-functions-95"></a>Don't recognize built-in functions that do not begin with
<span class="samp">__builtin_</span> as prefix.  See <a href="Other-Builtins.html#Other-Builtins">Other built-in functions provided by GCC</a>, for details of the functions affected,
including those which are not built-in functions when <span class="option">-ansi</span> or
<span class="option">-std</span> options for strict ISO C conformance are used because they
do not have an ISO standard meaning.

     <p>GCC normally generates special code to handle certain built-in functions
more efficiently; for instance, calls to <code>alloca</code> may become single
instructions that adjust the stack directly, and calls to <code>memcpy</code>
may become inline copy loops.  The resulting code is often both smaller
and faster, but since the function calls no longer appear as such, you
cannot set a breakpoint on those calls, nor can you change the behavior
of the functions by linking with a different library.

     <p>With the <span class="option">-fno-builtin-</span><var>function</var> option
only the built-in function <var>function</var> is
disabled.  <var>function</var> must not begin with <span class="samp">__builtin_</span>.  If a
function is named this is not built-in in this version of GCC, this
option is ignored.  There is no corresponding
<span class="option">-fbuiltin-</span><var>function</var> option; if you wish to enable
built-in functions selectively when using <span class="option">-fno-builtin</span> or
<span class="option">-ffreestanding</span>, you may define macros such as:

     <pre class="smallexample">          #define abs(n)          __builtin_abs ((n))
          #define strcpy(d, s)    __builtin_strcpy ((d), (s))
     </pre>
     <br><dt><code>-fhosted</code><dd><a name="index-fhosted-96"></a><a name="index-hosted-environment-97"></a>
Assert that compilation takes place in a hosted environment.  This implies
<span class="option">-fbuiltin</span>.  A hosted environment is one in which the
entire standard library is available, and in which <code>main</code> has a return
type of <code>int</code>.  Examples are nearly everything except a kernel. 
This is equivalent to <span class="option">-fno-freestanding</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-ffreestanding</code><dd><a name="index-ffreestanding-98"></a><a name="index-hosted-environment-99"></a>
Assert that compilation takes place in a freestanding environment.  This
implies <span class="option">-fno-builtin</span>.  A freestanding environment
is one in which the standard library may not exist, and program startup may
not necessarily be at <code>main</code>.  The most obvious example is an OS kernel. 
This is equivalent to <span class="option">-fno-hosted</span>.

     <p>See <a href="Standards.html#Standards">Language Standards Supported by GCC</a>, for details of
freestanding and hosted environments.

     <br><dt><code>-fms-extensions</code><dd><a name="index-fms_002dextensions-100"></a>Accept some non-standard constructs used in Microsoft header files.

     <br><dt><code>-trigraphs</code><dd><a name="index-trigraphs-101"></a>Support ISO C trigraphs.  The <span class="option">-ansi</span> option (and <span class="option">-std</span>
options for strict ISO C conformance) implies <span class="option">-trigraphs</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-no-integrated-cpp</code><dd><a name="index-no_002dintegrated_002dcpp-102"></a>Performs a compilation in two passes: preprocessing and compiling.  This
option allows a user supplied "cc1", "cc1plus", or "cc1obj" via the
<span class="option">-B</span> option. The user supplied compilation step can then add in
an additional preprocessing step after normal preprocessing but before
compiling. The default is to use the integrated cpp (internal cpp)

     <p>The semantics of this option will change if "cc1", "cc1plus", and
"cc1obj" are merged.

     <p><a name="index-traditional-C-language-103"></a><a name="index-C-language_002c-traditional-104"></a><br><dt><code>-traditional</code><dt><code>-traditional-cpp</code><dd><a name="index-traditional_002dcpp-105"></a><a name="index-traditional-106"></a>Formerly, these options caused GCC to attempt to emulate a pre-standard
C compiler.  They are now only supported with the <span class="option">-E</span> switch. 
The preprocessor continues to support a pre-standard mode.  See the GNU
CPP manual for details.

     <br><dt><code>-fcond-mismatch</code><dd><a name="index-fcond_002dmismatch-107"></a>Allow conditional expressions with mismatched types in the second and
third arguments.  The value of such an expression is void.  This option
is not supported for C++.

     <!-- APPLE LOCAL BEGIN pch distcc mrs -->
<br><dt><code>-fpch-preprocess</code><dd><a name="index-fpch_002dpreprocess-108"></a>Enable PCH processing even when <span class="option">-E</span> or <span class="option">-save-temps</span> is used. 
<!-- APPLE LOCAL END pch distcc mrs -->

     <br><dt><code>-funsigned-char</code><dd><a name="index-funsigned_002dchar-109"></a>Let the type <code>char</code> be unsigned, like <code>unsigned char</code>.

     <p>Each kind of machine has a default for what <code>char</code> should
be.  It is either like <code>unsigned char</code> by default or like
<code>signed char</code> by default.

     <p>Ideally, a portable program should always use <code>signed char</code> or
<code>unsigned char</code> when it depends on the signedness of an object. 
But many programs have been written to use plain <code>char</code> and
expect it to be signed, or expect it to be unsigned, depending on the
machines they were written for.  This option, and its inverse, let you
make such a program work with the opposite default.

     <p>The type <code>char</code> is always a distinct type from each of
<code>signed char</code> or <code>unsigned char</code>, even though its behavior
is always just like one of those two.

     <br><dt><code>-fsigned-char</code><dd><a name="index-fsigned_002dchar-110"></a>Let the type <code>char</code> be signed, like <code>signed char</code>.

     <p>Note that this is equivalent to <span class="option">-fno-unsigned-char</span>, which is
the negative form of <span class="option">-funsigned-char</span>.  Likewise, the option
<span class="option">-fno-signed-char</span> is equivalent to <span class="option">-funsigned-char</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-fsigned-bitfields</code><dt><code>-funsigned-bitfields</code><dt><code>-fno-signed-bitfields</code><dt><code>-fno-unsigned-bitfields</code><dd><a name="index-fsigned_002dbitfields-111"></a><a name="index-funsigned_002dbitfields-112"></a><a name="index-fno_002dsigned_002dbitfields-113"></a><a name="index-fno_002dunsigned_002dbitfields-114"></a>These options control whether a bit-field is signed or unsigned, when the
declaration does not use either <code>signed</code> or <code>unsigned</code>.  By
default, such a bit-field is signed, because this is consistent: the
basic integer types such as <code>int</code> are signed types.

     <br><dt><code>-fwritable-strings</code><dd><a name="index-fwritable_002dstrings-115"></a>Store string constants in the writable data segment and don't uniquize
them.  This is for compatibility with old programs which assume they can
write into string constants.

     <p>Writing into string constants is a very bad idea; &ldquo;constants&rdquo; should
be constant.

     <!-- APPLE LOCAL begin constant cfstrings -->
<br><dt><code>-fconstant-cfstrings</code><dd><a name="index-fconstant_002dcfstrings-116"></a>Enable the automatic creation of a CoreFoundation-type constant string
whenever a special builtin <code>__builtin__CFStringMakeConstantString</code>
is called on a literal string, and for <code>@"..."</code> literals
in Objective-C (thus overriding the <span class="option">-fconstant-string-class</span>
setting).  This option will also be enabled if the environment variable
<code>MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET</code> exists and is set to <code>"10.2"</code> or
greater.  (APPLE ONLY)
<!-- APPLE LOCAL end constant cfstrings -->

     <!-- APPLE LOCAL begin Pascal strings 2001-07-05 zll ** -->
<br><dt><code>-fpascal-strings</code><dd>Allow Pascal-style string literals to be constructed.  (APPLE ONLY)

     <p>See <a href="Pascal-Strings.html#Pascal-Strings">Constructing String Literals with a Pascal-style Length Byte</a>, for more information on the syntax and semantics of Pascal
string literals. 
<!-- APPLE LOCAL end Pascal strings 2001-07-05 zll ** -->

     <!-- APPLE LOCAL begin coalescing 2002-04-11 turly ** -->
<br><dt><code>-fcoalesce</code><dd><a name="index-fcoalesce-117"></a>Coalesce duplicated functions and data. The linker will discard all
but one, saving space.  Enabled by default. (APPLE ONLY)

     <br><dt><code>-fweak-coalesced</code><dd><a name="index-fweak_002dcoalesced-118"></a>Use the new OS X "weak_definitions" section attribute for coalesced items. 
A single "normal" definition will be chosen by the linker over any number
of weakly-coalesced ones.  (APPLE ONLY)
<!-- APPLE LOCAL end coalescing 2002-04-11 turly ** -->
