<H1><A NAME="SEC131" HREF="gdbint_toc.html#TOC131">Releasing GDB</A></H1>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX472"></A>

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC132" HREF="gdbint_toc.html#TOC132">Branch Commit Policy</A></H2>

<P>
The branch commit policy is pretty slack.  GDB releases 5.0,
5.1 and 5.2 all used the below:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The <TT>`gdb/MAINTAINERS'</TT> file still holds.
<LI>

Don't fix something on the branch unless/until it is also fixed in the
trunk.  If this isn't possible, mentioning it in the <TT>`gdb/PROBLEMS'</TT>
file is better than committing a hack.
<LI>

When considering a patch for the branch, suggested criteria include:
Does it fix a build?  Does it fix the sequence <KBD>break main; run</KBD>
when debugging a static binary?
<LI>

The further a change is from the core of GDB, the less likely
the change will worry anyone (e.g., target specific code).
<LI>

Only post a proposal to change the core of GDB after you've
sent individual bribes to all the people listed in the
<TT>`MAINTAINERS'</TT> file <TT>;-)</TT>
</UL>

<P>
<EM>Pragmatics: Provided updates are restricted to non-core
functionality there is little chance that a broken change will be fatal.
This means that changes such as adding a new architectures or (within
reason) support for a new host are considered acceptable.</EM>

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC133" HREF="gdbint_toc.html#TOC133">Obsoleting code</A></H2>

<P>
Before anything else, poke the other developers (and around the source
code) to see if there is anything that can be removed from GDB
(an old target, an unused file).

</P>
<P>
Obsolete code is identified by adding an <CODE>OBSOLETE</CODE> prefix to every
line.  Doing this means that it is easy to identify something that has
been obsoleted when greping through the sources.

</P>
<P>
The process is done in stages -- this is mainly to ensure that the
wider GDB community has a reasonable opportunity to respond.
Remember, everything on the Internet takes a week.

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Post the proposal on @email{gdb@sources.redhat.com, the GDB mailing
list} Creating a bug report to track the task's state, is also highly
recommended.
<LI>

Wait a week or so.
<LI>

Post the proposal on @email{gdb-announce@sources.redhat.com, the GDB
Announcement mailing list}.
<LI>

Wait a week or so.
<LI>

Go through and edit all relevant files and lines so that they are
prefixed with the word <CODE>OBSOLETE</CODE>.
<LI>

Wait until the next GDB version, containing this obsolete code, has been
released.
<LI>

Remove the obsolete code.
</OL>

<P>
<EM>Maintainer note: While removing old code is regrettable it is
hopefully better for GDB's long term development.  Firstly it
helps the developers by removing code that is either no longer relevant
or simply wrong.  Secondly since it removes any history associated with
the file (effectively clearing the slate) the developer has a much freer
hand when it comes to fixing broken files.</EM>

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC134" HREF="gdbint_toc.html#TOC134">Before the Branch</A></H2>

<P>
The most important objective at this stage is to find and fix simple
changes that become a pain to track once the branch is created.  For
instance, configuration problems that stop GDB from even
building.  If you can't get the problem fixed, document it in the
<TT>`gdb/PROBLEMS'</TT> file.

</P>

<H3>Prompt for <TT>`gdb/NEWS'</TT></H3>

<P>
People always forget.  Send a post reminding them but also if you know
something interesting happened add it yourself.  The <CODE>schedule</CODE>
script will mention this in its e-mail.

</P>

<H3>Review <TT>`gdb/README'</TT></H3>

<P>
Grab one of the nightly snapshots and then walk through the
<TT>`gdb/README'</TT> looking for anything that can be improved.  The
<CODE>schedule</CODE> script will mention this in its e-mail.

</P>

<H3>Refresh any imported files.</H3>

<P>
A number of files are taken from external repositories.  They include:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<TT>`texinfo/texinfo.tex'</TT>
<LI>

<TT>`config.guess'</TT> et. al. (see the top-level <TT>`MAINTAINERS'</TT>
file)
<LI>

<TT>`etc/standards.texi'</TT>, <TT>`etc/make-stds.texi'</TT>
</UL>


<H3>Check the ARI</H3>

<P>
@uref{http://sources.redhat.com/gdb/ari,,A.R.I.} is an <CODE>awk</CODE> script
(Awk Regression Index ;-) that checks for a number of errors and coding
conventions.  The checks include things like using <CODE>malloc</CODE> instead
of <CODE>xmalloc</CODE> and file naming problems.  There shouldn't be any
regressions.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC135" HREF="gdbint_toc.html#TOC135">Review the bug data base</A></H3>

<P>
Close anything obviously fixed.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC136" HREF="gdbint_toc.html#TOC136">Check all cross targets build</A></H3>

<P>
The targets are listed in <TT>`gdb/MAINTAINERS'</TT>.

a daily timestamp is added to the file <TT>`version.in'</TT>

Something goes here.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC139" HREF="gdbint_toc.html#TOC139">Create a Release</A></H2>

<P>
The process of creating and then making available a release is broken
down into a number of stages.  The first part addresses the technical
process of creating a releasable tar ball.  The later stages address the
process of releasing that tar ball.

</P>
<P>
When making a release candidate just the first section is needed.

<H3><A NAME="SEC140" HREF="gdbint_toc.html#TOC140">Create a release candidate</A></H3>

The objective at this stage is to create a set of tar balls that can be
made available as a formal release (or as a less formal release
candidate).

</P>

<H4>Freeze the branch</H4>

<P>
Send out an e-mail notifying everyone that the branch is frozen to

Check the <CODE>autoconf</CODE> version carefully.  You want to be using the
version taken from the <TT>`binutils'</TT> snapshot directory, which can be
found at @uref{ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/binutils/}. It is very
unlikely that a system installed version of <CODE>autoconf</CODE> (e.g.,

<H4>Update relevant files.</H4>

Dejagnu is more complicated.  The version number is a parameter to

<P>
Note:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

A pipe such as <KBD>bunzip2 &#60; xxx.bz2 | gzip -9 &#62; xxx.gz</KBD> is not since,
in that mode, <CODE>gzip</CODE> does not know the name of the file and, hence,
can not include it in the compressed file.  This is also why the release
process runs <CODE>tar</CODE> and <CODE>bzip2</CODE> as separate passes.

Insight is used since that contains more of the release than
GDB (<CODE>dejagnu</CODE> doesn't get tagged but I think we can live

<P>
If <TT>`gdb/version.in'</TT> does not contain an ISO date such as
<KBD>2002-01-24</KBD> then the daily <CODE>cronjob</CODE> won't update it.  Having
committed all the release changes it can be set to
<TT>`5.2.0_0000-00-00-cvs'</TT> which will restart things (yes the <KBD>_</KBD>
is important - it affects the snapshot process).

</P>
<P>
Don't forget the <TT>`ChangeLog'</TT>.

</P>

<H4>Merge into trunk</H4>
