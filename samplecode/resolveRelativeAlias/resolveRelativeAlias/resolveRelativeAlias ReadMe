 resolveRelativeAlias MPW Tool (System 7 only)Greg Robbins  3/92    Scenario:  A document contains an alias to a file in a known folder.  The problem  is that the document might be on a floppy, and the known folder might  be on a drive whose name is unknown.    For example, say the boot drive will contain "Super Folder" in the root  directory, and "Super File" in that folder.  The goal is to create an  alias to "Super File" which will work regardless of the drive's name.      Solution:    Create an alias to the the target (e.g. "SuperFile") which is relative to  the System file.  This presumes that the folder structure of the drive  is known, but makes no presumption about the name of the drive.    This sample tool demonstrates the steps involved in creating and resolving  the alias.  Instead of creating a document to store the alias, the tool wimps  out and stores the alias in a preference file.    The tool puts up a StandardGetFile dialog.  Selecting a file creates the  preference file containing the relative alias; clicking Cancel instead  gets the preference file, resolves it, and prints the vRefNum and name  of the target.      Alternative strategies:    Well, you could call PBGetVInfo to find the name of the boot volume  and then build a full pathname, or SetVol to the root directory of the  boot volume and then use a relative pathname.  But both of those  solutions are ugly and un-Seven like.
