/*    File: HTMLControl.h        Description:        Scrolling Text User Pane (HTML) control support routines.		Routines defined in this header file are implemented in the	file HTMLControl.c		These routines allow you to create (or use an existing) user	pane control as a scrolling edit text field.		These routines use the refcon field inside of the user pane	record for storage of interal variables.  You should not	use the reference value field in the user pane control if you	are calling these routines.    Copyright:        © Copyright 2000 Apple Computer, Inc.
