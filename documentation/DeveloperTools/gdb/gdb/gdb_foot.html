<H1>Debugging with GDB</H1>
<H2>The GNU Source-Level Debugger</H2>
<H2>Ninth Edition, for GDB version 6.3.50.20050815-cvs</H2>
<ADDRESS>Richard Stallman, Roland Pesch, Stan Shebs, et al.</ADDRESS>
<P>
<P><HR><P>
<H3><A NAME="FOOT1" HREF="gdb_3.html#DOCF1">(1)</A></H3>
<P>On
DOS/Windows systems, the home directory is the one pointed to by the
<CODE>HOME</CODE> environment variable.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT2" HREF="gdb_7.html#DOCF2">(2)</A></H3>
<P>
Note that embedded programs (the so-called "free-standing"
environment) are not required to have a <CODE>main</CODE> function as the
entry point.  They could even have multiple entry points.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT3" HREF="gdb_8.html#DOCF3">(3)</A></H3>
<P>
The only restriction is that your editor (say <CODE>ex</CODE>), recognizes the
following command-line syntax:

<PRE>
ex +<VAR>number</VAR> file
</PRE>

<P>
The optional numeric value +<VAR>number</VAR> specifies the number of the line in
the file where to start editing.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT4" HREF="gdb_9.html#DOCF4">(4)</A></H3>
<P><SAMP>`b'</SAMP> cannot be used because these format letters are also
used with the <CODE>x</CODE> command, where <SAMP>`b'</SAMP> stands for "byte";
see section <A HREF="gdb_9.html#SEC61">Examining memory</A>.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT5" HREF="gdb_9.html#DOCF5">(5)</A></H3>
<P>This is a way of removing
one word from the stack, on machines where stacks grow downward in
memory (most machines, nowadays).  This assumes that the innermost
stack frame is selected; setting <CODE>$sp</CODE> is not allowed when other
stack frames are selected.  To pop entire frames off the stack,
regardless of machine architecture, use <CODE>return</CODE>;
see section <A HREF="gdb_15.html#SEC143">Returning from a function</A>.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT6" HREF="gdb_18.html#DOCF6">(6)</A></H3>
<P>If you choose a port number that
conflicts with another service, <CODE>gdbserver</CODE> prints an error message
and exits.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT7" HREF="gdb_30.html#DOCF7">(7)</A></H3>
<P>In
<TT>`gdb-6.3.50.20050815-cvs/gdb/refcard.ps'</TT> of the version 6.3.50.20050815-cvs
release.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT8" HREF="gdb_31.html#DOCF8">(8)</A></H3>
<P>If you have a more recent version of GDB than 6.3.50.20050815-cvs,
look at the <TT>`README'</TT> file in the sources; we may have improved the
installation procedures since publishing this manual.
