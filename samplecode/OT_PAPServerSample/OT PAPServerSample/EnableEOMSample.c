/*	File:		EnableEOMSample.c	Contains:	Demonstrate the use of the OTOptionManagement call to tell a PAP or				ADSP endpoint to enable/disable the EOM option.							Note that this sample does not support asynch endpoints.  To support				an asynch endpoint, the same call to OTOptionManagement would happen				however, the endpoint handler will be called with the				T_OPTMGMTCOMPLETE event.  The handler would then inspect the cookie, 				which will be the TOptMgmt "ret" value to check for the				success or failure of the call.	Written by: Rich Kubota		Copyright:	Copyright © 1999 by Apple Computer, Inc., All Rights Reserved.				You may incorporate this Apple sample source code into your program(s) without				restriction.
