<H1>What's in This Book</H1>
 Information in this book is grouped by architecture type: the CFM-based or the original classic 68K runtime architecture. <P>
 The first nine chapters describe the architecture based on the Code Fragment Manager (CFM) and give details of the PowerPC and CFM-68K implementations.<P>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF=RTArch-14.html#MARKER-9-20>Chapter 1, "CFM-Based Runtime Architecture,"</A> gives an overview of the architecture based on the Code Fragment Manager. It includes general information about fragments, shared libraries, and the code fragment resource. 
<LI><A HREF=RTArch-27.html#MARKER-9-19>Chapter 2, "Indirect Addressing in the CFM-Based Architecture,"</A> describes the indirect addressing model used in the CFM-based runtime architecture. It describes indirect addressing of data, the use of transition vectors, and also information about the PowerPC and CFM-68K implementations of this model. 
<LI><A HREF=RTArch-35.html#MARKER-9-20>Chapter 3, "Programming for the CFM-Based Runtime Architecture,"</A> gives practical programming tips for writing CFM-based architecture code. It also includes information about common pitfalls that can occur. 
<LI><A HREF=RTArch-56.html#MARKER-9-21>Chapter 4, "PowerPC Runtime Conventions,"</A> lists low-level conventions such as register volatility and usage; default data types, sizes, and alignments; and calling conventions. 
<LI><A HREF=RTArch-65.html#MARKER-9-20>Chapter 5, "CFM-68K Runtime Conventions,"</A> lists low-level conventions such as register volatility and usage; default data types, sizes, and alignments; and calling conventions. Note that much of this information is different from the classic 68K runtime conventions. 
<LI><A HREF=RTArch-75.html#MARKER-9-19>Chapter 6, "The Mixed Mode Manager,"</A> describes the workings of the Mixed Mode Manager, which allows transparent switching between CFM-based and classic 68K code. 
<LI><A HREF=RTArch-86.html#MARKER-9-19>Chapter 7, "Fat Binary Programs,"</A>describes fat programs, which can contain code for multiple runtime architectures. 
<LI><A HREF=RTArch-89.html#MARKER-9-32>Chapter 8, "PEF Structure,"</A> gives low-level information about the structure of PEF (Preferred Executable Format) files, which are used to store both PowerPC and CFM-68K fragments. This chapter is primarily a reference for those writing programs that generate or analyze executable code (linkers, debuggers, and so on). 
<LI><A HREF=RTArch-102.html#MARKER-9-15>Chapter 9, "CFM-68K Application and Shared Library Structure,"</A> describes the file structure of CFM-68K applications and shared libraries in more detail. This material is primarily for those writing development tools. <P>
</UL>
 Chapters <A HREF=RTArch-115.html#MARKER-9-17>10</A> and <A HREF=RTArch-130.html#MARKER-9-20>11</A> describe the classic 68K runtime architecture, which is the original runtime architecture for Macintosh computers. <P>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF=RTArch-115.html#MARKER-9-17>Chapter 10, "Classic 68K Runtime Architecture,"</A> gives a summary of the classic 68K runtime architecture, including discussions about the A5 world, segmentation, and the jump table. It also includes information on how to implement the far model (32-bit addressed) version of the classic 68K runtime architecture in MPW. 
<LI><A HREF=RTArch-130.html#MARKER-9-20>Chapter 11, "Classic 68K Runtime Conventions,"</A> lists low-level conventions such as register volatility and usage; default data types, sizes, and alignments; and Pascal and C calling conventions. <P>
</UL>
 <A HREF=RTArch-136.html#MARKER-9-8>Appendix A</A> contains tables of terminology, constants, and data types that have been changed from earlier documentation. <P>
 <A HREF=RTArch-137.html#MARKER-9-12>Appendix B</A> contains information about the MPW RTLib libraries, which you must use if you need to patch the Segment Manager routines in either the classic 68K far model or CFM-68K runtime environments. <P>
 A glossary and index are provided at the end of the book. <P>
