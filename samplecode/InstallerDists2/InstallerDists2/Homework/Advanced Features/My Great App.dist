	This distribution is a more advanced version of the distribution created in the Hands On Session.  It shows the use of some of the more advanced features.

<!-- 
	The options element contains some distribution wide options.  The following options are used below to customize the experience:
		"rootVolumeOnly" (true or false, false default), only "/" is evaluated.  This option is an optimization and could easily be done with a volume check script.
		
		"customLocation" Allows the user to select a sub folder in a target (from the target select panel) for the relocatable packages to go.  The value is the default location relative to the target volume if the user does not change it.
		
		"customize" (allow, never, always, allow is default) This option determines if the easy or custom panels should be shown.  'always' specifies that easy is never shown, only customize.

	This package uses a special url scheme "x-disc". This scheme refers to a package on a removable media. The scheme is formatted as follows: x-disc://<VolumeName>/PathOnVolumeToPackage.  Note that spaces (even in the volume name) need to be escaped (%20).  This package is not provided, but shown for demo purposed.  A Distribution can refer to a package that isn't present, since the pkg-ref contains all the information needed by the Installer to make the decisions.
