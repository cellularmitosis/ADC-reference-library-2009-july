<b>NAME</b>
       Tie::File - Access the lines of a disk file via a Perl array

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
               # This file documents Tie::File version 0.97
               use Tie::File;

               tie @array, 'Tie::File', filename or die ...;

               $array[13] = 'blah';     # line 13 of the file is now 'blah'
               print $array[42];        # display line 42 of the file

               $n_recs = @array;        # how many records are in the file?
               $#array -= 2;            # chop two records off the end

               for (@array) {
                 s/PERL/Perl/g;         # Replace PERL with Perl everywhere in the file
               }

               # These are just like regular push, pop, unshift, shift, and splice
               # Except that they modify the file in the way you would expect

               push @array, new recs...;
               my $r1 = pop @array;
               unshift @array, new recs...;
               my $r2 = shift @array;
               @old_recs = splice @array, 3, 7, new recs...;

               untie @array;            # all finished

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       "Tie::File" represents a regular text file as a Perl array.  Each element in the array corresponds to
       a record in the file.  The first line of the file is element 0 of the array; the second line is ele-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment&nbsp;element</font>
       ment 1, and so on.

       The file is <u>not</u> loaded into memory, so this will work even for gigantic files.

       Changes to the array are reflected in the file immediately.

       Lazy people and beginners may now stop reading the manual.

       <b>"recsep"</b>

       What is a 'record'?  By default, the meaning is the same as for the "&lt;...&gt;" operator: It's a string
       terminated by $/, which is probably "\n".  (Minor exception: on DOS and Win32 systems, a 'record' is
       a string terminated by "\r\n".)  You may change the definition of "record" by supplying the "recsep"
       option in the "tie" call:

               tie @array, 'Tie::File', $file, recsep =&gt; 'es';

       This says that records are delimited by the string "es".  If the file contained the following data:

               Curse these pesky flies!\n

       then the @array would appear to have four elements:

               "Curse th"
               "e p"
               "ky fli"
               "!\n"

       An undefined value is not permitted as a record separator.  Perl's special "paragraph mode" semantics
       (A la "$/ = """) are not emulated.

       Records read from the tied array do not have the record separator string on the end; this is to allow

               $array[17] .= "extra";

       to work as expected.

       (See "autochomp", below.)  Records stored into the array will have the record separator string
       appended before they are written to the file, if they don't have one already.  For example, if the
       record separator string is "\n", then the following two lines do exactly the same thing:

               $array[17] = "Cherry pie";
               $array[17] = "Cherry pie\n";

       The result is that the contents of line 17 of the file will be replaced with "Cherry pie"; a newline
       character will separate line 17 from line 18.  This means that this code will do nothing:

               chomp $array[17];

       Because the "chomp"ed value will have the separator reattached when it is written back to the file.
       There is no way to create a file whose trailing record separator string is missing.

       Inserting records that <u>contain</u> the record separator string is not supported by this module.  It will
       probably produce a reasonable result, but what this result will be may change in a future version.
       Use 'splice' to insert records or to replace one record with several.

       <b>"autochomp"</b>

       Normally, array elements have the record separator removed, so that if the file contains the text

               Gold
               Frankincense
               Myrrh

       the tied array will appear to contain "("Gold", "Frankincense", "Myrrh")".  If you set "autochomp" to
       a false value, the record separator will not be removed.  If the file above was tied with

               tie @gifts, "Tie::File", $gifts, autochomp =&gt; 0;

       then the array @gifts would appear to contain "("Gold\n", "Frankincense\n", "Myrrh\n")", or (on Win32
       systems) "("Gold\r\n", "Frankincense\r\n", "Myrrh\r\n")".

       <b>"mode"</b>

       Normally, the specified file will be opened for read and write access, and will be created if it does
       not exist.  (That is, the flags "O_RDWR | O_CREAT" are supplied in the "open" call.)  If you want to
       change this, you may supply alternative flags in the "mode" option.  See Fcntl for a listing of
       available flags.  For example:

               # open the file if it exists, but fail if it does not exist
               use Fcntl 'O_RDWR';
               tie @array, 'Tie::File', $file, mode =&gt; O_RDWR;

               # create the file if it does not exist
               use Fcntl 'O_RDWR', 'O_CREAT';
               tie @array, 'Tie::File', $file, mode =&gt; O_RDWR | O_CREAT;

               # open an existing file in read-only mode
               use Fcntl 'O_RDONLY';
               tie @array, 'Tie::File', $file, mode =&gt; O_RDONLY;

       Opening the data file in write-only or append mode is not supported.

       <b>"memory"</b>

       This is an upper limit on the amount of memory that "Tie::File" will consume at any time while manag-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;managing</font>
       ing the file.  This is used for two things: managing the <u>read</u> <u>cache</u> and managing the <u>deferred</u> <u>write</u>
       <u>buffer</u>.

       Records read in from the file are cached, to avoid having to re-read them repeatedly.  If you read
       the same record twice, the first time it will be stored in memory, and the second time it will be
       fetched from the <u>read</u> <u>cache</u>.  The amount of data in the read cache will not exceed the value you
       specified for "memory".  If "Tie::File" wants to cache a new record, but the read cache is full, it
       will make room by expiring the least-recently visited records from the read cache.

       The default memory limit is 2Mib.  You can adjust the maximum read cache size by supplying the "mem-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ory"&nbsp;"memory"</font>
       ory" option.  The argument is the desired cache size, in bytes.

               # I have a lot of memory, so use a large cache to speed up access
               tie @array, 'Tie::File', $file, memory =&gt; 20_000_000;

       Setting the memory limit to 0 will inhibit caching; records will be fetched from disk every time you
       examine them.

       The "memory" value is not an absolute or exact limit on the memory used.  "Tie::File" objects con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tains&nbsp;contains</font>
       tains some structures besides the read cache and the deferred write buffer, whose sizes are not
       charged against "memory".

       The cache itself consumes about 310 bytes per cached record, so if your file has many short records,
       you may want to decrease the cache memory limit, or else the cache overhead may exceed the size of
       the cached data.

       <b>"dw_size"</b>

       (This is an advanced feature.  Skip this section on first reading.)

       If you use deferred writing (See "Deferred Writing", below) then data you write into the array will
       not be written directly to the file; instead, it will be saved in the <u>deferred</u> <u>write</u> <u>buffer</u> to be
       written out later.  Data in the deferred write buffer is also charged against the memory limit you
       set with the "memory" option.

       You may set the "dw_size" option to limit the amount of data that can be saved in the deferred write
       buffer.  This limit may not exceed the total memory limit.  For example, if you set "dw_size" to 1000
       and "memory" to 2500, that means that no more than 1000 bytes of deferred writes will be saved up.
       The space available for the read cache will vary, but it will always be at least 1500 bytes (if the
       deferred write buffer is full) and it could grow as large as 2500 bytes (if the deferred write buffer
       is empty.)

       If you don't specify a "dw_size", it defaults to the entire memory limit.

       <b>Option</b> <b>Format</b>

       "-mode" is a synonym for "mode".  "-recsep" is a synonym for "recsep".  "-memory" is a synonym for
       "memory".  You get the idea.

<b>Public</b> <b>Methods</b>
       The "tie" call returns an object, say $o.  You may call

               $rec = $o-&gt;FETCH($n);
               $o-&gt;STORE($n, $rec);

       to fetch or store the record at line $n, respectively; similarly the other tied array methods.  (See
       perltie for details.)  You may also call the following methods on this object:

       <b>"flock"</b>

               $o-&gt;flock(MODE)

       will lock the tied file.  "MODE" has the same meaning as the second argument to the Perl built-in
       "flock" function; for example "LOCK_SH" or "LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB".  (These constants are provided by the
       "use Fcntl ':flock'" declaration.)

       "MODE" is optional; the default is "LOCK_EX".

       "Tie::File" maintains an internal table of the byte offset of each record it has seen in the file.

       When you use "flock" to lock the file, "Tie::File" assumes that the read cache is no longer trustwor-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">thy,&nbsp;trustworthy,</font>
       thy, because another process might have modified the file since the last time it was read.  There-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fore,&nbsp;Therefore,</font>
       fore, a successful call to "flock" discards the contents of the read cache and the internal record
       offset table.

       "Tie::File" promises that the following sequence of operations will be safe:

               my $o = tie @array, "Tie::File", $filename;
               $o-&gt;flock;

       In particular, "Tie::File" will <u>not</u> read or write the file during the "tie" call.  (Exception: Using
       "mode =&gt; O_TRUNC" will, of course, erase the file during the "tie" call.  If you want to do this
       safely, then open the file without "O_TRUNC", lock the file, and use "@array = ()".)

       The best way to unlock a file is to discard the object and untie the array.  It is probably unsafe to
       unlock the file without also untying it, because if you do, changes may remain unwritten inside the
       object.  That is why there is no shortcut for unlocking.  If you really want to unlock the file pre-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">maturely,&nbsp;prematurely,</font>
       maturely, you know what to do; if you don't know what to do, then don't do it.

       All the usual warnings about file locking apply here.  In particular, note that file locking in Perl
       is <b>advisory</b>, which means that holding a lock will not prevent anyone else from reading, writing, or
       erasing the file; it only prevents them from getting another lock at the same time.  Locks are analo-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">gous&nbsp;analogous</font>
       gous to green traffic lights: If you have a green light, that does not prevent the idiot coming the
       other way from plowing into you sideways; it merely guarantees to you that the idiot does not also
       have a green light at the same time.

       <b>"autochomp"</b>

               my $old_value = $o-&gt;autochomp(0);    # disable autochomp option
               my $old_value = $o-&gt;autochomp(1);    #  enable autochomp option

               my $ac = $o-&gt;autochomp();   # recover current value

       See "autochomp", above.

       <b>"defer"</b>, "flush", "discard", and "autodefer"

       See "Deferred Writing", below.

       <b>"offset"</b>

               $off = $o-&gt;offset($n);

       This method returns the byte offset of the start of the $nth record in the file.  If there is no such
       record, it returns an undefined value.

<b>Tying</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>already-opened</b> <b>filehandle</b>
       If $fh is a filehandle, such as is returned by "IO::File" or one of the other "IO" modules, you may
       use:

               tie @array, 'Tie::File', $fh, ...;

       Similarly if you opened that handle "FH" with regular "open" or "sysopen", you may use:

               tie @array, 'Tie::File', \*FH, ...;

       Handles that were opened write-only won't work.  Handles that were opened read-only will work as long
       as you don't try to modify the array.  Handles must be attached to seekable sources of data---that
       means no pipes or sockets.  If "Tie::File" can detect that you supplied a non-seekable handle, the
       "tie" call will throw an exception.  (On Unix systems, it can detect this.)

       Note that Tie::File will only close any filehandles that it opened internally.  If you passed it a
       filehandle as above, you "own" the filehandle, and are responsible for closing it after you have
       untied the @array.

<b>Deferred</b> <b>Writing</b>
       (This is an advanced feature.  Skip this section on first reading.)

       Normally, modifying a "Tie::File" array writes to the underlying file immediately.  Every assignment
       like "$a[3] = ..." rewrites as much of the file as is necessary; typically, everything from line 3
       through the end will need to be rewritten.  This is the simplest and most transparent behavior.  Per-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">formance&nbsp;Performance</font>
       formance even for large files is reasonably good.

       However, under some circumstances, this behavior may be excessively slow.  For example, suppose you
       have a million-record file, and you want to do:

               for (@FILE) {
                 $_ = "&gt; $_";
               }

       The first time through the loop, you will rewrite the entire file, from line 0 through the end.  The
       second time through the loop, you will rewrite the entire file from line 1 through the end.  The
       third time through the loop, you will rewrite the entire file from line 2 to the end.  And so on.

       If the performance in such cases is unacceptable, you may defer the actual writing, and then have it
       done all at once.  The following loop will perform much better for large files:

               (tied @a)-&gt;defer;
               for (@a) {
                 $_ = "&gt; $_";
               }
               (tied @a)-&gt;flush;

       If "Tie::File"'s memory limit is large enough, all the writing will done in memory.  Then, when you
       call "-&gt;flush", the entire file will be rewritten in a single pass.

       (Actually, the preceding discussion is something of a fib.  You don't need to enable deferred writing
       to get good performance for this common case, because "Tie::File" will do it for you automatically
       unless you specifically tell it not to.  See "autodeferring", below.)

       Calling "-&gt;flush" returns the array to immediate-write mode.  If you wish to discard the deferred
       writes, you may call "-&gt;discard" instead of "-&gt;flush".  Note that in some cases, some of the data
       will have been written already, and it will be too late for "-&gt;discard" to discard all the changes.
       Support for "-&gt;discard" may be withdrawn in a future version of "Tie::File".

       Deferred writes are cached in memory up to the limit specified by the "dw_size" option (see above).
       If the deferred-write buffer is full and you try to write still more deferred data, the buffer will
       be flushed.  All buffered data will be written immediately, the buffer will be emptied, and the now-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">empty&nbsp;nowempty</font>
       empty space will be used for future deferred writes.

       If the deferred-write buffer isn't yet full, but the total size of the buffer and the read cache
       would exceed the "memory" limit, the oldest records will be expired from the read cache until the
       total size is under the limit.

       "push", "pop", "shift", "unshift", and "splice" cannot be deferred.  When you perform one of these
       operations, any deferred data is written to the file and the operation is performed immediately.
       This may change in a future version.

       If you resize the array with deferred writing enabled, the file will be resized immediately, but
       deferred records will not be written.  This has a surprising consequence: "@a = (...)" erases the
       file immediately, but the writing of the actual data is deferred.  This might be a bug.  If it is a
       bug, it will be fixed in a future version.

       <b>Autodeferring</b>

       "Tie::File" tries to guess when deferred writing might be helpful, and to turn it on and off automat-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ically.&nbsp;automatically.</font>
       ically.

               for (@a) {
                 $_ = "&gt; $_";
               }

       In this example, only the first two assignments will be done immediately; after this, all the changes
       to the file will be deferred up to the user-specified memory limit.

       You should usually be able to ignore this and just use the module without thinking about deferring.
       However, special applications may require fine control over which writes are deferred, or may require
       that all writes be immediate.  To disable the autodeferment feature, use

               (tied @o)-&gt;autodefer(0);

       or

               tie @array, 'Tie::File', $file, autodefer =&gt; 0;

       Similarly, "-&gt;autodefer(1)" re-enables autodeferment, and "-&gt;autodefer()" recovers the current value
       of the autodefer setting.

       Caching and deferred writing are inappropriate if you want the same file to be accessed simultane-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ously&nbsp;simultaneously</font>
       ously from more than one process.  Other optimizations performed internally by this module are also
       incompatible with concurrent access.  A future version of this module will support a "concurrent =&gt;
       1" option that enables safe concurrent access.

       Previous versions of this documentation suggested using "memory =&gt; 0" for safe concurrent access.
       This was mistaken.  Tie::File will not support safe concurrent access before version 0.98.

<b>CAVEATS</b>
       (That's Latin for 'warnings'.)

          Reasonable effort was made to make this module efficient.  Nevertheless, changing the size of a
           record in the middle of a large file will always be fairly slow, because everything after the new
           record must be moved.

          The behavior of tied arrays is not precisely the same as for regular arrays.  For example:

                   # This DOES print "How unusual!"
                   undef $a[10];  print "How unusual!\n" if defined $a[10];

           "undef"-ing a "Tie::File" array element just blanks out the corresponding record in the file.
           When you read it back again, you'll get the empty string, so the supposedly-"undef"'ed value will
           be defined.  Similarly, if you have "autochomp" disabled, then

                   # This DOES print "How unusual!" if 'autochomp' is disabled
                   undef $a[10];
                   print "How unusual!\n" if $a[10];

           Because when "autochomp" is disabled, $a[10] will read back as "\n" (or whatever the record sepa-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rator&nbsp;separator</font>
           rator string is.)

           There are other minor differences, particularly regarding "exists" and "delete", but in general,
           the correspondence is extremely close.

          I have supposed that since this module is concerned with file I/O, almost all normal use of it
           will be heavily I/O bound.  This means that the time to maintain complicated data structures
           inside the module will be dominated by the time to actually perform the I/O.  When there was an
           opportunity to spend CPU time to avoid doing I/O, I usually tried to take it.

          You might be tempted to think that deferred writing is like transactions, with "flush" as "com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mit"&nbsp;"commit"</font>
           mit" and "discard" as "rollback", but it isn't, so don't.

          There is a large memory overhead for each record offset and for each cache entry: about 310 bytes
           per cached data record, and about 21 bytes per offset table entry.

           The per-record overhead will limit the maximum number of records you can access per file. Note
           that <u>accessing</u> the length of the array via "$x = scalar @tied_file" accesses <b>all</b> records and
           stores their offsets.  The same for "foreach (@tied_file)", even if you exit the loop early.

<b>SUBCLASSING</b>
       This version promises absolutely nothing about the internals, which may change without notice.  A
       future version of the module will have a well-defined and stable subclassing API.

<b>WHAT</b> <b>ABOUT</b> <b>"DB_File"?</b>
       People sometimes point out that DB_File will do something similar, and ask why "Tie::File" module is
       necessary.

       There are a number of reasons that you might prefer "Tie::File".  A list is available at

<b>THANKS</b>
       Gigantic thanks to Jarkko Hietaniemi, for agreeing to put this in the core when I hadn't written it
       yet, and for generally being helpful, supportive, and competent.  (Usually the rule is "choose any
       one.")  Also big thanks to Abhijit Menon-Sen for all of the same things.

       Special thanks to Craig Berry and Peter Prymmer (for VMS portability help), Randy Kobes (for Win32
       portability help), Clinton Pierce and Autrijus Tang (for heroic eleventh-hour Win32 testing above and
       beyond the call of duty), Michael G Schwern (for testing advice), and the rest of the CPAN testers
       (for testing generally).

       Special thanks to Tels for suggesting several speed and memory optimizations.

<b>TODO</b>
       More tests.  (Stuff I didn't think of yet.)

       Paragraph mode?

       Fixed-length mode.  Leave-blanks mode.

       Maybe an autolocking mode?

       For many common uses of the module, the read cache is a liability.  For example, a program that
       inserts a single record, or that scans the file once, will have a cache hit rate of zero.  This sug-
       gests a major optimization: The cache should be initially disabled.  Here's a hybrid approach: Ini-
       tially, the cache is disabled, but the cache code maintains statistics about how high the hit rate
       would be *if* it were enabled.  When it sees the hit rate get high enough, it enables itself.  The
       STAT comments in this code are the beginning of an implementation of this.

       Record locking with <u>fcntl()</u>?  Then the module might support an undo log and get real transactions.
       What a tour de force that would be.

       Keeping track of the highest cached record. This would allow reads-in-a-row to skip the cache lookup
       faster (if reading from 1..N with empty cache at start, the last cached value will be always N-1).

       More tests.
