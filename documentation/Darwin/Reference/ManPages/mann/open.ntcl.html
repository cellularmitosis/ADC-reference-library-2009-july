<b>NAME</b>
       open - Open a file-based or command pipeline channel

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>open</b> <u>fileName</u>
       <b>open</b> <u>fileName</u> <u>access</u>
       <b>open</b> <u>fileName</u> <u>access</u> <u>permissions</u>
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________


<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       This command opens a file, serial port, or command pipeline and returns a channel identifier that may
       be used in future invocations of commands like <b>read</b>, <b>puts</b>, and <b>close</b>.   If  the  first  character  of
       <u>fileName</u>  is not <b>|</b> then the command opens a file: <u>fileName</u> gives the name of the file to open, and it
       must conform to the conventions described in the <b>filename</b> manual entry.

       The <u>access</u> argument, if present, indicates the way in which the file (or command pipeline) is  to  be
       accessed.  In the first form <u>access</u> may have any of the following values:

       <b>r</b>              Open the file for reading only; the file must already exist. This is the default value
                      if <u>access</u> is not specified.

       <b>r+</b>             Open the file for both reading and writing; the file must already exist.

       <b>w</b>              Open the file for writing only.  Truncate it if it exists.  If it doesn't exist,  cre-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ate&nbsp;create</font>
                      ate a new file.

       <b>w+</b>             Open  the  file  for  reading  and  writing.  Truncate it if it exists.  If it doesn't
                      exist, create a new file.

       <b>a</b>              Open the file for writing only.  If the file doesn't exist, create a new  empty  file.
                      Set the initial access position  to the end of the file.

       <b>a+</b>             Open  the file for reading and writing.  If the file doesn't exist, create a new empty
                      file.  Set the initial access position  to the end of the file.

       In the second form, <u>access</u> consists of a list of any of the following flags, all of  which  have  the
       standard POSIX meanings.  One of the flags must be either <b>RDONLY</b>, <b>WRONLY</b> or <b>RDWR</b>.

       <b>RDONLY</b>         Open the file for reading only.

       <b>WRONLY</b>         Open the file for writing only.

       <b>RDWR</b>           Open the file for both reading and writing.

       <b>APPEND</b>         Set the file pointer to the end of the file prior to each write.

       <b>CREAT</b>          Create  the file if it doesn't already exist (without this flag it is an error for the
                      file not to exist).

       <b>EXCL</b>           If <b>CREAT</b> is also specified, an error is returned if the file already exists.

       <b>NOCTTY</b>         If the file is a terminal device, this flag prevents the file from becoming  the  con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">trolling&nbsp;controlling</font>
                      trolling terminal of the process.

       <b>NONBLOCK</b>       Prevents  the process from blocking while opening the file, and possibly in subsequent
                      I/O operations.  The exact behavior of this flag is system- and device-dependent;  its
                      use  is  discouraged (it is better to use the <b>fconfigure</b> command to put a file in non-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">blocking&nbsp;nonblocking</font>
                      blocking mode).  For details refer to your system documentation  on  the  <b>open</b>  system
                      call's <b>O_NONBLOCK</b> flag.

       <b>TRUNC</b>          If the file exists it is truncated to zero length.

       If  a  new file is created as part of opening it, <u>permissions</u> (an integer) is used to set the permis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sions&nbsp;permissions</font>
       sions for the new file in conjunction with  the  process's  file  mode  creation  mask.   <u>Permissions</u>
       defaults to 0666.

       Note that if you are going to be reading or writing binary data from the channel created by this com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand,&nbsp;command,</font>
       mand, you should use the <b>fconfigure</b> command to change the  <b>-translation</b>  option  of  the  channel  to
       <b>binary</b>  before  transferring  any  binary data.  This is in contrast to the ``b'' character passed as
       part of the equivalent of the <u>access</u> parameter to some versions of the C library <u>fopen()</u> function.


<b>COMMAND</b> <b>PIPELINES</b>
       If the first character of <u>fileName</u> is ``|'' then the remaining characters of <u>fileName</u> are treated  as
       a  list  of  arguments that describe a command pipeline to invoke, in the same style as the arguments
       for <b>exec</b>.  In this case, the channel identifier returned by <b>open</b> may be used to  write  to  the  com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand's&nbsp;command's</font>
       mand's  input  pipe  or  read  from its output pipe, depending on the value of <u>access</u>.  If write-only
       access is used (e.g. <u>access</u> is <b>w</b>), then standard output for the pipeline is directed to  the  current
       standard  output  unless  overridden by the command.  If read-only access is used (e.g. <u>access</u> is <b>r</b>),
       standard input for the pipeline is taken from the current standard input  unless  overridden  by  the
       command.   The  id of the spawned process is accessible through the <b>pid</b> command, using the channel id
       returned by <b>open</b> as argument.


<b>SERIAL</b> <b>COMMUNICATIONS</b>                                                                                        |
       If <u>fileName</u> refers to a serial port, then the specified serial port is opened and  initialized  in  a |
       platform-dependent  manner.   Acceptable  values  for  the  <u>fileName</u> to use to open a serial port are |
       described in the PORTABILITY ISSUES section.                                                          |

       The <b>fconfigure</b> command can be used to query and set  additional  configuration  options  specific  to |
       serial ports (where supported):                                                                       |

       <b>-mode</b> <u>baud</u><b>,</b><u>par-</u>                                                                                       |
       <u>ity</u><b>,</b><u>data</u><b>,</b><u>stop</u>                                                                           |             |
              This option is a set of 4 comma-separated values: the baud rate, parity, number of data  bits, |
              and  number  of stop bits for this serial port.  The <u>baud</u> rate is a simple integer that speci- |
              fies the connection speed.  <u>Parity</u> is one of the following letters: <b>n</b>, <b>o</b>,  <b>e</b>,  <b>m</b>,  <b>s</b>;  respec- |
              tively  signifying  the parity options of ``none'', ``odd'', ``even'', ``mark'', or ``space''. |
              <u>Data</u> is the number of data bits and should be an integer from 5 to 8, while <u>stop</u> is the number |
              of stop bits and should be the integer 1 or 2.                                                 |

       <b>-handshake</b>                                                                                            |
       <u>type</u>                                                                                       |          |
              (Windows and Unix). This option is used to setup automatic handshake control.  Note  that  not |
              all handshake types maybe supported by your operating system. The <u>type</u> parameter is case-inde- |
              pendent.                                                                                       |

              If <u>type</u> is <b>none</b> then any handshake is switched  off.   <b>rtscts</b>  activates  hardware  handshake. |
              Hardware  handshake signals are described below.  For software handshake <b>xonxoff</b> the handshake |
              characters can be redefined with <b>-xchar</b>.  An additional hardware handshake <b>dtrdsr</b> is available |
              only under Windows.  There is no default handshake configuration, the initial value depends on |
              your operating system settings.  The <b>-handshake</b> option cannot be queried.                      |

       <b>-queue</b>                                                                                                ||
              (Windows  and Unix). The <b>-queue</b> option can only be queried.  It returns a list of two integers |
              representing the current number of bytes in the input and output queue respectively.           |

       <b>-timeout</b>                                                                                              |
       <u>msec</u>                                                                                         |        |
              (Windows  and  Unix).  This option is used to set the timeout for blocking read operations. It |
              specifies the maximum interval between the reception of two bytes in milliseconds.   For  Unix |
              systems the granularity is 100 milliseconds.  The <b>-timeout</b> option does not affect write opera- |
              tions or nonblocking reads.  This option cannot be queried.                                    |

       <b>-ttycontrol</b> <u>{signal</u> <u>boolean</u> <u>signal</u> <u>boolean</u>                                                            |
       <u>...}</u>                                                       |                                          |
              (Windows and Unix). This option is used to setup the handshake output lines (see below) perma- |
              nently or to send a BREAK over the serial line.  The <u>signal</u> names are case-independent.   <b>{RTS</b> |
              <b>1</b>  <b>DTR</b>  <b>0}</b>  sets  the  RTS output to high and the DTR output to low.  The BREAK condition (see |
              below) is enabled and disabled with <b>{BREAK</b> <b>1}</b> and <b>{BREAK</b> <b>0}</b> respectively.   It's  not  a  good |
              idea to change the <b>RTS</b> (or <b>DTR</b>) signal with active hardware handshake <b>rtscts</b> (or <b>dtrdsr</b>).  The |
              result is unpredictable.  The <b>-ttycontrol</b> option cannot be queried.                            |

       <b>-ttysta-</b>                                                                                              |
       <b>tus</b>                                                                                            |      |
              (Windows  and  Unix). The <b>-ttystatus</b> option can only be queried.  It returns the current modem |
              status and handshake input signals (see below).  The result is a list  of  signal,value  pairs |
              with  a  fixed  order,  e.g.  <b>{CTS</b> <b>1</b> <b>DSR</b> <b>0</b> <b>RING</b> <b>1</b> <b>DCD</b> <b>0}</b>.  The <u>signal</u> names are returned upper |
              case.                                                                                          |

       <b>-xchar</b> <u>{xonChar</u> <u>xof-</u>                                                                                  |
       <u>fChar}</u>                                                                             |                  |
              (Windows  and Unix). This option is used to query or change the software handshake characters. |
              Normally the operating system default should be DC1 (0x11) and  DC3  (0x13)  representing  the |
              ASCII standard XON and XOFF characters.                                                        |

       <b>-pollinterval</b>                                                                                         |
       <u>msec</u>                                                                                    |             |
              (Windows only). This option is used to set the maximum time between  polling  for  fileevents. |
              This affects the time interval between checking for events throughout the Tcl interpreter (the |
              smallest value always wins).  Use this option only if you want to poll the serial port more or |
              less often than 10 msec (the default).                                                         |

       <b>-sysbuffer</b>                                                                                            |
       <u>inSize</u>                                                                                     |          |

       <b>-sysbuffer</b> <u>{inSize</u> <u>out-</u>                                                                               |
       <u>Size}</u>                                                                           |                     |
              (Windows  only). This option is used to change the size of Windows system buffers for a serial |
              channel. Especially at higher communication rates the default input buffer size of 4096  bytes |

       RS-232  is the most commonly used standard electrical interface for serial communications. A negative |
       voltage (-3V..-12V) define a mark (on=1) bit and a positive voltage (+3..+12V) define a space (off=0) |
       bit  (RS-232C).  The following signals are specified for incoming and outgoing data, status lines and |
       handshaking. Here we are using the terms <u>workstation</u> for your computer and  <u>modem</u>  for  the  external |
       device,  because some signal names (DCD, RI) come from modems. Of course your external device may use |
       these signal lines for other purposes.                                                                |

              Valid values for <u>fileName</u> to open a serial port are of the form <b>com</b><u>X</u><b>:</b>, where <u>X</u>  is  a  number,
              generally  from  1 to 4.  This notation only works for serial ports from 1 to 9, if the system
              happens to have more than four.  An attempt to open a serial port that does not exist or has a
              number  greater  than  9  will  fail.  An alternate form of opening serial ports is to use the
              filename <b>\\.\comX</b>, where X is any number that corresponds to a serial port; please  note  that
              this method is considerably slower on Windows 95 and Windows 98.

              When  running  Tcl interactively, there may be some strange interactions between the real con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sole,&nbsp;console,</font>
              sole, if one is present, and a command pipeline that uses standard input or output.  If a com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
              mand  pipeline is opened for reading, some of the lines entered at the console will be sent to
              the command pipeline and some will be sent to the Tcl evaluator.  If  a  command  pipeline  is
              opened  for writing, keystrokes entered into the console are not visible until the the pipe is
              closed.  This behavior occurs whether the command  pipeline  is  executing  16-bit  or  32-bit
              applications.   These  problems only occur because both Tcl and the child application are com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">peting&nbsp;competing</font>
              peting for the console at the same time.  If the command pipeline is started from a script, so
              that  Tcl is not accessing the console, or if the command pipeline does not use standard input
              or output, but is redirected from or to a file, then the above problems do not occur.

       <b>Windows</b> <b>95</b>
              A command pipeline that executes a 16-bit DOS application cannot be opened  for  both  reading
              and  writing,  since  16-bit DOS applications that receive standard input from a pipe and send
              standard output to a pipe run synchronously.  Command pipelines that do not execute 16-bit DOS
              applications run asynchronously and can be opened for both reading and writing.

              When  running  Tcl interactively, there may be some strange interactions between the real con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sole,&nbsp;console,</font>
              sole, if one is present, and a command pipeline that uses standard input or output.  If a com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
              mand  pipeline is opened for reading from a 32-bit application, some of the keystrokes entered
              at the console will be sent to the command pipeline and some will be sent to the  Tcl  evalua-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tor.&nbsp;evaluator.</font>
              tor.   If a command pipeline is opened for writing to a 32-bit application, no output is visi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ble&nbsp;visible</font>
              ble on the console until the the pipe is closed.  These problems only occur because  both  Tcl
              and  the  child  application  are  competing for the console at the same time.  If the command
              pipeline is started from a script, so that Tcl is not accessing the console, or if the command
              pipeline  does not use standard input or output, but is redirected from or to a file, then the
              above problems do not occur.

              Whether or not Tcl is running interactively, if a command pipeline is opened for reading  from
              a 16-bit DOS application, the call to <b>open</b> will not return until end-of-file has been received
              from the command pipeline's standard output.  If a command pipeline is opened for writing to a
              16-bit  DOS  application, no data will be sent to the command pipeline's standard output until
              the pipe is actually closed.  This problem occurs because 16-bit DOS applications are run syn-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">chronously,&nbsp;synchronously,</font>
              chronously, as described above.

       <b>Macintosh</b>
              Opening a serial port is not currently implemented under Macintosh.

              Opening a command pipeline is not supported under Macintosh, since applications do not support
              the concept of standard input or output.

       <b>Unix</b>
              Valid values for <u>fileName</u> to open a serial port are generally of the form <b>/dev/tty</b><u>X</u>,  where  <u>X</u>
              is  <b>a</b>  or <b>b</b>, but the name of any pseudo-file that maps to a serial port may be used.  Advanced |
              configuration options are only supported for serial ports when Tcl is built to use  the  POSIX |
              serial interface.

              When running Tcl interactively, there may be some strange interactions between the console, if
              one is present, and a command pipeline that uses standard input.  If  a  command  pipeline  is
              opened for reading, some of the lines entered at the console will be sent to the command pipe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">line&nbsp;pipeline</font>
              line and some will be sent to the Tcl evaluator.  This problem only occurs  because  both  Tcl
              and  the  child  application  are  competing for the console at the same time.  If the command
              pipeline is started from a script, so that Tcl is not accessing the console, or if the command
              pipeline  does  not  use standard input, but is redirected from a file, then the above problem
              does not occur.
