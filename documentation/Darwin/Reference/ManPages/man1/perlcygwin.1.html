PERLCYGWIN(1)                         Perl Programmers Reference Guide                         PERLCYGWIN(1)



<b>NAME</b>
       README.cygwin - Perl for Cygwin

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       This document will help you configure, make, test and install Perl on Cygwin.  This document also
       describes features of Cygwin that will affect how Perl behaves at runtime.

       <b>NOTE:</b> There are pre-built Perl packages available for Cygwin and a version of Perl is provided in the
       normal Cygwin install.  If you do not need to customize the configuration, consider using one of
       those packages.

<b>PREREQUISITES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>COMPILING</b> <b>PERL</b> <b>ON</b> <b>CYGWIN</b>
       <b>Cygwin</b> <b>=</b> <b>GNU+Cygnus+Windows</b> <b>(Don't</b> <b>leave</b> <b>UNIX</b> <b>without</b> <b>it)</b>

       The Cygwin tools are ports of the popular GNU development tools for Win32 platforms.  They run thanks
       to the Cygwin library which provides the UNIX system calls and environment these programs expect.
       More information about this project can be found at:

         <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">http://www.cygwin.com/</a>

       A recent net or commercial release of Cygwin is required.

       At the time this document was last updated, Cygwin 1.5.2 was current.

       <b>Cygwin</b> <b>Configuration</b>

       While building Perl some changes may be necessary to your Cygwin setup so that Perl builds cleanly.
       These changes are <b>not</b> required for normal Perl usage.

       <b>NOTE:</b> The binaries that are built will run on all Win32 versions.  They do not depend on your host
       system (Win9x/WinME, WinNT/Win2K) or your Cygwin configuration (<u>ntea</u>, <u>ntsec</u>, binary/text mounts).
       The only dependencies come from hard-coded pathnames like "/usr/local".  However, your host system
       and Cygwin configuration will affect Perl's runtime behavior (see "TEST").

       * "PATH"
           Set the "PATH" environment variable so that Configure finds the Cygwin versions of programs.  Any
           Windows directories should be removed or moved to the end of your "PATH".

       * <u>nroff</u>
           If you do not have <u>nroff</u> (which is part of the <u>groff</u> package), Configure will <b>not</b> prompt you to
           install <u>man</u> pages.

       * Permissions
           On WinNT with either the <u>ntea</u> or <u>ntsec</u> "CYGWIN" settings, directory and file permissions may not
           be set correctly.  Since the build process creates directories and files, to be safe you may want
           to run a "chmod -R +w *" on the entire Perl source tree.

           Also, it is a well known WinNT "feature" that files created by a login that is a member of the
           <u>Administrators</u> group will be owned by the <u>Administrators</u> group.  Depending on your umask, you may
           find that you can not write to files that you just created (because you are no longer the owner).
           When using the <u>ntsec</u> "CYGWIN" setting, this is not an issue because it "corrects" the ownership
           to what you would expect on a UNIX system.

<b>CONFIGURE</b> <b>PERL</b> <b>ON</b> <b>CYGWIN</b>
       The default options gathered by Configure with the assistance of <u>hints/cygwin.sh</u> will build a Perl
       that supports dynamic loading (which requires a shared <u>libperl.dll</u>).

       This will run Configure and keep a record:

         ./Configure 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee log.configure

       If you are willing to accept all the defaults run Configure with <b>-de</b>.  However, several useful cus-
       tomizations are available.

       <b>Stripping</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>Binaries</b> <b>on</b> <b>Cygwin</b>

       It is possible to strip the EXEs and DLLs created by the build process.  The resulting binaries will
       be significantly smaller.  If you want the binaries to be stripped, you can either add a <b>-s</b> option
       when Configure prompts you,

         Any additional ld flags (NOT including libraries)? [none] -s
         Any special flags to pass to gcc to use dynamic linking? [none] -s
         Any special flags to pass to ld2 to create a dynamically loaded library?
         [none] -s

       or you can edit <u>hints/cygwin.sh</u> and uncomment the relevant variables near the end of the file.

       <b>Optional</b> <b>Libraries</b> <b>for</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>on</b> <b>Cygwin</b>

       Several Perl functions and modules depend on the existence of some optional libraries.  Configure
       will find them if they are installed in one of the directories listed as being used for library
       searches.  Pre-built packages for most of these are available from the Cygwin installer.

       * "-lcrypt"
           The crypt package distributed with Cygwin is a Linux compatible 56-bit DES crypt port by Corinna
           Vinschen.

           Alternatively, the crypt libraries in GNU libc have been ported to Cygwin.

           The DES based Ultra Fast Crypt port was done by Alexey Truhan:

             <a href="ftp://ftp.uni-erlangen.de/pub/pc/gnuwin32/cygwin/porters/Okhapkin_Sergey/cw32crypt-dist-0.tgz">ftp://ftp.uni-erlangen.de/pub/pc/gnuwin32/cygwin/porters/Okhapkin_Sergey/cw32crypt-dist-0.tgz</a>

           NOTE: There are various export restrictions on DES implementations, see the glibc README for more
           details.

           The MD5 port was done by Andy Piper:

             <a href="ftp://ftp.uni-erlangen.de/pub/pc/gnuwin32/cygwin/porters/Okhapkin_Sergey/libcrypt.tgz">ftp://ftp.uni-erlangen.de/pub/pc/gnuwin32/cygwin/porters/Okhapkin_Sergey/libcrypt.tgz</a>

       * "-lgdbm" ("use GDBM_File")
           GDBM is available for Cygwin.

           NOTE: The GDBM library only works on NTFS partitions.

       * "-ldb" ("use DB_File")
           BerkeleyDB is available for Cygwin.

           NOTE: The BerkeleyDB library only completely works on NTFS partitions.

       * "-lcygipc" ("use IPC::SysV")
           A port of SysV IPC is available for Cygwin.

           NOTE: This has <b>not</b> been extensively tested.  In particular, "d_semctl_semun" is undefined because
           it fails a Configure test and on Win9x the <u>shm*()</u> functions seem to hang.  It also creates a com-
           pile time dependency because <u>perl.h</u> includes <u>&lt;sys/ipc.h&gt;</u> and <u>&lt;sys/sem.h&gt;</u> (which will be required
           in the future when compiling CPAN modules). CURRENTLY NOT SUPPORTED!

       * "-lutil"
           Included with the standard Cygwin netrelease is the inetutils package which includes libutil.a.

       <b>Configure-time</b> <b>Options</b> <b>for</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>on</b> <b>Cygwin</b>

       The <u>INSTALL</u> document describes several Configure-time options.  Some of these will work with Cygwin,
       others are not yet possible.  Also, some of these are experimental.  You can either select an option
       when Configure prompts you or you can define (undefine) symbols on the command line.

       * "-Uusedl"
           Undefining this symbol forces Perl to be compiled statically.

       * "-Uusemymalloc"
           By default Perl uses the "malloc()" included with the Perl source.  If you want to force Perl to
           build with the system "malloc()" undefine this symbol.

       * "-Uuseperlio"
           Undefining this symbol disables the PerlIO abstraction.  PerlIO is now the default; it is not
           recommended to disable PerlIO.

       * "-Dusemultiplicity"
           Multiplicity is required when embedding Perl in a C program and using more than one interpreter
           instance.  This works with the Cygwin port.

       * "-Duse64bitint"
           By default Perl uses 32 bit integers.  If you want to use larger 64 bit integers, define this
           symbol.

       * "-Duselongdouble"
           <u>gcc</u> supports long doubles (12 bytes).  However, several additional long double math functions are
           necessary to use them within Perl (<u>{atan2,</u> <u>cos,</u> <u>exp,</u> <u>floor,</u> <u>fmod,</u> <u>frexp,</u> <u>isnan,</u> <u>log,</u> <u>modf,</u> <u>pow,</u>
           <u>sin,</u> <u>sqrt}l,</u> <u>strtold</u>).  These are <b>not</b> yet available with Cygwin.

       * "-Dusethreads"
           POSIX threads are implemented in Cygwin, define this symbol if you want a threaded perl.

       * "-Duselargefiles"
           Cygwin uses 64-bit integers for internal size and position calculations, this will be correctly
           detected and defined by Configure.

       * "-Dmksymlinks"
           Use this to build perl outside of the source tree.  This works with Cygwin.  Details can be found
           in the <u>INSTALL</u> document.  This is the recommended way to build perl from sources.

       <b>Suspicious</b> <b>Warnings</b> <b>on</b> <b>Cygwin</b>

       You may see some messages during Configure that seem suspicious.

       * <u>dlsym()</u>
           <u>ld2</u> is needed to build dynamic libraries, but it does not exist when "dlsym()" checking occurs
           (it is not created until "make" runs).  You will see the following message:

             Checking whether your C&lt;dlsym()&gt; needs a leading underscore ...
             ld2: not found
             I can't compile and run the test program.
             I'm guessing that dlsym doesn't need a leading underscore.

           Since the guess is correct, this is not a problem.

       * Win9x and "d_eofnblk"
           Win9x does not correctly report "EOF" with a non-blocking read on a closed pipe.  You will see
           the following messages:

             But it also returns -1 to signal EOF, so be careful!
             WARNING: you can't distinguish between EOF and no data!

             *** WHOA THERE!!! ***
                 The recommended value for $d_eofnblk on this machine was "define"!
                 Keep the recommended value? [y]

           At least for consistency with WinNT, you should keep the recommended value.

       * Compiler/Preprocessor defines
           The following error occurs because of the Cygwin "#define" of "_LONG_DOUBLE":

             Guessing which symbols your C compiler and preprocessor define...
             try.c:&lt;line#&gt;: missing binary operator

           This failure does not seem to cause any problems.  With older gcc versions, "parse error" is
           reported instead of "missing binary operator".

<b>MAKE</b> <b>ON</b> <b>CYGWIN</b>
       Simply run <u>make</u> and wait:

         make 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee log.make

       <b>Errors</b> <b>on</b> <b>Cygwin</b>

       Errors like these are normal:

         ...
         make: [extra.pods] Error 1 (ignored)
         ...
         make: [extras.make] Error 1 (ignored)

       <b>ld2</b> <b>on</b> <b>Cygwin</b>

       During "make", <u>ld2</u> will be created and installed in your $installbin directory (where you said to put
       public executables).  It does not wait until the "make install" process to install the <u>ld2</u> script,
       this is because the remainder of the "make" refers to <u>ld2</u> without fully specifying its path and does
       this from multiple subdirectories.  The assumption is that $installbin is in your current "PATH".  If
       this is not the case "make" will fail at some point.  If this happens, just manually copy <u>ld2</u> from
       the source directory to somewhere in your "PATH".

<b>TEST</b> <b>ON</b> <b>CYGWIN</b>
       There are two steps to running the test suite:

         make test 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee log.make-test

         cd t;./perl harness 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee ../log.harness

       The same tests are run both times, but more information is provided when running as "./perl harness".

       Test results vary depending on your host system and your Cygwin configuration.  If a test can pass in
       some Cygwin setup, it is always attempted and explainable test failures are documented.  It is possi-
       ble for Perl to pass all the tests, but it is more likely that some tests will fail for one of the
       reasons listed below.

       <b>File</b> <b>Permissions</b> <b>on</b> <b>Cygwin</b>

       UNIX file permissions are based on sets of mode bits for {read,write,execute} for each
       {user,group,other}.  By default Cygwin only tracks the Win32 read-only attribute represented as the
       UNIX file user write bit (files are always readable, files are executable if they have a
       <u>.{com,bat,exe}</u> extension or begin with "#!", directories are always readable and executable).  On
       WinNT with the <u>ntea</u> "CYGWIN" setting, the additional mode bits are stored as extended file
       attributes.  On WinNT with the <u>ntsec</u> "CYGWIN" setting, permissions use the standard WinNT security
       descriptors and access control lists.  Without one of these options, these tests will fail (listing
       not updated yet):

       <b>NDBM_File</b> <b>and</b> <b>ODBM_File</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>FAT</b> <b>filesystems</b>

       Do not use NDBM_File or ODBM_File on FAT filesystem.  They can be built on a FAT filesystem, but many
       tests will fail:

        ../ext/NDBM_File/ndbm.t       13  3328    71   59  83.10%  1-2 4 16-71

        run/fresh_perl.t                          97    1   1.03%  91

       If you intend to run only on FAT (or if using AnyDBM_File on FAT), run Configure with the -Ui_ndbm
       and -Ui_dbm options to prevent NDBM_File and ODBM_File being built.

       With NTFS (and CYGWIN=ntsec), there should be no problems even if perl was built on FAT.

       <b>"fork()"</b> <b>failures</b> <b>in</b> <b>io_*</b> <b>tests</b>

       A "fork()" failure may result in the following tests failing:

         ext/IO/lib/IO/t/io_multihomed.t
         ext/IO/lib/IO/t/io_sock.t
         ext/IO/lib/IO/t/io_unix.t

       See comment on fork in Miscellaneous below.

<b>Specific</b> <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cygwin</b> <b>port</b>
       <b>Script</b> <b>Portability</b> <b>on</b> <b>Cygwin</b>

       Cygwin does an outstanding job of providing UNIX-like semantics on top of Win32 systems.  However, in
       addition to the items noted above, there are some differences that you should know about.  This is a
       very brief guide to portability, more information can be found in the Cygwin documentation.

       * Pathnames
           Cygwin pathnames can be separated by forward (<u>/</u>) or backward (<u>\\</u>) slashes.  They may also begin
           with drive letters (<u>C:</u>) or Universal Naming Codes (<u>//UNC</u>).  DOS device names (<u>aux</u>, <u>con</u>, <u>prn</u>,
           <u>com*</u>, <u>lpt?</u>, <u>nul</u>) are invalid as base filenames.  However, they can be used in extensions (e.g.,
           <u>hello.aux</u>).  Names may contain all printable characters except these:

             : * ? " &lt; &gt; |

           File names are case insensitive, but case preserving.  A pathname that contains a backslash or
           drive letter is a Win32 pathname (and not subject to the translations applied to POSIX style
           pathnames).

       * Text/Binary
           When a file is opened it is in either text or binary mode.  In text mode a file is subject to
           CR/LF/Ctrl-Z translations.  With Cygwin, the default mode for an "open()" is determined by the
           mode of the mount that underlies the file.  Perl provides a "binmode()" function to set binary
           mode on files that otherwise would be treated as text.  "sysopen()" with the "O_TEXT" flag sets
           text mode on files that otherwise would be treated as binary:

               sysopen(FOO, "bar", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TEXT)

           "lseek()", "tell()" and "sysseek()" only work with files opened in binary mode.

           The text/binary issue is covered at length in the Cygwin documentation.

       * PerlIO
           PerlIO overrides the default Cygwin Text/Binary behaviour.  A file will always treated as binary,
           regardless which mode of the mount it lives on, just like it is in UNIX.  So CR/LF translation
           needs to be requested in either the "open()" call like this:

             open(FH, "&gt;:crlf", "out.txt");

           which will do conversion from LF to CR/LF on the output, or in the environment settings (add this
           to your .bashrc):

             export PERLIO=crlf

           which will pull in the crlf PerlIO layer which does LF -&gt; CRLF conversion on every output gener-
           ated by perl.

       * <u>.exe</u>
           The Cygwin "stat()", "lstat()" and "readlink()" functions make the <u>.exe</u> extension transparent by
           looking for <u>foo.exe</u> when you ask for <u>foo</u> (unless a <u>foo</u> also exists).  Cygwin does not require a
           <u>.exe</u> extension, but <u>gcc</u> adds it automatically when building a program.  However, when accessing
           an executable as a normal file (e.g., <u>cp</u> in a makefile) the <u>.exe</u> is not transparent.  The <u>install</u>
           included with Cygwin automatically appends a <u>.exe</u> when necessary.

       * cygwin vs. windows process ids
           Cygwin processes have their own pid, which is different from the underlying windows pid.  Most
           posix compliant Proc functions expect the cygwin pid, but several Win32::Process functions expect
           the winpid. E.g. $$ is the cygwin pid of <u>/usr/bin/perl</u>, which is not the winpid.  Use "Cyg-
           win::winpid_to_pid()" and "Cygwin::winpid_to_pid()" to translate between them.

       * "chown()"
           On WinNT "chown()" can change a file's user and group IDs.  On Win9x "chown()" is a no-op,
           although this is appropriate since there is no security model.

       * Miscellaneous
           File locking using the "F_GETLK" command to "fcntl()" is a stub that returns "ENOSYS".

           Win9x can not "rename()" an open file (although WinNT can).

           The Cygwin "chroot()" implementation has holes (it can not restrict file access by native Win32
           programs).

           Inplace editing "perl -i" of files doesn't work without doing a backup of the file being edited
           "perl -i.bak" because of windowish restrictions, therefore Perl adds the suffix ".bak" automati-
           cally if you use "perl -i" without specifying a backup extension.

           Using "fork()" after loading multiple dlls may fail with an internal cygwin error like the fol-
           lowing:

             C:\CYGWIN\BIN\PERL.EXE: *** couldn't allocate memory <!-- a -->0x10000(4128768)<!-- /a --> for 'C:\CYGWIN\LIB\PERL5\5.6.1\CYGWIN-MULTI\AUTO\SOCKET\SOCKET.DLL' alignment, Win32 error 8

               200 [main] perl 377147 sync_with_child: child -395691(0xB8) died before initialization with status code 0x1
              1370 [main] perl 377147 sync_with_child: *** child state child loading dlls

           Use the rebase utility to resolve the conflicting dll addresses.  The rebase package is included
           in the Cygwin netrelease.  Use setup.exe from <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/setup.exe"><u>http://www.cygwin.com/setup.exe</u></a> to install it and
           run rebaseall.

       "Cwd::cwd"
           Returns current working directory.

       "Cygwin::pid_to_winpid"
           Translates a cygwin pid to the corresponding Windows pid (which may or may not be the same).

       "Cygwin::winpid_to_pid"
           Translates a Windows pid to the corresponding cygwin pid (if any).

<b>INSTALL</b> <b>PERL</b> <b>ON</b> <b>CYGWIN</b>
       This will install Perl, including <u>man</u> pages.

         make install 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee log.make-install

       NOTE: If "STDERR" is redirected "make install" will <b>not</b> prompt you to install <u>perl</u> into <u>/usr/bin</u>.

       You may need to be <u>Administrator</u> to run "make install".  If you are not, you must have write access
       to the directories in question.

       Information on installing the Perl documentation in HTML format can be found in the <u>INSTALL</u> document.

<b>MANIFEST</b> <b>ON</b> <b>CYGWIN</b>
       These are the files in the Perl release that contain references to Cygwin.  These very brief notes
       attempt to explain the reason for all conditional code.  Hopefully, keeping this up to date will
       allow the Cygwin port to be kept as clean as possible (listing not updated yet).

<b>BUGS</b> <b>ON</b> <b>CYGWIN</b>
       Support for swapping real and effective user and group IDs is incomplete.  On WinNT Cygwin provides
       "setuid()", "seteuid()", "setgid()" and "setegid()".  However, additional Cygwin calls for manipulat-
       ing WinNT access tokens and security contexts are required.
