README - QTStdComprThis sample code illustrates how to use QuickTime's standard image compression dialog routines to get compression settings from the user and to compress an image using those settings. See Chapter 3 of Inside Macintosh: QuickTime Components for complete information on the standard image compression dialog routines.In this sample, we prompt the user to open an image file; then we display the standard imagecompression dialog box and use the settings selected by the user to compress the image. Enjoy,QuickTime Team
