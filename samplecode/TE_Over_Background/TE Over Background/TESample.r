The fundamental TextEdit #	toolbox calls and TextEdit autoscroll are demonstrated. It #	also shows how to create and maintain scrollbar controls.##	It does not by any means demonstrate all the techniques you #	need for a large application. In particular, Sample does not #	cover exception handling, multiple windows/documents, #	sophisticated memory management, printing, or undo. All of #	these are vital parts of a normal full-sized application.##	This application is an example of the form of a Macintosh #	application; it is NOT a template. It is NOT intended to be #	used as a foundation for the next world-class, best-selling, #	600K application. A stick figure drawing of the human body may #	be a good example of the form for a painting, but that does not #	mean it should be used as the basis for the next Mona Lisa.##	We recommend that you review this program or Sample before #	beginning a new application. Sample is a simple app. which doesn’t #	use TextEdit or the Control Manager.#------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/include "TESample.π.rsrc";#include "types.r"/* here is the quintessential MultiFinder friendliness device, the SIZE resource */resource 'SIZE' (-1) {	dontSaveScreen,	acceptSuspendResumeEvents,	enableOptionSwitch,	canBackground,				/* we can background; we don't currently, but our sleep value */								/* guarantees we don't hog the Mac while we are in the background */	multiFinderAware,			/* this says we do our own activate/deactivate; don't fake us out */	backgroundAndForeground,	/* this is definitely not a background-only application! */	dontGetFrontClicks,			/* change this is if you want "do first click" behavior like the Finder */	ignoreChildDiedEvents,		/* essentially, I'm not a debugger (sub-launching) */	not32BitCompatible,			/* this app should not be run in 32-bit address space */	reserved,	reserved,	reserved,	reserved,	reserved,	reserved,	reserved,	384 * 1024,	384 * 1024	};
