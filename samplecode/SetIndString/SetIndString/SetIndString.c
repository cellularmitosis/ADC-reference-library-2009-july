/*	File:		SetIndString.c	Contains:	I have been reviewing your question on how to set the contents of STR# resources				from your program.				As it turns out, there is no Toolbox call to do this, mostly because resources are				not meant to store data which changes frequently.  I have a solution to your				problem, but it comes with a warning: PLEASE DON'T CHANGE ANY OF YOUR APPLICATIONS				RESOURCES WHILE RUNNING.  Doing so will make it impossible for your program to run				off of a fileserver or locked volume.				That out of the way the format of an STR# resource is:				2 bytes       number of strings				-------------------------------				1 byte        length of 1st str				(variable)    1st string data				-------------------------------				1 byte        length of nth str				(variable)    nth string data				...				...				Note that the indexes into the strings are not at set positions, but instead are				relative to the lengths of the previous strings.				Finally, here's a C function, SetIndString() which takes the same parameters as				GetIndString().  This call does the opposite, namely, it sets a particular STR#				string to the passed in string:					Written by: 		Copyright:	Copyright © 1984-1999 by Apple Computer, Inc., All Rights Reserved.				You may incorporate this Apple sample source code into your program(s) without				restriction.
