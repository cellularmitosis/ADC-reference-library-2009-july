About WindowFunThis sample demonstrates how to:	¥ Create an arbitrary number of window layers within your application.  Your application		will typically create windows into one of the predefined classes, floating, utility, etc., 		but with Mac OS X you have the ability to create an arbitrary number of window groups		and layers, as well as set attributes to those groups.			¥ Display an overlay window which is attached to the main window.  Creating an overlay window 		that moves with its parent may be the easiest way to draw transparent text on a movie,		for instance.		¥ A method of drawing transparent lines by drawing to an overlay window. In the past it was 		a comon technique to XOR the bits on your window to draw overlay lines or show selection.		With Mac OS X you may chose to draw semi-transparently into an overlay window for a similar		effect.		¥ How to display the "Poof" the toolbar uses, similar to the dock "Poof".
