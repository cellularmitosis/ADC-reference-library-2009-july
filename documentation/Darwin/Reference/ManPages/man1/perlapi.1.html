PERLAPI(1)                            Perl Programmers Reference Guide                            PERLAPI(1)



<b>NAME</b>
       perlapi - autogenerated documentation for the perl public API

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       This file contains the documentation of the perl public API generated by embed.pl, specifically a
       listing of functions, macros, flags, and variables that may be used by extension writers.  The inter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">faces&nbsp;interfaces</font>
       faces of any functions that are not listed here are subject to change without notice.  For this rea-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">son,&nbsp;reason,</font>
       son, blindly using functions listed in proto.h is to be avoided when writing extensions.

       Note that all Perl API global variables must be referenced with the "PL_" prefix.  Some macros are
       provided for compatibility with the older, unadorned names, but this support may be disabled in a
       future release.

       The listing is alphabetical, case insensitive.

<b>"Gimme"</b> <b>Values</b>
       GIMME   A backward-compatible version of "GIMME_V" which can only return "G_SCALAR" or "G_ARRAY"; in
               a void context, it returns "G_SCALAR".  Deprecated.  Use "GIMME_V" instead.

                       U32     GIMME

       GIMME_V The XSUB-writer's equivalent to Perl's "wantarray".  Returns "G_VOID", "G_SCALAR" or
               "G_ARRAY" for void, scalar or list context, respectively.

                       U32     GIMME_V

       G_ARRAY Used to indicate list context.  See "GIMME_V", "GIMME" and perlcall.

       G_DISCARD
               Indicates that arguments returned from a callback should be discarded.  See perlcall.

       G_EVAL  Used to force a Perl "eval" wrapper around a callback.  See perlcall.

       G_NOARGS
               Indicates that no arguments are being sent to a callback.  See perlcall.

       G_SCALAR
               Used to indicate scalar context.  See "GIMME_V", "GIMME", and perlcall.

       G_VOID  Used to indicate void context.  See "GIMME_V" and perlcall.

<b>Array</b> <b>Manipulation</b> <b>Functions</b>
       AvFILL  Same as "av_len()".  Deprecated, use "av_len()" instead.

                       int     AvFILL(AV* av)

       av_clear
               Clears an array, making it empty.  Does not free the memory used by the array itself.

                       void    av_clear(AV* ar)

       av_delete
               Deletes the element indexed by "key" from the array.  Returns the deleted element. If "flags"
               equals "G_DISCARD", the element is freed and null is returned.

                       SV*     av_delete(AV* ar, I32 key, I32 flags)

       av_exists
               Returns true if the element indexed by "key" has been initialized.

               This relies on the fact that uninitialized array elements are set to &amp;PL_sv_undef.

                       bool    av_exists(AV* ar, I32 key)

       av_extend
               Pre-extend an array.  The "key" is the index to which the array should be extended.

                       void    av_extend(AV* ar, I32 key)

       av_fetch
               Returns the SV at the specified index in the array.  The "key" is the index.  If "lval" is
               set then the fetch will be part of a store.  Check that the return value is non-null before
               dereferencing it to a "SV*".

               See "Understanding the Magic of Tied Hashes and Arrays" in perlguts for more information on
               how to use this function on tied arrays.

                       SV**    av_fetch(AV* ar, I32 key, I32 lval)

       av_fill Ensure than an array has a given number of elements, equivalent to Perl's "$#array = $fill;".

                       void    av_fill(AV* ar, I32 fill)

       av_len  Returns the highest index in the array.  Returns -1 if the array is empty.

                       I32     av_len(AV* ar)

       av_make Creates a new AV and populates it with a list of SVs.  The SVs are copied into the array, so
               they may be freed after the call to av_make.  The new AV will have a reference count of 1.

                       AV*     av_make(I32 size, SV** svp)

       av_pop  Pops an SV off the end of the array.  Returns &amp;PL_sv_undef if the array is empty.

                       SV*     av_pop(AV* ar)

       av_push Pushes an SV onto the end of the array.  The array will grow automatically to accommodate the
               addition.

                       void    av_push(AV* ar, SV* val)

       av_shift
               Shifts an SV off the beginning of the array.

                       SV*     av_shift(AV* ar)

       av_store
               Stores an SV in an array.  The array index is specified as "key".  The return value will be
               NULL if the operation failed or if the value did not need to be actually stored within the
               array (as in the case of tied arrays). Otherwise it can be dereferenced to get the original
               "SV*".  Note that the caller is responsible for suitably incrementing the reference count of
               "val" before the call, and decrementing it if the function returned NULL.

               See "Understanding the Magic of Tied Hashes and Arrays" in perlguts for more information on
               how to use this function on tied arrays.

                       SV**    av_store(AV* ar, I32 key, SV* val)

       av_undef
               Undefines the array.  Frees the memory used by the array itself.

                       void    av_undef(AV* ar)

       av_unshift
               Unshift the given number of "undef" values onto the beginning of the array.  The array will
               grow automatically to accommodate the addition.  You must then use "av_store" to assign val-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ues&nbsp;values</font>
               ues to these new elements.

                       void    av_unshift(AV* ar, I32 num)

       get_av  Returns the AV of the specified Perl array.  If "create" is set and the Perl variable does
               not exist then it will be created.  If "create" is not set and the variable does not exist
               then NULL is returned.

               NOTE: the perl_ form of this function is deprecated.

                       AV*     get_av(const char* name, I32 create)

       newAV   Creates a new AV.  The reference count is set to 1.

                       AV*     newAV()

       sortsv  Sort an array. Here is an example:

                   sortsv(AvARRAY(av), av_len(av)+1, Perl_sv_cmp_locale);

               See lib/sort.pm for details about controlling the sorting algorithm.

                       void    sortsv(SV** array, size_t num_elts, SVCOMPARE_t cmp)

<b>Callback</b> <b>Functions</b>

                       char    toUPPER(char ch)

<b>Cloning</b> <b>an</b> <b>interpreter</b>
       perl_clone
               Create and return a new interpreter by cloning the current one.

               perl_clone takes these flags as parameters:

               CLONEf_COPY_STACKS - is used to, well, copy the stacks also, without it we only clone the
               data and zero the stacks, with it we copy the stacks and the new perl interpreter is ready to
               run at the exact same point as the previous one.  The pseudo-fork code uses COPY_STACKS while
               the threads-&gt;new doesn't.

               CLONEf_KEEP_PTR_TABLE perl_clone keeps a ptr_table with the pointer of the old variable as a
               key and the new variable as a value, this allows it to check if something has been cloned and
               not clone it again but rather just use the value and increase the refcount. If KEEP_PTR_TABLE
               is not set then perl_clone will kill the ptr_table using the function "ptr_ta-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ble_free(PL_ptr_table);&nbsp;"ptr_table_free(PL_ptr_table);</font>
               ble_free(PL_ptr_table); PL_ptr_table = NULL;", reason to keep it around is if you want to dup
               some of your own variable who are outside the graph perl scans, example of this code is in
               threads.xs create

               CLONEf_CLONE_HOST This is a win32 thing, it is ignored on unix, it tells perls win32host code
               (which is c++) to clone itself, this is needed on win32 if you want to run two threads at the
               same time, if you just want to do some stuff in a separate perl interpreter and then throw it
               away and return to the original one, you don't need to do anything.

                       PerlInterpreter*        perl_clone(PerlInterpreter* interp, UV flags)

<b>CV</b> <b>Manipulation</b> <b>Functions</b>
       CvSTASH Returns the stash of the CV.

                       HV*     CvSTASH(CV* cv)

       get_cv  Returns the CV of the specified Perl subroutine.  If "create" is set and the Perl subroutine
               does not exist then it will be declared (which has the same effect as saying "sub name;").
               If "create" is not set and the subroutine does not exist then NULL is returned.

               NOTE: the perl_ form of this function is deprecated.

                       CV*     get_cv(const char* name, I32 create)

<b>Embedding</b> <b>Functions</b>
       cv_undef
               Clear out all the active components of a CV. This can happen either by an explicit "undef
               &amp;foo", or by the reference count going to zero.  In the former case, we keep the CvOUTSIDE
               pointer, so that any anonymous children can still follow the full lexical scope chain.

                       void    cv_undef(CV* cv)

       load_module
               Loads the module whose name is pointed to by the string part of name.  Note that the actual
               module name, not its filename, should be given.  Eg, "Foo::Bar" instead of "Foo/Bar.pm".
               flags can be any of PERL_LOADMOD_DENY, PERL_LOADMOD_NOIMPORT, or PERL_LOADMOD_IMPORT_OPS (or
               0 for no flags). ver, if specified, provides version semantics similar to "use Foo::Bar VER-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">SION".&nbsp;VERSION".</font>
               SION".  The optional trailing SV* arguments can be used to specify arguments to the module's
               <u>import()</u> method, similar to "use Foo::Bar VERSION LIST".

                       void    load_module(U32 flags, SV* name, SV* ver, ...)

       nothreadhook
               Stub that provides thread hook for perl_destruct when there are no threads.

                       int     nothreadhook()

       perl_alloc
               Allocates a new Perl interpreter.  See perlembed.

                       PerlInterpreter*        perl_alloc()

       perl_construct
               Initializes a new Perl interpreter.  See perlembed.

                       void    perl_construct(PerlInterpreter* interp)

       perl_destruct
               Shuts down a Perl interpreter.  See perlembed.

                       int     perl_destruct(PerlInterpreter* interp)

       perl_free
               Releases a Perl interpreter.  See perlembed.

                       void    perl_free(PerlInterpreter* interp)

       perl_parse
               Tells a Perl interpreter to parse a Perl script.  See perlembed.

                       int     perl_parse(PerlInterpreter* interp, XSINIT_t xsinit, int argc, char** argv, char** env)

       perl_run
               Tells a Perl interpreter to run.  See perlembed.

                       int     perl_run(PerlInterpreter* interp)

       require_pv
               Tells Perl to "require" the file named by the string argument.  It is analogous to the Perl
               code "eval "require '$file'"".  It's even implemented that way; consider using load_module
               instead.

               NOTE: the perl_ form of this function is deprecated.

                       void    require_pv(const char* pv)

<b>Functions</b> <b>in</b> <b>file</b> <b>pp_pack.c</b>
       packlist
               The engine implementing <u>pack()</u> Perl function.

                       void    packlist(SV *cat, char *pat, char *patend, SV **beglist, SV **endlist)

       pack_cat
               The engine implementing <u>pack()</u> Perl function. Note: parameters next_in_list and flags are not
               used. This call should not be used; use packlist instead.

                       void    pack_cat(SV *cat, char *pat, char *patend, SV **beglist, SV **endlist, SV ***next_in_list, U32 flags)

       unpackstring
               The engine implementing <u>unpack()</u> Perl function. "unpackstring" puts the extracted list items
               on the stack and returns the number of elements.  Issue "PUTBACK" before and "SPAGAIN" after
               the call to this function.

                       I32     unpackstring(char *pat, char *patend, char *s, char *strend, U32 flags)

       unpack_str
               The engine implementing <u>unpack()</u> Perl function. Note: parameters strbeg, new_s and ocnt are
               not used. This call should not be used, use unpackstring instead.

                       I32     unpack_str(char *pat, char *patend, char *s, char *strbeg, char *strend, char **new_s, I32 ocnt, U32 flags)

<b>Global</b> <b>Variables</b>
       PL_modglobal
               "PL_modglobal" is a general purpose, interpreter global HV for use by extensions that need to
               keep information on a per-interpreter basis.  In a pinch, it can also be used as a symbol ta-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ble&nbsp;table</font>
               ble for extensions to share data among each other.  It is a good idea to use keys prefixed by
               the package name of the extension that owns the data.

                       HV*     PL_modglobal

       PL_na   A convenience variable which is typically used with "SvPV" when one doesn't care about the
               length of the string.  It is usually more efficient to either declare a local variable and
               use that instead or to use the "SvPV_nolen" macro.

                       STRLEN  PL_na

       PL_sv_no
               This is the "false" SV.  See "PL_sv_yes".  Always refer to this as &amp;PL_sv_no.

                       SV      PL_sv_no

       PL_sv_undef
               This is the "undef" SV.  Always refer to this as &amp;PL_sv_undef.

                       SV      PL_sv_undef

       PL_sv_yes
               This is the "true" SV.  See "PL_sv_no".  Always refer to this as &amp;PL_sv_yes.

<b>GV</b> <b>Functions</b>
       GvSV    Return the SV from the GV.

                       SV*     GvSV(GV* gv)

       gv_fetchmeth
               Returns the glob with the given "name" and a defined subroutine or "NULL".  The glob lives in
               the given "stash", or in the stashes accessible via @ISA and UNIVERSAL::.

               The argument "level" should be either 0 or -1.  If "level==0", as a side-effect creates a
               glob with the given "name" in the given "stash" which in the case of success contains an
               alias for the subroutine, and sets up caching info for this glob.  Similarly for all the
               searched stashes.

               This function grants "SUPER" token as a postfix of the stash name. The GV returned from
               "gv_fetchmeth" may be a method cache entry, which is not visible to Perl code.  So when call-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;calling</font>
               ing "call_sv", you should not use the GV directly; instead, you should use the method's CV,
               which can be obtained from the GV with the "GvCV" macro.

                       GV*     gv_fetchmeth(HV* stash, const char* name, STRLEN len, I32 level)

       gv_fetchmethod
               See gv_fetchmethod_autoload.

                       GV*     gv_fetchmethod(HV* stash, const char* name)

       gv_fetchmethod_autoload
               Returns the glob which contains the subroutine to call to invoke the method on the "stash".
               In fact in the presence of autoloading this may be the glob for "AUTOLOAD".  In this case the
               corresponding variable $AUTOLOAD is already setup.

               The third parameter of "gv_fetchmethod_autoload" determines whether AUTOLOAD lookup is per-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">formed&nbsp;performed</font>
               formed if the given method is not present: non-zero means yes, look for AUTOLOAD; zero means
               no, don't look for AUTOLOAD.  Calling "gv_fetchmethod" is equivalent to calling "gv_fetch-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">method_autoload"&nbsp;"gv_fetchmethod_autoload"</font>
               method_autoload" with a non-zero "autoload" parameter.

               These functions grant "SUPER" token as a prefix of the method name. Note that if you want to
               keep the returned glob for a long time, you need to check for it being "AUTOLOAD", since at
               the later time the call may load a different subroutine due to $AUTOLOAD changing its value.
               Use the glob created via a side effect to do this.

               These functions have the same side-effects and as "gv_fetchmeth" with "level==0".  "name"
               should be writable if contains ':' or "' ''". The warning against passing the GV returned by
               "gv_fetchmeth" to "call_sv" apply equally to these functions.

                       GV*     gv_fetchmethod_autoload(HV* stash, const char* name, I32 autoload)

       gv_fetchmeth_autoload
               Same as <u>gv</u><b>_</b><u>fetchmeth()</u>, but looks for autoloaded subroutines too.  Returns a glob for the
               subroutine.

               For an autoloaded subroutine without a GV, will create a GV even if "level &lt; 0".  For an
               autoloaded subroutine without a stub, <u>GvCV()</u> of the result may be zero.

                       GV*     gv_fetchmeth_autoload(HV* stash, const char* name, STRLEN len, I32 level)

       gv_stashpv
               Returns a pointer to the stash for a specified package.  "name" should be a valid UTF-8
               string and must be null-terminated.  If "create" is set then the package will be created if
               it does not already exist.  If "create" is not set and the package does not exist then NULL
               is returned.

                       HV*     gv_stashpv(const char* name, I32 create)

       gv_stashpvn
               Returns a pointer to the stash for a specified package.  "name" should be a valid UTF-8
               string.  The "namelen" parameter indicates the length of the "name", in bytes.  If "create"
               is set then the package will be created if it does not already exist.  If "create" is not set
               and the package does not exist then NULL is returned.

                       HV*     gv_stashpvn(const char* name, U32 namelen, I32 create)

       gv_stashsv
               Returns a pointer to the stash for a specified package, which must be a valid UTF-8 string.
               See "gv_stashpv".

                       HV*     gv_stashsv(SV* sv, I32 create)

<b>Handy</b> <b>Values</b>
       Nullav  Null AV pointer.

       Nullcv  Null CV pointer.

       Nullhv  Null HV pointer.

       Nullsv  Null SV pointer.

<b>Hash</b> <b>Manipulation</b> <b>Functions</b>
       get_hv  Returns the HV of the specified Perl hash.  If "create" is set and the Perl variable does not
               exist then it will be created.  If "create" is not set and the variable does not exist then
               NULL is returned.

               NOTE: the perl_ form of this function is deprecated.

                       HV*     get_hv(const char* name, I32 create)

       HEf_SVKEY
               This flag, used in the length slot of hash entries and magic structures, specifies the struc-
               ture contains an "SV*" pointer where a "char*" pointer is to be expected. (For information
               only--not to be used).

       HeHASH  Returns the computed hash stored in the hash entry.

                       U32     HeHASH(HE* he)

       HeKEY   Returns the actual pointer stored in the key slot of the hash entry. The pointer may be
               either "char*" or "SV*", depending on the value of "HeKLEN()".  Can be assigned to.  The
               "HePV()" or "HeSVKEY()" macros are usually preferable for finding the value of a key.

                       void*   HeKEY(HE* he)

       HeKLEN  If this is negative, and amounts to "HEf_SVKEY", it indicates the entry holds an "SV*" key.
               Otherwise, holds the actual length of the key.  Can be assigned to. The "HePV()" macro is
               usually preferable for finding key lengths.

                       STRLEN  HeKLEN(HE* he)

       HePV    Returns the key slot of the hash entry as a "char*" value, doing any necessary dereferencing
               of possibly "SV*" keys.  The length of the string is placed in "len" (this is a macro, so do
               <u>not</u> use &amp;len).  If you do not care about what the length of the key is, you may use the
               global variable "PL_na", though this is rather less efficient than using a local variable.
               Remember though, that hash keys in perl are free to contain embedded nulls, so using
               "strlen()" or similar is not a good way to find the length of hash keys. This is very similar
               to the "SvPV()" macro described elsewhere in this document.

                       char*   HePV(HE* he, STRLEN len)

       HeSVKEY Returns the key as an "SV*", or "Nullsv" if the hash entry does not contain an "SV*" key.

                       SV*     HeSVKEY(HE* he)

       HeSVKEY_force
               Returns the key as an "SV*".  Will create and return a temporary mortal "SV*" if the hash
               entry contains only a "char*" key.

                       SV*     HeSVKEY_force(HE* he)

       HeSVKEY_set
               Sets the key to a given "SV*", taking care to set the appropriate flags to indicate the pres-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ence&nbsp;presence</font>
               ence of an "SV*" key, and returns the same "SV*".

                       SV*     HeSVKEY_set(HE* he, SV* sv)

       HeVAL   Returns the value slot (type "SV*") stored in the hash entry.

                       SV*     HeVAL(HE* he)

       HvNAME  Returns the package name of a stash.  See "SvSTASH", "CvSTASH".

                       char*   HvNAME(HV* stash)

       hv_clear
               Clears a hash, making it empty.

                       void    hv_clear(HV* tb)

       hv_clear_placeholders
               Clears any placeholders from a hash.  If a restricted hash has any of its keys marked as
               readonly and the key is subsequently deleted, the key is not actually deleted but is marked
               by assigning it a value of &amp;PL_sv_placeholder.  This tags it so it will be ignored by future
               operations such as iterating over the hash, but will still allow the hash to have a value
               reassigned to the key at some future point.  This function clears any such placeholder keys
               from the hash.  See <u>Hash::Util::lock</u><b>_</b><u>keys()</u> for an example of its use.

                       void    hv_clear_placeholders(HV* hb)

       hv_delete
               Deletes a key/value pair in the hash.  The value SV is removed from the hash and returned to
               the caller.  The "klen" is the length of the key.  The "flags" value will normally be zero;
               if set to G_DISCARD then NULL will be returned.

                       SV*     hv_delete(HV* tb, const char* key, I32 klen, I32 flags)

       hv_delete_ent
               Deletes a key/value pair in the hash.  The value SV is removed from the hash and returned to
               the caller.  The "flags" value will normally be zero; if set to G_DISCARD then NULL will be
               returned.  "hash" can be a valid precomputed hash value, or 0 to ask for it to be computed.

                       SV*     hv_delete_ent(HV* tb, SV* key, I32 flags, U32 hash)

       hv_exists
               Returns a boolean indicating whether the specified hash key exists.  The "klen" is the length
               of the key.

                       bool    hv_exists(HV* tb, const char* key, I32 klen)

       hv_exists_ent
               Returns a boolean indicating whether the specified hash key exists. "hash" can be a valid
               precomputed hash value, or 0 to ask for it to be computed.

                       bool    hv_exists_ent(HV* tb, SV* key, U32 hash)

       hv_fetch
               Returns the SV which corresponds to the specified key in the hash.  The "klen" is the length
               of the key.  If "lval" is set then the fetch will be part of a store.  Check that the return
               value is non-null before dereferencing it to an "SV*".

               See "Understanding the Magic of Tied Hashes and Arrays" in perlguts for more information on
               how to use this function on tied hashes.

                       SV**    hv_fetch(HV* tb, const char* key, I32 klen, I32 lval)

       hv_fetch_ent
               Returns the hash entry which corresponds to the specified key in the hash.  "hash" must be a
               valid precomputed hash number for the given "key", or 0 if you want the function to compute
               it.  IF "lval" is set then the fetch will be part of a store.  Make sure the return value is
               non-null before accessing it.  The return value when "tb" is a tied hash is a pointer to a
               static location, so be sure to make a copy of the structure if you need to store it some-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">where.&nbsp;somewhere.</font>
               where.

               See "Understanding the Magic of Tied Hashes and Arrays" in perlguts for more information on
               how to use this function on tied hashes.

       hv_iterinit
               Prepares a starting point to traverse a hash table.  Returns the number of keys in the hash
               (i.e. the same as "HvKEYS(tb)").  The return value is currently only meaningful for hashes
               without tie magic.

               NOTE: Before version 5.004_65, "hv_iterinit" used to return the number of hash buckets that
               happen to be in use.  If you still need that esoteric value, you can get it through the macro
               "HvFILL(tb)".

                       I32     hv_iterinit(HV* tb)

       hv_iterkey
               Returns the key from the current position of the hash iterator.  See "hv_iterinit".

                       char*   hv_iterkey(HE* entry, I32* retlen)

       hv_iterkeysv
               Returns the key as an "SV*" from the current position of the hash iterator.  The return value
               will always be a mortal copy of the key.  Also see "hv_iterinit".

                       SV*     hv_iterkeysv(HE* entry)

       hv_iternext
               Returns entries from a hash iterator.  See "hv_iterinit".

               You may call "hv_delete" or "hv_delete_ent" on the hash entry that the iterator currently
               points to, without losing your place or invalidating your iterator.  Note that in this case
               the current entry is deleted from the hash with your iterator holding the last reference to
               it.  Your iterator is flagged to free the entry on the next call to "hv_iternext", so you
               must not discard your iterator immediately else the entry will leak - call "hv_iternext" to
               trigger the resource deallocation.

                       HE*     hv_iternext(HV* tb)

       hv_iternextsv
               Performs an "hv_iternext", "hv_iterkey", and "hv_iterval" in one operation.

                       SV*     hv_iternextsv(HV* hv, char** key, I32* retlen)

       hv_iternext_flags
               Returns entries from a hash iterator.  See "hv_iterinit" and "hv_iternext".  The "flags"
               value will normally be zero; if HV_ITERNEXT_WANTPLACEHOLDERS is set the placeholders keys
               (for restricted hashes) will be returned in addition to normal keys. By default placeholders
               are automatically skipped over.  Currently a placeholder is implemented with a value that is
               &amp;Perl_sv_placeholder. Note that the implementation of placeholders and restricted hashes may
               change, and the implementation currently is insufficiently abstracted for any change to be
               tidy.

               NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be removed without notice.

                       HE*     hv_iternext_flags(HV* tb, I32 flags)

       hv_iterval
               Returns the value from the current position of the hash iterator.  See "hv_iterkey".

       hv_magic
               Adds magic to a hash.  See "sv_magic".

                       void    hv_magic(HV* hv, GV* gv, int how)

       hv_scalar
               Evaluates the hash in scalar context and returns the result. Handles magic when the hash is
               tied.

                       SV*     hv_scalar(HV* hv)

       hv_store
               Stores an SV in a hash.  The hash key is specified as "key" and "klen" is the length of the
               key.  The "hash" parameter is the precomputed hash value; if it is zero then Perl will com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pute&nbsp;compute</font>
               pute it.  The return value will be NULL if the operation failed or if the value did not need
               to be actually stored within the hash (as in the case of tied hashes).  Otherwise it can be
               dereferenced to get the original "SV*".  Note that the caller is responsible for suitably
               incrementing the reference count of "val" before the call, and decrementing it if the func-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;function</font>
               tion returned NULL.  Effectively a successful hv_store takes ownership of one reference to
               "val".  This is usually what you want; a newly created SV has a reference count of one, so if
               all your code does is create SVs then store them in a hash, hv_store will own the only refer-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ence&nbsp;reference</font>
               ence to the new SV, and your code doesn't need to do anything further to tidy up.  hv_store
               is not implemented as a call to hv_store_ent, and does not create a temporary SV for the key,
               so if your key data is not already in SV form then use hv_store in preference to

                       SV**    hv_store(HV* tb, const char* key, I32 klen, SV* val, U32 hash)

       hv_store_ent
               Stores "val" in a hash.  The hash key is specified as "key".  The "hash" parameter is the
               precomputed hash value; if it is zero then Perl will compute it.  The return value is the new
               hash entry so created.  It will be NULL if the operation failed or if the value did not need
               to be actually stored within the hash (as in the case of tied hashes).  Otherwise the con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tents&nbsp;contents</font>
               tents of the return value can be accessed using the "He?" macros described here.  Note that
               the caller is responsible for suitably incrementing the reference count of "val" before the
               call, and decrementing it if the function returned NULL.  Effectively a successful
               hv_store_ent takes ownership of one reference to "val".  This is usually what you want; a
               newly created SV has a reference count of one, so if all your code does is create SVs then
               store them in a hash, hv_store will own the only reference to the new SV, and your code
               doesn't need to do anything further to tidy up.  Note that hv_store_ent only reads the "key";
               unlike "val" it does not take ownership of it, so maintaining the correct reference count on
               "key" is entirely the caller's responsibility.  hv_store is not implemented as a call to
               hv_store_ent, and does not create a temporary SV for the key, so if your key data is not
               already in SV form then use hv_store in preference to hv_store_ent.

               how to use this function on tied hashes.

               should be NULL or a pointer to an NV.  The scan stops at the end of the string, or the first
               invalid character.  Unless "PERL_SCAN_SILENT_ILLDIGIT" is set in <u>*flags</u>, encountering an
               invalid character will also trigger a warning.  On return <u>*len</u> is set to the length of the
               scanned string, and <u>*flags</u> gives output flags.

               If the value is &lt;= UV_MAX it is returned as a UV, the output flags are clear, and nothing is
               written to <u>*result</u>. If the value is &gt; UV_MAX "grok_oct" returns UV_MAX, sets
               "PERL_SCAN_GREATER_THAN_UV_MAX" in the output flags, and writes the value to <u>*result</u> (or the
               value is discarded if <u>result</u> is NULL).

               If "PERL_SCAN_ALLOW_UNDERSCORES" is set in <u>*flags</u> then the octal number may use '_' charac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ters&nbsp;characters</font>
               ters to separate digits.

       looks_like_number
               Test if the content of an SV looks like a number (or is a number).  "Inf" and "Infinity" are
               treated as numbers (so will not issue a non-numeric warning), even if your <u>atof()</u> doesn't

               Creates a new SV and initializes it with the string formatted like "sprintf".

                       SV*     newSVpvf(const char* pat, ...)

       newSVpvn
               Creates a new SV and copies a string into it.  The reference count for the SV is set to 1.
               Note that if "len" is zero, Perl will create a zero length string.  You are responsible for
               ensuring that the source string is at least "len" bytes long.  If the "s" argument is NULL
               the new SV will be undefined.

                       SV*     newSVpvn(const char* s, STRLEN len)

       newSVpvn_share
               Creates a new SV with its SvPVX_const pointing to a shared string in the string table. If the
               string does not already exist in the table, it is created first.  Turns on READONLY and FAKE.
               The string's hash is stored in the UV slot of the SV; if the "hash" parameter is non-zero,
               that value is used; otherwise the hash is computed.  The idea here is that as the string ta-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ble&nbsp;table</font>
               ble is used for shared hash keys these strings will have SvPVX_const == HeKEY and hash lookup
               will avoid string compare.

       newSVrv Creates a new SV for the RV, "rv", to point to.  If "rv" is not an RV then it will be
               upgraded to one.  If "classname" is non-null then the new SV will be blessed in the specified
               package.  The new SV is returned and its reference count is 1.

                       SV*     newSVrv(SV* rv, const char* classname)

       newSVsv Creates a new SV which is an exact duplicate of the original SV.  (Uses "sv_setsv").

       SvGROW  Expands the character buffer in the SV so that it has room for the indicated number of bytes
               (remember to reserve space for an extra trailing NUL character).  Calls "sv_grow" to perform
               the expansion if necessary.  Returns a pointer to the character buffer.

               Turn on the UTF-8 status of an SV (the data is not changed, just the flag).  Do not use
               frivolously.

                       void    SvUTF8_on(SV *sv)

       SvUV    Coerces the given SV to an unsigned integer and returns it.  See "SvUVx" for a version which
               guarantees to evaluate sv only once.

                       UV      SvUV(SV* sv)

       SvUVX   Returns the raw value in the SV's UV slot, without checks or conversions.  Only use when you
               are sure SvIOK is true. See also "SvUV()".

                       UV      SvUVX(SV* sv)

       SvUVx   Coerces the given SV to an unsigned integer and returns it. Guarantees to evaluate sv only
               once. Use the more efficient "SvUV" otherwise.

                       UV      SvUVx(SV* sv)

       SvUV_set
               Set the value of the UV pointer in sv to val.  See "SvIV_set".

                       void    SvUV_set(SV* sv, UV val)

       sv_2bool
               This function is only called on magical items, and is only used by <u>sv</u><b>_</b><u>true()</u> or its macro
               equivalent.

                       bool    sv_2bool(SV* sv)

       sv_2cv  Using various gambits, try to get a CV from an SV; in addition, try if possible to set *st
               and *gvp to the stash and GV associated with it.

                       CV*     sv_2cv(SV* sv, HV** st, GV** gvp, I32 lref)

       sv_2io  Using various gambits, try to get an IO from an SV: the IO slot if its a GV; or the recursive
               result if we're an RV; or the IO slot of the symbol named after the PV if we're a string.

                       IO*     sv_2io(SV* sv)

       sv_2iv  Return the integer value of an SV, doing any necessary string conversion, magic etc. Normally
               used via the "SvIV(sv)" and "SvIVx(sv)" macros.

                       IV      sv_2iv(SV* sv)

       sv_2mortal
               Marks an existing SV as mortal.  The SV will be destroyed "soon", either by an explicit call
               to FREETMPS, or by an implicit call at places such as statement boundaries.  <u>SvTEMP()</u> is
               turned on which means that the SV's string buffer can be "stolen" if this SV is copied. See
               also "sv_newmortal" and "sv_mortalcopy".

                       SV*     sv_2mortal(SV* sv)

       sv_2nv  Return the num value of an SV, doing any necessary string or integer conversion, magic etc.
               Normally used via the "SvNV(sv)" and "SvNVx(sv)" macros.

                       NV      sv_2nv(SV* sv)

       sv_2pvbyte
               Return a pointer to the byte-encoded representation of the SV, and set *lp to its length.
               May cause the SV to be downgraded from UTF-8 as a side-effect.

               Usually accessed via the "SvPVbyte" macro.

                       char*   sv_2pvbyte(SV* sv, STRLEN* lp)

       sv_2pvbyte_nolen
               Return a pointer to the byte-encoded representation of the SV.  May cause the SV to be down-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">graded&nbsp;downgraded</font>
               graded from UTF-8 as a side-effect.

               Usually accessed via the "SvPVbyte_nolen" macro.

                       char*   sv_2pvbyte_nolen(SV* sv)

       sv_2pvutf8
               Return a pointer to the UTF-8-encoded representation of the SV, and set *lp to its length.
               May cause the SV to be upgraded to UTF-8 as a side-effect.

               Usually accessed via the "SvPVutf8" macro.

                       char*   sv_2pvutf8(SV* sv, STRLEN* lp)

       sv_2pvutf8_nolen
               Return a pointer to the UTF-8-encoded representation of the SV.  May cause the SV to be
               upgraded to UTF-8 as a side-effect.

               Usually accessed via the "SvPVutf8_nolen" macro.

                       char*   sv_2pvutf8_nolen(SV* sv)

       sv_2pv_flags
               Returns a pointer to the string value of an SV, and sets *lp to its length.  If flags
               includes SV_GMAGIC, does an <u>mg</u><b>_</b><u>get()</u> first. Coerces sv to a string if necessary.  Normally
               invoked via the "SvPV_flags" macro. "sv_2pv()" and "sv_2pv_nomg" usually end up here too.

                       char*   sv_2pv_flags(SV* sv, STRLEN* lp, I32 flags)

       sv_2pv_nolen
               Like "sv_2pv()", but doesn't return the length too. You should usually use the macro wrapper
               "SvPV_nolen(sv)" instead.       char*     sv_2pv_nolen(SV* sv)

       sv_2uv  Return the unsigned integer value of an SV, doing any necessary string conversion, magic etc.
               Normally used via the "SvUV(sv)" and "SvUVx(sv)" macros.

                       UV      sv_2uv(SV* sv)

       sv_backoff
               Remove any string offset. You should normally use the "SvOOK_off" macro wrapper instead.

                       int     sv_backoff(SV* sv)

       sv_bless
               Blesses an SV into a specified package.  The SV must be an RV.  The package must be desig-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nated&nbsp;designated</font>
               nated by its stash (see "gv_stashpv()").  The reference count of the SV is unaffected.

                       SV*     sv_bless(SV* sv, HV* stash)

       sv_catpv
               Concatenates the string onto the end of the string which is in the SV.  If the SV has the
               UTF-8 status set, then the bytes appended should be valid UTF-8.  Handles 'get' magic, but
               not 'set' magic.  See "sv_catpv_mg".

                       void    sv_catpv(SV* sv, const char* ptr)

       sv_catpvf
               Processes its arguments like "sprintf" and appends the formatted output to an SV.  If the
               appended data contains "wide" characters (including, but not limited to, SVs with a UTF-8 PV
               formatted with %s, and characters &gt;255 formatted with %c), the original SV might get upgraded
               to UTF-8.  Handles 'get' magic, but not 'set' magic.  See "sv_catpvf_mg". If the original SV
               was UTF-8, the pattern should be valid UTF-8; if the original SV was bytes, the pattern
               should be too.

                       void    sv_catpvf(SV* sv, const char* pat, ...)

       sv_catpvf_mg
               Like "sv_catpvf", but also handles 'set' magic.

                       void    sv_catpvf_mg(SV *sv, const char* pat, ...)

       sv_catpvn
               Concatenates the string onto the end of the string which is in the SV.  The "len" indicates
               number of bytes to copy.  If the SV has the UTF-8 status set, then the bytes appended should
               be valid UTF-8.  Handles 'get' magic, but not 'set' magic.  See "sv_catpvn_mg".

                       void    sv_catpvn(SV* sv, const char* ptr, STRLEN len)

       sv_catpvn_flags
               Concatenates the string onto the end of the string which is in the SV.  The "len" indicates
               number of bytes to copy.  If the SV has the UTF-8 status set, then the bytes appended should
               be valid UTF-8.  If "flags" has "SV_GMAGIC" bit set, will "mg_get" on "dsv" if appropriate,
               else not. "sv_catpvn" and "sv_catpvn_nomg" are implemented in terms of this function.

                       void    sv_catpvn_flags(SV* sv, const char* ptr, STRLEN len, I32 flags)

       sv_catpvn_mg
               Like "sv_catpvn", but also handles 'set' magic.

                       void    sv_catpvn_mg(SV *sv, const char *ptr, STRLEN len)

       sv_catpvn_nomg
               Like "sv_catpvn" but doesn't process magic.

                       void    sv_catpvn_nomg(SV* sv, const char* ptr, STRLEN len)

       sv_catpv_mg
               Like "sv_catpv", but also handles 'set' magic.

                       void    sv_catpv_mg(SV *sv, const char *ptr)

       sv_catsv
               Concatenates the string from SV "ssv" onto the end of the string in SV "dsv".  Modifies "dsv"
               but not "ssv".  Handles 'get' magic, but not 'set' magic.  See "sv_catsv_mg".

                       void    sv_catsv(SV* dsv, SV* ssv)

       sv_catsv_flags
               Concatenates the string from SV "ssv" onto the end of the string in SV "dsv".  Modifies "dsv"
               but not "ssv".  If "flags" has "SV_GMAGIC" bit set, will "mg_get" on the SVs if appropriate,
               else not. "sv_catsv" and "sv_catsv_nomg" are implemented in terms of this function.

                       void    sv_catsv_flags(SV* dsv, SV* ssv, I32 flags)

       sv_catsv_mg
               Like "sv_catsv", but also handles 'set' magic.

                       void    sv_catsv_mg(SV *dstr, SV *sstr)

       sv_catsv_nomg
               Like "sv_catsv" but doesn't process magic.

                       void    sv_catsv_nomg(SV* dsv, SV* ssv)

       sv_chop Efficient removal of characters from the beginning of the string buffer.  SvPOK(sv) must be
               true and the "ptr" must be a pointer to somewhere inside the string buffer.  The "ptr"
               becomes the first character of the adjusted string. Uses the "OOK hack".  Beware: after this
               function returns, "ptr" and SvPVX_const(sv) may no longer refer to the same chunk of data.

                       void    sv_chop(SV* sv, char* ptr)

       sv_clear
               Clear an SV: call any destructors, free up any memory used by the body, and free the body
               itself. The SV's head is <u>not</u> freed, although its type is set to all 1's so that it won't
               inadvertently be assumed to be live during global destruction etc.  This function should only
               be called when REFCNT is zero. Most of the time you'll want to call "sv_free()" (or its macro
               wrapper "SvREFCNT_dec") instead.

                       void    sv_clear(SV* sv)

       sv_cmp  Compares the strings in two SVs.  Returns -1, 0, or 1 indicating whether the string in "sv1"
               is less than, equal to, or greater than the string in "sv2". Is UTF-8 and 'use bytes' aware,
               handles get magic, and will coerce its args to strings if necessary.  See also
               "sv_cmp_locale".

                       I32     sv_cmp(SV* sv1, SV* sv2)

       sv_cmp_locale
               Compares the strings in two SVs in a locale-aware manner. Is UTF-8 and 'use bytes' aware,
               handles get magic, and will coerce its args to strings if necessary.  See also
               "sv_cmp_locale".  See also "sv_cmp".

                       I32     sv_cmp_locale(SV* sv1, SV* sv2)

       sv_collxfrm
               Add Collate Transform magic to an SV if it doesn't already have it.

               Any scalar variable may carry PERL_MAGIC_collxfrm magic that contains the scalar data of the
               variable, but transformed to such a format that a normal memory comparison can be used to
               compare the data according to the locale settings.

                       char*   sv_collxfrm(SV* sv, STRLEN* nxp)

       sv_copypv
               Copies a stringified representation of the source SV into the destination SV.  Automatically
               performs any necessary mg_get and coercion of numeric values into strings.  Guaranteed to
               preserve UTF-8 flag even from overloaded objects.  Similar in nature to sv_2pv[_flags] but
               operates directly on an SV instead of just the string.  Mostly uses sv_2pv_flags to do its
               work, except when that would lose the UTF-8'ness of the PV.

                       void    sv_copypv(SV* dsv, SV* ssv)

       sv_dec  Auto-decrement of the value in the SV, doing string to numeric conversion if necessary. Han-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dles&nbsp;Handles</font>
               dles 'get' magic.

                       void    sv_dec(SV* sv)

       sv_derived_from
               Returns a boolean indicating whether the SV is derived from the specified class.  This is the
               function that implements "UNIVERSAL::isa".  It works for class names as well as for objects.

                       bool    sv_derived_from(SV* sv, const char* name)

       sv_eq   Returns a boolean indicating whether the strings in the two SVs are identical. Is UTF-8 and
               'use bytes' aware, handles get magic, and will coerce its args to strings if necessary.

                       I32     sv_eq(SV* sv1, SV* sv2)

       sv_force_normal
               Undo various types of fakery on an SV: if the PV is a shared string, make a private copy; if
               we're a ref, stop refing; if we're a glob, downgrade to an xpvmg. See also "sv_force_nor-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mal_flags".&nbsp;"sv_force_normal_flags".</font>
               mal_flags".

                       void    sv_force_normal(SV *sv)

       sv_force_normal_flags
               Undo various types of fakery on an SV: if the PV is a shared string, make a private copy; if
               we're a ref, stop refing; if we're a glob, downgrade to an xpvmg. The "flags" parameter gets
               passed to  "sv_unref_flags()" when unrefing. "sv_force_normal" calls this function with flags
               set to 0.

                       void    sv_force_normal_flags(SV *sv, U32 flags)

       sv_free Decrement an SV's reference count, and if it drops to zero, call "sv_clear" to invoke
               destructors and free up any memory used by the body; finally, deallocate the SV's head
               itself.  Normally called via a wrapper macro "SvREFCNT_dec".

                       void    sv_free(SV* sv)

       sv_gets Get a line from the filehandle and store it into the SV, optionally appending to the cur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rently-stored&nbsp;currently-stored</font>
               rently-stored string.

                       char*   sv_gets(SV* sv, PerlIO* fp, I32 append)

       sv_grow Expands the character buffer in the SV.  If necessary, uses "sv_unref" and upgrades the SV to
               "SVt_PV".  Returns a pointer to the character buffer.  Use the "SvGROW" wrapper instead.

                       char*   sv_grow(SV* sv, STRLEN newlen)

       sv_inc  Auto-increment of the value in the SV, doing string to numeric conversion if necessary. Han-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dles&nbsp;Handles</font>
               dles 'get' magic.

                       void    sv_inc(SV* sv)

       sv_insert
               Inserts a string at the specified offset/length within the SV. Similar to the Perl <u>substr()</u>
               function.

                       void    sv_insert(SV* bigsv, STRLEN offset, STRLEN len, char* little, STRLEN littlelen)

       sv_isa  Returns a boolean indicating whether the SV is blessed into the specified class.  This does
               not check for subtypes; use "sv_derived_from" to verify an inheritance relationship.

                       int     sv_isa(SV* sv, const char* name)

       sv_isobject
               Returns a boolean indicating whether the SV is an RV pointing to a blessed object.  If the SV
               is not an RV, or if the object is not blessed, then this will return false.

                       int     sv_isobject(SV* sv)

       sv_iv   A private implementation of the "SvIVx" macro for compilers which can't cope with complex
               macro expressions. Always use the macro instead.

                       IV      sv_iv(SV* sv)

       sv_len  Returns the length of the string in the SV. Handles magic and type coercion.  See also
               "SvCUR", which gives raw access to the xpv_cur slot.

                       STRLEN  sv_len(SV* sv)

       sv_len_utf8
               Returns the number of characters in the string in an SV, counting wide UTF-8 bytes as a sin-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">gle&nbsp;single</font>
               gle character. Handles magic and type coercion.

                       STRLEN  sv_len_utf8(SV* sv)

       sv_magic
               Adds magic to an SV. First upgrades "sv" to type "SVt_PVMG" if necessary, then adds a new
               magic item of type "how" to the head of the magic list.

               See "sv_magicext" (which "sv_magic" now calls) for a description of the handling of the
               "name" and "namlen" arguments.

               You need to use "sv_magicext" to add magic to SvREADONLY SVs and also to add more than one
               instance of the same 'how'.

                       void    sv_magic(SV* sv, SV* obj, int how, const char* name, I32 namlen)

       sv_magicext
               Adds magic to an SV, upgrading it if necessary. Applies the supplied vtable and returns a
               pointer to the magic added.

               Note that "sv_magicext" will allow things that "sv_magic" will not.  In particular, you can
               add magic to SvREADONLY SVs, and add more than one instance of the same 'how'.

               If "namlen" is greater than zero then a "savepvn" <u>copy</u> of "name" is stored, if "namlen" is
               zero then "name" is stored as-is and - as another special case - if "(name &amp;&amp; namlen ==
               HEf_SVKEY)" then "name" is assumed to contain an "SV*" and is stored as-is with its REFCNT
               incremented.

               (This is now used as a subroutine by "sv_magic".)

       sv_mortalcopy
               Creates a new SV which is a copy of the original SV (using "sv_setsv").  The new SV is marked
               as mortal. It will be destroyed "soon", either by an explicit call to FREETMPS, or by an
               implicit call at places such as statement boundaries.  See also "sv_newmortal" and "sv_2mor-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tal".&nbsp;"sv_2mortal".</font>
               tal".

                       SV*     sv_mortalcopy(SV* oldsv)

       sv_newmortal
               Creates a new null SV which is mortal.  The reference count of the SV is set to 1. It will be
               destroyed "soon", either by an explicit call to FREETMPS, or by an implicit call at places
               such as statement boundaries.  See also "sv_mortalcopy" and "sv_2mortal".

                       SV*     sv_newmortal()

       sv_newref
               Increment an SV's reference count. Use the "SvREFCNT_inc()" wrapper instead.

                       SV*     sv_newref(SV* sv)

       sv_nv   A private implementation of the "SvNVx" macro for compilers which can't cope with complex
               macro expressions. Always use the macro instead.

                       NV      sv_nv(SV* sv)

       sv_pos_b2u
               Converts the value pointed to by offsetp from a count of bytes from the start of the string,
               to a count of the equivalent number of UTF-8 chars.  Handles magic and type coercion.

                       void    sv_pos_b2u(SV* sv, I32* offsetp)

       sv_pos_u2b
               Converts the value pointed to by offsetp from a count of UTF-8 chars from the start of the
               string, to a count of the equivalent number of bytes; if lenp is non-zero, it does the same
               to lenp, but this time starting from the offset, rather than from the start of the string.
               Handles magic and type coercion.

                       void    sv_pos_u2b(SV* sv, I32* offsetp, I32* lenp)

       sv_pv   Use the "SvPV_nolen" macro instead

                       char*   sv_pv(SV *sv)

       sv_pvbyte
               Use "SvPVbyte_nolen" instead.

       sv_pvn_force
               Get a sensible string out of the SV somehow.  A private implementation of the "SvPV_force"
               macro for compilers which can't cope with complex macro expressions. Always use the macro
               instead.

                       char*   sv_pvn_force(SV* sv, STRLEN* lp)

       sv_pvn_force_flags
               Get a sensible string out of the SV somehow.  If "flags" has "SV_GMAGIC" bit set, will
               "mg_get" on "sv" if appropriate, else not. "sv_pvn_force" and "sv_pvn_force_nomg" are imple-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mented&nbsp;implemented</font>
               mented in terms of this function.  You normally want to use the various wrapper macros
               instead: see "SvPV_force" and "SvPV_force_nomg"

                       char*   sv_pvn_force_flags(SV* sv, STRLEN* lp, I32 flags)

       sv_pvutf8
               Use the "SvPVutf8_nolen" macro instead

                       char*   sv_pvutf8(SV *sv)

       sv_pvutf8n
               A private implementation of the "SvPVutf8" macro for compilers which can't cope with complex

               Returns a string describing what the SV is a reference to.

                       char*   sv_reftype(SV* sv, int ob)

       sv_replace
               Make the first argument a copy of the second, then delete the original.  The target SV physi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cally&nbsp;physically</font>
               cally takes over ownership of the body of the source SV and inherits its flags; however, the
               target keeps any magic it owns, and any magic in the source is discarded.  Note that this is
               a rather specialist SV copying operation; most of the time you'll want to use "sv_setsv" or
               one of its many macro front-ends.

                       void    sv_replace(SV* sv, SV* nsv)

       sv_report_used
               Dump the contents of all SVs not yet freed. (Debugging aid).

                       void    sv_report_used()

       sv_reset
               Underlying implementation for the "reset" Perl function.  Note that the perl-level function
               is vaguely deprecated.

                       void    sv_reset(char* s, HV* stash)

       sv_rvweaken
               Weaken a reference: set the "SvWEAKREF" flag on this RV; give the referred-to SV
               "PERL_MAGIC_backref" magic if it hasn't already; and push a back-reference to this RV onto
               the array of backreferences associated with that magic.

                       SV*     sv_rvweaken(SV *sv)

       sv_setiv
               Copies an integer into the given SV, upgrading first if necessary.  Does not handle 'set'
               magic.  See also "sv_setiv_mg".

                       void    sv_setiv(SV* sv, IV num)

       sv_setiv_mg
               Like "sv_setiv", but also handles 'set' magic.

       sv_setnv
               Copies a double into the given SV, upgrading first if necessary.  Does not handle 'set'

       sv_setnv_mg
               Like "sv_setnv", but also handles 'set' magic.

       sv_setpv
               Copies a string into an SV.  The string must be null-terminated.  Does not handle 'set'
               magic.  See "sv_setpv_mg".

                       void    sv_setpv(SV* sv, const char* ptr)

       sv_setpvf
               Works like "sv_catpvf" but copies the text into the SV instead of appending it.  Does not
               handle 'set' magic.  See "sv_setpvf_mg".

                       void    sv_setpvf(SV* sv, const char* pat, ...)

       sv_setpvf_mg
               Like "sv_setpvf", but also handles 'set' magic.

                       void    sv_setpvf_mg(SV *sv, const char* pat, ...)

       sv_setpviv
               Copies an integer into the given SV, also updating its string value.  Does not handle 'set'
               magic.  See "sv_setpviv_mg".

                       void    sv_setpviv(SV* sv, IV num)

       sv_setpviv_mg
               Like "sv_setpviv", but also handles 'set' magic.

                       void    sv_setpviv_mg(SV *sv, IV iv)

       sv_setpvn
               Copies a string into an SV.  The "len" parameter indicates the number of bytes to be copied.
               If the "ptr" argument is NULL the SV will become undefined.  Does not handle 'set' magic.
               See "sv_setpvn_mg".

                       void    sv_setpvn(SV* sv, const char* ptr, STRLEN len)

       sv_setpvn_mg
               Like "sv_setpvn", but also handles 'set' magic.

                       void    sv_setpvn_mg(SV *sv, const char *ptr, STRLEN len)

       sv_setpv_mg
               Like "sv_setpv", but also handles 'set' magic.

                       void    sv_setpv_mg(SV *sv, const char *ptr)

       sv_setref_iv
               Copies an integer into a new SV, optionally blessing the SV.  The "rv" argument will be
               upgraded to an RV.  That RV will be modified to point to the new SV.  The "classname" argu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment&nbsp;argument</font>
               ment indicates the package for the blessing.  Set "classname" to "Nullch" to avoid the bless-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing.&nbsp;blessing.</font>
               ing.  The new SV will have a reference count of 1, and the RV will be returned.

                       SV*     sv_setref_iv(SV* rv, const char* classname, IV iv)

       sv_setref_nv
               Copies a double into a new SV, optionally blessing the SV.  The "rv" argument will be
               upgraded to an RV.  That RV will be modified to point to the new SV.  The "classname" argu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment&nbsp;argument</font>
               ment indicates the package for the blessing.  Set "classname" to "Nullch" to avoid the bless-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing.&nbsp;blessing.</font>
               ing.  The new SV will have a reference count of 1, and the RV will be returned.

                       SV*     sv_setref_nv(SV* rv, const char* classname, NV nv)

       sv_setref_pv
               Copies a pointer into a new SV, optionally blessing the SV.  The "rv" argument will be
               upgraded to an RV.  That RV will be modified to point to the new SV.  If the "pv" argument is
               NULL then "PL_sv_undef" will be placed into the SV.  The "classname" argument indicates the
               package for the blessing.  Set "classname" to "Nullch" to avoid the blessing.  The new SV
               will have a reference count of 1, and the RV will be returned.

               Do not use with other Perl types such as HV, AV, SV, CV, because those objects will become
               corrupted by the pointer copy process.

               Note that "sv_setref_pvn" copies the string while this copies the pointer.

                       SV*     sv_setref_pv(SV* rv, const char* classname, void* pv)

       sv_setref_pvn
               Copies a string into a new SV, optionally blessing the SV.  The length of the string must be
               specified with "n".  The "rv" argument will be upgraded to an RV.  That RV will be modified
               to point to the new SV.  The "classname" argument indicates the package for the blessing.
               Set "classname" to "Nullch" to avoid the blessing.  The new SV will have a reference count of
               1, and the RV will be returned.

               Note that "sv_setref_pv" copies the pointer while this copies the string.

       sv_setref_uv
               Copies an unsigned integer into a new SV, optionally blessing the SV.  The "rv" argument will
               be upgraded to an RV.  That RV will be modified to point to the new SV.  The "classname"
               argument indicates the package for the blessing.  Set "classname" to "Nullch" to avoid the
               blessing.  The new SV will have a reference count of 1, and the RV will be returned.

                       SV*     sv_setref_uv(SV* rv, const char* classname, UV uv)

       sv_setsv
               Copies the contents of the source SV "ssv" into the destination SV "dsv".  The source SV may
               be destroyed if it is mortal, so don't use this function if the source SV needs to be reused.
               Does not handle 'set' magic.  Loosely speaking, it performs a copy-by-value, obliterating any
               previous content of the destination.

               You probably want to use one of the assortment of wrappers, such as "SvSetSV", "SvSetSV_nos-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">teal",&nbsp;"SvSetSV_nosteal",</font>
               teal", "SvSetMagicSV" and "SvSetMagicSV_nosteal".

                       void    sv_setsv(SV* dsv, SV* ssv)

       sv_setsv_flags
               Copies the contents of the source SV "ssv" into the destination SV "dsv".  The source SV may
               be destroyed if it is mortal, so don't use this function if the source SV needs to be reused.
               Does not handle 'set' magic.  Loosely speaking, it performs a copy-by-value, obliterating any
               previous content of the destination.  If the "flags" parameter has the "SV_GMAGIC" bit set,
               will "mg_get" on "ssv" if appropriate, else not. If the "flags" parameter has the "NOSTEAL"
               bit set then the buffers of temps will not be stolen. &lt;sv_setsv&gt; and "sv_setsv_nomg" are
               implemented in terms of this function.

               You probably want to use one of the assortment of wrappers, such as "SvSetSV", "SvSetSV_nos-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">teal",&nbsp;"SvSetSV_nosteal",</font>
               teal", "SvSetMagicSV" and "SvSetMagicSV_nosteal".

               This is the primary function for copying scalars, and most other copy-ish functions and
               macros use this underneath.

                       void    sv_setsv_flags(SV* dsv, SV* ssv, I32 flags)

       sv_setsv_mg
               Like "sv_setsv", but also handles 'set' magic.

                       void    sv_setsv_mg(SV *dstr, SV *sstr)

       sv_setsv_nomg
               Like "sv_setsv" but doesn't process magic.

                       void    sv_setsv_nomg(SV* dsv, SV* ssv)

       sv_setuv
               Copies an unsigned integer into the given SV, upgrading first if necessary.  Does not handle
               'set' magic.  See also "sv_setuv_mg".

                       void    sv_setuv(SV* sv, UV num)

       sv_setuv_mg
               Like "sv_setuv", but also handles 'set' magic.

                       void    sv_setuv_mg(SV *sv, UV u)

       sv_taint
               Taint an SV. Use "SvTAINTED_on" instead.       void sv_taint(SV* sv)

       sv_tainted
               Test an SV for taintedness. Use "SvTAINTED" instead.       bool sv_tainted(SV* sv)

       sv_true Returns true if the SV has a true value by Perl's rules.  Use the "SvTRUE" macro instead,
               which may call "sv_true()" or may instead use an in-line version.

                       I32     sv_true(SV *sv)

       sv_unmagic
               Removes all magic of type "type" from an SV.

                       int     sv_unmagic(SV* sv, int type)

       sv_unref
               Unsets the RV status of the SV, and decrements the reference count of whatever was being ref-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">erenced&nbsp;referenced</font>
               erenced by the RV.  This can almost be thought of as a reversal of "newSVrv".  This is
               "sv_unref_flags" with the "flag" being zero.  See "SvROK_off".

                       void    sv_unref(SV* sv)

       sv_unref_flags
               Unsets the RV status of the SV, and decrements the reference count of whatever was being ref-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">erenced&nbsp;referenced</font>
               erenced by the RV.  This can almost be thought of as a reversal of "newSVrv".  The "cflags"
               argument can contain "SV_IMMEDIATE_UNREF" to force the reference count to be decremented
               (otherwise the decrementing is conditional on the reference count being different from one or
               the reference being a readonly SV).  See "SvROK_off".

                       void    sv_unref_flags(SV* sv, U32 flags)

       sv_untaint
               Untaint an SV. Use "SvTAINTED_off" instead.       void sv_untaint(SV* sv)

       sv_upgrade
               Upgrade an SV to a more complex form.  Generally adds a new body type to the SV, then copies
               across as much information as possible from the old body.  You generally want to use the
               "SvUPGRADE" macro wrapper. See also "svtype".

                       bool    sv_upgrade(SV* sv, U32 mt)

       sv_usepvn
               Tells an SV to use "ptr" to find its string value.  Normally the string is stored inside the
               SV but sv_usepvn allows the SV to use an outside string.  The "ptr" should point to memory
               that was allocated by "malloc".  The string length, "len", must be supplied.  This function
               will realloc the memory pointed to by "ptr", so that pointer should not be freed or used by
               the programmer after giving it to sv_usepvn.  Does not handle 'set' magic.  See
               "sv_usepvn_mg".

                       void    sv_usepvn(SV* sv, char* ptr, STRLEN len)

       sv_usepvn_mg
               Like "sv_usepvn", but also handles 'set' magic.

                       void    sv_usepvn_mg(SV *sv, char *ptr, STRLEN len)

       sv_utf8_decode
               If the PV of the SV is an octet sequence in UTF-8 and contains a multiple-byte character, the

       bytes_from_utf8
               Converts a string "s" of length "len" from UTF-8 into byte encoding.  Unlike "utf8_to_bytes"
               but like "bytes_to_utf8", returns a pointer to the newly-created string, and updates "len" to
               contain the new length.  Returns the original string if no conversion occurs, "len" is
               unchanged. Do nothing if "is_utf8" points to 0. Sets "is_utf8" to 0 if "s" is converted or
               contains all 7bit characters.

               NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be removed without notice.

               Converts a string "s" of length "len" from ASCII into UTF-8 encoding.  Returns a pointer to
               the newly-created string, and sets "len" to reflect the new length.

               If you want to convert to UTF-8 from other encodings than ASCII, see <u>sv</u><b>_</b><u>recode</u><b>_</b><u>to</u><b>_</b><u>utf8()</u>.

       ibcmp_utf8
               Return true if the strings s1 and s2 differ case-insensitively, false if not (if they are
               equal case-insensitively).  If u1 is true, the string s1 is assumed to be in UTF-8-encoded
               Unicode.  If u2 is true, the string s2 is assumed to be in UTF-8-encoded Unicode.  If u1 or
               u2 are false, the respective string is assumed to be in native 8-bit encoding.

               If the pe1 and pe2 are non-NULL, the scanning pointers will be copied in there (they will
               point at the beginning of the <u>next</u> character).  If the pointers behind pe1 or pe2 are
               non-NULL, they are the end pointers beyond which scanning will not continue under any circum-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">stances.&nbsp;circumstances.</font>
               stances.  If the byte lengths l1 and l2 are non-zero, s1+l1 and s2+l2 will be used as goal
               end pointers that will also stop the scan, and which qualify towards defining a successful
               match: all the scans that define an explicit length must reach their goal pointers for a
               match to succeed).

               The "p" contains the pointer to the UTF-8 string encoding the character that is being con-
               verted.

               The "ustrp" is a pointer to the character buffer to put the conversion result to.  The "lenp"
               is a pointer to the length of the result.

               The "swashp" is a pointer to the swash to use.

               Both the special and normal mappings are stored lib/unicore/To/Foo.pl, and loaded by
               SWASHGET, using lib/utf8_heavy.pl.  The special (usually, but not always, a multicharacter
               mapping), is tried first.

               The "special" is a string like "utf8::ToSpecLower", which means the hash %utf8::ToSpecLower.
               The access to the hash is through <u>Perl</u><b>_</b><u>to</u><b>_</b><u>utf8</u><b>_</b><u>case()</u>.

               Returns the native character value of the first character in the string "s" which is assumed
               to be in UTF-8 encoding; "retlen" will be set to the length, in bytes, of that character.

               "retlen" will be set to the length, in bytes, of that character.

               If "s" does not point to a well-formed UTF-8 character, the behaviour is dependent on the
               value of "flags": if it contains UTF8_CHECK_ONLY, it is assumed that the caller will raise a
               warning, and this function will silently just set "retlen" to "-1" and return zero.  If the
               "flags" does not contain UTF8_CHECK_ONLY, warnings about malformations will be given,
               "retlen" will be set to the expected length of the UTF-8 character in bytes, and zero will be
               returned.

               The "flags" can also contain various flags to allow deviations from the strict UTF-8 encoding
               (see <u>utf8.h</u>).

               Most code should use <u>utf8</u><b>_</b><u>to</u><b>_</b><u>uvchr()</u> rather than call this directly.

               this over-writes the original string, and updates len to contain the new length.  Returns
               zero on failure, setting "len" to -1.

               NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be removed without notice.

                       U8*     utf8_to_bytes(U8 *s, STRLEN *len)

       utf8_to_uvchr
               Returns the native character value of the first character in the string "s" which is assumed
               to be in UTF-8 encoding; "retlen" will be set to the length, in bytes, of that character.

               If "s" does not point to a well-formed UTF-8 character, zero is returned and retlen is set,
               if possible, to -1.

                       UV      utf8_to_uvchr(U8 *s, STRLEN *retlen)

       utf8_to_uvuni
               Returns the Unicode code point of the first character in the string "s" which is assumed to
               be in UTF-8 encoding; "retlen" will be set to the length, in bytes, of that character.

               This function should only be used when returned UV is considered an index into the Unicode
               semantic tables (e.g. swashes).

               If "s" does not point to a well-formed UTF-8 character, zero is returned and retlen is set,
               if possible, to -1.

                       UV      utf8_to_uvuni(U8 *s, STRLEN *retlen)

       uvchr_to_utf8
               Adds the UTF-8 representation of the Native codepoint "uv" to the end of the string "d"; "d"
               should be have at least "UTF8_MAXBYTES+1" free bytes available. The return value is the
               pointer to the byte after the end of the new character. In other words,

                   d = uvchr_to_utf8(d, uv);

               is the recommended wide native character-aware way of saying

                   *(d++) = uv;

                       U8*     uvchr_to_utf8(U8 *d, UV uv)

       uvuni_to_utf8_flags
               Adds the UTF-8 representation of the Unicode codepoint "uv" to the end of the string "d"; "d"
               should be have at least "UTF8_MAXBYTES+1" free bytes available. The return value is the
               pointer to the byte after the end of the new character. In other words,

                   d = uvuni_to_utf8_flags(d, uv, flags);

               or, in most cases,

                   d = uvuni_to_utf8(d, uv);

               (which is equivalent to)

                   d = uvuni_to_utf8_flags(d, uv, 0);

               is the recommended Unicode-aware way of saying

                   *(d++) = uv;

                       U8*     uvuni_to_utf8_flags(U8 *d, UV uv, UV flags)

<b>Warning</b> <b>and</b> <b>Dieing</b>
       croak   This is the XSUB-writer's interface to Perl's "die" function.  Normally call this function
               the same way you call the C "printf" function.  Calling "croak" returns control directly to
               Perl, sidestepping the normal C order of execution. See "warn".

               If you want to throw an exception object, assign the object to $@ and then pass "Nullch" to
               <u>croak()</u>:

                  errsv = get_sv("@", TRUE);
                  sv_setsv(errsv, exception_object);
                  croak(Nullch);

                       void    croak(const char* pat, ...)

       warn    This is the XSUB-writer's interface to Perl's "warn" function.  Call this function the same
               way you call the C "printf" function.  See "croak".

                       void    warn(const char* pat, ...)
