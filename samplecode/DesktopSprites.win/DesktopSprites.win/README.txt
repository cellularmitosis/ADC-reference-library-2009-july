SPECIFICSDesktop Sprites is based largely on the sample code included in the QuickTime Sprite Toolbox documentation (see http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/quicktime for the latest QuickTime documentation).The code simply displays a window with animated sprites.The code shows how to:- create and initialize a sprite world- create and initialize individual sprites- animate the sprites by modifying the sprite propertiesThe code contains rather limited error checking. It's up to you to add the appropriate error-handling routines.3. BUILDING DESKTOP SPRITESMacintosh  - Included is a Metrowerks project file. The application will run on any system with QuickTime 3.0 or better installed. CarbonLib is required as this code has been Carbonized from the original sources in the documentation.Windows 95/98/NT/2000 - Included is a Microsoft Visual C++ 5 project file. The application will run on any system with QuickTime 3.0 or better installed.Note - when the program is built using the Microsoft Visual C++ 5 build environment, we execute a custom script which uses the QuickTime Rez tool to create a file (.qtr) which contains the necessary macintosh resources for the application. This file has the same name as the application but with a .qtr extension. If you move the application (.exe file) to a new location, you must also move the (.qtr) resource file as well, otherwise the application will not be able to load the necessary macintosh resources.Alternately, you can use the QuickTime RezWack tool to actually embed the macintosh resources into the application executable file (xxx.exe). That way, when the file is moved to another location you need not worry about the application not being able to locate its resources.4. USING CREATEMOVIESimply launch the application and a window is created with the animated sprites. Click the close box to exit the program.Enjoy,QuickTime Team
