/*	File:		AppConditionals.h	Contains:	There are a number of conditionals used to control exactly how the game will	 			actually run, along with debugging constraints.					qDebugging  -- Whether or not additional debugging code should be inserted.				With this turned on, most errors will DebugStr almost immediately and return				errors as the error propagates up the calling chain.  This is slower, but if				you've found a weird bug, this is the fastest way to replicate it.					qSyncTiming -- When this is on, we always try to sync the frame rate to 30				frames per second, skipping frames if necessary to try to keep this appearance				on the screen. If this is turned off, we'll process frames as fast as we can,				without attempting to sync to a specific timing value.					qUsePageFlip -- If this is turned on, we'll attempt to set up a draw context				that allows page flipping.  If this is off, we'll always use double buffering.					qSyncToDrawVBL -- if this is turned on, we'll attempt to sync to draw 				sprocket's VBL. If this is off, we'll get some tearing, but we don't wait				for draw sprocket.					qShotsHaveRange -- if this is on, shows will eventually fade and disappear.				If this is off, shots last forever.							qShowTiming -- if this is on, we'll display our frame rate estimate and the				number of shots on the board in the lower left corner.					qUsingSound -- If this is off, all of the sound code is dead stripped.	Written by: 		Copyright:	Copyright © 1999 by Apple Computer, Inc., All Rights Reserved.				You may incorporate this Apple sample source code into your program(s) without				restriction.
