exec(n)                                     Tcl Built-In Commands                                    exec(n)



____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

<b>NAME</b>
       exec - Invoke subprocess(es)

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>exec</b> ?<u>switches</u>? <u>arg</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________


<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       This  command  treats its arguments as the specification of one or more subprocesses to execute.  The
       arguments take the form of a standard shell pipeline where each <u>arg</u> becomes one word  of  a  command,
       and each distinct command becomes a subprocess.

       If  the initial arguments to <b>exec</b> start with <b>-</b> then they are treated as command-line switches and are
       not part of the pipeline specification.  The following switches are currently supported:

       <b>-keepnewline</b> Retains a trailing newline in the pipeline's output.  Normally a trailing  newline  will
                    be deleted.

       <b>--</b>           Marks the end of switches.  The argument following this one will be treated as the first
                    <u>arg</u> even if it starts with a <b>-</b>.

       If an <u>arg</u> (or pair of <u>arg</u>'s) has one of the forms described below then it is used by <b>exec</b> to  control
       the flow of input and output among the subprocess(es).  Such arguments will not be passed to the sub-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">process(es).&nbsp;subprocess(es).</font>
       process(es).  In forms such as ``&lt; <u>fileName</u>'' <u>fileName</u> may either be  in  a  separate  argument  from
       ``&lt;'' or in the same argument with no intervening space (i.e. ``&lt;<u>fileName</u>'').

       |              Separates  distinct  commands  in  the pipeline.  The standard output of the preceding
                      command will be piped into the standard input of the next command.

       |&amp;             Separates distinct commands in the pipeline.  Both standard output and standard  error
                      of  the  preceding  command will be piped into the standard input of the next command.
                      This form of redirection overrides forms such as 2&gt; and &gt;&amp;.

       &lt; <u>fileName</u>     The file named by <u>fileName</u> is opened and used as the standard input for the first com-
                      mand in the pipeline.

       &lt;@ <u>fileId</u>      <u>FileId</u> must be the identifier for an open file, such as the return value from a previ-
                      ous call to <b>open</b>.  It is used as the standard input for the first command in the pipe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">line.&nbsp;pipeline.</font>
                      line.  <u>FileId</u> must have been opened for reading.

       &lt;&lt; <u>value</u>       <u>Value</u> is passed to the first command as its standard input.

       &gt; <u>fileName</u>     Standard  output from the last command is redirected to the file named <u>fileName</u>, over-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">writing&nbsp;overwriting</font>
                      writing its previous contents.

       2&gt; <u>fileName</u>    Standard error from all commands in the pipeline is redirected to the file named <u>file</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">Name,&nbsp;fileName,</font>
                      <u>Name</u>, overwriting its previous contents.

       &gt;&amp; <u>fileName</u>    Both  standard  output  from the last command and standard error from all commands are
                      redirected to the file named <u>fileName</u>, overwriting its previous contents.

       &gt;&gt; <u>fileName</u>    Standard output from the last command  is  redirected  to  the  file  named  <u>fileName</u>,
                      appending to it rather than overwriting it.

       2&gt;&gt; <u>fileName</u>   Standard error from all commands in the pipeline is redirected to the file named <u>file</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">Name,&nbsp;fileName,</font>
                      <u>Name</u>, appending to it rather than overwriting it.

       &gt;&gt;&amp; <u>fileName</u>   Both standard output from the last command and standard error from  all  commands  are
                      redirected to the file named <u>fileName</u>, appending to it rather than overwriting it.

       &gt;@ <u>fileId</u>      <u>FileId</u> must be the identifier for an open file, such as the return value from a previ-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ous&nbsp;previous</font>
                      ous call to <b>open</b>.  Standard output from the last command  is  redirected  to  <u>fileId</u>'s
                      file, which must have been opened for writing.

       2&gt;@ <u>fileId</u>     <u>FileId</u> must be the identifier for an open file, such as the return value from a previ-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ous&nbsp;previous</font>
                      ous call to <b>open</b>.  Standard error from all commands in the pipeline is  redirected  to
                      <u>fileId</u>'s file.  The file must have been opened for writing.

       &gt;&amp;@ <u>fileId</u>     <u>FileId</u> must be the identifier for an open file, such as the return value from a previ-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ous&nbsp;previous</font>
                      ous call to <b>open</b>.  Both standard output from the last command and standard error  from
                      all  commands  are  redirected  to  <u>fileId</u>'s file.  The file must have been opened for
                      writing.

       If standard output has not been redirected then the <b>exec</b> command returns the standard output from the
       last  command  in the pipeline.  If any of the commands in the pipeline exit abnormally or are killed
       or suspended, then <b>exec</b> will return an error and the error message will include the pipeline's output
       followed  by error messages describing the abnormal terminations; the <b>errorCode</b> variable will contain
       additional information about the last abnormal termination  encountered.   If  any  of  the  commands
       writes  to its standard error file and that standard error isn't redirected, then <b>exec</b> will return an
       error;  the error message will include the pipeline's standard output,  followed  by  messages  about
       abnormal terminations (if any), followed by the standard error output.

       If  the  last  character  of the result or error message is a newline then that character is normally
       deleted from the result or error message.  This is consistent with other  Tcl  return  values,  which
       don't normally end with newlines.  However, if <b>-keepnewline</b> is specified then the trailing newline is
       retained.

       If standard input isn't redirected with ``&lt;'' or ``&lt;&lt;'' or ``&lt;@'' then the  standard  input  for  the
       first command in the pipeline is taken from the application's current standard input.

       If  the  last  <u>arg</u>  is ``&amp;'' then the pipeline will be executed in background.  In this case the <b>exec</b>
       command will return a list whose elements are the process identifiers for all of the subprocesses  in
       the pipeline.  The standard output from the last command in the pipeline will go to the application's
       standard output if it hasn't been redirected, and error output from all of the commands in the  pipe-
       line will go to the application's standard error file unless redirected.

       The  first  word in each command is taken as the command name; tilde-substitution is performed on it,
       and if the result contains no slashes then the directories  in  the  PATH  environment  variable  are
       searched  for an executable by the given name.  If the name contains a slash then it must refer to an
       executable reachable from the current directory.  No ``glob'' expansion or other shell-like substitu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tions&nbsp;substitutions</font>
       tions are performed on the arguments to commands.


<b>PORTABILITY</b> <b>ISSUES</b>                                                                                           |
       <b>Windows</b> (all ver-                                                                                     |
       sions)                                                                                |               |
              Reading from or writing to a socket, using the ``<b>@</b> <u>fileId</u>'' notation,  does  not  work.   When |
              reading from a socket, a 16-bit DOS application will hang and a 32-bit application will return |
              immediately with end-of-file.  When either type of application writes to a socket, the  infor- |
              mation is instead sent to the console, if one is present, or is discarded.                     |

              The  Tk  console  text  widget does not provide real standard IO capabilities.  Under Tk, when |
              redirecting from standard input, all applications will see an immediate end-of-file;  informa- |
              tion redirected to standard output or standard error will be discarded.                        |

              Either  forward  or backward slashes are accepted as path separators for arguments to Tcl com- |
              mands.  When executing an application, the path name specified for the  application  may  also |
              contain forward or backward slashes as path separators.  Bear in mind, however, that most Win- |
              dows applications accept arguments with forward slashes only as option  delimiters  and  back- |
              slashes  only in paths.  Any arguments to an application that specify a path name with forward |
              slashes will not automatically be converted to use the backslash character.   If  an  argument |
              contains  forward  slashes  as  the  path separator, it may or may not be recognized as a path |
              name, depending on the program.                                                                |

              Additionally, when calling a 16-bit DOS or Windows 3.X application, all path  names  must  use |
              the   short,  cryptic,  path  format  (e.g.,  using  ``applba~1.def''  instead  of  ``applbak- |
              ery.default''), which can be obtained with the <b>file</b> <b>attributes</b> <b>$fileName</b> <b>-shortname</b> command.   |

              Two or more forward or backward slashes in a row in a path refer to a network path.  For exam- |
              ple, a simple concatenation of the root directory <b>c:/</b> with a subdirectory <b>/windows/system</b> will |
              yield <b>c://windows/system</b> (two slashes together), which refers to the mount point called <b>system</b> |
              on  the  machine  called  <b>windows</b>  (and  the <b>c:/</b> is ignored), and is not equivalent to <b>c:/win-</b> |
              <b>dows/system</b>, which describes a directory on the  current  computer.   The  <b>file</b>  <b>join</b>  command |
              should be used to concatenate path components.                                                 |

              Note that there are two general types of Win32 console applications:                           |
                     1) CLI -- CommandLine Interface, simple stdio exchange. <b>netstat.exe</b> for example.        |
                     2)  TUI  --  Textmode User Interface, any application that accesses the console API for |
                     doing such things as cursor movement, setting text color,  detecting  key  presses  and |
                     mouse  movement, etc...  An example would be <b>telnet.exe</b> from Windows 2000.  These types |
                     of applications are not common in a windows environment, but do exist.                  |
              <b>exec</b> will not work well with TUI applications when a console is not present, as is  done  when |
              launching  applications  under  wish.  It is desirable to have console applications hidden and |
              detached.  This is a designed-in limitation as <b>exec</b> wants  to  communicate  over  pipes.   The |
              Expect extension addresses this issue when communication between a TUI application is desired. |


       <b>Windows</b>                                                                                               |
       <b>NT</b>                                                                                            |       |
              When  attempting  to execute an application, <b>exec</b> first searches for the name as it was speci- |
              fied.  Then, in order, <b>.com</b>, <b>.exe</b>, and <b>.bat</b> are appended to the end of the specified name  and |
              it  searches for the longer name.  If a directory name was not specified as part of the appli- |
              cation name, the following directories are automatically searched in order when attempting  to |
              locate the application:                                                                        |

                     The directory from which the Tcl executable was loaded.                                 |
                     The current directory.                                                                  |
                     The Windows NT 32-bit system directory.                                                 |
                     The Windows NT 16-bit system directory.                                                 |
                     The Windows NT home directory.                                                          |
                     The directories listed in the path.                                                     |

              In  order  to  execute  the  shell builtin commands like <b>dir</b> and <b>copy</b>, the caller must prepend |
              ``<b>cmd.exe</b> <b>/c</b> '' to the desired command.                                                        |

                     The directory from which the Tcl executable was loaded.                                 |

              ``<b>command.com</b> <b>/c</b> '' to the desired command.                                                    |

              Once a 16-bit DOS application has read standard input from a console and then quit, all subse- |
              quently  run  16-bit  DOS  applications will see the standard input as already closed.  32-bit |
              applications do not have this problem and will run correctly, even after a 16-bit DOS applica- |
              tion  thinks that standard input is closed.  There is no known workaround for this bug at this |
              time.                                                                                          |

              Redirection between the <b>NUL:</b> device and a 16-bit application does not always work.  When redi- |
              recting  from <b>NUL:</b>, some applications may hang, others will get an infinite stream of ``0x01'' |
              bytes, and some will actually correctly get an immediate end-of-file; the  behavior  seems  to |
              depend  upon something compiled into the application itself.  When redirecting greater than 4K |
              or so to <b>NUL:</b>, some applications will hang.  The above problems  do  not  happen  with  32-bit |
              applications.                                                                                  |

              All DOS 16-bit applications are run synchronously.  All standard input from a pipe to a 16-bit |
              DOS application is collected into a temporary file; the other end of the pipe must  be  closed |
              before  the  16-bit  DOS  application  begins  executing.  All standard output or error from a |
              16-bit DOS application to a pipe is collected into temporary files; the application must  ter- |
              minate  before  the temporary files are redirected to the next stage of the pipeline.  This is |
              due to a workaround for a Windows 95 bug in the implementation of pipes, and is how the  stan- |
              dard Windows 95 DOS shell handles pipes itself.                                                |

              Certain applications, such as <b>command.com</b>, should not be executed interactively.  Applications |
              which directly access the console window, rather than reading from their  standard  input  and |
              writing to their standard output may fail, hang Tcl, or even hang the system if their own pri- |
              vate console window is not available to them.                                                  |

              The <b>exec</b> command is not implemented and does not exist under Macintosh.                        |

              The <b>exec</b> command is fully functional and works as described.                                   |
