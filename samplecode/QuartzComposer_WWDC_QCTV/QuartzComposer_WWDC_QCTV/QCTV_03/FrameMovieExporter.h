File: FrameMovieExporter.h

Abstract: Declares the interface for the FrameMovieExporter class (a subclass
of FrameCompressor) which allows to save series of CVPixelBuffers as a
QuickTime movie file. The FrameMovieExporter is initialized with the path
to the destination movie file (any pre-existing file at that path will be
overwritten), the compression codec to use, the dimensions of the
CVPixelBuffers to be passed and compression session options (cannot be
nil - see FrameCompressor.h for more information about those options).
Appending frames to the movie file is performed by simply calling
-exportFrame: and passing a CVPixelBuffer along with a timestamp expressed
in seconds.

Version: 1.0
