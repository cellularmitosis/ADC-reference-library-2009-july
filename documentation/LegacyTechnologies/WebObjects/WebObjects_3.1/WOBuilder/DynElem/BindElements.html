<P>A message appears in the upper right corner of the component window's editing display. The message tells you what attribute the variable is bound to.

<P>Bindings are the key to writing dynamic HTML pages in WebObjects. A <I>binding</I> is a mapping between a variable or method declared in a component's script and a dynamic element in the component's HTML. 
<P>Each dynamic element defines one or more <I>attributes</I>. You can bind each attribute to a different variable or method in your script. Thus, there is not a one-to-one correlation between dynamic elements and variables. To bind an element, you must specify three things: the variable (or method), the element, and the attribute within the element.
<P>Many times, WebObjects Builder can determine which attribute you want to bind to without you having to explicitly specify the attribute. For example, if you select a WORepetition and double-click an array, WebObjects Builder binds the array to the <B>list</B> attribute. If you select a WORepetiton and double-click a variable that isn't an array, WebObjects Builder binds the variable to the <B>item</B> attribute (which represents a single item in the WORepetition's list).
<P>For each dynamic element, WebObjects Builder chooses the attribute that is most commonly used, given the <U><A HREF="../Script/Classes.html">class</A></U> of the double-clicked variable. Thus, double-clicking a variable should produce the binding you want most of the time. 
<P>You can override WebObjects Builder's default bindings by <U><A HREF="BindInInspector.html">binding using the inspector</A></U> instead of double-clicking. You might need to do this when:

<UL>
<P><LI>You want to bind to a constant value. 
<P>Most dynamic element attributes can be bound to constants as well as variables. If you want to bind to a constant, you must use the inspector interface.
<BR>
<P><LI>WebObjects Builder cannot determine which attribute to bind to.
<P>This happens when the dynamic element doesn't have one attribute that's more commonly used than its other attributes. If WebObjects Builder can't determine a default attribute, it displays the message "No suitable default binding" and you can complete the binding using the inspector. 
<BR>

<P><LI>You double-clicked a variable whose class doesn't match the class accepted by the dynamic element's default attributes. 
<P>For example, WOString's only default attribute is <B>value</B>, which specifies what the string should display. WebObjects Builder automatically binds to this attribute only if you double-click a simple variable (that is, an Object, Number, or String, all of which can easily translate into a string). If you double-click an array, WebObjects Builder displays the message "No suitable default binding." If you truly intend to bind the WOString to the array, you can do so using the inspector. 
<BR>
<P><LI>You want to bind to an attribute that is not the default. 
<P>For example, suppose you want to bind to the WOString's <B>escapeHTML</B> attribute (which determines if any HTML tags in the string should be interpreted by the browser or displayed as specified). If you select the WOString and double-click a variable, WebObjects Builder chooses the <B>value</B> attribute. 
<BR>
<P><LI>You cannot easily select the element you want to bind. 
<P>For example, if you have a WORepetition that surrounds a table row, the WORepetition doesn't appear in the component window. 
<BR></UL>


<P>To learn more about a dynamic element's attributes, look it up in the "<U><A HREF="../../Reference/DynamicElements/DynamicElements.book.html">Dynamic Elements</A></U>" section of the <I>WebObjects Reference</I>. Also, you can select the attribute in the bindings inspector to see a short description of the attribute.
