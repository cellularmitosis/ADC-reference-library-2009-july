Start with a display group for Employee objects. Programmaticallyqualify this display group to fetch only the top-level management(the Employees with which to fill the browser's first column). </p><p>Drag a browser into a window. Be sure to set it to "Allowbranch selection." Control-drag from the browser to your Employeedisplay group. In the Interface Builder's Connections Inspector (EORecursiveBrowserAssociation-labeledEORecBrowser-is chosen by default), bind the <b>rootChildren</b> aspectto Employee's <b>directReports</b> relationship(a recursive, to-many relationship). Making this binding has theeffect of:</p><ul><li>Creating a new display group named "LastEmployeeColumn."More generally, the new display group has a name of the form, "Last<em>NameOfFirstDisplayGroup</em>Column."</li><li>Preconnecting the new display group to a data source.</li><li>Binding the EORecursiveBrowserAssociation's <b>children</b> aspectto the <b>directReports</b> relationship-thesame relationship used for the <b>rootChildren</b> aspect.</li></ul><p>Now bind the <b>title</b> and <b>isLeaf</b> aspects.(Note that if you try to bind these aspects before you bind the <b>rootChildren</b> aspect,you'll bypass work that the association can do for you automatically.) Control-dragfrom the browser to either of the display groups, and bind the association's <b>title</b> aspect tothe <b>fullName</b> key and the <b>isLeaf</b> aspectto the <b>isIndividualContributor</b> key (a methodthat returns <code>NO</code> if theEmployee is a manager with direct reports). It doesn't matterwhat display group you make these bindings to, because the associationexpects <b>rootChildren</b> and <b>children</b> toreference the same kind of objects (have the same keys).</p><p>Now the association populates the browser's columns basedon the selection in the previous column. You might want to createa master-detail association between the <em>LastColumn</em> displaygroup and another display group. For example, the Employees applicationmight display information about the employee selected in the browser'sright-most column.</p><br><h2>The rootChildren Aspect</h2><p>When you bind an EORecursiveBrowserAssociation's <b>rootChildren</b> aspect,the association assumes that <b>children</b> willbe bound to the same key. However, it's possible for you to bindthese aspects to different keys. If you want to do this, you'llhave to disconnect the <b>children</b> bindingthat the association creates automatically, and then rebind it tothe key you want to use. Note that you only have this freedom withthe first column. Subsequent columns must all use the same key tosatisfy the <b>children</b> aspect.</p><br><BR><br><a href="../EOInterfaceTOC.html"><img src="../../../../../../images/up.gif" border="0" alt="Table of Contents"></a> </BODY></HTML>
