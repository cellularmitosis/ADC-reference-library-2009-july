On SIMMs,the data bus is 32 bits wide while the data bus on DIMMs is 64 bits wide.</p><P>To span the PowerPC 64-bit data bus, SIMMs need to be installed incomplimentary pairs (i.e., in parallel). DIMMs, with their 64-bit data bus, canbe installed individually in second generation Power Macintosh computers.</p><P>The only exception to this are some entry-levels Power Macintosh computers,such as the Power Macintosh 5200/75 LC, which incorporate a PowerPC 603processor configured with a 32-bit bus. In such computers, SIMMs are used formemory expansion and not installed in identical pairs.</p><H3>How does the PowerPC address memory?</H3><P>PowerPC microprocessors are <b>32-bit </b>processors that have 4 <b>Gbytes</b>of address space. This means that the processor instructions are encoded in 32bits, and that they can address or access 4 Gbytes of data.</p><P>Figure 1 illustrates a 32-bit address bus and a 64-bit data bus. Although thePowerPC has 4G of address space, only a portion of the 4G is allocated for mainmemory (DRAM memory). For example, the total RAM expansion on entry-level Macscan be as much as 136 <b>Mbytes, </b>while RAM expansion on Power Mac 9500 canbe as much as 1.5G. The remaining portion of the address space is allocated forsystem ROM, PCI cards, system control, etc.</p><P align=center><img src="images/tn1055_003.gif" alt="" width=374 height=248><br><b>Figure 1</b>. A PowerPC system bus</p><P>Data is transferred between the PowerPC and main memory via the 64-bit data busby memory reads or memory writes.</p><P>There are two types of memory transactions: single -and four-beat transfers. Asingle-beat memory transaction reads or writes between one to 8 bytes of data.(Equating 8 bytes to 64 bits and noting that the data bus is 64 bits wide, thePowerPC can read or write eight bytes in a single memory operation.) Afour-beat memory transaction reads or writes a cache block of 32 bytes to orfrom memory. Each of the four beats encompasses 8 bytes.</p><P>What's important to understand is that the memory bus is 64 bits wide and up to8 bytes can be transferred in a single memory operation.</p><H3>What is memory interleaving and what advantage does it provide?</H3><P>Even though the system data bus is 64 bits wide, the memory controller in PowerMacintosh 7500, 7600, 8500, and 9500 computers can support 128-bit data readand write operations by interleaving data between corresponding DIMMS.</p><P>Memory interleaving provides higher bandwidth (MBytes per second) between thePowerPC microprocessor and main memory. It also provides a significantperformance boost, increasing the execution speed of memory-intensive programs.How much faster depends on the program's software architecture and whether anL2 cache is present.</p><H3>How is memory interleaving enabled?</H3><P>Memory interleaving is a function of the memory controller used in PowerMacintosh 7500, 7600, 8500, and 9500 computers. Memory interleaving is enabledby the power-up software when it detects two DIMMs in corresponding expansionslots (e.g., A1 and B1, A2 and B2, etc.) that are the same density, have thesame memory bank configuration, and have the same DRAM addressing modes. Foraddressing mode information, refer to the appropriate Developer Notes on theDeveloper CD Reference Library Edition.</p><H3>What speed SIMMs and DIMMs are required for PowerMac computers?</H3><P>The access time of DRAMs used to expand memory on most PowerMac computers are80 nsec, 70 nsec, and faster, as we move into the future. Always be sure tocheck memory expansion specifications for your particular computer beforemaking a purchase.</p><H3>Can faster speed memory modules be used in Power Macintosh computers andwill they increase system performance, i.e., 60 nsec instead of 70 nsec modulesfor a performance increase of 10 - 15 percent?</H3><P>Faster speed memory modules will most likely work fine in Power Macintoshcomputers, i.e., 60 nsec instead of 70 nsec modules. This will not increase CPUperformance, however. The PowerPC processor will not <i>access memory</i> anyfaster with faster memory module speed, since PowerMacs do not use memorymodule speed sense lines.</p>    <BR><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=550><TR><td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><P><B>Note:</B><BR>         Apple recommends that for memory expansion that you stay with the speedspecified for the computer.

DRAM devices havetheir address inputs multiplexed by row and column addresses (in this example: 11 row and 11 column addresses, noted by "11/11"). The memory controllerdelivers the row and column address at different times, and drives signalsreferred to as <b>RAS</b> and <b>CAS</b> to strobe in the respective addresses.Note that the access time from the beginning of the address cycle  to validdata out (measured from RAS) is 70 nsec.</p><P>DRAM access time directly correlates to the speed specification for SIMM andDIMM memory modules; 60, 70, and 80 nsec are common speeds required by today'stypical Macintosh and PC CPUs. Access time is specified as a maximum value.</p><P align=center><img src="images/tn1055_004.gif" alt="" width=356 height=185><br><b>Figure 2</b>. A basic timing diagram showing how the device is addressed fora typical read cycle</p><H3>Can different speed memory modules be intermixed, i.e., 60 and 70 nsec modulesin a PowerMac that is specified at 70 nsec?</H3><P>As long as memory modules speeds are equal to or less than the PowerMacspecified memory speed, installing different speed modules should have noimpact on the PowerMac's functionality.</p><H3>What does refresh rate or count refer to (e.g., 1K, 2K, or 4K)?</H3><P>The term "4K refresh," for example, refers to the number of refresh cyclesrequired to refresh all sections of the memory array and is determined by thenumber of row addresses. (12 addresses will address 4096, or 4K, locations.Similarly, 11 addresses will address 2048, or 2K, locations.)</p><P>Data stored in DRAM devices is volatile. To maintain data integrity,DRAM requires a power source and continuous refreshing.</p><P>DRAMs are specified at different refresh rates that may or may not becompatible with a particular PC model.

Addressing notation refers to a matrixarray organization where 4K refresh devices (12/10) have 12 row addresses and10 column addresses. Likewise, 2K refresh devices (11/11) have 11 row addressesand 11 column addresses. Both modes (12/10 &amp; 11/11) have 22 address lines(number of column plus row lines) which is required for an address space of4,194,304 (or 4M) locations, each of which contains a 4-bit word. </p><H3>How do PowerMac computers provide continuous refreshing?</H3><P>The power source and refreshing are provided as long as the computer is poweredon. The Memory Controller in Apple Macintosh and Power Macintosh computersgenerate a CAS before RAS refresh cycle every 15.6 usec. DRAM devices containan address refresh counter which is triggered by a CAS before RAS memorycycle.</p><p>A 16 MBit (11/11) device with an 11 row address - referred to as a 2K refreshpart - requires all row address combinations (2048) to be accessed every 32<b>msec</b>. A 4K refresh device (12/10) requires 64 msec to refresh all rowaddresses. DRAM row addresses are refreshed by the Refresh Address Counter,which is triggered by a CAS before RAS refresh cycle.</p><P>The importance, therefore, lies less in whether or not a Macintosh CPU supports1K, 2K, and/or 4K refresh DRAM parts than whether the Macintosh MemoryController and DRAM devices have compatible addressing schemes, and whether theDRAM devices are compatible with CAS before RAS refresh cycles every 15.6 usec.For further details, refer to the appropriate Developer Note for the particularCPU.</p><H3>How are different sized SIMMs and DIMMs -- 16 Mbytes, 32 Mbytes, etc. --designed with different types of DRAM devices, such as 4M x 4, 2M x 8, and 1M x16 parts?</H3><P>Figures 3, 4, and 5 provide three examples of DIMM modules designed using 4M x4, 2M x 8, and 1M x 16 devices. These examples are intended to show how DIMMsare logically mapped out with different DRAM devices - <i>not</i> to show adetailed electrical schematic and/or specification. For design guidelines,refer to the JEDEC Standard 21-C and Apple Developer Notes for a particularCPU.</p><P>Remembering that DIMMs and SIMMs have a 64-bit and 32-bit wide data bus,respectively, the following examples can be applied to SIMM modules by usinghalf the number of devices to span 32 bits.</p><P>Figure 3 shows a 32 Mbyte DIMM using 4M x 4 devices in a single bank design.SIMM and DIMM memory modules accommodate one or two memory banks.

Although EDOdevices will improve timing efficiency to main memory by approximately 10%, itdoes not necessarily mean programs will execute 10% faster; much of thetime the CPU fetches instructions and data from cached memory, i.e., L1 cachewithin the PowerPC microprocessor and or L2 cache on the mother board.</p><P>EDO DRAM is a superset of conventional (also called Fast Page Mode) DRAM.  Thismeans that an EDO DRAM can be used in place of a Fast Page Mode DRAM, althoughunless the memory controller is designed to utilize the faster EDO timing, thememory performance will be the same as Fast Page Mode.</p><P>Power Macintosh computers do not yet support the extended data out timing thatEDO DRAM devices can provide. If memory modules with EDO DRAM are designed tobe fully compatible with standard Fast Page Mode DRAM, however, they shouldfunction properly. (Be sure to check with the SIMM or DIMM manufacturer andspecify the Macintosh model.)  </p><P>In the future, PowerMacs will support the extended data out timing, taking fulladvantage of EDO DRAM devices.</p><H3>What is parity memory and do Power Macintosh computers support it?</H3><P>If a computer is designed for parity RAM, the parity bit allows the memorycontroller to check for DRAM errors in the form of a parity error. A parityerror cannot correct system errors, but the system can be designed to alert theuser that a memory error has occurred.</p><P>Apple's newly introduced Network Server 500 and 700 products are the onlycomputers that support parity memory; all other Power Macintosh Desktop, Tower,and PowerBook computers do not. Parity memory modules add one parity bit toeach  byte. Thus, a 64-bit DIMM -- eight bytes -- expands from 64 bits to 72bits wide.</p><H3>What is ECC memory and do Macintosh computers support it?</H3><P>Macintosh computers do not support ECC memory. ECC (Error Correction Coding)memory has additional check bits for each byte. This entails the memorycontroller calculating and writing error control check bits on each memorywrite operation, and recalculating and comparing the check bits on memory readoperations, and then if necessary correcting the bad bits. As opposed toparity, this can automatically correct single-bit RAM errors.</p><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><a name = "RTFToC2"></A><H2>Commonly Used Terms and Abbreviations</H2>    <P><B>Mbytes</b><BR>        millions of bytes</p>    <P><B>GBytes</b><BR>        giga (one thousand million) of bytes</p>    <P><B>32 bits</b><BR>        data path or data storage unit thirty two bits wide</p>    <P><B>64 bits</b><BR>        data path or data storage unit sixty four bits wide</p>    <P><B>1M x 16</b><BR>            DRAM device with one million 16-bit wide data storage units    </p>    <P><B>2M x 8</b><BR>        DRAM device with two million 8-bit wide data storage units</p>    <P><B>4M x 4</b><BR>        DRAM device with four million 4-bit wide data storage units    </p>    <P><B>usec</b><BR>        Microseconds, or one millionth of a second</p>    <P><B>msec</b><BR>        Milliseconds, or one thousandth of a second</p>    <P><B>nsec</b><BR>        Nanoseconds, or one thousandth of a millionth of a second</p>    <P><B>memory modules</b><BR>         generic term referring to either 72-pin SIMM or 168-pin DIMM modules</p>    <P><B>first generation Power Macintosh</b><BR>        NuBus I/O expansion</p>    <P><B>second generation Power Macintosh</b><BR>        PCI I/O expansion</p>    <P><B>CAS</b><BR>        Column Address Strobe</p>    <P><B>RAS</b><BR>        Row Address Strobe</p><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><A NAME="References"></a><H2>References</h2><p>Developer Notes for specific Macintosh models and JEDEC Standard 21-C</p><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P>         <P><A NAME=Downloads></A></P>                  <H2>Downloadables</H2>                  <TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <td width=50 align=left>                  <P ALIGN=center><img src="images/acrobatsmall.gif" width=22 height=23 align=middle alt="Acrobat"></P>               </TD>               <td align="left">                  <P>Acrobat version of this Note (336K).</P>               </TD>               <td width=60 align=left>                  <P><A HREF="pdf/tn1055.pdf">Download</A></P>               </TD>            </TR></TABLE><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P></TD></TR></table></center><!-- begin_footer_information -->	<table width="680" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
