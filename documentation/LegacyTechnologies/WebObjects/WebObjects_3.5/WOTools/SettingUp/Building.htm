Building Your Application</H1>

<A NAME="6062"></A>



<P>You must build your application if your project contains any compiled

code (Java or Objective-C). If your application uses WebScript only, you

do not need to build. In this case, Project Builder runs a default executable

(<B>WODefaultApp</B>) when you launch your application.

<BR>&nbsp;<A NAME="8437"></A>



<P>Once you have built your application, you do not need to rebuild unless

you have made changes to your compiled code. You can make changes to your

components (the <B>.html</B>, <B>.wod</B>, or <B>.wos</B> files) and test

them without rebuilding.

<BR>&nbsp;<A NAME="8831"></A>



<P><B>Note:</B> When you are developing a framework, you must rebuild after

any change, even for changes to scripts or images. Therefore, when developing

a framework, it is probably best to develop it as an application project,

and once it has been tested, move its reusable pieces into a framework.

<BR>&nbsp;<A NAME="8156"></A>

<BR>Project Builder has a toolbar with buttons you use to build and launch

your application.

Click&nbsp;<IMG SRC="SetUp12.gif" > in the toolbar to open the Project

Build panel.&nbsp;<A NAME="6081"></A></LI>



<LI>

Click&nbsp;<IMG SRC="SetUp13.gif" > in the Project Build panel to build

your project.&nbsp;<A NAME="10172"></A></LI>

<P><A NAME="6089"></A>



<P>The Project Build panel displays the commands that are being executed

to build your project. If all goes well, it displays the status message

"Build succeeded."

Close the panel.</LI>

The Application Wrapper</H2>

<A NAME="8253"></A>When you build your project, Project Builder creates

an <I>application wrapper</I>, which is a folder whose name is the project

name plus the extension <B>.woa</B>.



<P><A NAME="8770"></A>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="SetUp15.gif" ></CENTER>





<P><A NAME="8763"></A>The application wrapper has a structure similar to

that of a framework. It consists of the following:

<UL><A NAME="8255"></A>

<LI>

The executable application.&nbsp;<A NAME="8256"></A></LI>



<LI>

The application's resources.&nbsp;<A NAME="8257"></A></LI>





<P>These include the application's components as well as other files that

are needed by your application at run time.

<BR>&nbsp;<A NAME="8258"></A>

<LI>

The application's web server resources.</LI>

</UL>

<A NAME="8259"></A>When you build and install your application, Project

Builder copies all the files from your Web Server Resources suitcase to

a folder called WebServerResources inside the application wrapper. If you

have client-side Java components in your project, these are also copied

to the WebServerResources folder.
