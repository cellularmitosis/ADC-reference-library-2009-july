This module solves that problems.  It searches the IORegistry and creates // a port list that includes the port's user visible name.  To use it properly you // must provide a callback (set via MoreSCFSetPortNameCallback) which it can use // to get the localised versions of certain strings.  This means that you have // to hard code port name strings in your application.  This is not an ideal // solution, but it's the best you can do until we provide the necessary APIs// [2851695, 2851696, 2851697].  Hopefully I will be able to layer a later // version of this code on top of any new APIs we introduce.  At a minimum you // will have to recompile your application when these new APIs are introduced.extern pascal OSStatus MoreSCCreatePortArray(CFArrayRef *portArray);	// Builds a list of network ports and returns their attributes as a CFArray 	// of CFDictionaries, with one dictionary per port.  The array is sorted in 	// the default order which one would display the ports to the user (and set 	// them up in the IPv4 service order array). Each entries contains the 	// following required keys.	//	// o kSCPropUserDefinedName -- the user-visible name of the port	//	// o kSCPropNetInterfaceHardware -- the hardware type of the interface, 	//   typically kSCEntNetEthernet, kSCEntNetAirPort, or kSCEntNetModem	//	// o kSCPropNetInterfaceType -- either kSCValNetInterfaceTypeEthernet 	//   or kSCValNetInterfaceTypePPP	//	// o kSCPropNetInterfaceDeviceName -- typically the BSD name of the 	//   network device; for serial-like devices this is the base 	//   name, including the suffix, but not including any leading "cu." 	//   and so on	//	// The dictionary may also contain values for the following keys. 	//	// o kSCPropNetInterfaceSubType -- either kSCValNetInterfaceSubTypePPPSerial 	//   or kSCValNetInterfaceSubTypePPPoE, only present if  	//   kSCPropNetInterfaceType is kSCValNetInterfaceTypePPP	// 	// o kSCPropMACAddress -- the MAC address for Ethernet-like devices,	//   encoded as a colon delimited string	//	// o kMoreSCPropNetInterfaceHardwareVariant -- set to 	//   kMoreSCValNetInterfaceHardwareVariantIrDACOMM to distinguish 	//   modem/serial ports from IrDA COMM ports	//	// o kSCPropNetInterfaceSupportsModemOnHold -- may be present for 	//   modem devices (kSCPropNetInterfaceHardware is kSCEntNetModem); if 	//   present, this is a CFNumber of value 0 or 1 indicating whether the 	//   modem supports V.92 call waiting; if not present, assume 0	//	// The dictionary may also contain other keys. These keys were set up 	// during the operation of the function. You may find their values useful.	// 	// o "AAPL,slot-name" -- For PCI devices this is the name of the 	//   slot that the device is plugged in to.	//	// o "IOChildIndex" -- For PCI devices thish is the port number.	//   To tell you the truth I'm not exactly sure what this means )-:	//	// o kIOBSDNameKey -- For generic Ethernet-like devices this is the 	//   BSD name of the underlying device.	//	// o kIOTTYBaseNameKey -- For generic serial ports this is the 	//   base name of the serial driver.	//	// This function takes a guess at the user-visible name of the port 	// and then calls your callback function (which you install using 	// MoreSCFSetPortNameCallback) to refine that name.  If your 	// callback function doesn't override the user-visible name 	// this function will just returns its guess.  Note that the code 	// that generates the guess is bug-for-bug compatible with the 	// Network preferences panel in Mac OS X 10.1.x and may not produce 	// ideal results. Moreover, the guess is not localised.	// 	//  portArray must not be NULL.	// *portArray must be NULL.	// On success, *portArray will be non-NULL; the caller is responsible for 	// releasing it.	// On error, *portArray will be NULL.#define kMoreSCPropNetInterfaceHardwareVariant CFSTR("HardwareVariant")#define kMoreSCValNetInterfaceHardwareVariantIrDACOMM CFSTR("IrDA-IrCOMM")/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Localisable Port Names// You can install a MoreSCFPortNameCallback to return the localised // name for a port.  The function is called with a non-localised // port label and is expected to return a localised name.//// If you don't install a callback the default (English) names for // the ports are used.//// One day a revision of IOKit will make it easy to get port names. // Until that day...typedef pascal kern_return_t (*MoreSCFPortNameCallback)(io_object_t interface, 														CFMutableDictionaryRef interfaceInfo, 														CFStringRef proposedUserVisibleName, 														CFStringRef *userVisibleName);	// MoreSCF calls this callback when it needs to determine the user-visible 	// name of a port.  The callback is provided with a reference to the 	// I/O Registry object, a dictionary of information about that object 	// (this is basically the same dictionary as is returned by 	// MoreSCCreatePortArray, without the kSCPropUserDefinedName of course) 	// and a proposed user-visible name.  The routine can either leave 	// *userVisibleName as NULL, in which case MoreSCF uses the 	// proposedUserVisible name, or set it to a user-visible name that's 	// better than the proposed one.  	//	// For example, your code might have a set of localised strings 	// for each of the port labels listed below, and return the 	// appropriate string based on the current user's preferences.  Or 	// your code might have special information about a specific 	// interface, and return a custom string for that interface. 	//	// MoreSCF does keyword substitution (for example, replacing 	// %2$@ with the PCI slot name that the device resides in) *after* 	// calling this routine, so you don't have to parse these variable 	// keywords out of proposedUserVisibleName when deciding on your 	// localisations.  You can also modify the substitions that are 	// performed by returning a string with different keywords.	//	// interface will not be 0.	// interfaceInfo will not be NULL.	// proposedUserVisibleName will not be NULL.  It will be either one of the 	// labels listed below, or a more specific name derived from the I/O Registry.	// userVisibleName will not be NULL.	// *userVisibleName will be NULL.	// On success, *userVisibleName may be NULL or not NULL.  If not NULL, 	// it's the user visible name of the port.  If NULL, your code doesn't 	// have a user visible name for this type of port.	// On error, *userVisibleName must be NULL.	//	// *userVisibleName can contain the following strings which are substituted 	// by MoreSCF upon return.	//	//   %1$@ is the BSD name of the device	//   %2$@ is the PCI slot name of the device	//   %3$@ is the function number of a multifunction PCI device	//   %4$@ is the lowercased TTY base name of the device	//        Why lowercase?  Because that's what the 10.1.x control 	//        panel does, for reasons unknown.#define kMoreSCPortLabelEthernetBuiltIn 		CFSTR("Built-in Ethernet")	// built-in Ethernet#define kMoreSCPortLabelAirPort 				CFSTR("AirPort")	// Apple AirPort#define kMoreSCPortLabelWireless 				CFSTR("Wireless Network Adaptor")	// non-AirPort wireless#define kMoreSCPortLabelEthernetPCI 			CFSTR("PCI Ethernet Slot %2$@")	// generic PCI card#define kMoreSCPortLabelEthernetPCIMultiport 	CFSTR("PCI Ethernet Slot %2$@, Port %3$@")	// multiport PCI card (I think we handle this wrongly but it's compatible 	// with the Network preferences panel)#define kMoreSCPortLabelEthernet 				CFSTR("Ethernet Adaptor (%1$@)")		// non-PCI Ethernet#define kMoreSCPortLabelModemInternal 			CFSTR("Internal Modem")	// built-in modem#define kMoreSCPortLabelModemPort 				CFSTR("Modem Port")						// built-in serial port (eg Beige G3)#define kMoreSCPortLabelPrinterPort 			CFSTR("Printer Port")					// ditto#define kMoreSCPortLabelModemPrinterPort 		CFSTR("Modem/Printer Port")				// built-in serial port (eg Wallstreet)#define kMoreSCPortLabelModemUSB 				CFSTR("USB Modem")						// generic USB modem, usually we find a better name in I/O registry#define kMoreSCPortLabelModemIrDA 				CFSTR("IrDA Modem Port")				// USB-based IrDA, including built-in port on TiBook#define kMoreSCPortLabelSerial 					CFSTR("%4$@-port")						// generic serial portextern pascal void MoreSCFSetPortNameCallback(MoreSCFPortNameCallback callback);	// Installs the callback function, eliminating any existing one. 	// Pass NULL to remove your callback./////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////#ifdef __cplusplus}#endif
