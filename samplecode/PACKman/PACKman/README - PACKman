//--------------------------------------------------------------------------//																			//		PACKman													//			by Scott “Zz” Zimmerman & Nick Thompson													//																			//		Description:	This snippet shows how to implement a simple//						Chooser Package, updated from Scott “Zz” Zimmerman's //						PACKman pascal sample										//// It's really simple, and based largely on a pascal sample that Zz wrote a few years back.  // I fixed it up a bit, and converted it to THINK C.  To build with MPW use the rez source // files and modify the makefile to build the code into PACMan.code.  Modify PACKman.r to include // the built code, it should work, and I'll fix it up some time to do this.// // Nick Thompson (AppleLink: NICKT)//																			//		Version:		1.0 Completed 10/19/94								// ////	Copyright:	© 1989-94 by Apple Computer, Inc., all rights reserved.//// Modification History:////	10/18/94		nick	converted from Pascal//	10/19/94		nick	updated to reflect info in IM: Devices (pages 1-42 ff)//							this sample is think C specific//// To do://		implement for metrowerks and MPW C//--------------------------------------------------------------------------
