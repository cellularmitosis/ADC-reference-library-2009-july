PERL572DELTA(1)                       Perl Programmers Reference Guide                       PERL572DELTA(1)



<b>NAME</b>
       perl572delta - what's new for perl v5.7.2

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       This document describes differences between the 5.7.1 release and the 5.7.2 release.

       (To view the differences between the 5.6.0 release and the 5.7.0 release, see perl570delta.  To view
       the differences between the 5.7.0 release and the 5.7.1 release, see perl571delta.)

<b>Security</b> <b>Vulnerability</b> <b>Closed</b>
       (This change was already made in 5.7.0 but bears repeating here.)

       A security vulnerability affecting all Perl versions prior to 5.6.1 was found in August 2000.  The
       vulnerability does not affect default installations and as far as is known affects only the Linux
       platform.

       You should upgrade your Perl to 5.6.1 as soon as possible.  Patches for earlier releases exist but
       using the patches require full recompilation from the source code anyway, so 5.6.1 is your best
       choice.

       See <a href="http://www.cpan.org/src/5.0/sperl-2000-08-05/sperl-2000-08-05.txt">http://www.cpan.org/src/5.0/sperl-2000-08-05/sperl-2000-08-05.txt</a> for more information.

<b>Incompatible</b> <b>Changes</b>
       <b>64-bit</b> <b>platforms</b> <b>and</b> <b>malloc</b>

       If your pointers are 64 bits wide, the Perl malloc is no more being used because it simply does not
       work with 8-byte pointers.  Also, usually the system malloc on such platforms are much better opti-
       mized for such large memory models than the Perl malloc.

       <b>AIX</b> <b>Dynaloading</b>

       The AIX dynaloading now uses in AIX releases 4.3 and newer the native dlopen interface of AIX instead
       of the old emulated interface.  This change will probably break backward compatibility with compiled
       modules.  The change was made to make Perl more compliant with other applications like modperl which
       are using the AIX native interface.

       <b>Socket</b> <b>Extension</b> <b>Dynamic</b> <b>in</b> <b>VMS</b>

       The Socket extension is now dynamically loaded instead of being statically built in.  This may or may
       not be a problem with ancient TCP/IP stacks of VMS: we do not know since we weren't able to test Perl
       in such configurations.

       <b>Different</b> <b>Definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Unicode</b> <b>Character</b> <b>Classes</b> <b>\p{In...}</b>

       As suggested by the Unicode consortium, the Unicode character classes now prefer <u>scripts</u> as opposed
       to <u>blocks</u> (as defined by Unicode); in Perl, when the "\p{In....}" and the "\p{In....}" regular
       expression constructs are used.  This has changed the definition of some of those character classes.

       The difference between scripts and blocks is that scripts are the glyphs used by a language or a
       group of languages, while the blocks are more artificial groupings of 256 characters based on the
       Unicode numbering.

       In general this change results in more inclusive Unicode character classes, but changes to the other
       direction also do take place: for example while the script "Latin" includes all the Latin characters
       and their various diacritic-adorned versions, it does not include the various punctuation or digits
       (since they are not solely "Latin").

       Changes in the character class semantics may have happened if a script and a block happen to have the
       same name, for example "Hebrew".  In such cases the script wins and "\p{InHebrew}" now means the
       script definition of Hebrew.  The block definition in still available, though, by appending "Block"
       to the name: "\p{InHebrewBlock}" means what "\p{InHebrew}" meant in perl 5.6.0.  For the full list of
       affected character classes, see "Blocks" in perlunicode.

       <b>Deprecations</b>

       The current user-visible implementation of pseudo-hashes (the weird use of the first array element)
       is deprecated starting from Perl 5.8.0 and will be removed in Perl 5.10.0, and the feature will be
       implemented differently.  Not only is the current interface rather ugly, but the current implementa-
       tion slows down normal array and hash use quite noticeably. The "fields" pragma interface will remain
       available.

       The syntaxes "@a-&gt;[...]" and  "@h-&gt;{...}" have now been deprecated.

       The suidperl is also considered to be too much a risk to continue maintaining and the suidperl code
       is likely to be removed in a future release.

       The "package;" syntax ("package" without an argument has been deprecated.  Its semantics were never
       that clear and its implementation even less so.  If you have used that feature to disallow all but
       fully qualified variables, "use strict;" instead.

       The chdir(undef) and chdir('') behaviors to match <u>chdir()</u> has been deprecated.  In future versions,
       chdir(undef) and chdir('') will simply fail.

<b>Core</b> <b>Enhancements</b>
       In general a lot of fixing has happened in the area of Perl's understanding of numbers, both integer
       and floating point.  Since in many systems the standard number parsing functions like "strtoul()" and
       "atof()" seem to have bugs, Perl tries to work around their deficiencies.  This results hopefully in
       more accurate numbers.

          The rules for allowing underscores (underbars) in numeric constants have been relaxed and simpli-
           fied: now you can have an underscore <b>between</b> <b>digits</b>.

          GMAGIC (right-hand side magic) could in many cases such as string concatenation be invoked too
           many times.

          Lexicals I: lexicals outside an eval "" weren't resolved correctly inside a subroutine definition
           inside the eval "" if they were not already referenced in the top level of the eval""ed code.

          Lexicals II: lexicals leaked at file scope into subroutines that were declared before the lexi-
           cals.

          Lvalue subroutines can now return "undef" in list context.

          The "op_clear" and "op_null" are now exported.

          A new special regular expression variable has been introduced: $^N, which contains the most-
           recently closed group (submatch).

          utime now supports "utime undef, undef, @files" to change the file timestamps to the current
           time.

          The Perl parser has been stress tested using both random input and Markov chain input.

          "eval "v200"" now works.

          VMS now works under PerlIO.

          END blocks are now run even if you exit/die in a BEGIN block.  The execution of END blocks is now
           controlled by PL_exit_flags &amp; PERL_EXIT_DESTRUCT_END. This enables the new behaviour for perl
           embedders. This will default in 5.10. See perlembed.

<b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b>
       <b>New</b> <b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Distributions</b>


          Attribute::Handlers - Simpler definition of attribute handlers

          ExtUtils::Constant - generate XS code to import C header constants

          I18N::Langinfo - query locale information

          I18N::LangTags - functions for dealing with RFC3066-style language tags

          libnet - a collection of perl5 modules related to network programming

           Perl installation leaves libnet unconfigured, use <u>libnetcfg</u> to configure.

          List::Util - selection of general-utility list subroutines

          Locale::Maketext - framework for localization

          Memoize - Make your functions faster by trading space for time

          NEXT - pseudo-class for method redispatch

          Scalar::Util - selection of general-utility scalar subroutines

          Test::More - yet another framework for writing test scripts

          Test::Simple - Basic utilities for writing tests

          Time::HiRes - high resolution ualarm, usleep, and gettimeofday

          Time::Piece - Object Oriented time objects

           (Previously known as Time::Object.)

          Time::Seconds - a simple API to convert seconds to other date values

          UnicodeCD - Unicode Character Database

       <b>Updated</b> <b>And</b> <b>Improved</b> <b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b>


          B::Deparse module has been significantly enhanced.  It now can deparse almost all of the standard
           test suite (so that the tests still succeed).  There is a make target "test.deparse" for trying
           this out.

          Class::Struct now assigns the array/hash element if the accessor is called with an array/hash
           element as the <b>sole</b> argument.

          Cwd extension is now (even) faster.

          DB_File extension has been updated to version 1.77.

          Fcntl, Socket, and Sys::Syslog have been rewritten to use the new-style constant dispatch section
           (see ExtUtils::Constant).

          File::Find is now (again) reentrant.  It also has been made more portable.

          File::Glob now supports "GLOB_LIMIT" constant to limit the size of the returned list of file-
           names.

          IO::Socket::INET now supports "LocalPort" of zero (usually meaning that the operating system will
           make one up.)

          The vars pragma now supports declaring fully qualified variables.  (Something that "our()" does
           not and will not support.)

<b>Utility</b> <b>Changes</b>
          The <u>emacs/e2ctags.pl</u> is now much faster.

          h2ph now supports C trigraphs.

          h2xs uses the new ExtUtils::Constant module which will affect newly created extensions that
           define constants.  Since the new code is more correct (if you have two constants where the first
           one is a prefix of the second one, the first constant <b>never</b> gets defined), less lossy (it uses
           integers for integer constant, as opposed to the old code that used floating point numbers even
           for integer constants), and slightly faster, you might want to consider regenerating your exten-
           sion code (the new scheme makes regenerating easy).  h2xs now also supports C trigraphs.

          libnetcfg has been added to configure the libnet.

          The <u>Pod::Html</u> (and thusly pod2html) now allows specifying a cache directory.

<b>New</b> <b>Documentation</b>
          Locale::Maketext::TPJ13 is an article about software localization, originally published in The
           Perl Journal #13, republished here with kind permission.

          More README.$PLATFORM files have been converted into pod, which also means that they also be
           installed as perl$PLATFORM documentation files.  The new files are perlapollo, perlbeos,
           perldgux, perlhurd, perlmint, perlnetware, perlplan9, perlqnx, and perltru64.

          The <u>Todo</u> and <u>Todo-5.6</u> files have been merged into perltodo.

          Use of the <u>gprof</u> tool to profile Perl has been documented in perlhack.  There is a make target
           "perl.gprof" for generating a gprofiled Perl executable.

<b>Installation</b> <b>and</b> <b>Configuration</b> <b>Improvements</b>
       <b>New</b> <b>Or</b> <b>Improved</b> <b>Platforms</b>


          AIX should now work better with gcc, threads, and 64-bitness.  Also the long doubles support in
           AIX should be better now.  See perlaix.

          AtheOS ( <a href="http://www.atheos.cx/">http://www.atheos.cx/</a> ) is a new platform.

          DG/UX platform now supports the 5.005-style threads.  See perldgux.

          DYNIX/ptx platform (a.k.a. dynixptx) is supported at or near osvers 4.5.2.

          Several Mac OS (Classic) portability patches have been applied.  We hope to get a fully working
           port by 5.8.0.  (The remaining problems relate to the changed IO model of Perl.)  See perlmacos.

          Mac OS X (or Darwin) should now be able to build Perl even on HFS+ filesystems.  (The case-insen-
           sitivity confused the Perl build process.)

          NetWare from Novell is now supported.  See perlnetware.

          The Amdahl UTS UNIX mainframe platform is now supported.

       <b>Generic</b> <b>Improvements</b>


          In AFS installations one can configure the root of the AFS to be somewhere else than the default
           <u>/afs</u> by using the Configure parameter "-Dafsroot=/some/where/else".

          The version of Berkeley DB used when the Perl (and, presumably, the DB_File extension) was built
           is now available as @Config{qw(db_version_major db_version_minor db_version_patch)} from Perl and
           as "DB_VERSION_MAJOR_CFG DB_VERSION_MINOR_CFG DB_VERSION_PATCH_CFG" from C.

          The Thread extension is now not built at all under ithreads ("Configure -Duseithreads") because
           it wouldn't work anyway (the Thread extension requires being Configured with "-Duse5005threads").

          The "B::Deparse" compiler backend has been so significantly improved that almost the whole Perl
           test suite passes after being deparsed.  A make target has been added to help in further testing:
           "make test.deparse".

<b>Selected</b> <b>Bug</b> <b>Fixes</b>
           The autouse pragma didn't work for Multi::Part::Function::Names.

           The behaviour of non-decimal but numeric string constants such as "0x23" was platform-dependent:
            in some platforms that was seen as 35, in some as 0, in some as a floating point number (don't
            ask).  This was caused by Perl using the operating system libraries in a situation where the
            result of the string to number conversion is undefined: now Perl consistently handles such
            strings as zero in numeric contexts.

           dprofpp -R didn't work.

           PERL5OPT with embedded spaces didn't work.

           Sys::Syslog ignored the "LOG_AUTH" constant.

       <b>Platform</b> <b>Specific</b> <b>Changes</b> <b>and</b> <b>Fixes</b>


          Some versions of glibc have a broken <u>modfl()</u>.  This affects builds with "-Duselongdouble".  This
           version of Perl detects this brokenness and has a workaround for it.  The glibc release 2.2.2 is
           known to have fixed the <u>modfl()</u> bug.

<b>New</b> <b>or</b> <b>Changed</b> <b>Diagnostics</b>
          In the regular expression diagnostics the "&lt;&lt; HERE" marker introduced in 5.7.0 has been changed
           to be "&lt;-- HERE" since too many people found the "&lt;&lt;" to be too similar to here-document
           starters.

          If you try to "pack" in perlfunc a number less than 0 or larger than 255 using the "C" format you
           will get an optional warning.  Similarly for the "c" format and a number less than -128 or more
           than 127.

          Certain regex modifiers such as "(?o)" make sense only if applied to the entire regex.  You will
           an optional warning if you try to do otherwise.

          Using arrays or hashes as references (e.g. "%foo-&gt;{bar}" has been deprecated for a while.  Now
           you will get an optional warning.

<b>Source</b> <b>Code</b> <b>Enhancements</b>
       <b>MAGIC</b> <b>constants</b>

       The MAGIC constants (e.g. 'P') have been macrofied (e.g. "PERL_MAGIC_TIED") for better source code
       readability and maintainability.

       <b>Better</b> <b>commented</b> <b>code</b>

       <u>perly.c</u>, <u>sv.c</u>, and <u>sv.h</u> have now been extensively commented.

       <b>Regex</b> <b>pre-/post-compilation</b> <b>items</b> <b>matched</b> <b>up</b>

       The regex compiler now maintains a structure that identifies nodes in the compiled bytecode with the
       corresponding syntactic features of the original regex expression.  The information is attached to
       the new "offsets" member of the "struct regexp". See perldebguts for more complete information.

       <b>gcc</b> <b>-Wall</b>

       The C code has been made much more "gcc -Wall" clean.  Some warning messages still remain, though, so
       if you are compiling with gcc you will see some warnings about dubious practices.  The warnings are
       being worked on.

<b>New</b> <b>Tests</b>
       Several new tests have been added, especially for the <u>lib</u> subsection.

       The tests are now reported in a different order than in earlier Perls.  (This happens because the
       test scripts from under t/lib have been moved to be closer to the library/extension they are test-
       ing.)

<b>Known</b> <b>Problems</b>
       Note that unlike other sections in this document (which describe changes since 5.7.0) this section is
       cumulative containing known problems for all the 5.7 releases.

       <b>AIX</b>


          In AIX 4.2 Perl extensions that use C++ functions that use statics may have problems in that the
           statics are not getting initialized.  In newer AIX releases this has been solved by linking Perl
           with the libC_r library, but unfortunately in AIX 4.2 the said library has an obscure bug where
           the various functions related to time (such as <u>time()</u> and <u>gettimeofday()</u>) return broken values,
           and therefore in AIX 4.2 Perl is not linked against the libC_r.

          vac 5.0.0.0 May Produce Buggy Code For Perl

           The AIX C compiler vac version 5.0.0.0 may produce buggy code, resulting in few random tests
           failing, but when the failing tests are run by hand, they succeed.  We suggest upgrading to at
           least vac version 5.0.1.0, that has been known to compile Perl correctly.  "lslpp -L|grep vac.C"
           will tell you the vac version.

       <b>Amiga</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>Invoking</b> <b>Mystery</b>

       One cannot call Perl using the "volume:" syntax, that is, "perl -v" works, but for example "bin:perl
       -v" doesn't.  The exact reason is known but the current suspect is the <u>ixemul</u> library.

       <b>lib/ftmp-security</b> <b>tests</b> <b>warn</b> <b>'system</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>insecure'</b>

       Don't panic.  Read INSTALL 'make test' section instead.

       <b>Cygwin</b> <b>intermittent</b> <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> <b>lib/Memoize/t/expire_file</b> <b>11</b> <b>and</b> <b>12</b>

       The subtests 11 and 12 sometimes fail and sometimes work.

       <b>HP-UX</b> <b>lib/io_multihomed</b> <b>Fails</b> <b>When</b> <b>LP64-Configured</b>

       The lib/io_multihomed test may hang in HP-UX if Perl has been configured to be 64-bit. Because other
       64-bit platforms do not hang in this test, HP-UX is suspect. All other tests pass in 64-bit HP-UX.
       The test attempts to create and connect to "multihomed" sockets (sockets which have multiple IP
       addresses).

       <b>HP-UX</b> <b>lib/posix</b> <b>Subtest</b> <b>9</b> <b>Fails</b> <b>When</b> <b>LP64-Configured</b>

       If perl is configured with -Duse64bitall, the successful result of the subtest 10 of lib/posix may
       arrive before the successful result of the subtest 9, which confuses the test harness so much that it
       thinks the subtest 9 failed.

       <b>Linux</b> <b>With</b> <b>Sfio</b> <b>Fails</b> <b>op/misc</b> <b>Test</b> <b>48</b>

       No known fix.

       <b>OS/390</b>

       OS/390 has rather many test failures but the situation is actually better than it was in 5.6.0, it's
       just that so many new modules and tests have been added.

       <b>op/sprintf</b> <b>tests</b> <b>129</b> <b>and</b> <b>130</b>

       The op/sprintf tests 129 and 130 are known to fail on some platforms.  Examples include any platform
       using sfio, and Compaq/Tandem's NonStop-UX.  The failing platforms do not comply with the ANSI C
       Standard, line 19ff on page 134 of ANSI X3.159 1989 to be exact.  (They produce something other than
       "1" and "-1" when formatting 0.6 and -0.6 using the printf format "%.0f", most often they produce "0"
       and "-0".)

       <b>Failure</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thread</b> <b>tests</b>

       <b>Note</b> <b>that</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>5.005-style</b> <b>threading</b> <b>remains</b> <b>experimental.</b>

       The following tests are known to fail due to fundamental problems in the 5.005 threading implementa-
       tion. These are not new failures--Perl 5.005_0x has the same bugs, but didn't have these tests.

         lib/autouse.t                 4
         t/lib/thr5005.t               19-20

       <b>UNICOS</b>


          ext/POSIX/sigaction subtests 6 and 13 may fail.

          lib/ExtUtils may spuriously claim that subtest 28 failed, which is interesting since the test
           only has 27 tests.

          Numerous numerical test failures

             op/numconvert                 209,210,217,218
             op/override                   7
             ext/Time/HiRes/HiRes          9
             lib/Math/BigInt/t/bigintpm    1145
             lib/Math/Trig                 25

           These tests fail because of yet unresolved floating point inaccuracies.

       <b>UTS</b>

       There are a few known test failures, see perluts.

       <b>VMS</b>

       Rather many tests are failing in VMS but that actually more tests succeed in VMS than they used to,
       it's just that there are many, many more tests than there used to be.

       Here are the known failures from some compiler/platform combinations.

       <b>Win32</b>

       In multi-CPU boxes there are some problems with the I/O buffering: some output may appear twice.

       <b>Localising</b> <b>a</b> <b>Tied</b> <b>Variable</b> <b>Leaks</b> <b>Memory</b>

           use Tie::Hash;
           tie my %tie_hash =&gt; 'Tie::StdHash';

           ...

           local($tie_hash{Foo}) = 1; # leaks

       Code like the above is known to leak memory every time the <u>local()</u> is executed.

       <b>Self-tying</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arrays</b> <b>and</b> <b>Hashes</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Forbidden</b>

       Self-tying of arrays and hashes is broken in rather deep and hard-to-fix ways.  As a stop-gap measure
       to avoid people from getting frustrated at the mysterious results (core dumps, most often) it is for
       now forbidden (you will get a fatal error even from an attempt).

       <b>Variable</b> <b>Attributes</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>Currently</b> <b>Usable</b> <b>for</b> <b>Tieing</b>

       This limitation will hopefully be fixed in future.  (Subroutine attributes work fine for tieing, see
       Attribute::Handlers).

       <b>Building</b> <b>Extensions</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Fail</b> <b>Because</b> <b>Of</b> <b>Largefiles</b>

       Some extensions like mod_perl are known to have issues with `largefiles', a change brought by Perl
       5.6.0 in which file offsets default to 64 bits wide, where supported.  Modules may fail to compile at
       all or compile and work incorrectly.  Currently there is no good solution for the problem, but Con-
       figure now provides appropriate non-largefile ccflags, ldflags, libswanted, and libs in the %Config
       hash (e.g., $Config{ccflags_nolargefiles}) so the extensions that are having problems can try config-
       uring themselves without the largefileness.  This is admittedly not a clean solution, and the solu-
       tion may not even work at all.  One potential failure is whether one can (or, if one can, whether
       it's a good idea) link together at all binaries with different ideas about file offsets, all this is
       platform-dependent.

       <b>The</b> <b>Compiler</b> <b>Suite</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Still</b> <b>Experimental</b>

       The compiler suite is slowly getting better but is nowhere near working order yet.

       <b>The</b> <b>Long</b> <b>Double</b> <b>Support</b> <b>is</b> <b>Still</b> <b>Experimental</b>

       The ability to configure Perl's numbers to use "long doubles", floating point numbers of hopefully
       better accuracy, is still experimental.  The implementations of long doubles are not yet widespread
       and the existing implementations are not quite mature or standardised, therefore trying to support
       them is a rare and moving target.  The gain of more precision may also be offset by slowdown in com-
       putations (more bits to move around, and the operations are more likely to be executed by less opti-
       mised libraries).
