It shows how to use offscreen pixmaps and#	bitmaps to produce flicker-free updating with a#	minimum of re-structuring of code. OffSample attempts#	to reduce the amount of 'knowledge' that it has of#	the offscreen structure so as to minimize its#	dependence on that unit.##	OffSample emphasizes using the Offscreen unit; it#	is not intended to be viewed as a complete application#	from which to base some larger effort. Instead, its#	method of using offscreen bitmaps and pixmaps should#	be studied and adapted to other applications that#	desire features such as flicker-free updating.#PObjs = OffSample.p.o 		UFailure.a.o 		UFailure.p.o 		Offscreen.p.o 		"{Libraries}"Runtime.o 		"{Libraries}"Interface.o 		"{PLibraries}"PasLib.oPOffSample		컴 {PObjs} POffSample.make		Link -o {Targ} {PObjs}		SetFile {Targ} -t APPL -c '????' -a BPOffSample		컴 OffSample.r OffSample.h OffSample.rsrc POffSample.make		Rez -rd -o {Targ} OffSample.r -appendPOffSample.p.o	컴 Offscreen.p UFailure.p POffSample.makeUFailure.p.o	컴 UFailure.inc1.p POffSample.makeUFailure.a.o	컴 POffSample.makeOffscreen.p.o	컴 Offscreen.inc1.p POffSample.make
