A close relative of the horse, the zebra still found in the wild in parts of EasternAfrica. The digestive system of the zebra is designed to extract energy and nutrients from course, low-quality forage by permitting the passage of largequantities of foliage and plant matter through a long hindgut. The intestine ofthe zebra is eleven to seventeen times the body length. This allows the zebra to live in areas of scrub brush, and grassy plains. Adults stand 55 to 57 inches at the shoulder and may weigh 880 pounds or more. The broad black stripes are closely spaced and extend all the way to the broad hooves leaving the belly white. The mane is long and erect, and the ears are large and rounded.Pregnant zebra give birth to several foals after a 13 month gestation period. The foals can walk only hours after birth and become independant from their mothersafter a few months of age.Under increased pressure from human encroachment on their habitat, the zebra is listed as an endangered species.
