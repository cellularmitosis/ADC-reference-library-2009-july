// ABOUT MOKit
//
// MOKit is a collection of useful and general objects.  Permission is
// granted by the author to use MOKit in your own programs in any way
// you see fit.  All other rights to the kit are reserved by the author
// including the right to sell these objects as part of a LIBRARY or as
// SOURCE CODE.  In plain English, I wish to retain rights to these
// objects as objects, but allow the use of the objects as pieces in a
// fully functional program.  NO WARRANTY is expressed or implied.  The author
// will under no circumstances be held responsible for ANY consequences to
// you or others from the use of these objects.  Since you don't have to pay for
// them, and full source is provided, I think this is perfectly fair.

// ABOUT MORegularExpression
//
// MORegularExpression objects have a pattern string in unix-style regular
// expression syntax and know how match other strings against them.  They
// are immutable.  If you need to match another string, make another
// MORegularExpression.  The implementation is almost entirely provided by
// Henry Spencer's regular expression package which is used by this framework
// in a modified form and also included in its original and complete form.
// This class is NOT unicode aware.  Expressions and candidate strings should
// be ascii encodable.  This lack of internationalizability stems from the
// limitations of the underlying expression parsing code used.
