<b>NAME</b>
       Test::More - yet another framework for writing test scripts

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
         use Test::More tests =&gt; $Num_Tests;
         # or
         use Test::More qw(no_plan);
         # or
         use Test::More skip_all =&gt; $reason;

         BEGIN { use_ok( 'Some::Module' ); }
         require_ok( 'Some::Module' );

         # Various ways to say "ok"
         ok($this eq $that, $test_name);

         is  ($this, $that,    $test_name);
         isnt($this, $that,    $test_name);

         # Rather than print STDERR "# here's what went wrong\n"
         diag("here's what went wrong");

         like  ($this, qr/that/, $test_name);
         unlike($this, qr/that/, $test_name);

         cmp_ok($this, '==', $that, $test_name);

         is_deeply($complex_structure1, $complex_structure2, $test_name);

         SKIP: {
             skip $why, $how_many unless $have_some_feature;

             ok( foo(),       $test_name );
             is( <!-- a -->foo(42)<!-- /a -->, 23, $test_name );
         };

         TODO: {
             local $TODO = $why;

             ok( foo(),       $test_name );
             is( <!-- a -->foo(42)<!-- /a -->, 23, $test_name );
         };

         can_ok($module, @methods);
         isa_ok($object, $class);

         pass($test_name);
         fail($test_name);

         BAIL_OUT($why);

         # UNIMPLEMENTED!!!
         my @status = Test::More::status;

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       <b>STOP!</b> If you're just getting started writing tests, have a look at Test::Simple first.  This is a
       drop in replacement for Test::Simple which you can switch to once you get the hang of basic testing.

       The purpose of this module is to provide a wide range of testing utilities.  Various ways to say "ok"
       with better diagnostics, facilities to skip tests, test future features and compare complicated data
       structures.  While you can do almost anything with a simple "ok()" function, it doesn't provide good
       diagnostic output.

       <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> <b>comes</b> <b>together</b>

       Before anything else, you need a testing plan.  This basically declares how many tests your script is
       going to run to protect against premature failure.

       The preferred way to do this is to declare a plan when you "use Test::More".

         use Test::More tests =&gt; $Num_Tests;

       There are rare cases when you will not know beforehand how many tests your script is going to run.
       In this case, you can declare that you have no plan.  (Try to avoid using this as it weakens your
       test.)

         use Test::More qw(no_plan);

       <b>NOTE</b>: using no_plan requires a Test::Harness upgrade else it will think everything has failed.  See
       "CAVEATS and NOTES").

       In some cases, you'll want to completely skip an entire testing script.

         use Test::More skip_all =&gt; $skip_reason;

       Your script will declare a skip with the reason why you skipped and exit immediately with a zero
       (success).  See Test::Harness for details.

       If you want to control what functions Test::More will export, you have to use the 'import' option.
       For example, to import everything but 'fail', you'd do:

         use Test::More tests =&gt; 23, import =&gt; ['!fail'];

       Alternatively, you can use the <u>plan()</u> function.  Useful for when you have to calculate the number of
       tests.

         use Test::More;
         plan tests =&gt; keys %Stuff * 3;

       or for deciding between running the tests at all:

         use Test::More;
         if( $^O eq 'MacOS' ) {
             plan skip_all =&gt; 'Test irrelevant on MacOS';
         }
         else {
             plan tests =&gt; 42;
         }

       <b>Test</b> <b>names</b>

       By convention, each test is assigned a number in order.  This is largely done automatically for you.
       However, it's often very useful to assign a name to each test.  Which would you rather see:

         ok 4
         not ok 5
         ok 6

       or

         ok 4 - basic multi-variable
         not ok 5 - simple exponential
         ok 6 - force == mass * acceleration

       The later gives you some idea of what failed.  It also makes it easier to find the test in your
       script, simply search for "simple exponential".

       All test functions take a name argument.  It's optional, but highly suggested that you use it.

       <b>I'm</b> <b>ok,</b> <b>you're</b> <b>not</b> <b>ok.</b>

       The basic purpose of this module is to print out either "ok #" or "not ok #" depending on if a given
       test succeeded or failed.  Everything else is just gravy.

       All of the following print "ok" or "not ok" depending on if the test succeeded or failed.  They all
       also return true or false, respectively.

       <b>ok</b>
             ok($this eq $that, $test_name);

           This simply evaluates any expression ("$this eq $that" is just a simple example) and uses that to
           determine if the test succeeded or failed.  A true expression passes, a false one fails.  Very
           simple.

           For example:

               ok( $exp{9} == 81,                   'simple exponential' );
               ok( Film-&gt;can('db_Main'),            'set_db()' );
               ok( $p-&gt;tests == 4,                  'saw tests' );
               ok( !grep !defined $_, @items,       'items populated' );

           (Mnemonic:  "This is ok.")

           $test_name is a very short description of the test that will be printed out.  It makes it very
           easy to find a test in your script when it fails and gives others an idea of your intentions.
           $test_name is optional, but we <b>very</b> strongly encourage its use.

           Should an <u>ok()</u> fail, it will produce some diagnostics:

               not ok 18 - sufficient mucus
               #   Failed test 'sufficient mucus'
               #   in foo.t at line 42.

           This is actually Test::Simple's <u>ok()</u> routine.

       <b>is</b>
       <b>isnt</b>
             is  ( $this, $that, $test_name );
             isnt( $this, $that, $test_name );

           Similar to <u>ok()</u>, <u>is()</u> and <u>isnt()</u> compare their two arguments with "eq" and "ne" respectively and
           use the result of that to determine if the test succeeded or failed.  So these:

               # Is the ultimate answer 42?
               is( ultimate_answer(), 42,          "Meaning of Life" );

               # $foo isn't empty
               isnt( $foo, '',     "Got some foo" );

           are similar to these:

               ok( ultimate_answer() eq 42,        "Meaning of Life" );
               ok( $foo ne '',     "Got some foo" );

           (Mnemonic:  "This is that."  "This isn't that.")

           So why use these?  They produce better diagnostics on failure.  <u>ok()</u> cannot know what you are
           testing for (beyond the name), but <u>is()</u> and <u>isnt()</u> know what the test was and why it failed.  For
           example this test:

               my $foo = 'waffle';  my $bar = 'yarblokos';
               is( $foo, $bar,   'Is foo the same as bar?' );

           Will produce something like this:

               not ok 17 - Is foo the same as bar?
               #   Failed test 'Is foo the same as bar?'
               #   in foo.t at line 139.
               #          got: 'waffle'
               #     expected: 'yarblokos'

           So you can figure out what went wrong without rerunning the test.

           You are encouraged to use <u>is()</u> and <u>isnt()</u> over <u>ok()</u> where possible, however do not be tempted to
           use them to find out if something is true or false!

             # XXX BAD!
             is( exists $brooklyn{tree}, 1, 'A tree grows in Brooklyn' );

           This does not check if "exists $brooklyn{tree}" is true, it checks if it returns 1.  Very differ-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ent.&nbsp;different.</font>
           ent.  Similar caveats exist for false and 0.  In these cases, use <u>ok()</u>.

             ok( exists $brooklyn{tree},    'A tree grows in Brooklyn' );

           For those grammatical pedants out there, there's an "isn't()" function which is an alias of
           <u>isnt()</u>.

       <b>like</b>
             like( $this, qr/that/, $test_name );

           Similar to <u>ok()</u>, <u>like()</u> matches $this against the regex "qr/that/".

           So this:

               like($this, qr/that/, 'this is like that');

           is similar to:

               ok( $this =~ /that/, 'this is like that');

           (Mnemonic "This is like that".)

           The second argument is a regular expression.  It may be given as a regex reference (i.e. "qr//")
           or (for better compatibility with older perls) as a string that looks like a regex (alternative
           delimiters are currently not supported):

               like( $this, '/that/', 'this is like that' );

           Regex options may be placed on the end ('/that/i').

           Its advantages over <u>ok()</u> are similar to that of <u>is()</u> and <u>isnt()</u>.  Better diagnostics on failure.

       <b>unlike</b>
             unlike( $this, qr/that/, $test_name );

           Works exactly as <u>like()</u>, only it checks if $this <b>does</b> <b>not</b> match the given pattern.

       <b>cmp_ok</b>
             cmp_ok( $this, $op, $that, $test_name );

           Halfway between <u>ok()</u> and <u>is()</u> lies <u>cmp</u><b>_</b><u>ok()</u>.  This allows you to compare two arguments using any
           binary perl operator.

               # ok( $this eq $that );
               cmp_ok( $this, 'eq', $that, 'this eq that' );

               # ok( $this == $that );
               cmp_ok( $this, '==', $that, 'this == that' );

               # ok( $this &amp;&amp; $that );
               cmp_ok( $this, '&amp;&amp;', $that, 'this &amp;&amp; that' );
               ...etc...

           Its advantage over <u>ok()</u> is when the test fails you'll know what $this and $that were:

               not ok 1
               #   Failed test in foo.t at line 12.
               #     '23'
               #         &amp;&amp;
               #     undef

           It's also useful in those cases where you are comparing numbers and <u>is()</u>'s use of "eq" will
           interfere:

               cmp_ok( $big_hairy_number, '==', $another_big_hairy_number );

       <b>can_ok</b>
             can_ok($module, @methods);
             can_ok($object, @methods);

           Checks to make sure the $module or $object can do these @methods (works with functions, too).

               can_ok('Foo', qw(this that whatever));

           is almost exactly like saying:

               ok( Foo-&gt;can('this') &amp;&amp;
                   Foo-&gt;can('that') &amp;&amp;
                   Foo-&gt;can('whatever')
                 );

           only without all the typing and with a better interface.  Handy for quickly testing an interface.

           No matter how many @methods you check, a single <u>can</u><b>_</b><u>ok()</u> call counts as one test.  If you desire
           otherwise, use:

               foreach my $meth (@methods) {
                   can_ok('Foo', $meth);
               }

       <b>isa_ok</b>
             isa_ok($object, $class, $object_name);
             isa_ok($ref,    $type,  $ref_name);

           Checks to see if the given "$object-&gt;isa($class)".  Also checks to make sure the object was
           defined in the first place.  Handy for this sort of thing:

               my $obj = Some::Module-&gt;new;
               isa_ok( $obj, 'Some::Module' );

           where you'd otherwise have to write

               my $obj = Some::Module-&gt;new;
               ok( defined $obj &amp;&amp; $obj-&gt;isa('Some::Module') );

           to safeguard against your test script blowing up.

           It works on references, too:

               isa_ok( $array_ref, 'ARRAY' );

           The diagnostics of this test normally just refer to 'the object'.  If you'd like them to be more
           specific, you can supply an $object_name (for example 'Test customer').

       <b>pass</b>
       <b>fail</b>
             pass($test_name);
             fail($test_name);

           Sometimes you just want to say that the tests have passed.  Usually the case is you've got some
           complicated condition that is difficult to wedge into an <u>ok()</u>.  In this case, you can simply use
           <u>pass()</u> (to declare the test ok) or fail (for not ok).  They are synonyms for <!-- a --><u>ok</u>(1)<!-- /a --> and <u>ok</u>(0).

           Use these very, very, very sparingly.

       <b>Module</b> <b>tests</b>

       You usually want to test if the module you're testing loads ok, rather than just vomiting if its load
       fails.  For such purposes we have "use_ok" and "require_ok".

       <b>use_ok</b>
              BEGIN { use_ok($module); }
              BEGIN { use_ok($module, @imports); }

           These simply use the given $module and test to make sure the load happened ok.  It's recommended
           that you run <u>use</u><b>_</b><u>ok()</u> inside a BEGIN block so its functions are exported at compile-time and pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">totypes&nbsp;prototypes</font>
           totypes are properly honored.

           If @imports are given, they are passed through to the use.  So this:

              BEGIN { use_ok('Some::Module', qw(foo bar)) }

           is like doing this:

              use Some::Module qw(foo bar);

           Version numbers can be checked like so:

              # Just like "use Some::Module 1.02"
              BEGIN { use_ok('Some::Module', 1.02) }

           Don't try to do this:

              BEGIN {
                  use_ok('Some::Module');

                  ...some code that depends on the use...
                  ...happening at compile time...
              }

           because the notion of "compile-time" is relative.  Instead, you want:

             BEGIN { use_ok('Some::Module') }
             BEGIN { ...some code that depends on the use... }

       <b>require_ok</b>
              require_ok($module);
              require_ok($file);

           Like <u>use</u><b>_</b><u>ok()</u>, except it requires the $module or $file.

       <b>Complex</b> <b>data</b> <b>structures</b>

       Not everything is a simple eq check or regex.  There are times you need to see if two data structures
       are equivalent.  For these instances Test::More provides a handful of useful functions.

       <b>NOTE</b> I'm not quite sure what will happen with filehandles.

       <b>is_deeply</b>
             is_deeply( $this, $that, $test_name );

           Similar to <u>is()</u>, except that if $this and $that are references, it does a deep comparison walking
           each data structure to see if they are equivalent.  If the two structures are different, it will
           display the place where they start differing.

           <u>is</u><b>_</b><u>deeply()</u> compares the dereferenced values of references, the references themselves (except for
           their type) are ignored.  This means aspects such as blessing and ties are not considered "dif-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ferent".&nbsp;"different".</font>
           ferent".

           <u>is</u><b>_</b><u>deeply()</u> current has very limited handling of function reference and globs.  It merely checks
           if they have the same referent.  This may improve in the future.

           Test::Differences and Test::Deep provide more in-depth functionality along these lines.

       <b>Diagnostics</b>

       If you pick the right test function, you'll usually get a good idea of what went wrong when it
       failed.  But sometimes it doesn't work out that way.  So here we have ways for you to write your own
       diagnostic messages which are safer than just "print STDERR".

       <b>diag</b>
             diag(@diagnostic_message);

           Prints a diagnostic message which is guaranteed not to interfere with test output.  Like "print"
           @diagnostic_message is simply concatenated together.

           Handy for this sort of thing:

               ok( grep(/foo/, @users), "There's a foo user" ) or
                   diag("Since there's no foo, check that /etc/bar is set up right");

           which would produce:

               not ok 42 - There's a foo user
               #   Failed test 'There's a foo user'
               #   in foo.t at line 52.
               # Since there's no foo, check that /etc/bar is set up right.

           You might remember "ok() or diag()" with the mnemonic "open() or die()".

           <b>NOTE</b> The exact formatting of the diagnostic output is still changing, but it is guaranteed that
           whatever you throw at it it won't interfere with the test.

       <b>Conditional</b> <b>tests</b>

       Sometimes running a test under certain conditions will cause the test script to die.  A certain func-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;function</font>
       tion or method isn't implemented (such as <u>fork()</u> on MacOS), some resource isn't available (like a net
       connection) or a module isn't available.  In these cases it's necessary to skip tests, or declare
       that they are supposed to fail but will work in the future (a todo test).

       For more details on the mechanics of skip and todo tests see Test::Harness.

       The way Test::More handles this is with a named block.  Basically, a block of tests which can be
       skipped over or made todo.  It's best if I just show you...

       <b>SKIP:</b> <b>BLOCK</b>
             SKIP: {
                 skip $why, $how_many if $condition;

                 ...normal testing code goes here...
             }

           This declares a block of tests that might be skipped, $how_many tests there are, $why and under
           what $condition to skip them.  An example is the easiest way to illustrate:

               SKIP: {
                   eval { require HTML::Lint };

                   skip "HTML::Lint not installed", 2 if $@;

                   my $lint = new HTML::Lint;
                   isa_ok( $lint, "HTML::Lint" );

                   $lint-&gt;parse( $html );
                   is( $lint-&gt;errors, 0, "No errors found in HTML" );
               }

           If the user does not have HTML::Lint installed, the whole block of code <u>won't</u> <u>be</u> <u>run</u> <u>at</u> <u>all</u>.
           Test::More will output special ok's which Test::Harness interprets as skipped, but passing,
           tests.

           It's important that $how_many accurately reflects the number of tests in the SKIP block so the #
           of tests run will match up with your plan.  If your plan is "no_plan" $how_many is optional and
           will default to 1.

           It's perfectly safe to nest SKIP blocks.  Each SKIP block must have the label "SKIP", or
           Test::More can't work its magic.

           You don't skip tests which are failing because there's a bug in your program, or for which you
           don't yet have code written.  For that you use TODO.  Read on.

       <b>TODO:</b> <b>BLOCK</b>
               TODO: {
                   local $TODO = $why if $condition;

                   ...normal testing code goes here...
               }

           Declares a block of tests you expect to fail and $why.  Perhaps it's because you haven't fixed a
           bug or haven't finished a new feature:

               TODO: {
                   local $TODO = "URI::Geller not finished";

                   my $card = "Eight of clubs";
                   is( URI::Geller-&gt;your_card, $card, 'Is THIS your card?' );

                   my $spoon;
                   URI::Geller-&gt;bend_spoon;
                   is( $spoon, 'bent',    "Spoon bending, that's original" );
               }

           With a todo block, the tests inside are expected to fail.  Test::More will run the tests nor-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mally,&nbsp;normally,</font>
           mally, but print out special flags indicating they are "todo".  Test::Harness will interpret
           failures as being ok.  Should anything succeed, it will report it as an unexpected success.  You
           then know the thing you had todo is done and can remove the TODO flag.

           The nice part about todo tests, as opposed to simply commenting out a block of tests, is it's
           like having a programmatic todo list.  You know how much work is left to be done, you're aware of
           what bugs there are, and you'll know immediately when they're fixed.

           Once a todo test starts succeeding, simply move it outside the block.  When the block is empty,
           delete it.

           <b>NOTE</b>: TODO tests require a Test::Harness upgrade else it will treat it as a normal failure.  See
           "CAVEATS and NOTES").

       <b>todo_skip</b>
               TODO: {
                   todo_skip $why, $how_many if $condition;

                   ...normal testing code...
               }

           With todo tests, it's best to have the tests actually run.  That way you'll know when they start
           passing.  Sometimes this isn't possible.  Often a failing test will cause the whole program to
           die or hang, even inside an "eval BLOCK" with and using "alarm".  In these extreme cases you have
           no choice but to skip over the broken tests entirely.

           The syntax and behavior is similar to a "SKIP: BLOCK" except the tests will be marked as failing
           but todo.  Test::Harness will interpret them as passing.

       When do I use SKIP vs. TODO?
           <b>If</b> <b>it's</b> <b>something</b> <b>the</b> <b>user</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b>, use SKIP.  This includes optional modules
           that aren't installed, running under an OS that doesn't have some feature (like <u>fork()</u> or sym-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">links),&nbsp;symlinks),</font>
           links), or maybe you need an Internet connection and one isn't available.

           <b>If</b> <b>it's</b> <b>something</b> <b>the</b> <b>programmer</b> <b>hasn't</b> <b>done</b> <b>yet</b>, use TODO.  This is for any code you haven't
           written yet, or bugs you have yet to fix, but want to put tests in your testing script (always a
           good idea).

       <b>Test</b> <b>control</b>


       <b>BAIL_OUT</b>
               BAIL_OUT($reason);

           Incidates to the harness that things are going so badly all testing should terminate.  This
           includes the running any additional test scripts.

           This is typically used when testing cannot continue such as a critical module failing to compile
           or a necessary external utility not being available such as a database connection failing.

           The test will exit with 255.

       <b>Discouraged</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>functions</b>

       The use of the following functions is discouraged as they are not actually testing functions and pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">duce&nbsp;produce</font>
       duce no diagnostics to help figure out what went wrong.  They were written before <u>is</u><b>_</b><u>deeply()</u> existed
       because I couldn't figure out how to display a useful diff of two arbitrary data structures.

       These functions are usually used inside an <u>ok()</u>.

           ok( eq_array(\@this, \@that) );

       "is_deeply()" can do that better and with diagnostics.

           is_deeply( \@this, \@that );

       They may be deprecated in future versions.

       <b>eq_array</b>
             my $is_eq = eq_array(\@this, \@that);

           Checks if two arrays are equivalent.  This is a deep check, so multi-level structures are handled
           correctly.

       <b>eq_hash</b>
             my $is_eq = eq_hash(\%this, \%that);

           Determines if the two hashes contain the same keys and values.  This is a deep check.

       <b>eq_set</b>
             my $is_eq = eq_set(\@this, \@that);

           Similar to <u>eq</u><b>_</b><u>array()</u>, except the order of the elements is <b>not</b> important.  This is a deep check,
           but the irrelevancy of order only applies to the top level.

               ok( eq_set(\@this, \@that) );

           Is better written:

               is_deeply( [sort @this], [sort @that] );

           <b>NOTE</b> By historical accident, this is not a true set comparison.  While the order of elements does
           not matter, duplicate elements do.

           <b>NOTE</b> <u>eq</u><b>_</b><u>set()</u> does not know how to deal with references at the top level.  The following is an
           example of a comparison which might not work:

               eq_set([\1, \2], [\2, \1]);

           Test::Deep contains much better set comparison functions.

       <b>Extending</b> <b>and</b> <b>Embedding</b> <b>Test::More</b>

       Sometimes the Test::More interface isn't quite enough.  Fortunately, Test::More is built on top of
       Test::Builder which provides a single, unified backend for any test library to use.  This means two
       test libraries which both use Test::Builder <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>together</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>program</b>.

       If you simply want to do a little tweaking of how the tests behave, you can access the underlying
       Test::Builder object like so:

       <b>builder</b>
               my $test_builder = Test::More-&gt;builder;

           Returns the Test::Builder object underlying Test::More for you to play with.

<b>EXIT</b> <b>CODES</b>
       If all your tests passed, Test::Builder will exit with zero (which is normal).  If anything failed it
       will exit with how many failed.  If you run less (or more) tests than you planned, the missing (or
       extras) will be considered failures.  If no tests were ever run Test::Builder will throw a warning
       and exit with 255.  If the test died, even after having successfully completed all its tests, it will
       still be considered a failure and will exit with 255.

       So the exit codes are...

           0                   all tests successful
           255                 test died or all passed but wrong # of tests run
           any other number    how many failed (including missing or extras)

       If you fail more than 254 tests, it will be reported as 254.

       <b>NOTE</b>  This behavior may go away in future versions.

<b>CAVEATS</b> <b>and</b> <b>NOTES</b>
       Backwards compatibility
           Test::More works with Perls as old as 5.004_05.

       Overloaded objects
           String overloaded objects are compared <b>as</b> <b>strings</b> (or in <u>cmp</u><b>_</b><u>ok()</u>'s case, strings or numbers as
           appropriate to the comparison op).  This prevents Test::More from piercing an object's interface
           allowing better blackbox testing.  So if a function starts returning overloaded objects instead
           of bare strings your tests won't notice the difference.  This is good.

           However, it does mean that functions like <u>is</u><b>_</b><u>deeply()</u> cannot be used to test the internals of
           string overloaded objects.  In this case I would suggest Test::Deep which contains more flexible
           testing functions for complex data structures.

       Threads
           Test::More will only be aware of threads if "use threads" has been done <u>before</u> Test::More is
           loaded.  This is ok:

               use threads;
               use Test::More;

           This may cause problems:

               use Test::More
               use threads;

       Test::Harness upgrade
           no_plan and todo depend on new Test::Harness features and fixes.  If you're going to distribute
           tests that use no_plan or todo your end-users will have to upgrade Test::Harness to the latest
           one on CPAN.  If you avoid no_plan and TODO tests, the stock Test::Harness will work fine.

           Installing Test::More should also upgrade Test::Harness.

<b>HISTORY</b>
       This is a case of convergent evolution with Joshua Pritikin's Test module.  I was largely unaware of
       its existence when I'd first written my own <u>ok()</u> routines.  This module exists because I can't figure
       out how to easily wedge test names into Test's interface (along with a few other problems).

       The goal here is to have a testing utility that's simple to learn, quick to use and difficult to trip
       yourself up with while still providing more flexibility than the existing Test.pm.  As such, the
       names of the most common routines are kept tiny, special cases and magic side-effects are kept to a
       minimum.  WYSIWYG.

<b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b>
       Test::Simple if all this confuses you and you just want to write some tests.  You can upgrade to
       Test::More later (it's forward compatible).

       Test is the old testing module.  Its main benefit is that it has been distributed with Perl since
       5.004_05.

       Test::Harness for details on how your test results are interpreted by Perl.

       Test::Differences for more ways to test complex data structures.  And it plays well with Test::More.

       Test::Class is like XUnit but more perlish.

       Test::Deep gives you more powerful complex data structure testing.

       Test::Unit is XUnit style testing.

       Test::Inline shows the idea of embedded testing.

       Bundle::Test installs a whole bunch of useful test modules.
