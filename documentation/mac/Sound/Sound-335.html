 <B>speech version information record  </B>A structure that contains information about the speech synthesizer currently being used. Defined by the <CODE>SpeechVersionInfo</CODE> data type.<P>
 <B>speech volume  </B>A fixed-point value on a scale from 0.000 to 1.000 that indicates the average amplitude a speech synthesizer should use in generating synthesized speech. A value of 0.000 corresponds to the lowest possible volume, and a value of 1.000 corresponds to the highest.<P>
 <B>square-wave data</B>  Any set of values that represent a sound by its frequency, amplitude, and duration.<P>
 <B>stereo sound</B>  Sound that simultaneously consists of two or more channels. Also called <I>polyphonic sound</I> or <I>multichannel sound</I>. Compare <B>monophonic sound.</B><P>
 <B>synchronization callback procedure</B>  An application-defined procedure that is executed whenever the Speech Manager encounters an embedded synchronization speech command in a buffer of input text.<P>
 <B>synchronous sound play</B>  A playing of sound by the Sound Manager that prevents other code from executing until the sound is done playing. Compare <B>asynchronous sound play.</B><P>
 <B>synthesized speech</B>  The product of converting nonaural tokens (such as written or digitally-stored words or phonemes) into speech. See also <B>Speech Manager.</B><P>
 <B>synthesizer</B>  See <B>speech synthesizer.<A NAME=MARKER-2-44></A></B><P>
 <B>system alert sound</B>  A sound resource stored in the System file that is played whenever an application or other executable code calls the <CODE>SysBeep</CODE> procedure.<P>
 <B>text </B>  The written representation of language.<P>
 <B>text-done callback procedure</B>  An application-defined procedure that is executed when the Speech Manager has finished processing (although not necessarily speaking) a buffer of input text.<P>
 <B>text-to-speech</B>  See <B>synthesized speech.<A NAME=MARKER-2-45></A></B><P>
 <B>tick</B>  A unit of time equal to one sixtieth of a second.<P>
 <B>timbre</B>  The tone of a sound, which can range from clear to buzzing.<P>
 <B>two's complement encoding</B>  A system for digitally encoding sound that stores the amplitude values as a signed number--silence is represented by a sample with a value of 0. For example, with 8-bit sound samples, two's complement values would range from -128 to 127, with 0 meaning silence. The Audio Interchange File Format (AIFF) used by the Sound Manager stores samples in two's complement form. Compare <B>offset-binary encoding.</B><P>
 <B>uncompressed sound data</B>  See <B>decompressed sound data, noncompressed sound data.<A NAME=MARKER-2-46></A></B><P>
 <B>utility component  </B>A sound component that performs some modification on sound data and does not communicate directly with any sound output device. See also <B>sound component, sound output device component.</B><P>
 <B>version record  </B>A structure that contains version information. Defined by the <CODE>NumVersion</CODE> data type.<P>
 <B>voice  </B>(1) The set of parameters that specify a particular quality of synthesized speech. A voice is designed to work with a particular speech synthesizer. (2) A sampled sound played at varying rates to produce a number of different pitches or notes. See also <B>instrument.</B><P>
 <B>voice description record  </B>A structure that contains information about a voice. Defined by the <CODE>VoiceDescription</CODE> data type.<P>
 <B>voice file information record  </B>A structure that contains information about the file in which a voice is stored and the resource ID of the voice within that file. Defined by the <CODE>VoiceFileInfo</CODE> data type.<P>
 <B>voice specification record  </B>A structure that provides a unique specification that you must use to obtain information about a voice. Defined by the <CODE>VoiceSpec</CODE> data type.<P>
 <B>volume  </B>See <B>amplitude, speech volume.<A NAME=MARKER-2-47></A></B><P>
 <B>Volumes control panel  </B>A subpanel of the Sound control panel that allows the user to select volumes. See also <B>Alert Sounds control panel, Sound In control panel, Sound Out control panel.</B><P>
 <B>VOX recording</B>  A feature that allows sound recording only when the sound to be recorded exceeds a certain amplitude.<P>
 <B>VOX stopping</B>  A feature that stops sound recording when the sound falls below a certain amplitude.<P>
 <B>wave amplitude</B>  The height of a sound wave at an instant of time. Compare <B>amplitude.</B><P>
 <B>waveform</B>  The shape of a wave (a graph of a wave's amplitude over time).<P>
 <B>wavelength</B>  The extent of one complete cycle of a wave.<P>
 <B>wave table</B>  A sequence of wave amplitudes measured at fixed intervals.<P>
 <B>wave-table data</B>  Any set of values that represent a sound by a wave table.<P>
