/*File: CDROMDriveCheck.cWhat's this?An MPW c tool that checks to see which SCSI IDs are AppleCD SC drives.  Itmakes a status call(97) to the AppleCD SC driver (only works with this driver).  On exit from the status call, the byte at csParam+1 contains a bit field with bits 7 - 0 corresponding to SCSI IDs 7 - 0.  That is, a value of 10000010 means there are two AppleCD SCs attached, with SCSI IDs 7 and 1.Code notes:As the Blue …yster Cult says, I'm making a career of evil:  the refnum is hard-coded, which would cause Clarus to commence to bitin' on my kneecaps (dogcows aren't very tall) were s/he to find out.Further references:Apple CD SCª Developers Guide, Revised Edition, Macintosh CD-ROM device driver status calls section.
