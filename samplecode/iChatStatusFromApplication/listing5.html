&quot;iChatStatusFromApplication&quot; demonstrates how to use the Scripting Bridge
framework to communicate with iChat. It uses the Accessibility API to listen for
frontmost application change events, then uses the scripting bridge to set the
user's status message and icon to represent what application they are currently
using. The user's status message is set to &quot;Using Safari&quot; if Safari is the
frontmost application, for example.  It also presents the user with a &quot;Join
Chat&quot; button that, when clicked, uses the scripting bridge to ask iChat to join
a specific AIM chat room (&quot;ichatstatus&quot;).  You could use this or similar
techniques to, for example, allow users of an application to join a discussion
or support AIM chat room for that app.

&quot;iChatStatusFromApplication&quot; requires that &quot;Enable access for assistive
devices&quot; be enabled in your Universal Access preferences in order to listen for
active-application-changed events. It is worth noting that turning on &quot;Enable
access for assistive devices&quot; is not a requirement for using the Scripting
Bridge framework with iChat.


Building the Sample
1. Create a new project.
&quot;iChatStatusFromApplication&quot; is a Cocoa application. Open Xcode, choose File &gt;
New Project and select Cocoa Application under application in the New Project
Assistant window. Click Next and save the project as iChatStatusFromApplication.

2. Add the Scripting Bridge framework to your project.
Open the Frameworks and Libraries group in the Groups &amp; Files list of the
project window and then right-click or control-click on the Linked Frameworks
subgroup. Choose Add &gt; Existing Frameworks from the pop-up menu and navigate to
the /System/Library/Frameworks/ folder to select and add the
ScriptingBridge.framework to your project.

3. Add the minimum system version Info.plist key
This project uses the Scripting Bridge framework that is only available in Mac
OS X 10.5 and later. Set the LSMinimumSystemVersion to 10.5 so users can receive
notices informing them about the minimum system requirement when they attempt to
run the application on a system earlier than Mac OS X 10.5. 
Double-click the Info.plist file in the resource area of the project and copy
and paste the following lines into the file. 
    &lt;key&gt;LSMinimumSystemVersion&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;10.5&lt;/string&gt;

4. Set the Target SDK to Mac OS X 10.5
Double-click the iChatStatusFromApplication project icon in the Groups &amp; Files
list. When the project info window appears, go to the General tab and set the
&quot;Cross-Develop Using Target SDK&quot; to Mac OS X 10.5. 


5. Create iChat header file
Open the Terminal application and run the following command:
        sdef /Applications/iChat.app | sdp -fh --basename iChat

You should see an iChat.h file in your working directory. Drag and drop iChat.h
into the Other Sources group in your Xcode project window. Check &quot;Copy items
into destination group's folder (if needed)&quot; in the ensuing dialog. 

6. Create the ISFAController&rsquo;s class files
Select File &gt; New File and click Objective-C class under Cocoa in the New File
Assistant window. Name the file ISFAController and check the &quot;Also create...&quot;
checkbox if unchecked. 

7. Add the iChat header and define a scripting bridge object in the
ISFAController.h file. See the ISFAController.h  file in this sample for its
implementation.

8. Add Scripting Bridge to the code 
the &quot;joinChatRoom&quot; method in the ISFAController.m file describes how to use the
Scripting Bridge to communicate with iChat.

9. Add code to watch for application switch events 
The &quot;registerForAppSwitchNotificationFor&quot; method in the ISFAController.m file
describes how to watch for an application switch events. It uses an
accessibility observer to pay attention to an application switch events.

10. Add code to update the current status and icon of users
The &quot;applicationSwitched&quot; method in the ISFAController.m file refreshes the
current status and icon of users in iChat and &quot;iChatStatus&quot; window.

11. Build and run the sample
Click the Build and Go toolbar item in the project window to compile and run
the sample. 


Using the Sample 
Turn on the &quot;Enable access for assistive devices&quot; (if disabled) in your
Universal Access preferences.
Open this sample in Xcode 3.0 and Mac OS X 10.5 and later. Click the Build and
Go toolbar item in the project window to compile and run the application. 

Switch to another application to see your status message and icon changed to
your frontmost application's name and icon. 
Click the &quot;Join Chat Room&quot; button to join the &quot;ichatstatus&quot; AIM chat room in
iChat. iChat will join the chat room in the same way as if you had selected to
do so manually within iChat, so all normal actions will then work - for example,
you can show/hide the participants drawer using the View &lt; Show/Hide Chat
Participants menu item, click the &quot;+&quot; button in the drawer to invite and add a
user to the chat room. 



Changes from Previous Versions
Updated sample to work with released Leopard instead of WWDC 2007 Leopard Beta.
Check if the &quot;Enable access for assistive devices&quot; feature is turned on and
warn users if it is not.
