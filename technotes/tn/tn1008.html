The Bus Specification, Revision 2.0,features a 32-bit data path -- upgradeable to 64-bits -- withsynchronous bus operation up to 33 Mhz, and the ability to transfer adata object on the raising edge of each PCI clock cycle. Assuming thatneither the initiator nor the target inserts wait states during eachdata phase, the maximum theoretical bandwidth over a 32-bit bus is 132Mbytes/second. This also assumes continuous bursting with a 32-bit dataobject transferred on each PCI clock cycle. (Apple's implementationincorporates a 32-bit data bus.</p><P>Since the IB chip competes for system memory along with other systemdevices, continuous PCI bursting is not possible. Therefore, theachievable PCI bandwidth on Power Macintosh computers -- a significantimprovement from NuBus -- will be less than the PCI theoretical maximum.Also, the bandwidth will be dependent on the PCI target's hardwaredesign and the architecture of the driver software.</p><P>A PCI burst transfer is defined by one PCI bus transaction with a signaladdress phase followed by two or more data phases. One may ask, how canthe bus master transfer a data object on each PCI clock cycle? Toinitiate a bus transaction, the PCI master only has to arbitrate forownership of the bus one time. The master then issues the start addressand transaction type during the address phase. It's the responsibilityof the target device to latch the start address into an address counterand increment the addressing from data phase to data phase. (Asingle-beat read or write transaction is defined by a signal addressphase followed by only one data phase..</p><P>For data to be transferred between the PowerPC Processor and the PCITarget, or for the PCI Target to transfer data between system memory,one of the following commands is initiated, as shown in Table 1.</p><center><img src="images/tn1008_003.gif" alt="" width=329 height=182><BR><P><b>Table 1.</b> Commands between PowerPC Processor and PCI Bus</P></center><BR><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=550><TR><td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><P><B>Note:</B><BR>The I/O Read and I/O Write commands are used to transfer databetween the Processor and the Target's I/O space.</P></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><BR><p>The Configuration Read and Configuration Write commands are used totransfer data between the Processor and the PCI target's Configurationregisters during system initialization.</p><p>The Memory Read and Memory Write commands are used to transfer databetween the PCI Master and the Target's memory space.</p><p>The Memory Read Line command is used by the PCI Master to transfer acache line of data from the PCI Target's memory space.</p><p>The Memory Read Multiple command is used by the PCI Master totransfer more than one cache line of data from the PCI Target's memoryspace.</p><p>The Memory Write and Invalidate command is used by the PCI Master totransfer one or more complete cache lines of data to the PCI Target's memory space.</p><BR><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=550><TR><td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><P><B>Note:</B><BR>A cache line is 32-bytes for Apple Power Macintosh computers.</P></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><BR><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><a name="RTFToC2"></a><h2>About the PowerPC Processor and PCI Commands</h2><P>Now with the basics of the PCI bus under our belt, let's move on toimportant details regarding PCI Power Macintosh computers. The PowerPCprocessor has a 64-bit data bus and its system memory space defaults towrite back cache mode, while the PCI bus is 32-bits wide and the PPCprocessor sets PCI address space to cache inhibit mode. For PPCinitiated read and write transactions between PCI memory space, the IBchip (the PowerPC Processor to PCI Bridge) will initiate basically oneof the three following types of PCI commands:</p><ol>	<li>a single-beat Memory Read or Write command; </li>	<li>a Memory Read or Write command with two data phases -- defined as a burst transaction; and</li>	<li>a Memory Read Line or Memory Write and Invalidate command that bursts a 32-byte cache line.  </li></ol><BR><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=550><TR><td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><P><B>IMPORTANT:</B><BR>The PPC processor will not burst to or from address space marked cache inhibited. Therefore, under default cache settings, the IB chip will not initiate the Memory Read Line or Memory Write and Invalidate commands to a PCI target.</P></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><BR><P>As per the PCI Specification Revision 2.0, PCI Power Macintosh Computers support PCI I/O space. PCI I/O commands and Mac OS services available for them are addressed later in this Technote.</p><P>With the basics of the PCI bus described and details of the Power Macintosh PCI implementation outlined, this should be ample background to describe the functionality of the IB chip. In particular, under what circumstance will it perform what type of PCI command?</p><h3>Bursting from PowerPC to PCI</h3><P>Provided software is written to utilize floating-point load and store instructions -- as opposed to integer operations -- the IB chip will burst a two-beat Memory Read or Memory Write command (two 4-byte data phases with one PCI transaction). The PowerPC floating-point data is 8-bytes wide and integer data is 4-bytes. Utilizing floating-point instructions in effect nearly doubles the PCI bandwidth over single-beat PCI Memory Read or Write commands. This is worth investigating for solutions where the PCI hardware does not support cache line bursting.</p><P>If the PCI target's address space is set to write thru cache mode, the IB chip will perform an eight-beat burst read on PCI with the Memory Read Line command. This translates to a cache line, eight 4-byte long words, i.e. 32-bytes.</p><P>If the PCI target's address space is set to write back cache mode, the IB chip will perform an eight-beat burst write on PCI with the Memory Write and Invalidate command.</p><BR><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=550><TR><td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><P><B>IMPORTANT:</B><BR>Extreme care must be taken for burst writes to PCI address space to perform appropriate cache flushing.</P></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><BR><h3>Bursting from PCI to PowerPC </h3><P>If the address is aligned on an 8-byte boundary, the IB chip will respond to PCI Memory Read and Memory Write commands by a two-beat PCI transaction to align two 32-bit PCI data words to the 64-bit PowerPC bus. On non-8-byte-aligned addresses, single-beat transactions are implemented.</p><P>The PCI Memory Write and Invalidate command will perform an 8-beat transaction if the address is aligned on a 32-byte boundary.</p><P>The PCI Memory Read Line or Memory Read Multiple commands will perform an eight-beat transaction if the address is aligned to an address less than or equal to 8-bytes less than the next 32-byte boundary. The PCI Memory Read Line and Memory Read Multiple commands are treated the same by the IB chip, in either case the IB chip will disconnect after an eight-beat transaction -- one 32-byte cache line.</p><BR><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=550><TR><td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><P><B>Note:</B><BR>Keep in mind that the main memory space is set to write back cache mode.</P></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><BR><P>As mentioned earlier, 132 Mbytes/sec is the maximum theoretical bandwidth across a 32-bit PCI bus at 33 Mhz.

It's important to mention first that for second generation PCI Power Macintosh Computers, there is a new PCI driver environment -- or I/O architecture -- available in the reference release Mac OS version 7.5.2. Refer to <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.apple.com/devworld/Technical_Documentation/PCI_Information/Designing_PCI_Cards_-_Driv.sit"> Designing PCI Cards and Drivers for Power Macintosh Computers</A>.</p><P>With this reference release OS, Apple starts to separate between APIs (Application Programming Services) and SPI (System Programming Services). In this present Mac OS release and the future direction, such as Copland, APIs and toolbox services are no longer available to driver SW. The Mac OS version 7.5.2 provides a DSL (Driver Services Library) that implements all SPI services available for drivers; documented in <cite>Designing PCI Cards and Drivers for Power Macintosh Computers</cite>, Chapter 9.</p><P>To coordinate I/O operations that transfer buffers between system memory and PCI address space, the Macintosh OS provides two functions with the DSL (Driver Services Library): <code>PrepareMemoryForIO</code>, and <code>CheckpointIO</code>.  The <code>PrepareMemoryForIO</code> function allocates resident system memory to buffers, provides logical and physical address information, and in conjunction with <code>CheckpointIO</code> manages coherency between system memory and the PowerPC caches. <code>CheckpointIO</code> is called after the buffer transfer is complete and either relinquishes the memory back to the OS and adjusts the processor caches for coherency, or prepares for another IO transfer.</p><BR><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=550><TR><td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><P><B>IMPORTANT:</B><BR><code>PrepareMemoryForIO</code> should not be confused with PCI<br>I/O space. It is for buffers whether they are located in PCI memory or PCI I/O space. </P></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><BR><P><code>PrepareMemoryForIO</code> is an example of a service in the DSL; PCI cards that have DMA hardware should use <code>PrepareMemoryForIO</code> to locate physical addresses in system memory.  Older I/O expansion cards would typically use a toolbox call <code>GetPhysical</code> to locate physical addresses in system memory. To be fully compatible with the present and future Mac OS releases, drivers should only use SPI services. Again, this is fully documented in <cite>Designing PCI Cards and Drivers for Power Macintosh Computers</cite>.</p><P>Remembering that PCI address space defaults to cache inhibit mode, to enable the PowerPC to burst to areas of PCI memory space, that area must be set to cacheable setting. This can be done with the <code>SetProcessorCacheMode</code> (see chapter 9 in <cite>Designing PCI Cards and Drivers for Power Macintosh</cite> Computers). Set the desired PCI address space to <code>kProcessorCacheModeCopyBack</code> for cache line writes and <code>kProcessorCacheModeWriteThrough</code> for cache line reads.</p><BR><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=550><TR><td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><P><B>IMPORTANT:</B><BR>Extreme care must be taken for burst writes to PCI address space to perform appropriate cache flushing.</P></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><BR><P>Be advised that the <code>SetProcessorCacheMode</code> has an undocumented limitation.  The PowerPC address space is divided into sixteen 256-Mbyte segments that are distinguished by the upper 4-bits of the effective address. The <code>SetProcessorCacheMode</code> is only capable of changing the cache setting for one contiguous section of memory per 256-Mbyte segment. Therefore, if two PCI cards are configured where they both have PCI address assignments in the same segment only one card can change its address space cache setting.</p><P>As an example, if two cards (card x and card y) have addresses mapped into segment 8, one at 0x80800000 and another at 0x80801000, the first call to <code>SetProcessorCacheMode</code> from the driver of card x to make a cacheable address space in segment 8 will work. A second call, say from the driver of card y, to modify the cache setting in segment 8 will not work nor will it report an error. This scenario will most likely result in a lower than expected performance for card y, because card y address space is actually cache inhibited which disables PCI transactions of 32-byte cache lines. If the two cards are mapped into different segments, such as 8 and A, then they both can modify the cache settings within their perspective segments. This limitation will be relaxed in the future.</p><P>Extensions to the <code>BlockMove</code> routine have been incorporated in the DSL that optimizes performance on the PowerPC CPU family. In particular, <code>BlockMoveData</code> has been optimized for data that is cacheable and <code>BlockMoveDataUncached</code> for data that is cache inhibited. The difference between the cached and uncached versions of these instructions is that, for <code>BlockMoveData</code>, the PPC <code>dcbz</code> instruction is used to avoid the logically unnecessary read of the destination cache blocks. <code>BlockMoveDataUncached</code> does not use the <code>dcbz</code> instruction because <code>dcbz</code> is extremely slow for address space marked cache inhibited or cache write thru.</p><P>Table 4 lists the different BlockMove functions provided in the DSL</p><CENTER><img src="images/tn1008_006.gif" alt="" width=327 height=190><br><P><b>Table 4.</b> BlockMove functions provided in the DSL</p></center><P>The difference between <code>BlockMove</code> and <code>BlockMoveData</code> versions is whether or not the block being moved contains 68K instructions. If the data does contain 68K instructions <code>BlockMove</code> must be called which also flushes the DR (Dynamic Recompilation) Emulator's cache. This is costly time-wise, so if the block does not contain 68K instructions, be sure to use <code>BlockMoveData</code> or <code>BlockMoveDataUncached</code>. Also with performance in mind, when appropriate the <code>BlockMove</code> routines will align the source and destination address to utilize floating-point load and store instructions.</p><P>To summarize the <code>BlockMove</code> routines, for transfers of large buffers between PCI cards the <code>MoveBlockData</code> or <code>BlockMoveDataUncached</code> functions should be used, depending if the destination address space is marked write back cacheable or not. Furthermore, PCI drivers most likely will not need to consider the non-Data variant of the <code>BlockMove</code> routines because destination buffers either in PCI address space or system memory will probably not need to execute 68K code.</p><P>A common question from PCI developers is, how to initiate a PCI burst of a cache line? Provided the PCI address space is marked cacheable as explained earlier, the <code>BockMoveData</code> function will force the IB chip to burst 32-byte cache lines -- eight-beat data phases per PCI command transaction.</p><P>To read or write PCI I/O space, the Expansion Bus Manager provides routines to transfer data -- byte, word, or long word (8, 16, or 32 bits, respectively) -- using PCI I/O Read and I/O Write commands. The Expansion Bus Manager is part of the ROM firmware in PCI Power Macintosh CPUs. These routines also perform appropriate byte swapping. For a further description, refer to <cite>Designing PCI Cards and Drivers for Power Macintosh Computers</cite>, chapter 10. PCI cards that are limited to I/O space, and do not incorporate PCI memory space, are limited to PCI I/O Read and I/O Write commands to transfer data between the PPC and PCI target. If PCI I/O data needs to be processed quickly, note there is a significant performance hit using Expansion Manager Routines. These routines are intended for PCI targets that have I/O registers or low bandwidth I/O buffers. The IB chip does not burst PCI I/O Read nor burst PCI I/O Write commands.</p><P>As described in chapter 10 of <cite>Designing PCI Cards and Drivers for Power Macintosh Computers</cite> along with sample code, the PCI property "assigned-addresses" provides vector entries that represent physical addresses on PCI cards. Using the "APPL,address" property a driver can locate a logical address of a physical I/O resource. By accessing the logical I/O address the IB chip will generate the appropriate PCI I/O command. Therefore a driver can generate PCI I/O commands without using the Expansion Bus Manager Routines; the same way it accesses PCI memory space. This provides the fastest way to access I/O space, but note it does not perform byte swapping as the Expansion Bus Manager routines.</p><P>Also note, the Expansion Bus Manager provides OS services to generate PCI Configuration Read, Configuration Write, Interrupt Acknowledge, and Special Cycle commands.</p><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><a name="RTFToC4"></a><h2>Summary</h2><P>The PCI bus on Power Macintosh computers delivers higher I/O performance along with lower costs and complexity from the previous NuBus architecture.  PCI also represents an emerging standard in the desktop PC industry. To maximize bus performance, utilize the services available in the Driver Services Library, and pay close attention to PCI chip selection -- in particular, chips that can execute cache line burst transactions with Memory Read Line, Memory Read Multiple, and Memory Write and Invalidate commands.
