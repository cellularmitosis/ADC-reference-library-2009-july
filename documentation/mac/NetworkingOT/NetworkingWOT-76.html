<H1>About PAP</H1>
 The <B>Printer Access Protocol (PAP)</B> is an asymmetrical connection-oriented transactionless protocol that enables communication between client and server endpoints, allowing multiple connections at both ends. PAP uses ATP packets to transport the data once a connection is open to the server.<P>
 PAP is the protocol that ImageWriter and LaserWriter printers in the AppleTalk environment use for printing. You use PAP when the workstation sends a print job directly to a printer connected to the network or when you send it to a print spooler, which in turn uses PAP to send it to the printer. Open Transport PAP provides a single protocol implementation that is integrated into the AppleTalk protocol stack. <P>
 <A HREF=#MARKER-9-21>Figure 18-1</A> shows how a PAP endpoint provider encompasses its underlying delivery protocol and link-access STREAMS modules.<P>

<IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "graphics/OTPA-L-01.gif"><P>
 One of the unique features of PAP is its ability to determine which connection request to honor when there are several requests outstanding at the same time. At any time a PAP server endpoint can receive requests to open a connection from different client endpoints. For example, a printer server is available on a network to many workstations, several of which can send data to the printer at any time. PAP uses an<A NAME=MARKER-13-22></A> arbitration scheme to allow a server to accept a connection with the workstation that has been waiting the longest for a connection. The scheme works this way: <P>
<OL>
<P><LI>A PAP server receives a connection request but delays granting it for a predefined length of time (nominally 2 seconds). This default time period is implementation specific and is defined in <I>Inside AppleTalk</I>, second edition.
<P><LI>The PAP server accumulates any additional connection requests that come in from other endpoints during that time period.
<P><LI>At end of the time period, the PAP server obtains the wait time from each workstation endpoint requesting a connection. The workstations track the amount of elapsed time spent waiting for access to the server. For example, if a workstation client has to try several times to connect to a busy LaserWriter, the workstation continues to track the total time since the first connection attempt and reports that amount to the LaserWriter on every subsequent connection attempt. 
<P><LI>The PAP server then grants the request of the workstation that has waited the longest.<P>
</OL>
