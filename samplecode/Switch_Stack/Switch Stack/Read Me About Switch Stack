Read Me About Switch Stack1.0.1This sample demonstrates how to switch to a private stack correctly.  The code is particularly useful for interrupt time programs that need a guaranteed amount of stack space.The sample compiles for 68K only.  Doing this in PPC code is somewhat trickier.Packing ListThe sample contains the following items:• Read Me About Switch Stack — This document• Switch Stack.c — Source to the sample• Switch Stack.r — Source to the sample’s resources.• Switch Stack.π.rsrc — A compiled version of the above.• Switch Stack CW.π — A CodeWarrior project for the sample.• Switch Stack CW — A compiled version of the above.• Switch Stack MPW.make — A MPW make file for the sample.• Switch Stack MPW — A compiled version of the above.• Switch Stack.π  — A Think C project for the sample.• Switch Stack THINK — A compiled version of the above.Credits and Version HistoryIf you find any problems with this sample, mail <DevSupport@apple.com> with “Attn: Quinn” as the first line of your mail and I’ll try to fix them up.1.0 (Oct 1993 — May 1995) Jim Luther — I've grouped all previous versions of this sample under version 1.0.
