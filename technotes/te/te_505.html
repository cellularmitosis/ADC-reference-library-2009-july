It seems to be filling up with font-related resources. What's causingthis to happen?</p>___<P>Your application is probably calling <code>RealFont</code> for each font installed in thesystem. Trying to build lists of font information at startup nearly alwaysballoons the system heap to enormous sizes if you have lots of fonts.</p><p>When you call <code>RealFont</code>, the system must load the <code>FOND</code> resource and walk throughthe association table to see if there's a bitmap for it. If there's a TrueTypefont, the Font Manager loads the <code>'sfnt'</code> resource and examines it. A valueinside TrueType fonts says "I don't render smaller than this resolution"; ifthe requested resolution is smaller than that value, <code>RealFont</code> returns FALSEeven on a TrueType font. For most of Apple's TrueType fonts the value is about6 points - calling <code>RealFont</code>(2, Helvetica) will return FALSE.</p><p>So the system is loading every <code>FOND</code> and <code>'sfnt'</code> looking to see whether the fontsare real. The main solution is not to call <code>RealFont</code> until you're sure you needthe information. For example, don't outline Size menus until just beforethey're accessed or until a new font is chosen, to prevent this kind ofproblem.</p><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></p><h2>Embedding fonts in applications</h2><P>Date Written:   2/3/93</p><P>Last reviewed: 7/2/93</p><p>We're planning to distribute a custom font with our application, by includingthe <code>FOND</code> and <code>NFNT</code> resources in its resource fork. Are there any problems wemight be overlooking by using this technique?</p>___<P>There are things you must be aware of when embedding fonts in applications.First, no ID conflict resolution is done. Since the system caches some fontsfor performance reasons, if your font has the ID of a font in the system, youcan't predict whether you'll get your font or the system's font. Second, youmust use <code>NFNT</code> instead of <code>FONT</code> resources for bitmap fonts, or the system willsometimes get the wrong font strike. This is described in the MacintoshTechnical Note <A HREF = "te_21.html">"Fond of FONDs"</a> (Text 21). You should never try to override afont in the System file with one in your application; the name of your customfont should be different from all other font names. If you don't want your fontto show up in menus, give it a name beginning with a period or "%" so that<code>AddResMenu</code> will ignore it.</p><p>While most printer drivers and the system take pains to find fonts whereverthey may be, some software components don't, and we can't promise this willwork with all printers or all software. While installing fonts in anapplication should work for most purposes, it's preferable all around for you(and your customers) to install your fonts in the system. Of course, you shouldalways ask for your font by name in your code.</p><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></p><h2>Macintosh fonts that are likely to be available</h2><P>Date Written:  2/3/93</p><P>Last reviewed:  5/4/93</p><p>Starting with system software version 6.0.5, are there certain fonts that areguaranteed available regardless of the language system running? I'm hoping thatGeneva 9, Geneva 12, and Chicago 12 will always be available for my cdev.</p>___<P>There's no such thing as a guaranteed font. Since fonts are simply resources inthe System file or in the Fonts folder, users <i>can</i> remove or replace themwith different ones if they're sufficiently determined to. Apple makes noguarantee that the system will work if these fonts are removed; nevertheless,their removal is possible.</p><p>There are resources in the System file that tell both Font/DA Mover and theSystem 7 Finder not to show specific fonts so the users can't easily removethem without a resource editor. Font/DA Mover's resource is of type <code>FRSV</code> andcontains font IDs that correspond to Chicago 12, Geneva 9, Geneva 12, andMonaco 9. The System 7 resource type is <code>'resf'</code>; it contains font names andpoint sizes (so as not to rely on ID numbers) and it also protects Chicago 12,Geneva 9, Geneva 12, and Monaco 9. Chicago 12 is usually in ROM as well, soit's a lot harder to remove.</p><p>So you have a pretty decent chance that these four fonts are available. Even ifthey're not, though, you'll get <i>some</i> font, so that text will draw evenif it doesn't fit in the space you've provided. Be careful about extremelytight text spaces--it makes it a lot harder to localize your products sincenon-English text can expand by an average of 50 percent.</p><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></p><h2>Chicago Control-Q prints propeller or clover symbol</h2><P>Date Written:  7/4/90</p><P>Last reviewed:  6/14/93</p><p>How do I get the character that represents the clover used for Command-keyequivalents in documents and in menus?</p>___<P>This key is documented in the Apple Style Guide, which is available on thelatest <i>Developer CD Series</i> disc as well as from APDA. One little featureof Key Caps which is not widely known is the Control key (not the Command orOption keys). Pressing the Control key in Chicago shows that Control-Q inChicago maps to the propeller symbol for which you search. Control-Q generatesthe character code 17; the standard Macintosh character set (see <i>InsideMacintosh</i> Volume VI, page 12-5) specifies this symbol for it.</p><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></p><h2>Determining Macintosh system font size</h2><P>Date Written:  2/11/91</p><P>Last reviewed:  8/1/92</p><p>How does a program determine the default system font size?</p>___<P>If you want to know the default system font size, use the <code>GetDefFontSize</code> call<i>(Inside Macintosh</i> Volume V, page 314). This call will return the truedefault system font size. On all Roman systems the <code>sysFontSize</code> low-memoryglobal is always zero by default; this means that it's actually 12. Don't askme why they did this, but it's true, so you should use the call if you want apainless method of obtaining this information. Try to avoid reading the globaldirectly.</p><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></p><h2>FScaleDisable and Macintosh screen rendering</h2><P>Date Written:  6/4/91</p><P>Last reviewed:  8/1/92</p><p>What is the current interface guideline on font scaling? Should we set<code>FScaleDisable</code> to true or false for screen rendering? I believe the oldguideline was to set it to true (thus disabling font scaling) so that if youhave a 23 pt screen font you will see 12 pt glyphs with 23 pt widths. We wantperformance on Apple's low-end machines, and we don't want to make this a userpreference.</p>___<P>Most applications now set <code>FScaleDisable</code> to false all the time. If you areworried about the speed degradation in your application when running on slowerMacintosh systems, you could have your software identify which Mac it isrunning on using <code>Gestalt</code>, <code>SysEnvirons</code>, etc., and then set <code>FScaleDisable</code> to trueonly on the slow machines. From the purely interface point of view,"what-you-see-is-what-you-get" is best, if processor speed allows it.</p><p>With TrueType there is no issue, since <code>FScaleDisable</code> doesn't have any effect onan outline font.</p><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></p><h2>Five font style-mapping table styles</h2><P>Date Written:  6/17/91</p><P>Last reviewed:  6/14/93</p><p>Why is "47" the bounds of the indexes' array in the StyleTable?</p>___<P>The style-mapping tables, which are used for mapping of a font style to aparticular font for printing, have only five possible styles, unlike the sixscreen styles (underline is omitted, since a laser printer just explicitlydraws a line under the string--it doesn't need a special font for that). Youcan have any combination of these five styles, EXCEPT that you can't have"Condense" and "Extend" at the same time (Condensed Extended wouldn't make awhole lot of sense). Thus you get (combinatorics come back to haunt us) 48possible unique styles to map to.</p><p>X-Ref:</p><P>Snippet <A HREF = "downloads/Stylemap.sea.hqx">"StyleMap"</a> on the Developer CD.</p><P>LaserWriter Reference, Chapter 2, "Working with Fonts," (Addison-Wesley; APDA#M7073, $19.95).</p><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></p><h2>System 7 and modified fonts</h2><P>Date Written:  6/21/91</p><P>Last reviewed:  6/14/93</p><p>We ship modified versions of the Chicago and Geneva fonts and their <code>FOND</code>s inour application's resource fork. With System 6, when we ask for font 0 or font3, we get our modified fonts in windows, buttons, menus and dialogs, but notwith System 7. Is there a new way to tell System 7 to use my version of Chicago12 to display all system related stuff?</p>___<P>What's happened is that the system software is being much more strict aboutwhose "Chicago" it uses for menus and dialogs. The Menu and Control Managersnow only look at the system file for the Chicago they use.</p><p>There are a couple of ways to get around this: First, you can try patching<code>DrawString</code> right before calling <code>MenuSelect</code> in your program. The patch wouldselect your Chicago and then jump to the standard <code>DrawString</code>. After <code>MenuSelect</code>,remove the patch. The disadvantage of this method is that, if a future systemsoftware release doesn't use <code>DrawString</code> for drawing menus, the patch wouldcease to have any effect.</p><p>A better solution is to write your own menu and control definition code--inother words, your own custom MDEF and CDEFs. The way you typically do this isto get a copy of the standard Macintosh system's MDEF or CDEF, and alter it toyour specifications. In your case, this would be merely selecting your fontinstead of the system font. Name your font something other than Chicago andjust select that font by name in the menu or control's draw routine. TheControl and Menu Manager chapters in <i>Inside Macintosh</i> Volume I have moreinformation on writing custom definitions. There is only one problem with thisright now: While the System 6 MDEF and CDEF are available on AppleLink, theSystem 7 versions are not available yet, although they will be soon.</p><p>A note on the use of Chicago in your application: As the June 1991 edition ofthe Macintosh Technical Note <A HREF = "te_02.html">"Font Family Numbers"</a> mentions, fonts arecopyrighted material. Apple owns the Chicago font and typeface, so be sure youcheck into licensing issues before releasing any version, altered or unaltered,with your application.</p><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></p><h2>Spanish typographic measurements</h2><P>Date Written:  12/10/91</p><P>Last reviewed:  8/1/92</p><p>What typographical measurement issues must be considered for Spanish systems?Do the Spanish specify type in ciceros and didots instead of points?</p>___<P>If typesetting is done in Spain with computers, U.S. standards generally areused. It is only when typesetting is done the old-fashioned way that you'll seedifferent measurements.</p><p>Paper sizes are different. In Spain DIN-44 (210 x 297), DIN-A3 (420 x 297) and"folio" (215 x 315) are used. As always, you'll be working with 72 dpi for thescreen (and any time you use QuickDraw) but something different on paper, soyou'll need to use <code>PrGeneral</code> and image the stuff yourself to a resolution thatallows you control over your imaging for printing. This is detailed in thearticle, "Meet PrGeneral, the Trap That Makes the Most of the PrintingManager," in issue #3 of <i>develop.</i></P><P>Here are the measurements used in Spain:</p><ul type="disc">	<li>Decimal point (Didot) (0.3759 mm)</li>	<li>Millimeter</li>	<li>Cicero (12 decimal points)</li>	<li>Centimeter</li>	<li>Inches</li></ul><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></p><h2>SetOutlinePreferred = TRUE or not?</h2><P>Date Written:  12/2/91</p><P>Last reviewed:  6/14/93</p><p>My application calls <code>SetOutlinePreferred</code> so that TrueType fonts are used ifboth bitmapped and TrueType fonts are in the system. It was reported to me,however, that some international TrueType fonts look really bad at small pointsizes on the screen. Should I avoid calling this function?</p>___<P><code>SetOutlinePreferred</code> is best used as a user-selectable option. Along the samelines, you might want to include the <code>SetPreserveGlyph</code> call <i>(InsideMacintosh</i> Volume VI, page 12-21)--again, as a user-selectable option.</p><p>Currently, the default for <code>outlinePreferred</code> is FALSE for compatibility reasons(existing documents don't get reflowed if the bitmapped fonts are still around)and for aesthetic and performance reasons (users are free to maintain bitmappedfonts in the smaller point sizes if the TrueType version isn't satisfying forsmall sizes or is too slow). On the other hand, as soon as a bitmapped font isunavailable for a requested point size, and a TrueType font is present, theTrueType font is used even with <code>outlinePreferred</code> = FALSE. Setting<code>outlinePreferred</code> = TRUE makes a difference only for point sizes where abitmapped font strike is present along with an <code>'sfnt'</code> in the same family.</p><p>TrueType fonts might be preferable even for small point sizes if linearlyscaled character widths are more important than screen rendering: if the mainpurpose of a program is preprint processing for a high-resolution outputdevice, outlinePreferred = TRUE may give better line layout results on theprinter, at the price of "not so great" type rendering on a 72 dpi screen. (Anexample of the conflict between linearly scaled TrueType and nonlinearly scaledbitmapped fonts is Helvetica: <code>StringWidth</code>('Lilli') returns 19 for the 12-pointbitmapped font, and 15 for the 13-point size from TrueType!)</p><p>All this boils down to the recommendation stated initially: the user should begiven the flexibility to decide whether to use the existing bitmaps (usingTrueType only for bigger point sizes and high-resolution printers), or to gowith TrueType even if the result on the screen is not optimal. (By the way,it's likely that TrueType development will substantially reduce this conflictin the future.)</p><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></p><h2>FontRec fontType field and determining monospaced fonts</h2><P>Date Written:  1/13/92</P><P>Last reviewed:  6/14/93</p><p>How can I tell whether a font is monospaced or proportional? The <code>FontRec</code>record's fontType field doesn't correctly tell me whether the font is fixedwidth as <i>Inside Macintosh</i> Volume V says it should. All system fontsappear to have the same fontType regardless of whether they're fixed orproportional. Currently I test whether the width of the characters "m" and "i"are equal and if they are, I consider the font to be fixed width. Is there aneasier (and faster!) way?</p>___<P>The Font Manager documentation is not explicit enough about the fact that bit13 (0x2000) of the <code>fontType</code> field is useless. The Font Manager doesn't checkthe setting of this bit, nor does QuickDraw (or any printer driver). As youobserved, monospaced fonts like Monaco or Courier don't have the bit set; thebit is meaningless. In addition, the <code>fontType</code> field is available only for<code>'FONT'</code> and <code>'NFNT'</code> resources; it does not exist in <code>'sfnt'</code> resources, and youwould have to check separately for the resource type of the font. Your idea ofcomparing the widths of "m" and "i" (or any other characters that are extremelyunlikely to have the same widths in a proportionally spaced font) is indeed theonly reasonable way of figuring out whether a font is monospaced.</p><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></p><h2>Getting global width table for a font specification</h2><P>Date Written:  4/22/92</P><P>Last reviewed:  6/14/93</p><p>What's the fastest way to get the width table for a given font? <code>FontMetrics</code> istoo slow, especially in color. Is there any other call that will get the globalwidth table set up correctly? That is all that we need from the call to<code>FontMetrics</code>.</p>___<P><code>FontMetrics</code> does not have much overhead in setting up the width table. It doesa dummy <code>DrawChar</code>(' '); this is very rapidly transformed into a call to StdText,and StdText immediately calls <code>StdTxMeas</code>. The first thing <code>StdTxMeas</code> does is toset up the input parameters for a <code>FMSwapFont</code> call and call it. <code>FMSwapFont</code> isthe heart of the Font Manager, and does all the work. It comes back with the<code>FMOutput</code> record, the font strike, and the width table. From there, <code>FontMetrics</code>derives the values it needs to bring back.</p><p>You probably wouldn't save much more than 1/1000th of a second if, instead ofcalling <code>FontMetrics</code>, you called <code>FMSwapFont</code> explicitly yourself--our onlyalternative suggestion.</p><p>The Font Manager does quite a lot of caching (up to 12 width tables), andmanaging the cache takes some cycles, too. If there is nothing in the cachecorresponding to the font request, the cache makes the call even slower than itwould be without cache.</p><p>The next source of overhead is the Resource Manager. Looking for a specificfont involves going through the whole resource chain first for the <code>FOND</code> (ifnone is found, the search restarts for a FONT), and then, based on the FOND'sfont association table, for a <code>NFNT</code> or <code>'sfnt'</code>. If no <code>NFNT</code> is found, the searchrestarts for a FONT, always through the whole resource chain. For a hugeresource fork like in the System file (and, maybe, also in your application),the time spent in the Resource Manager is not negligible--in particular, if youhave add-ons in your system (such as INITs or 'cdev's) that patch out ResourceManager calls, maybe several times, and usually slow it down considerably!</p><p>Even in case this hurdle is overcome swiftly (after all, the Resource Managerhas its own caching scheme for optimization), the next step necessarily takessome time, and, as you have observed, especially on a color system: It consistsof actually providing the bitmap for the font strike. If the screen depth is&gt;1, this involves creating "synthetic" fonts for the correct screen depth,to optimize text drawing. Also, if the font is an outline font, the first timea font strike has to be rasterized is quite costly in terms of machinecycles.</p><p>Finally, the width table can be created; and, because of the scaling factorsinvolved, this requires 256 times some arithmetic which is known never to befast enough.</p><p>All this certainly gives us an understanding for the time it takes <code>FMSwapFont</code>(<code>FontMetrics</code>) to get the job done, but it does not solve your problem.</p><p>Depending on how predictable the usage of fonts and width tables in yourapplication is, you might consider building kind of a database of width tablesbeforehand, or along the way, and use this information directly from withinyour application. There is no shortcut at all through the Resource Manager toget at the font resources, and there is no shortcut within <code>FMSwapFont</code>, like notbuilding the font bitmaps. (To the best of my knowledge, the needbits field inthe <code>FMInput</code> record does <i>not</i> have this effect.) The only obvious way toget width tables faster is to keep them around, and to extend "manually" thecapacity of the Font Manager's cache of width tables.</p><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></p><h2>SetFractEnable and recalculating width tables</h2><P>Date Written:  5/5/92</P><P>Last reviewed:  6/14/93</p><p>Calling <code>SetFractEnable</code> seems to force the width tables to be recalculatedregardless of the setting of the low-memory global <code>FractEnable</code>. We're callingthis routine at a central entry point for any document, as it's adocument-by-document attribute. We then unconditionally call<code>SetFractEnable</code>(false) on exit back to the event loop, to be nice to otherapplications. Calling <code>SetFractEnable</code>(false) seems to trigger the recalculationeven though FractEnable is false. What's the best way to get around this?</p>___<P>Your observation is correct. The <code>SetFractEnable</code> call stuffs the <code>Boolean</code>parameter (as a single byte) into the low-memory global $BF4 andindiscriminately invalidates the cached width table by setting the 4-byte valueat $B4C (<code>LastSpExtra</code>, a Fixed value) to -1. Obviously, it wasn't anticipatedthat <code>SetFractEnable</code> could be called regularly with a parameter that oftendoesn't change the previous setting. (By the way, the same observation appliesto <code>SetFScaleDisable</code> and to <code>SetOutlinePreferred</code>).</p><p>In your case, you may want to keep track of the <code>fractEnable</code> setting in yourapplication and avoid redundant <code>SetFractEnable</code> calls. (Note that it's not agood idea to use the above insider information and poke at $BF4 and $B4C onyour own!)</p><p>You don't need to worry about other applications when resetting <code>fractEnable</code>; itbelongs to those low-memory globals that are swapped in and out during contextswitches to other applications.</p><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></p><h2>Corrupted Macintosh font or font suitcase criteria</h2><P>Date Written:  6/19/92</P><P>Last reviewed:  6/14/93</p><p>How can I detect whether a font suitcase is corrupted when it's opened andwhether any of the fonts in it are corrupted before any of the fonts are used?I know that the Finder is able to do this, and I was wondering whether Applegives out this information.

(This is a test for some older third-party corrupted suitcases.)</li>	<li>The <code>FOND</code> has no name.</li>	<li>The <code>FOND</code> doesn't have a valid character range; ffFirstChar has to be less than <code>ffLastChar</code>, unless it's a "dummy" <code>FOND</code> (created on the fly for old standalone <code>FONT</code>s, in which case <code>ffLastChar</code> is 0).</li>	<li>All the font association table entries aren't in ascending point size order.</li>	<li>Two font association table entries reference exactly the same point size and style.</li>	<li>The offsets to the width table, kerning table, and style mapping table are invalid and nonzero.</li>	<li>The font ID is 0 and it's not the system font.</li></ul><p>We can't promise that this list is complete, but it does contain mostconditions for which the Finder would report a suitcase as damaged.</p>         <a name="Downloads"></a>       <P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></p><h2>Downloadables</H2>                  <TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <td width=50 align=left>                  <P ALIGN=center><img src="images/acrobatsmall.gif" width=22 height=23 align=middle alt="Acrobat gif"></P>               </TD>               <td align="left">                  <P>Acrobat version of this Note (56K).</P>               </TD>               <td width=60 align=left>                  <P><A HREF="pdf/te_505.pdf">Download</A></P>               </TD>            </TR>                    </TABLE>         <BR></TD></TR></table></center><!-- begin_footer_information -->	<table width="680" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
