As explained more fully below, a drawing engine is software that supports the low-level rasterization operations required for interactive 3D rendering. To achieve interactive performance, a drawing engine is often associated with some hardware device designed specifically to accelerate the 3D rasterization process.</P><P CLASS="T1.Text1"><A NAME="pgfId=43702"> </A>QuickDraw&nbsp;3D RAVE is used internally by QuickDraw&nbsp;3D, the 3D graphics library from Apple Computer, Inc. that you can use to create, configure, render, and interact with models of three-dimensional objects. For most 3D drawing and interaction, you should use the high-level application programming interfaces provided by QuickDraw&nbsp;3D. In some cases, however, you might need to use the low-level services provided by QuickDraw&nbsp;3D RAVE.

The bibliography lists a number of standard 3D reference books that document those algorithms.</P><P CLASS="T1.Text1"><A NAME="pgfId=43867"> </A>This document begins by describing the basic capabilities of QuickDraw&nbsp;3D RAVE. Then it shows how to use some of those capabilities to find the available drawing engines, select and configure a drawing engine, and use that drawing engine to draw 3D images. The section <A HREF="qd3dravedriver.d.htm#42210" CLASS="XRef">&quot;Writing a Drawing Engine&quot;</A>, shows how to add a new drawing engine to those already available for use by QuickDraw&nbsp;3D RAVE.
