Make that your decoy movie by setting <TT CLASS="cv">SRC=&quot;Decoy.mov&quot;</TT>. QuickTime ignores the <TT CLASS="cv">SRC</TT> file if the <TT CLASS="cv">QTSRC</TT> parameter is present, and instead plays the movie indicated by <TT CLASS="cv">QTSRC</TT>.

With real-time streams, you don't send the actual file--just streams of media. QuickTime never keeps more than a few seconds of those streams in its buffers. It displays the media and immediately discards it.</P><P CLASS="Number-text"><A NAME="pgfId-16270"></A>Only very sophisticated users, equipped with packet-sniffing technology, are able to intercept and copy these data streams. It takes additional sophistication to reconstruct a movie from them. For well over 99.9% of the population, it's simply impossible.</P><P CLASS="Number-text"><A NAME="pgfId-16275"></A>The trade-off is that it takes a bit of extra effort for you to deliver QuickTime movies as real-time streams. It isn't difficult, mind you, but there are a couple of extra steps.</P><P CLASS="Number-text"><A NAME="pgfId-16276"></A>Also, by their nature real-time streams can deliver only as high quality an experience as the viewer's bandwidth permits. People on slow or unreliable connections can still receive the highest possible quality by download--they just have to wait longer. But they can't view high-bandwidth streaming content at all, and may find the quality of low-bandwidth material unacceptable.</P><P CLASS="Number-text"><A NAME="pgfId-16332"></A>Of course, streaming also has advantages that balance these drawbacks, such as the ability to jump to any point in a movie without downloading the intervening material. </P><P CLASS="Number-text"><A NAME="pgfId-16333"></A>For this and other reasons, streaming is the most common approach to copy protection. </P><P CLASS="Number-text"><A NAME="pgfId-16277"></A>For more information, see What about Streaming? and Gently down the Stream</P><UL><LI CLASS="Bullet-1"><A NAME="pgfId-16336"></A><TT CLASS="B1">&nbsp;</TT><TT CLASS="bold">	Encrypt the Media</TT></LI></UL><P CLASS="Number-text"><A NAME="pgfId-16337"></A>The traditional approach to copy protection is encryption. This is moderately effective for copy-protecting physical media, such as DVDs, and can be very effective at keeping any kind of data from being intercepted and copied by people who don't have the encryption key.</P><P CLASS="Number-text"><A NAME="pgfId-16344"></A>The problem is, you generally have to supply the encryption key to the viewer. If the viewer wants to make copies, you can't usually prevent it except by legal action.</P><P CLASS="Number-text"><A NAME="pgfId-16348"></A>QuickTime has built-in support for encryption using media keys--only viewers who have the key can view the media. It's very similar to the way you unlock QuickTime Pro's editing features. Currently, only Sorenson video has implemented media key protection as an option for their codecs.</P><P CLASS="Number-text"><A NAME="pgfId-16361"></A>Other vendors have announced near-term plans to market encryption modules for QuickTime movies that conceal the key from the viewer. These modules should provide moderate to strong protection for any QuickTime media. None are shipping as of this writing, but that could very well have changed by the time you read this. Check the websites listed in the <TT CLASS="cv">Resources.htm</TT> file on the CD for announcements.</P><UL><LI CLASS="Bullet-1"><A NAME="pgfId-16070"></A><TT CLASS="B1">&nbsp;</TT><TT CLASS="bold">	Jujitsu</TT></LI></UL><P CLASS="Number-text"><A NAME="pgfId-16073"></A>Sometimes the best answer is jujitsu; instead of fighting the force, redirect it to your benefit.
