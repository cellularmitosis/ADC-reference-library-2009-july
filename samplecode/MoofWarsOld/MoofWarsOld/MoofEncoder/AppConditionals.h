/*	File:		AppConditionals.h	Contains:	Like MoofWars, we'll define a few conditional macros that assist in configuring 				how the application actually works.  For the moment, we'll just have one, the				debugging macro.				qDebugging  -- Whether or not additional debugging code should be inserted.				With this turned on, most errors will DebugStr almost immediately and return				errors as the error propagates up the calling chain.  This is slower, but if				you've found a weird bug, this is the fastest way to replicate it.	Written by: Timothy Carroll		Copyright:	Copyright © 1996-1999 by Apple Computer, Inc., All Rights Reserved.				You may incorporate this Apple sample source code into your program(s) without				restriction.
