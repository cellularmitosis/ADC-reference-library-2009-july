<p>NSUndoManager is a general-purpose recorder of operations
for undo and redo. You register an undo operation by specifying
the object that is changing (or the owner of that object), along
with a method to invoke to revert its state, and the arguments for
that method. NSUndoManager groups all operations within a single
cycle of the run loop, so that performing an undo reverts all changes
that occurred during the loop. Also, when performing undo an NSUndoManager
saves the operations reverted so that you can redo the undos.</p>
<p>NSUndoManager is implemented as a class of the Foundation
framework because executables other than applications might want
to revert changes to their states. For example, you might have an
interactive command-line tool with undo and redo commands; or there
could be Distributed Object implementations that can revert operations
“over the wire.” However, users typically see undo and redo
as application features. The Application Kit implements undo and
redo in its NSTextView object and makes it easy to implement it
in objects along the responder chain. For more on the role of the
Application Kit in undo and redo, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../Tasks/UsingUndoAppKit.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000213-CJBJBEII">“Using Undo in Applications.”</a></span></p>

<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000205-74904" title="Undo Operations and Groups"></a><h2>Undo Operations and Groups</h2>
<p>An undo operation is a method for reverting a change to an
object, along with the arguments needed to revert the change (for
example, its state before the change). Undo operations are typically
collected in undo groups, which represent whole revertible actions,
and are stored on a stack. Redo operations and groups are simply
undo operations stored on a separate stack (described below). When
an NSUndoManager performs undo or redo, it is actually undoing or
redoing an entire group of operations. For example, a user could
change the type face and the font size of some text. An application
might package both attribute-setting operations as a group, so
when the user chooses Undo, both type face and font size are reverted.
To undo a single operation, it must still be packaged in a group.</p>
<p>NSUndoManager normally creates undo groups automatically during
the run loop. The first time it is asked to record an undo operation
in the run loop, it creates a new group. Then, at the end of the
loop, it closes the group. You can create additional, nested undo groups
within these default groups using the <code>beginUndoGrouping</code> and <code>enableUndoRegistration</code> methods.
You can also turn off the default grouping behavior using <code>setGroupsByEvent:</code>.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000205-112683" title="The Undo and Redo Stacks"></a><h2>The Undo and Redo Stacks</h2>
<p>Undo groups are stored on a stack, with the oldest groups
at the bottom and the newest at the top. The undo stack is unlimited
by default, but you can restrict it to a maximum number of groups
using the <code>setLevelsOfUndo:</code> method. When
the stack exceeds the maximum, the oldest undo groups are dropped
from the bottom.</p>
<p>Initially, both stacks are empty. Recording undo operations
adds to the undo stack, but the redo stack remains empty until undo
is performed. Performing undo causes the reverting operations in
the latest group to be applied to their objects. Since these operations
cause changes to the objects’ states, the objects presumably register
new operations with the NSUndoManager, this time in the reverse
direction from the original operations. Since the NSUndoManager
is in the process of performing undo, it records these operations
as redo operations on the redo stack. Consecutive undos add to the
redo stack. Subsequent redo operations pull the operations off the
redo stack, apply them to the objects, and push them back onto the
undo stack.</p>
<p>The redo stack’s contents last as long as undo and redo
are performed successively. However, because applying a new change
to an object invalidates the previous changes, as soon as a new
undo operation is registered, the redo stack is cleared. This prevents
redo from returning objects to an inappropriate prior state. You
can check for the ability to undo and redo with the <code>canUndo</code> and <code>canRedo</code> methods.</p>
