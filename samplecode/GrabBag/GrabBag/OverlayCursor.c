/*	File:		OverlayCursor.c		Contains:	Routines to handle drawing a pseudo large cursor.  By creating an overlay window 				and positioning the overlay window under the cursor and drawing our large 				cursor into the overlay window we simulate a large cursor.  Overlay windows				are commonly used to simulate drawing directly to the screen.	Disclaimer:	IMPORTANT:  This Apple software is supplied to you by Apple Computer, Inc.				("Apple") in consideration of your agreement to the following terms, and your				use, installation, modification or redistribution of this Apple software				constitutes acceptance of these terms.
