<b>NAME</b>
       rcsintro - introduction to RCS commands

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  Revision  Control  System (RCS) manages multiple revisions of files.  RCS automates the storing,
       retrieval, logging, identification, and merging of revisions.  RCS is useful for text that is revised
       frequently, for example programs, documentation, graphics, papers, and form letters.

       The basic user interface is extremely simple.  The novice only needs to learn two commands: <a href="ci.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ci"><b>ci</b>(1)</a> and
       <a href="co.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/co"><b>co</b>(1)</a>.  <b>ci</b>, short for "check in", deposits the contents of a file into an archival file called an RCS
       file.  An RCS file contains all revisions of a particular file.  <b>co</b>, short for "check out", retrieves
       revisions from an RCS file.

   <b>Functions</b> <b>of</b> <b>RCS</b>
             Store and retrieve multiple revisions of text.  RCS saves all old revisions in a  space  effi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cient&nbsp;efficient</font>
              cient  way.   Changes  no  longer  destroy the original, because the previous revisions remain
              accessible.  Revisions can be retrieved according to  ranges  of  revision  numbers,  symbolic
              names, dates, authors, and states.

             Maintain a complete history of changes.  RCS logs all changes automatically.  Besides the text
              of each revision, RCS stores the author, the date and time of check-in, and a log message sum-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">marizing&nbsp;summarizing</font>
              marizing the change.  The logging makes it easy to find out what happened to a module, without
              having to compare source listings or having to track down colleagues.

             Resolve access conflicts.  When two or more programmers wish to modify the same revision,  RCS
              alerts the programmers and prevents one modification from corrupting the other.

             Maintain a tree of revisions.  RCS can maintain separate lines of development for each module.
              It stores a tree structure that represents the ancestral relationships among revisions.

             Merge revisions and resolve conflicts.  Two separate lines of development of a module  can  be
              coalesced  by  merging.   If  the revisions to be merged affect the same sections of code, RCS
              alerts the user about the overlapping changes.

             Control releases and configurations.  Revisions can be assigned symbolic names and  marked  as
              released,  stable, experimental, etc.  With these facilities, configurations of modules can be
              described simply and directly.

             Automatically identify each revision with name, revision number, creation time,  author,  etc.
              The identification is like a stamp that can be embedded at an appropriate place in the text of
              a revision.  The identification makes it simple to determine which revisions of which  modules
              make up a given configuration.

             Minimize  secondary storage.  RCS needs little extra space for the revisions (only the differ-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ences).&nbsp;differences).</font>
              ences).  If intermediate revisions  are  deleted,  the  corresponding  deltas  are  compressed
              accordingly.

   <b>Getting</b> <b>Started</b> <b>with</b> <b>RCS</b>
       Suppose  you have a file <b>f.c</b> that you wish to put under control of RCS.  If you have not already done
       so, make an RCS directory with the command

              <b>mkdir</b>  <b>RCS</b>

       Then invoke the check-in command

              <b>ci</b>  <b>f.c</b>

       This command creates an RCS file in the <b>RCS</b> directory, stores  <b>f.c</b>  into  it  as  revision  1.1,  and
       deletes  <b>f.c</b>.   It also asks you for a description.  The description should be a synopsis of the con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tents&nbsp;contents</font>
       tents of the file.  All later check-in commands will ask you for a log entry, which should  summarize
       the changes that you made.

       Files  in  the  RCS directory are called RCS files; the others are called working files.  To get back
       the working file <b>f.c</b> in the previous example, use the check-out command

              <b>co</b>  <b>f.c</b>

       This command extracts the latest revision from the RCS file and writes it into <b>f.c</b>.  If you  want  to
       edit <b>f.c</b>, you must lock it as you check it out with the command

              <b>co</b>  <b>-l</b>  <b>f.c</b>

       You can now edit <b>f.c</b>.

       Suppose after some editing you want to know what changes that you have made.  The command

              <b>rcsdiff</b>  <b>f.c</b>

       tells  you the difference between the most recently checked-in version and the working file.  You can
       check the file back in by invoking

              <b>ci</b>  <b>f.c</b>

       This increments the revision number properly.

       If <b>ci</b> complains with the message

              <b>ci</b> <b>error:</b> <b>no</b> <b>lock</b> <b>set</b> <b>by</b> <u>your</u> <u>name</u>

       then you have tried to check in a file even though you did not lock it when you checked it  out.   Of
       course,  it  is  too late now to do the check-out with locking, because another check-out would over-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">write&nbsp;overwrite</font>
       write your modifications.  Instead, invoke

              <b>rcs</b>  <b>-l</b>  <b>f.c</b>

       This command will lock the latest revision for you, unless somebody else got ahead  of  you  already.
       In this case, you'll have to negotiate with that person.

       Locking  assures  that  you, and only you, can check in the next update, and avoids nasty problems if
       several people work on the same file.  Even if a revision is locked, it can still be checked out  for
       reading, compiling, etc.  All that locking prevents is a <u>check-in</u> by anybody but the locker.

       If  your RCS file is private, i.e., if you are the only person who is going to deposit revisions into
       it, strict locking is not needed and you can turn it off.  If strict locking is turned off, the owner
       of  the  RCS file need not have a lock for check-in; all others still do.  Turning strict locking off
       and on is done with the commands

              <b>rcs</b>  <b>-U</b>  <b>f.c</b>     and     <b>rcs</b>  <b>-L</b>  <b>f.c</b>

       If you don't want to clutter your working directory with RCS files, create a subdirectory called  <b>RCS</b>
       in your working directory, and move all your RCS files there.  RCS commands will look first into that
       directory to find needed files.  All the commands discussed above will still work, without any  modi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fication.&nbsp;modification.</font>
       fication.   (Actually,  pairs  of  RCS and working files can be specified in three ways: (a) both are
       given, (b) only the working file is given, (c) only the RCS file is  given.   Both  RCS  and  working
       files may have arbitrary path prefixes; RCS commands pair them up intelligently.)

       To  avoid  the  deletion of the working file during check-in (in case you want to continue editing or
       compiling), invoke

              <b>ci</b>  <b>-l</b>  <b>f.c</b>     or     <b>ci</b>  <b>-u</b>  <b>f.c</b>

       These commands check in <b>f.c</b> as usual, but perform an implicit check-out.  The first form  also  locks
       the  checked  in revision, the second one doesn't.  Thus, these options save you one check-out opera-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion.&nbsp;operation.</font>
       tion.  The first form is useful if you want to continue editing, the second one if you just  want  to
       read the file.  Both update the identification markers in your working file (see below).

       You  can  give  <b>ci</b>  the number you want assigned to a checked in revision.  Assume all your revisions
       were numbered 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc., and you would like to start release 2.  The command

              <b>ci</b>  <b>-r2</b>  <b>f.c</b>     or     <b>ci</b>  <b>-r2.1</b>  <b>f.c</b>

       assigns the number 2.1 to the new revision.  From then on, <b>ci</b> will number  the  subsequent  revisions
       with 2.2, 2.3, etc.  The corresponding <b>co</b> commands

              <b>co</b>  <b>-r2</b>  <b>f.c</b>     and     <b>co</b>  <b>-r2.1</b>  <b>f.c</b>

       retrieve  the latest revision numbered 2.<u>x</u> and the revision 2.1, respectively.  <b>co</b> without a revision
       number selects the latest revision on the <u>trunk</u>, i.e. the highest revision with a  number  consisting
       of  two  fields.  Numbers with more than two fields are needed for branches.  For example, to start a
       branch at revision 1.3, invoke

              <b>ci</b>  <b>-r1.3.1</b>  <b>f.c</b>

       This command starts a branch numbered 1 at revision 1.3, and assigns the number 1.3.1.1  to  the  new
       revision.  For more information about branches, see <a href="../man5/rcsfile.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/rcsfile"><b>rcsfile</b>(5)</a>.

   <b>Automatic</b> <b>Identification</b>
       RCS  can  put  special  strings  for identification into your source and object code.  To obtain such
       identification, place the marker

              <b>$Id$</b>

       into your text, for instance inside a comment.  RCS will replace this marker with  a  string  of  the
       form

              <b>$Id:</b>  <u>filename</u>  <u>revision</u>  <u>date</u>  <u>time</u>  <u>author</u>  <u>state</u>  <b>$</b>

       With  such  a marker on the first page of each module, you can always see with which revision you are
       working.  RCS keeps the markers up to date automatically.  To propagate the markers into your  object
       code, simply put them into literal character strings.  In C, this is done as follows:

              <b>static</b> <b>char</b> <b>rcsid[]</b> <b>=</b> <b>"$Id$";</b>

       The  command <b>ident</b> extracts such markers from any file, even object code and dumps.  Thus, <b>ident</b> lets
       you find out which revisions of which modules were used in a given program.

       You may also find it useful to put the marker <b>$Log$</b> into your text, inside a  comment.   This  marker
       accumulates the log messages that are requested during check-in.  Thus, you can maintain the complete
       history of your file directly inside it.  There are several additional  identification  markers;  see
       <a href="co.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/co"><b>co</b>(1)</a> for details.
