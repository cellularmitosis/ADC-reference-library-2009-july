You only need toprovide the database-to-enterprise objects mapping (the model) and WebObjectscreates your application from it. However, the rapid developmentapproaches also impose a user interface on your application andyou must be adept at WebObjects and Direct to Web to override it. </p><p>There are several types of applications at which the rapiddevelopment approaches excel because their user interface limitationsaren't an issue:</p><ul><li><b>Databasemaintenance tools.</b> These approaches create user interfacesoptimized for administering databases and are therefore well-suitedfor this type of application.</font></li><li><b>Prototypes.</b> You can quickly and easilytest a model by creating a Direct to Web or Direct to Java Clientapplication based on the model. Using this application, you can testwhether the relationships and database integrity rules are correct.</font></li><li><b>Internal data driven applications.</b> Directto Web has been used to develop in-house applications for bug andfeature tracking, customer account management, and writing onlinehelp. Direct to Java Client can be used for such applications aswell. For internal applications, the user interface polish is notas important as development time, making these applications idealcandidates for the WebObjects rapid development approaches.</font></li></ul><br>    <br><a href="Specific_La_equirements.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/previous.gif" border="0"></a><a href="Combining_Approaches.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/next.gif" border="0"></a>&nbsp;<br><br><p><hr><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">&#169; 2002 Apple Computer, Inc.
