For example, it may be useful to know the value of a certain component variable each time the page is accessed. This is most easily accomplished by overriding <strong>descriptionForResponse:inContext:</strong> in your component and having it return the desired information.<p></a><a name="5047">For example, the HelloWorld example's Hello component could return the value of its <strong>visitorName</strong> instance variable along with the component name:<p></a><pre><a name="5048">// WebScript Hello.m<br>- (NSString *)descriptionForResponse:(WOResponse *)response inContext:(WOContext *)context {<br>		return [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@/%@", <br>			[self name], visitorName];<br>}</a><a name="5049">//Java Hello.java<br>public String descriptionForResponse(WOResponse response, WOContext context) {<br>		return new String(this.name() + visitorName);<br>}</a></pre><a name="5041">The response component receives the <strong>descriptionForResponse:inContext:</strong> message after it receives the message <strong>appendToResponse:inContext:</strong>. The default implementation of <strong>descriptionForResponse:inContext:</strong> prints the page name. Unlike other methods invoked during the component action request-response loop, <strong>descriptionForResponse:inContext:</strong> is not sent to all components and dynamic elements on the page; it is sent only to the top-level response component.<p></a><a name="5054">Note that this method receives the response and context objects as arguments, just as <strong>appendToResponse:inContext:</strong> does. This means you &#32;can add such information as the HTTP header keys, or any other information recorded in these objects, to your description string. This &#32;description string is then appended to the log file in the CLFF &#32;format as discussed in <a href="Deployment2.html#5978">"Maintaining a Log File"</a>.<p></a><a name="7505">When an application is deployed, a session object keeps in memory all these descriptions in the order their components were accessed by the session's user. When the session times out, three things happen:<p></a><ul><a name="7506"><p><li>All its descriptions are written in the CLFF log file (if any).</a><a name="7507"><p><li>All its descriptions appear in the WOStats page under "Last User's Statistics."</a><a name="7508"><p><li>All its descriptions are added to all previous descriptions, and these totals appear in the WOStats page under "Detailed Statistics."</a></ul><P> <a href="Deployment.html"><IMG SRC="ArrowUp.gif">Table of Contents</a> <a href="Deployment5.html"><IMG SRC="ArrowRight.gif">Next Section</a><P></body></html>
