    /* Here we are calling SimplePing which does all the work of pinging the remote host for us.
     * First Argument: The host to ping expressed as a C-String.  On calling SimplePing this
     *    variable will hold a description of the host as a C-String.  The string can either be
     *    a hostname (e.g. "www.google.com") or an IP address (e.g. "17.203.23.111")
     * Second Argument: The number of ping packets to send to the remote host before stopping.
     *    Also, for each ping packet simple ping will show some output on if there was a 
     *    reply, round trip time, etc.  
     * Third Argument: The time to wait for responses to the ping before stopping.  Note we will
     *    wait for responses even after a successful response has been received up until 
     *    the timeout has occurred
     * Forth Argument: An integer indicating if we want to return immediately after getting the desired
     *    response or if we wait for the timeout (even after a successful response) to see if any other
     *    packets come.  If the integer is zero then we will wait for the timeout and non-zero indicates
     *    we want to return immediately.  Here we pass zero to wait for the full timeout.
     * Return Value: This is an UNIX integer error code.  On success the return value will be zero.  On
     *    failure the value will be a UNIX error code.  You can find the list of UNIX error codes
     *    and their meanings in /usr/include/sys/errno.h
