They provide an example of applications using asynchronous PPC Toolbox code for communications, and of a faceless background-only application used as agent to control remote system.All source Metrowerks Pascal code for both programs is included. Built using the Unversal Interfaces version 2.0.Note: the functionality provided by these applications can be easily duplicated with the scriptable Finder and AppleScript.Requires:  Metrowerks Pascal 6Keywords:  AppleShare, File Sharing, Faceless Background-only, FBA, PPC ToolboxVirus scan:	Disinfectant 3.5 shows no viruses in this file
