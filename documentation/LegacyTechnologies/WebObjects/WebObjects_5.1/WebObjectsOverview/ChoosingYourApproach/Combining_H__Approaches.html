These advantage are lost when the applicationsalso use inherently less-interactive HTML-based interfaces.</p><p>Similarly, a major advantage of HTML-based applications isthat any computer with a Web browser can use them. When combinedwith Java Client, these applications depend on the quality of thebrowser's Java Virtual Machine, if the browser even implementsone. In addition, you must install the client code on the user'scomputer or force the user to wait for it to download. The extrainteractivity Java Client adds to the HTML-based approaches is usuallyoutweighed by the concomitant loss of portability.</p><br>    <br><a href="Combining_Approaches.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/previous.gif" border="0"></a><a href="Adding_Rapid_Development.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/next.gif" border="0"></a>&nbsp;<br><br><p><hr><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">&#169; 2002 Apple Computer, Inc.
