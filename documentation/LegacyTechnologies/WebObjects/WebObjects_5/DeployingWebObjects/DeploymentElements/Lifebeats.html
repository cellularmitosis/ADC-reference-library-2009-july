This allows the application's users connectto it. One of the main goals of WebObjects Deployment is to provideyou with tools that help you deploy a resilient site. To accomplishthat, wotaskd restarts application instances that become unresponsive.</p><p>A <b>lifebeat</b> is a status message that anapplication instance sends to a wotaskd process to keep it informedof the instance's status. There are four kinds of lifebeats:</p><ul><li>has started</font></li><li>is alive</font></li><li>will stop</font></li><li>will crash</font></li></ul><p>An application instance is configured by default to send lifebeatsto a wotaskd process through TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)sockets. (A <b>socket</b> is a mechanism through whichtwo processes communicate.) Instances can also send lifebeats usingUDP (User Datagram Protocol) sockets. UDP sockets use fewer resourcesthan TCP sockets.</p><p>The lifebeat mechanism is how the state of your site is constantlyupdated. Lifebeats are sent from a separate execution thread ina WebObjects application and do not interfere with, nor are theyaffected by, normal request processing.</p><p>By default, application instances try to send a lifebeat every30 seconds. If a failure occurs (there is no wotaskd process listeningon the <code>WOLifebeatDesinationPort</code>),the instance does the following:</p><ol><li>Sends upto 10 TCP lifebeats until a response is received.<p>After thetenth unanswered lifebeat, the instance goes to stage 2.</p></font></li><li>Sends UDP lifebeats (low-resource lifebeat mode) until a responseis received.<p>If the instance cannot create a UDP socket, itgoes back to stage 1.</p><p>When the instance receives anacknowledgement, it resumes sending TCP lifebeats.</p></font></li></ol><p>The two-stage mechanism allows application instances to gointo low-resource lifebeat mode if wotaskd isn't running whenthe instance starts.</p><br>    <br><a href="Configuration_Files.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/previous.gif" border="0"></a><a href="wotaskd_Processes.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/next.gif" border="0"></a>&nbsp;<br><hr><p><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">&#169; 2001 Apple Computer, Inc.
