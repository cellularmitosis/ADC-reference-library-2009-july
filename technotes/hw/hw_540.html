Is something wrong with the SCSIManager?</p><P>A problem has recently been found with the SCSI chip on the Macintosh Quadra700 and 900. In a nutshell, the National 53c96 chips that are used in the thesemodels do something that the SCSI Manager doesn't expect (they sometimes holdonto a byte in the chip's on-board FIFO). Because of this, in certain cases,instead of the SCSI Manager retrieving the Status and Message bytes from thedrive it just posted a command to, it gets the stuck byte as the Status byte,and the Message byte as the Status byte.</p><P>The end result is some peculiarities. For instance, users report that theycan't get a CD-ROM drive to work with Macintosh Quadra 900s. Also, periodicallyusers get "can't read such and such drive" messages on the desktop.</p><P>This may occur with a CD-ROM device (and most likely, with any removable-mediadevice such as SyQuests). The reason is that, since these devices may or maynot have media inserted, the drivers for these devices typically poll devicesthat don't have media inserted, looking for newly inserted media. Often, theydo this by issuing a <code>TestUnitReady</code> SCSI command to the device. If the devicereturns a 0, which indicates NO ERROR, then it's assumed that some sort ofmedia is inserted into the drive and the driver then tries to mount the newlymounted media.</p><P>Let's look at this in detail. Here's the command that's sent to the CD-ROMdrive:</p><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=550><TR>	<td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><pre>  0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  -  Linked command byte: On Macintosh systems, always 0  |  |  |  |  -  -  Reserved  |  |  |  -  -  -  Reserved  |  |  -  -  -  -  Reserved  |  -  -  -  -  -  Logical unit number (usually 0)  -  -  -  -  -  -  SCSI command: TestUnitReady</pre>	</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER>  <P>The last byte (SCSI command such as Linked) is always 0. This is the byte thatsticks in the FIFO of the c96, such that when you read the Status and Messagebytes back, you get a 0 back as the Status byte, and a "Not Ready" (2) in theMessage byte.</p><P>Unfortunately, 0 is the value returned to the driver, which says "Oh boy! Thedrive has some media in it and it's ready to be mounted!" The driver proceedsto issue (in the case of the CD-ROM) a <code>_PostEvent</code> that then causes other <code>_Read</code>trap calls and such, all of which fail, and you end up with the UninitializedDisk dialog box.</p><P>Apple has figured out a SCSI Manager fix for this problem and the fix will bereleased in an upcoming System Disk release.</p><P>As a workaround, try doing a retry and see if the problem still occurs withSystem 7.1.</p><h2>Macintosh Quadra SCSI data transfer</h2>  <P>Date Written:  1/15/92</p><P>Last reviewed:  2/6/92</p><P>My application has problems with Macintosh Quadra SCSI data transfer. I thinkit depends on the SCSI-chip installed in the machine. Is there a Gestaltdefinition for the SCSI-chip installed?</p><P>You need to examine the 6th, 7th, and 21st bits of the <code>gestaltHardwareAttr</code>selector. To investigate hardware-dependent bit values, use the <A HREF = "downloads/GestaltDA_0.4.sea.hqx">Gestalt DA</a>,which you'll find on the latest <i>Developer CD Series</i> disc.</p><P>Make sure your software doesn't read or write to SCSI hardware directly. Forexample, the Quadra utilizes the 53C96, so it won't correctly interpret orqueue a SCSIstat call. With the 53C96, you don't have access to the state ofthe SCSI  bus lines. In implementation, the 53C96 is more abstract then the53C80; software no longer has the same access to the physical layers of thechip's instruction set. Your software development should allow the SCSI Managerto handle the 53C96 chip/software interaction.</p><P>X-Ref:</p><P>"<code>gestaltHardwareAttr</code> hasSCSI selector" Q&amp;A</p><h2><code>gestaltHardwareAttr</code> hasSCSI selector</h2>Date Written:  1/3/<P>Last reviewed:  1/27/92Why does the <code>gestaltHardwareAttr</code> selector on the Macintosh IIfx return aselector indicating no SCSI available?</p><P>Labelling bit 7 of the response to the <code>gestaltHardwareAttr</code> selector "hasSCSI"is a bit misleading. <code>gestaltHardwareAttr</code> is supplying information about thevery low-level hardware implementation. What bit 7 signifies is the presence ofa standard 53C80 SCSI chip (the kind in use from the Macintosh Plus up to theIIfx). The IIfx has a different implementation of the 53C80 that allows forSCSI DMA, hence a different bit is used. The new Quadras have yet another chip,the 53C96, so different bits are used for those, as well. </p><P>The reason this is not more clearly documented is that it is very rare forapplications to need this level of detail. Depending on such informationvirtually guarantees your application will be hardware dependent and so,incompatible in the future. </p><P>Here are the latest, official gestaltHardwareAttr flags from MPW 3.2.1.

Ourcode works fine on systems using the NCR 5380, but hangs with the new SCSI NCR53C96. Do I need to add a NOP somewhere because the new chip is faster?</p><P>Although SCSIBase is exactly where a SCSI device driver should look to find thebase address of a SCSI chip in the Macintosh, the NCR 53C96 is a physicallydifferent chip then the NCR 5380. Besides having its registers in differentlocations of the address map and a slightly different register set, the chiptakes on much more of the burden (and control) of accessing the SCSI bus. Themajor difference is that with the 5380, the chip controller (drvr) needs toactively respond to the phases of the SCSI bus as the target changes them andto be ready to correctly react to any unexpected changes in state. Forcontinued compatibility with the Macintosh product lines, your driver must usethe SCSI Manager rather than to write directly to the chip. With the new chip(5396) the chip controller needs to set up all information for the entirecommand sequence (Arbitration thru Message In) and then tell the chip toexecute it. The "controller" is not in direct control of the SCSI bus. (Withthe earlier chip, it's really the Target that's always in control, not yourdriver, but the 5380's interaction model gives the IMPRESSION that your driveris in control.)</p><P>Your best course of action is to make sure your SCSI driver uses the SCSIManager so that you will automatically work on all Macintosh platforms in theevent that Apple changes chips in the future. If there is something odd aboutyour SCSI device that it just cannot be accommodated by the SCSI Manager (thisis rare!) then you will need to get the documentation for the NCR 5396 (fromNCR) and rewrite your driver to use this new "setup and go" interactionmodel.</p><h2>Apple SCSI cable information</h2><P>Date Written:  9/17/91</p><P>Last reviewed:  9/17/91</p><P>Where can we get specs for Apple's SCSI cables, similar to Apple's paint andfinish standard, which allows us to match our hardware exactly to the Macintoshfamily? SCSI details we are concerned with are: single versus double shielding,contact types (such as gold), wire gage, and color.</p><P>The information you've requested is unavailable for distribution. Apple simplydoesn't supply specifications for any of its hardware to outside parties.However, you might try looking at the following SCSI specifications for moreinformation:</p><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=550><TR>	<td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><pre>Specification:                         Available from:_____________                          ______________SCSI-1: ANSI X3.131-1986               American National Standards Institute        ISO DP 9316                    1430 Broadway        ECMA-111                       New York, NY  10018CCS: X359.2/85-52,1986 (Rev 4.B)       American National Standards Institute     (Common Command Set)              1430 Broadway                                       New York, NY  10018SCSI-2: ANSI X3.131-1990               Global Engineering Documents(Revision 10c)                         2805 McGaw                                       Irvine, CA  92714                                       Tel: (800) 854-7179 or (714) 261-1455</pre>	</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P>These specifications discuss SCSI interface and, although they don't tell youexactly how to build a SCSI cable, they give you a good benchmark forengineering one.

A/UX is the onlyoperating system on the Macintosh that does use this chip.</p><h2>Transferring data from SCSI device to Macintosh</h2><P>Date Written:  8/30/91</p><P>Last reviewed:  6/14/93How can an external SCSI device interrupt the Macintosh system CPU? What's theprocedure for transferring data from my external SCSI device's buffer to systemRAM?</p><P>Transferring data from a SCSI device to a Macintosh is not a simple task. TheMacintosh SCSI implementation does not support arbitration, so only theMacintosh can start a SCSI transaction. If someone else were to begintransferring data on the bus, and the Macintosh wanted to begin a transfer, itwould not know how to deal with the situation.</p><P>This rules out your SCSI device being able to decide to send data to theMacintosh. The only way to accomplish what you need to do is to write a VBL orTime Manager task that periodically checks your device to see if it needs to beserviced, and if so, initiates a SCSI transfer to get the data from it. Whilethis approach requires somewhat more care, because of its granularity, itshould prove adequate.</p><h2>Using Macintosh SCSI Manager for direct disk access</h2><P>Date Written:  5/7/91</p><P>Last reviewed:  7/25/91I would like to read and write sectors directly on a SCSI disk. Do I need toaccess the SCSI chip directly or can I use the SCSI Manager for this?</p><P>The normal way to access a SCSI disk is to use the Macintoshreg. file system,which calls the SCSI Manager to access the SCSI bus and command the hard diskto read or write data in various blocks. You should be able to directly commandthe hard disk yourself and directly send and receive the sector buffers bycalling the SCSI Manager to perform the SCSI communication for you.</p><P>Pseudo code to perform this kind of transaction would be:</p><P>*    Prepare a command block for read or write, etc.</p><P>*    Prepare your data buffer and a transfer instruction block (tib) containinginstructions for data transfer. For example, a tib for transferring six512-byte blocks of data from or to address $67B50 contains the following:</p><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=550><TR>	<td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><pre>        SCINC     $67B50    512        SCLOOP    -10       6        SCSTOP</pre>	</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><ul type="disc">	<li>Call SCSIGet() to gain control of the buss</li>	<li>Call SCSISelect(TargetId) to select the target device (your hard drive) and  allow the target to command the bus.</li>	<li>Call SCSICmd(CommandBlock,Length) to give the SCSI Manager the command you  want it to transfer when the target requests the command.</li>	<li>Call SCSIRead(tib) (or SCSIWrite) to tell the SCSI Manager where to put the bytes (or where to get them from on a write) when the target requests them.</li>	<li>Call SCSIComplete(Status, message) to finish the transaction and receive the (potential) error code.</li></ul><P>If what you intended to ask was how to write your own SCSI hardware driver, beaware that this is not an area that DTS normally supports. If you aredeveloping for a unique SCSI device that cannot be interfaced to using theprovided SCSI Manager, please let DTS know the details about your device andthe problems you are encountering that will not allow its control via the SCSIManager. Also, please note that the specific SCSI chip used in a specificMacintosh model may change in some future Macintosh model and will break yourcustom driver, requiring you to rev your driver if you want to continue to becompatible. For this reason we strongly suggest that you use the providedSCSIManager if at all possible.</p><h2>Connecting two Macintosh systems via SCSI</h2>Date Written:  12/12/90<p>Last reviewed:  7/26/91How can I connect two Macintosh systems together using the SCSI port so theycan run in parallel?</p><P>For many reasons, connecting any two systems via SCSI port to SCSI port shouldnot be attempted. The most important reason is that you would then have twodevices (the CPUs, and probably the internal drive) on the bus with the sameSCSI ID. Further, a straight-through cable would connect outputs to outputs andinputs to inputs, which would bring communications to a halt.</p><P>However, a SCSI-to-SCSI connection, like the type mentioned below, is possiblebetween the Macintosh Portable and a desktop Macintosh using LapLink MacintoshIII from Traveling Software. It works only on the Macintosh Portable since theSCSI ID of the Macintosh Portable can be changed from 7 to 6, avoiding the IDconflicts. Traveling Software also provides a special SCSI-SCSI cable, which isrequired for this connection. (This setup cannot connect two desktop Macintoshsystems unless the drive ID can be changed. This is not possible with Apple'sinternal drives but you may be able to do it with other internals. In any case,this is unsupported, so if you attempt this you do so at your own risk. Youprobably will void your warranty.)</p><P>LapLink Macintosh III<br>Traveling Software, Inc.<br>18702 North Creek Parkwaybr<br>Bothell, WA  98011<br>206-483-8088</p><h2>Cannot make SCSI inquiries of CPU</h2>Date Written:  12/12/90<p>Last reviewed:  1/16/91Is there a way to get the SCSI information for the CPU (ID 7) using a SCSIcall?</p><P>No, sorry. The SCSI protocol says that there is a SCSI bus Master and a SCSItarget, and that the two will not be the same. Since the Macintosh is alwaysthe master, there is no way you can make inquiries of it.</p><h2>SCSI/NuBus card development tools and resources</h2>Date Written:  7/11/90<p>Last reviewed:  8/30/91Are there any new tools or resources for developing a SCSI/NuBus card?

The best advice and the official line from Apple is not to have devices onthe bus and powered off. It's been found that having devices powered off and onthe bus causes degradation to performance and the signals. This is the issue:electrical problems of termination and termination power. Some devices are NOTfollowing the description of how Apple's devices work, and following theguidelines of the Apple cable guide does not apply with non-Apple devices. Thetermination problem can cause hardware damage. Therefore, the rule is this: DoNOT have devices connected to the bus with their power off. Also, do not poweron a device connected to the bus after booting and never connect one while thesystem is on.</p><h2>Macintosh Quadra and SCSI termination</h2><P>Date Written:  11/27/91</p><P>Last reviewed:  11/27/91</p><P>Proper SCSI termination is critical for correct operation of the MacintoshQuadra computers, just as with all Macintosh computers. The Macintosh Quadracomputers require external SCSI termination at the end of the device chain,either supplied by the last device in the chain, or using a standard Apple SCSICable Terminator (M0332LL/A). Note that this is the standard SCSI terminator,NOT the black terminator required by the Macintosh IIfx (although the blackIIfx terminator may be used as well).</p><P>Termination is generally supplied at the factory for use with internal SCSIdevices. Some early floppy-only Macintosh Quadra 700 units may not haveinternal termination, so users who attach external SCSI devices (without havingadded an internal SCSI device) may need to double terminate their external SCSIchain. Properly terminated floppy-only Macintosh Quadra 700 units will have aterminator inserted into the motherboard internal SCSI cable connector. Usersof internal SCSI devices must, of course, remove this terminator beforeconnecting their internal SCSI device.</p><P>The Macintosh Quadra 900 is the first Macintosh computer to provide a separate,internal SCSI bus. This bus is physically isolated from the external SCSI busand must also be properly terminated. The cable provided with the machineincludes all the termination necessary, so ALL internal devices must have SCSItermination removed before connecting to the internal Macintosh Quadra 900 SCSIcable. If extra termination is supplied it may cause intermittent hardwarefailures as well as physical damage to the device.</p><P>Developers who ship terminated SCSI devices for possible internal use in theMacintosh Quadra 900 must provide users with instructions for removing thetermination.</p><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></p><P><A NAME=Downloads></A></p>          <h2>Downloadables</h2>          <TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH="100%">  <TR>   <td width=50 align=left>     <P align=center><img src="images/acrobatsmall.gif" width=22 height=23 align=middle alt="Acrobat gif"></p></TD>   <td align="left">     <P>Acrobat version of this Note (56K)</p>   </TD>   <td width=60 align=left>     <P><A HREF="pdf/hw_540.pdf">Download</A></p>   </TD>  </TR></table><BR><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></p></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><!-- end_content --><!-- begin_footer_information -->	<table width="680" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
