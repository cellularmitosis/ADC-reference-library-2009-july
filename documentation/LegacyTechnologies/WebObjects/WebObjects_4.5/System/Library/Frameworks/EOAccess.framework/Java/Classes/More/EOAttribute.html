A simpleattribute typically corresponds to a single column in the database,and may be read or updated directly from or to the database. A simple EOAttributemay also be set as read-only with its  <a frame= "conv" href="../EOAttribute.html#//apple_ref/java/instm/EOAttribute/setReadOnly">setReadOnly</a> method. Read-only attributesof enterprise objects are never updated.</p><p>A derived attribute doesn't necessarily correspond to asingle database column in its entity's database table, and isusually based on some other attribute, which is modified in someway. For example, if an Employee entity has a simple monthly salaryattribute, you can define a derived <b>annualSalary</b> attribute as"salary * 12". Derived attributes, since they don't correspondto actual values in the database, are read-only; it makes no senseto write a derived value.</p><p>A flattened attribute of an entity is actually an attributeof some other entity that's fetched through a relationship witha database join. A flattened attribute's external definition isa data path ending in an attribute name. For example, if the Employeeentity has the relationship <b>toAddress</b> andthe Address entity has the attribute <b>street</b>,you can define <b>streetName</b> as an attributeof your Employee EOEntity by creating an EOAttribute for it witha definition of "toAddress.street".</p><br><h2>Creating a Simple Attribute</h2><p>A simple attribute needs at least the following characteristics:</p><ul><li>A name unique within its EOEntity</li><li>The name of a column in the database table for its entity(the EOAttribute's external name)</li><li>A declaration of the type of that column as defined by thedatabase and adaptor (the EOAttribute's external type)</li><li>A declaration of the Java class used to represent values outsidethe context of an enterprise object</li><li>For Java value classes that require it, a subtype for suchdistinctions as between numeric types</li></ul><p>You also have to set whether the attribute is part of itsentity's primary key, is a class property, or is used for locking.See the  <a frame= "conv" href="../EOEntity.html#DAJCFCGJ">EOEntity</a> classdescription for more information.</p><br><h2>Creating a Derived Attribute</h2><p>A derived attribute depends on another attribute, so you baseit on a definition including that attribute's name rather thanon an external name. Because a derived attribute isn't mappeddirectly to anything in the database, you shouldn't include itin the entity's set of primary key attributes or attributes usedfor locking.</p><br><h2>Creating a Flattened Attribute</h2><p>A flattened attribute depends on a relationship, so you baseit on a definition including that relationship's name rather thanon an external name. Because a flattened attribute doesn't correspond directlyto anything in its entity's table, you don't have to specifyan external name, and shouldn't include it in the entity's setof primary key attributes or attributes used for locking. </p><p>Instead of flattening attributes in your model, a better approachis often to directly traverse the object graph through relationships.</p><dd></dd><br><a name = "CEHBFGDD"><h2>Mapping from Database toObjects</h2></a><p>Every EOAttribute has an external type, which is the typeused by the database to store its associated data, and a Java classused as the type for that data in the client application. The typeused by the database is accessed with the  <a frame= "conv" href="../EOAttribute.html#//apple_ref/java/instm/EOAttribute/setExternalType">setExternalType</a> and  <a frame= "conv" href="../EOAttribute.html#//apple_ref/java/instm/EOAttribute/externalType">externalType</a> methods. The class typeused by the application is accessed with the  <a frame= "conv" href="../EOAttribute.html#//apple_ref/java/instm/EOAttribute/valueClassName">valueClassName</a> method. You can mapdatabase types to a set of standard value classes, which includes:</p><ul><li>String</li><li>Number</li><li>java.math.BigDecimal</li><li>NSData</li><li>NSDate</li></ul><p>Database-specific adaptors automatically handle value conversionsfor these classes. You can also create your own custom value class,so long as you define a format that it uses to interpret data. For moreinformation on using EOAttribute methods to work with custom datatypes, see the next section,  <a frame= "conv" href="#CHCCEBCE">"Working with Custom Data Types"</a>.</p><p>The handling of dates assumes by default that both the databaseserver and the client application are running in the same, local,time zone. You can alter the server time zone with the  <a frame= "conv" href="../EOAttribute.html#//apple_ref/java/instm/EOAttribute/setServerTimeZone">setServerTimeZone</a> method.If you alter the server time zone, the adaptor automatically convertsdates as they pass into and out of the server.</p><br><a name = "CHCCEBCE"><h2>Working with Custom DataTypes</h2></a><p>When you create a new model, EOModeler maps each attributein your model to one of the primitive data types the adaptor knowshow to manipulate: String, Number, java.math.BigDecimal, NSData,and NSDate. For example, suppose you have a <b>photo</b> attributethat's stored in the database as a LONG RAW. When you create anew model, this attribute is mapped to NSData. However, NSData isjust an object wrapper for binary data-for instance, it doesn'thave any methods for operating on images, which would limit whatyou'd be able to do with the image in your application. This isa case in which you'd probably choose to use a custom data type,such as com.apple.yellow.application.NSImage.</p><p>For a custom data type to be usable in Enterprise ObjectsFramework, it must supply methods for importing and exporting itselfas one of the primitive types so that it can be read from and writtento the database. Specifically, to use a custom data type you needto do the following:</p><ul><li>Set the attribute's value class using the method  <a frame= "conv" href="../EOAttribute.html#//apple_ref/java/instm/EOAttribute/setValueClassName">setValueClassName</a>. </li><li>Set the factory method that will be used to create instancesof your class from raw data using the method  <a frame= "conv" href="../EOAttribute.html#//apple_ref/java/instm/EOAttribute/setValueFactoryMethodName">setValueFactoryMethodName</a>.</li><li>Set the type of the argument that should be passed to thefactory method using the method  <a frame= "conv" href="../EOAttribute.html#//apple_ref/java/instm/EOAttribute/setFactoryMethodArgumentType">setFactoryMethodArgumentType</a>.</li><li>Set the conversion method that is used to convert your databack into one of the primitive data types the adaptor can work withusing the method  <a frame= "conv" href="../EOAttribute.html#//apple_ref/java/instm/EOAttribute/setAdaptorValueConversionMethodName">setAdaptorValueConversionMethodName</a>;this enables the data to be stored in the database.</li></ul><p>If an EOAttribute represents a binary column in the database,the factory method argument type can be either  <a frame= "conv" href="../EOAttribute.html#CEHHBICC">FactoryMethodArgumentIsData</a> or  <a frame= "conv" href="../EOAttribute.html#CEHJHJIH">FactoryMethodArgumentIsBytes</a>, indicatingthat the method takes an NSData object or raw bytes as an argument.If the EOAttribute represents a string or character column, thefactory method argument type can be either  <a frame= "conv" href="../EOAttribute.html#CEHHDJAH">FactoryMethodArgumentIsString</a> or <code>FactoryMethodArgumentIsBytes</code><b></b>,indicating that the method takes a String object or raw bytes asan argument. These types apply when fetching custom values.</p><p>Instead of setting the class information programmatically,you can use the Attributes Inspector in EOModeler, which is morecommon. For more information, see the chapter "Advanced Enterprise ObjectsModeling" in the <i>Enterprise Objects Framework Developer'sGuide</i>.</p><br><h2>Fetching Custom Values</h2><p>Custom values are created during fetching in EOAdaptorChannel's  <a frame= "conv" href="../EOAdaptorChannel.html#//apple_ref/java/instm/EOAdaptorChannel/fetchRow">fetchRow</a> method.This method fetches data in the external (server) type and convertsit to a value object, applying the custom value factory method ( <a frame= "conv" href="../EOAttribute.html#//apple_ref/java/instm/EOAttribute/valueFactoryMethod">valueFactoryMethod</a>)to convert a value into the custom class if necessary. Once the valueis converted, the EOAdaptorChannel puts it into the dictionary forthe row being fetched.</p><br><h2>Converting Custom Values</h2><p>Custom values are converted back to binary or character datain EOAdaptorChannel's  <a frame= "conv" href="../EOAdaptorChannel.html#//apple_ref/java/instm/EOAdaptorChannel/evaluateExpression">evaluateExpression</a> method.For each value in the EOSQLExpression to be evaluated, the EOAdaptorChannelsends the appropriate EOAttribute an  <a frame= "conv" href="../EOAttribute.html#//apple_ref/java/instm/EOAttribute/adaptorValueByConvertingAttributeValue">adaptorValueByConvertingAttributeValue</a> messageto convert it. If the value is any of the standard value classes,it's returned unchanged. If the value is of a custom class, though,it's converted by applying the conversion method ( <a frame= "conv" href="../EOAttribute.html#//apple_ref/java/instm/EOAttribute/adaptorValueConversionMethod">adaptorValueConversionMethod</a>)specified in the EOAttribute.</p><br><a name = "CEHEAHAG"><h2>SQL Statement Formats</h2></a><p>In addition to mapping database values to object values, anEOAttribute can alter the way values are selected, inserted, andupdated in the database by defining special format strings. Theseformat strings allow a client application to extend its reach rightdown to the server for certain operations. For example, you mightwant to view an employee's salary on a yearly basis, without defininga derived attribute as in a previous example. In this case, youcould set the salary attribute's SELECT statement format to "salary* 12" (with  <a frame= "conv" href="../EOAttribute.html#//apple_ref/java/instm/EOAttribute/setReadFormat">setReadFormat</a>) and the INSERT andUPDATE statement formats to "salary / 12" ( <a frame= "conv" href="../EOAttribute.html#//apple_ref/java/instm/EOAttribute/setWriteFormat">setWriteFormat</a>). Thus, whenever yourapplication retrieves values for the salary attribute they'remultiplied by 12, and when it writes values back to the databasethey're divided by 12.</p><p>Your application can use any legal SQL value expression ina format string, and can even access server-specific features suchas functions and stored procedures (see EOEntity's  <a frame= "conv" href="../EOEntity.html#//apple_ref/java/instm/EOEntity/setStoredProcedure">setStoredProcedure</a> method descriptionfor more information). Accessing server-specific features can offeryour application great flexibility in dealing with its server, butdoes limit its portability. You're responsible for ensuring thatyour SQL is well-formed and will be understood by the database server.</p><p>Format strings for the  <a frame= "conv" href="../EOAttribute.html#//apple_ref/java/instm/EOAttribute/setReadFormat">setReadFormat</a> and  <a frame= "conv" href="../EOAttribute.html#//apple_ref/java/instm/EOAttribute/setWriteFormat">setWriteFormat</a> methods should use"%P" as the substitution character for the value that is beingformatted. "%@" will not work. For example:</p><blockquote><pre>myAttribute.setReadFormat("TO_UPPER(%P)");myAttribute.setWriteFormat("TO_LOWER(%P)");</pre></blockquote><br><p>Instead of setting the read and write formats programmatically,you can set them in EOModeler, which is more common.
