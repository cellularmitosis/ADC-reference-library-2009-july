<p><h3>Class At a Glance:</h3>

<p><dl><dt><h4>Purpose</h4>

</dl>An EOMasterDetailAssociation binds one EODisplayGroup (the detail) to a relationship in another (the master), so that the detail EODisplayGroup contains the destination objects for the object selected in the master. The EODisplayGroups' data sources also operate in a master-detail arrangement, meaning changes to one are immediately reflected in the other.<p>

<dl><dt><h4>Usable With</h4>

<h3>Class Description </h3>

</a>An EOMasterDetailAssociation binds two EODisplayGroups together in a master-detail relationship, where the detail EODisplayGroup shows the destination objects for the relationship of the master EODisplayGroup. In this arrangement, the detail EODisplayGroup's data source must be an EODetailDataSource. The detail objects are taken directly from the selected object in the master EODisplayGroup, so that changes to the objects in one EODisplayGroup are instantly reflected in the other.<p>

By contrast, with an EOMasterPeerAssociation, the two EODisplayGroups are independent of each other. In a master-peer setup, insertions and deletions in the detail EODisplayGroup don't affect the corresponding relationship property of the selected object in the master EODisplayGroup. Master-peer setups are more appropriate when no insertions or deletions will be made in the detail EODisplayGroup. See the EOMasterPeerAssociation class specification for more information.<p>

<h3> Example</h3>

</a>Suppose you have a master EODisplayGroup that presents Movie objects and a detail EODisplayGroup that presents Talent objects. An EOMasterDetailAssociation between the two, bound to the "directors" key, causes the Talent EODisplayGroup to contain the directors for the first Movie object selected in the Movie EODisplayGroup. Inserting a new director into the detail EODisplayGroup also adds it to the relationship property of the selected Movie object.<p>

<h3>Instance Methods </h3>

</a><a name="95">

<h4> <a name="//apple_ref/occ/instm/EOMasterDetailAssociation/priority">priority</a></h4>

</a>- (EOObserverPriority)<B>priority </B><p>

Returns EOObserverPrioritySecond (one notch above the default priority). This guarantees that changes in the master are propagated to the detail before any other updates are made.<p>
