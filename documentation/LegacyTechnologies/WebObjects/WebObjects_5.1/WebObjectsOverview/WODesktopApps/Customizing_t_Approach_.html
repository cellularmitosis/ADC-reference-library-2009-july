It's very similar to writing customrules for Direct to Web applications. As with Direct to Web applications,all the information about how to configure a Direct to Java Client applicationis stored in the form of rules. The default rules generate the defaultDirect to Java Client application. Adding new rules that overrideor supplement the default rules is an easy-to-maintain approachthat doesn't interfere with your use of the assistant. You writerules with the Rule Editor, the same application used for writingrules in Direct to Web applications. For more information, see  <a href="../D2W/Direct_to_W_pplications.html#TPXREF106">"Developing a Direct to Web Application"</a>.</p><p>There are also some more specialized ways to change the wayDirect to Java Client works. For example, you can get the preciseuser interface layout for a particular window by freezing the interfaceand supplying a nib file (created in Interface Builder the way youdo for regular Java Client applications). As another example, Directto Java Client provides hooks you can use to introduce custom commandsinto an application's main menu. Additionally, you can also subclassDirect to Java Client classes to change the way an application performsa particular task or to add new functionality to the default set.</p><p>Direct to Java Client was designed to be flexible and extensible,so there are numerous customization approaches. There are simpleapproaches that are code-free and maintainable (using the assistantand writing custom rules), there are more specialized approachesthat are complex and require a lot of work, and there's everythingin between. You can achieve almost any effect that you need. It'sgenerally simply a question of which technique to use and what trade-offsyou're willing to make.</p><br><a href="Creating_th_Non_Direct_.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/previous.gif" border="0"></a><a href="../j2ee/index.html" target="_top"><img src="../images/next.gif" border="0"></a>&nbsp;<br><br><p><hr><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">&#169; 2002 Apple Computer, Inc.
