MacintoshSample Code Notes_____________________________________________________________________________                                                  Developer Technical Support#1:	SampleWritten by:	Darin Adler, Mark Bennett, and Jim ReekesVersions:			1.00						August 1988					1.01						November 1988					1.02						April 1989					1.03						June 1989					1.04						June 1992					1.05						October 1994Components:			Sample.p				June 1, 1989					Sample.c				June 1, 1989					SampleInit.c			June 2, 1992					Sample.a				June 1, 1989					Sample.inc1.a			June 1, 1989					SampleMisc.a			June 1, 1989					Sample.r				June 1, 1989					Sample.h				June 1, 1989					PSample.make			June 1, 1989					CSample.make			June 1, 1989					ASample.make			June 1, 1989					CSample.¹				June 2, 1992					CSample.¹.rsrc			June 2, 1992____________________________________________________________________________Major changes since 1.0Revamped the way that memory availability is checked and handled at initialization.  Substantially changed the way windows are closed.  Added an error message dialog to better inform users, and improved error handling in general.  Finally, put a funny hack into the C version so we could call _PurgeSpace under MPW 2.0.2.Search for Ò1.01Ó in the code to find all the specific changes.Major changes since 1.01Removed all dependencies on MPW 2.0; this version requires MPW 3.0 or later.  Improved TrapAvailable to handle differences between machines prior to the Macintosh II and the Macintosh II and later models.Search for Ò1.02Ó in the code to find all the specific changes.Major Changes for 1.04This version requires MPW 3.2 or THINK C 5.0Sample now works with THINK C 5.0.This involved separating Sample.c, the original C version, into twoseparate files, one for segment Main, and one for Segment Initialize.This was due to the way that THINK C handles its segmentation.Also a THINK C project file and resource (.rsrc) file were created.In Sample.inc1.a, some data structure EQUates were commented outbecause they were added to the MPW 3.2 header files.Major Changes for 1.05Updated to Universal Interfaces for ETO #16._____________________________________________________________________________Sample is an example application that demonstrates how to initialize the commonly used Toolbox managers, operate successfully under MultiFinder, handle desk accessories, and create, grow, and zoom windows.It does not, by any means, demonstrate all the techniques you need for a large application.  In particular, Sample does not cover exception handling, multiple windows or documents, sophisticated memory management, printing, or undo, all of which are vital parts of a normal full-sized application.This application is an example of the form of a Macintosh application; it is not a template.  It is not intended to be used as a foundation for the next world-class, best-selling, 600K application.  A stick figure drawing of the human body may be a good example of the form for a painting, but that does not mean it should be used as the basis for the next Mona Lisa.We recommend that you review this program or TESample before beginning a new application.
