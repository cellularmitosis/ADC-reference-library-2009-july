<h2> Session Code</h2>
</a><a name="4945">
<em>Sessions</em> are periods during which one user is accessing your application. Because users on different clients may be accessing your application at the same time, a single application may have more than one session accessing it at a time (see <a href="SessionCode.html#5882">Figure 3</a>). Each session has its own copy of the components that its user has requested. <p>

You perform tasks that affect a single session and store variables that persist throughout a session in the <em>session code file</em>. The session code file is named Session and has the appropriate extension (<strong>Session.wos</strong>, <strong>Session.java</strong>, or <strong>Session.m</strong>). <p>
