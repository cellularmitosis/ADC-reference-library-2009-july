/*
    How It Works
    ------------
    The basic idea behind this module is that it uses per-thread storage to keep 
    track of an Apple event reply for any given thread.  The first time that the 
    thread calls AESendMessageThreadSafeSynchronous, the per-thread storage will 
    not be initialised and the code will grab an Apple event reply port and 
    assign it to the per-thread storage.  Subsequent calls to AESendMessageThreadSafeSynchronous 
    will continue to use that port.  When the thread dies, pthreads will automatically 
    call the destructor for the per-thread storage, and that will clean up the port.
    
    Because we can't dispose of the reply port (without triggering the Apple 
    Event Manager bug that's the reason we wrote this code in the first place), 
    the destructor doesn't actually dispose of the port.  Rather, it adds the 
    port to a pool of ports that are available for reuse.  The next time a thread 
    needs to allocate a port, it will grab it from the pool rather than allocating 
    it from scratch.

    This technique means that the code still 'leaks' Apple event reply ports, but 
    the size of the leak is limited to the maximum number of threads that you run 
    simultaneously.  This isn't a problem in practice.

// The PerThreadStorage structure is a trivial wrapper around the Mach port.  
// I added this because I need to attach this structure a thread using 
// per-thread storage.  The API for that (<x-man-page://3/pthread_setspecific>) 
// is pointer based.  I could've just cast the Mach port to a (void *), but 
// that's ugly because of a) pointer size issues (are pointers always bigger than 
// ints?), and b) because it implies an equivalent between NULL and MACH_PORT_NULL.
// Given this, I simply decided to create a structure to wrap the Mach port.
