JPEG Sample This sample demonstrates how to compress and decompress JPEG images with QuickTime. We use the FCompressImage function but the CompressImage counterpart function could also be used. Although this sample strictly demonstrates JPEG compression/decompression you could use this as a framework for other types of compression (except for the decoding of the JPEG header).Report Bugs to:Mike Marinkovichmarink@apple.comModification History--------------------4/3/96		MWM 	Initial coding	2/97	    MWM		fixed some memory leaks and has it parse the JPEG further  to determine what the contents are.
