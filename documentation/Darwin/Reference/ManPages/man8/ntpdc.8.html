NTPDC(8)                  BSD System Manager's Manual                 NTPDC(8)

<b>NAME</b>
     <b>ntpdc</b> -- special NTP query program

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
     <b>ntpdc</b> [<b>-ilnps</b>] [<b>-c</b> <u>command</u>] [<u>host</u> <u>...</u>]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
     The <b>ntpdc</b> utility is used to query the <a href="ntpd.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/ntpd">ntpd(8)</a> daemon about its current state and to request changes in
     that state.  The program may be run either in interactive mode or controlled using command line argu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ments.&nbsp;arguments.</font>
     ments.  Extensive state and statistics information is available through the <b>ntpdc</b> interface.  In addi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion,&nbsp;addition,</font>
     tion, nearly all the configuration options which can be specified at startup using ntpd's configuration
     file may also be specified at run time using <b>ntpdc</b>.

     The following options are available:

     <b>-c</b> <u>command</u>
             The following argument is interpreted as an interactive format command and is added to the list
             of commands to be executed on the specified <!-- a -->host(s)<!-- /a -->.  Multiple <b>-c</b> options may be given.

     <b>-i</b>      Force <b>ntpdc</b> to operate in interactive mode.  Prompts will be written to the standard output and
             commands read from the standard input.

     <b>-l</b>      Obtain a list of peers which are known to the <!-- a -->server(s)<!-- /a -->.  This switch is equivalent to `-c
             listpeers'.

     <b>-n</b>      Output all host addresses in dotted-quad numeric format rather than converting to the canonical
             host names.

     <b>-p</b>      Print a list of the peers known to the server as well as a summary of their state.  This is
             equivalent to `-c peers'.

     <b>-s</b>      Print a list of the peers known to the server as well as a summary of their state, but in a
             slightly different format than the <b>-p</b> switch.  This is equivalent to `-c dmpeers'.

     If one or more request options are included on the command line when <b>ntpdc</b> is executed, each of the
     requests will be sent to the NTP servers running on each of the hosts given as command line arguments,
     or on localhost by default.  If no request options are given, <b>ntpdc</b> will attempt to read commands from
     the standard input and execute these on the NTP server running on the first host given on the command
     line, again defaulting to localhost when no other host is specified.  The <b>ntpdc</b> utility will prompt for
     commands if the standard input is a terminal device.

     The <b>ntpdc</b> utility uses NTP mode 7 packets to communicate with the NTP server, and hence can be used to
     query any compatible server on the network which permits it.  Note that since NTP is a UDP protocol
     this communication will be somewhat unreliable, especially over large distances in terms of network
     topology.  The <b>ntpdc</b> utility makes no attempt to retransmit requests, and will time requests out if the
     remote host is not heard from within a suitable timeout time.

     The operation of <b>ntpdc</b> are specific to the particular implementation of the <a href="ntpd.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/ntpd">ntpd(8)</a> daemon and can be
     expected to work only with this and maybe some previous versions of the daemon.  Requests from a remote
     <b>ntpdc</b> utility which affect the state of the local server must be authenticated, which requires both the
     remote program and local server share a common key and key identifier.  Specifying a command line
     option other than <b>-i</b> or <b>-n</b> will cause the specified query (queries) to be sent to the indicated <!-- a -->host(s)<!-- /a -->
     immediately.  Otherwise, <b>ntpdc</b> will attempt to read interactive format commands from the standard
     input.

   <b>Interactive</b> <b>Commands</b>
     Interactive format commands consist of a keyword followed by zero to four arguments.  Only enough char-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">acters&nbsp;characters</font>
     acters of the full keyword to uniquely identify the command need be typed.  The output of a command is
     normally sent to the standard output, but optionally the output of individual commands may be sent to a
     file by appending a `&gt;', followed by a file name, to the command line.

     A number of interactive format commands are executed entirely within the <b>ntpdc</b> utility itself and do
     not result in NTP mode 7 requests being sent to a server.  These are described following.

     <b>?</b> <u>command</u><b>_</b><u>keyword</u>

     <b>help</b> <u>command</u><b>_</b><u>keyword</u>
             A <b>?</b> will print a list of all the command keywords known to this incarnation of <b>ntpdc</b>.  A <b>?</b> fol-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lowed&nbsp;followed</font>
             lowed by a command keyword will print function and usage information about the command.  This
             command is probably a better source of information about <a href="ntpq.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/ntpq">ntpq(8)</a> than this manual page.

     <b>delay</b> <u>milliseconds</u>
             Specify a time interval to be added to timestamps included in requests which require authenti-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cation.&nbsp;authentication.</font>
             cation.  This is used to enable (unreliable) server reconfiguration over long delay network
             paths or between machines whose clocks are unsynchronized.  Actually the server does not now
             require timestamps in authenticated requests, so this command may be obsolete.

     <b>host</b> <u>hostname</u>
             Set the host to which future queries will be sent.  Hostname may be either a host name or a
             numeric address.

     <b>hostnames</b> [<b>yes</b> | <b>no</b>]
             If <b>yes</b> is specified, host names are printed in information displays.  If <b>no</b> is specified,
             numeric addresses are printed instead.  The default is <b>yes</b>, unless modified using the command
             line <b>-n</b> switch.

     <b>keyid</b> <u>keyid</u>
             This command allows the specification of a key number to be used to authenticate configuration
             requests.  This must correspond to a key number the server has been configured to use for this
             purpose.

     <b>quit</b>    Exit <b>ntpdc</b>.

     <b>passwd</b>  This command prompts you to type in a password (which will not be echoed) which will be used to
             authenticate configuration requests.  The password must correspond to the key configured for
             use by the NTP server for this purpose if such requests are to be successful.

     <b>timeout</b> <u>milliseconds</u>
             Specify a timeout period for responses to server queries.  The default is about 8000 millisec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">onds.&nbsp;milliseconds.</font>
             onds.  Note that since <b>ntpdc</b> retries each query once after a timeout, the total waiting time
             for a timeout will be twice the timeout value set.

   <b>Control</b> <b>Message</b> <b>Commands</b>
     Query commands result in NTP mode 7 packets containing requests for information being sent to the
     server.  These are read-only commands in that they make no modification of the server configuration
     state.

     <b>listpeers</b>
             Obtains and prints a brief list of the peers for which the server is maintaining state.  These
             should include all configured peer associations as well as those peers whose stratum is such
             that they are considered by the server to be possible future synchonization candidates.

     <b>peers</b>   Obtains a list of peers for which the server is maintaining state, along with a summary of that
             state.  Summary information includes the address of the remote peer, the local interface
             address (0.0.0.0 if a local address has yet to be determined), the stratum of the remote peer
             (a stratum of 16 indicates the remote peer is unsynchronized), the polling interval, in sec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">onds,&nbsp;seconds,</font>
             onds, the reachability register, in octal, and the current estimated delay, offset and disper-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion&nbsp;dispersion</font>
             sion of the peer, all in seconds.

             The character in the left margin indicates the mode this peer entry is operating in.  A `+'
             denotes symmetric active, a `-' indicates symmetric passive, a `=' means the remote server is
             being polled in client mode, a `^' indicates that the server is broadcasting to this address, a
             `~' denotes that the remote peer is sending broadcasts and a `*' marks the peer the server is
             currently synchronizing to.

             The contents of the host field may be one of four forms.  It may be a host name, an IP address,
             a reference clock implementation name with its parameter or <b>REFCLK</b>(<u>implementation</u><b>_</b><u>number</u>,
             <u>parameter</u>).  On <b>hostnames</b> <b>no</b> only IP-addresses will be displayed.

     <b>dmpeers</b>
             A slightly different peer summary list.  Identical to the output of the <b>peers</b> command, except
             for the character in the leftmost column.  Characters only appear beside peers which were
             included in the final stage of the clock selection algorithm.  A `.' indicates that this peer
             was cast off in the falseticker detection, while a `+' indicates that the peer made it through.
             A `*' denotes the peer the server is currently synchronizing with.

     <b>showpeer</b> <u>peer</u><b>_</b><u>address</u> <u>...</u>
             Shows a detailed display of the current peer variables for one or more peers.  Most of these
             values are described in the NTP Version 2 specification.

     <b>pstats</b> <u>peer</u><b>_</b><u>address</u> <u>...</u>
             Show per-peer statistic counters associated with the specified <!-- a -->peer(s)<!-- /a -->.

     <b>clockinfo</b> <u>clock</u><b>_</b><u>peer</u><b>_</b><u>address</u> <u>...</u>
             Obtain and print information concerning a peer clock.  The values obtained provide information
             on the setting of fudge factors and other clock performance information.

     <b>kerninfo</b>
             Obtain and print kernel phase-lock loop operating parameters.  This information is available
             only if the kernel has been specially modified for a precision timekeeping function.

     <b>loopinfo</b> [<b>oneline</b> | <b>multiline</b>]
             Print the values of selected loop filter variables.  The loop filter is the part of NTP which
             deals with adjusting the local system clock.  The `offset' is the last offset given to the loop
             filter by the packet processing code.  The `frequency' is the frequency error of the local
             clock in parts-per-million (ppm).  The `time_const' controls the stiffness of the phase-lock
             loop and thus the speed at which it can adapt to oscillator drift.  The `watchdog timer' value
             is the number of seconds which have elapsed since the last sample offset was given to the loop
             filter.  The <b>oneline</b> and <b>multiline</b> options specify the format in which this information is to
             be printed, with <b>multiline</b> as the default.

     <b>sysinfo</b>
             Print a variety of system state variables, i.e., state related to the local server.  All except
             the last four lines are described in the NTP Version 3 specification, RFC-1305.

             The `system flags' show various system flags, some of which can be set and cleared by the
             <b>enable</b> and <b>disable</b> configuration commands, respectively.  These are the <b>auth</b>, <b>bclient</b>, <b>monitor</b>,
             <b>pll</b>, <b>pps</b> and <b>stats</b> flags.  See the <a href="ntpd.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/ntpd">ntpd(8)</a> documentation for the meaning of these flags.  There
             are two additional flags which are read only, the <b>kernel_pll</b> and <b>kernel_pps</b>.  These flags indi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cate&nbsp;indicate</font>
             cate the synchronization status when the precision time kernel modifications are in use.  The
             `kernel_pll' indicates that the local clock is being disciplined by the kernel, while the
             `kernel_pps' indicates the kernel discipline is provided by the PPS signal.

             The `stability' is the residual frequency error remaining after the system frequency correction
             is applied and is intended for maintenance and debugging.  In most architectures, this value
             will initially decrease from as high as 500 ppm to a nominal value in the range .01 to 0.1 ppm.
             If it remains high for some time after starting the daemon, something may be wrong with the
             local clock, or the value of the kernel variable <u>kern.clockrate.tick</u> may be incorrect.

             The `broadcastdelay' shows the default broadcast delay, as set by the <b>broadcastdelay</b> configura-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;configuration</font>
             tion command.

             The `authdelay' shows the default authentication delay, as set by the <b>authdelay</b> configuration
             command.

     <b>sysstats</b>
             Print statistics counters maintained in the protocol module.

     <b>memstats</b>
             Print statistics counters related to memory allocation code.

     <b>iostats</b>
             Print statistics counters maintained in the input-output module.

     <b>timerstats</b>
             Print statistics counters maintained in the timer/event queue support code.

     <b>reslist</b>
             Obtain and print the server's restriction list.  This list is (usually) printed in sorted order
             and may help to understand how the restrictions are applied.

     <b>monlist</b> [<u>version</u>]
             Obtain and print traffic counts collected and maintained by the monitor facility.  The version
             number should not normally need to be specified.

     <b>clkbug</b> <u>clock</u><b>_</b><u>peer</u><b>_</b><u>address</u> <u>...</u>
             Obtain debugging information for a reference clock driver.  This information is provided only
             by some clock drivers and is mostly undecodable without a copy of the driver source in hand.

   <b>Runtime</b> <b>Configuration</b> <b>Requests</b>
     All requests which cause state changes in the server are authenticated by the server using a configured
     NTP key (the facility can also be disabled by the server by not configuring a key).  The key number and
     the corresponding key must also be made known to <b>ntpdc</b>.  This can be done using the <b>keyid</b> and <b>passwd</b>
     commands, the latter of which will prompt at the terminal for a password to use as the encryption key.
     You will also be prompted automatically for both the key number and password the first time a command
     which would result in an authenticated request to the server is given.  Authentication not only pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">vides&nbsp;provides</font>
     vides verification that the requester has permission to make such changes, but also gives an extra
     degree of protection again transmission errors.

     Authenticated requests always include a timestamp in the packet data, which is included in the computa-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;computation</font>
     tion of the authentication code.  This timestamp is compared by the server to its receive time stamp.
     If they differ by more than a small amount the request is rejected.  This is done for two reasons.
     First, it makes simple replay attacks on the server, by someone who might be able to overhear traffic
     on your LAN, much more difficult.  Second, it makes it more difficult to request configuration changes
     to your server from topologically remote hosts.  While the reconfiguration facility will work well with
     a server on the local host, and may work adequately between time-synchronized hosts on the same LAN, it
     will work very poorly for more distant hosts.  As such, if reasonable passwords are chosen, care is
     taken in the distribution and protection of keys and appropriate source address restrictions are
     applied, the run time reconfiguration facility should provide an adequate level of security.

     The following commands all make authenticated requests.

     <b>addpeer</b> <u>peer</u><b>_</b><u>address</u> [<u>keyid</u>] [<u>version</u>] [<b>prefer</b>]
             Add a configured peer association at the given address and operating in symmetric active mode.
             Note that an existing association with the same peer may be deleted when this command is exe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cuted,&nbsp;executed,</font>
             cuted, or may simply be converted to conform to the new configuration, as appropriate.  If the
             optional <u>keyid</u> is a nonzero integer, all outgoing packets to the remote server will have an
             authentication field attached encrypted with this key.  If the value is 0 (or not given) no
             authentication will be done.  The <u>version</u> can be 1, 2 or 3 and defaults to 3.  The <b>prefer</b> key-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">word&nbsp;keyword</font>
             word indicates a preferred peer (and thus will be used primarily for clock synchronisation if
             possible).  The preferred peer also determines the validity of the PPS signal - if the pre-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ferred&nbsp;preferred</font>
             ferred peer is suitable for synchronisation so is the PPS signal.

     <b>addserver</b> <u>peer</u><b>_</b><u>address</u> [<u>keyid</u>] [<u>version</u>] [<b>prefer</b>]
             Identical to the addpeer command, except that the operating mode is client.

     <b>broadcast</b> <u>peer</u><b>_</b><u>address</u> [<u>keyid</u>] [<u>version</u>] [<b>prefer</b>]
             Identical to the addpeer command, except that the operating mode is broadcast.  In this case a
             valid key identifier and key are required.  The <u>peer</u><b>_</b><u>address</u> parameter can be the broadcast
             address of the local network or a multicast group address assigned to NTP.  If a multicast
             address, a multicast-capable kernel is required.

     <b>unconfig</b> <u>peer</u><b>_</b><u>address</u> <u>...</u>
             This command causes the configured bit to be removed from the specified <!-- a -->peer(s)<!-- /a -->.  In many cases
             this will cause the peer association to be deleted.  When appropriate, however, the association
             may persist in an unconfigured mode if the remote peer is willing to continue on in this fash-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ion.&nbsp;fashion.</font>
             ion.

     <b>fudge</b> <u>peer</u><b>_</b><u>address</u> [<b>time1</b>] [<b>time2</b>] [<u>stratum</u>] [<u>refid</u>]
             This command provides a way to set certain data for a reference clock.  See the source listing
             for further information.

     <b>enable</b> <u>flag</u> <u>...</u>

     <b>disable</b> <u>flag</u> <u>...</u>
             These commands operate in the same way as the <b>enable</b> and <b>disable</b> configuration file commands of
             <a href="ntpd.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/ntpd">ntpd(8)</a>.  Following is a description of the flags.  Note that only the <b>auth</b>, <b>bclient</b>, <b>monitor</b>,
             <b>pll</b>, <b>pps</b> and <b>stats</b> flags can be set by <b>ntpdc</b>; the <b>pll_kernel</b> and <b>pps_kernel</b> flags are read-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">only.&nbsp;readonly.</font>
             only.

             <b>auth</b>    Enables the server to synchronize with unconfigured peers only if the peer has been
                     correctly authenticated using a trusted key and key identifier.  The default for this
                     flag is enable.

             <b>bclient</b>
                     Enables the server to listen for a message from a broadcast or multicast server, as in
                     the <b>multicastclient</b> command with default address.  The default for this flag is dis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able.&nbsp;disable.</font>
                     able.

             <b>monitor</b>
                     Enables the monitoring facility.  See the <b>monlist</b> command for further information.  The
                     default for this flag is enable.

             <b>pll</b>     Enables the server to adjust its local clock by means of NTP.  If disabled, the local
                     clock free-runs at its intrinsic time and frequency offset.  This flag is useful in
                     case the local clock is controlled by some other device or protocol and NTP is used
                     only to provide synchronization to other clients.  In this case, the local clock driver
                     is used.  See the "Reference Clock Drivers" page (available as part of the HTML docu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mentation&nbsp;documentation</font>
                     mentation provided in <u>/usr/share/doc/ntp</u>) page for further information.  The default
                     for this flag is enable.

             <b>pps</b>     Enables the pulse-per-second (PPS) signal when frequency and time is disciplined by the
                     precision time kernel modifications.  See the "A Kernel Model for Precision
                     Timekeeping" page for further information.  The default for this flag is disable.

             <b>stats</b>   Enables the statistics facility.  See the <u>Monitoring</u> <u>Options</u> section of the <a href="../man5/ntp.conf.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/ntp.conf">ntp.conf(5)</a>
                     page for further information.  The default for this flag is enable.

             <b>pll_kernel</b>
                     When the precision time kernel modifications are installed, this indicates the kernel
                     controls the clock discipline; otherwise, the daemon controls the clock discipline.

             <b>pps_kernel</b>
                     When the precision time kernel modifications are installed and a pulse-per-second (PPS)
                     signal is available, this indicates the PPS signal controls the clock discipline; oth-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">erwise,&nbsp;otherwise,</font>
                     erwise, the daemon or kernel controls the clock discipline, as indicated by the
                     <b>pll_kernel</b> flag.

     <b>restrict</b> <u>address</u> <u>mask</u> <u>flag</u> <u>...</u>
             This command operates in the same way as the <b>restrict</b> configuration file commands of <a href="ntpd.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/ntpd">ntpd(8)</a>.

     <b>unrestrict</b> <u>address</u> <u>mask</u> <u>flag</u> <u>...</u>
             Unrestrict the matching entry from the restrict list.

     <b>delrestrict</b> <u>address</u> <u>mask</u> [<b>ntpport</b>]
             Delete the matching entry from the restrict list.

     <b>readkeys</b>
             Causes the current set of authentication keys to be purged and a new set to be obtained by
             rereading the keys file (which must have been specified in the <a href="ntpd.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/ntpd">ntpd(8)</a> configuration file).
             This allows encryption keys to be changed without restarting the server.

     <b>trustedkey</b> <u>keyid</u> <u>...</u>

     <b>untrustedkey</b> <u>keyid</u> <u>...</u>
             These commands operate in the same way as the <b>trustedkey</b> and <b>untrustedkey</b> configuration file
             commands of <a href="ntpd.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/ntpd">ntpd(8)</a>.

     <b>authinfo</b>
             Returns information concerning the authentication module, including known keys and counts of
             encryptions and decryptions which have been done.

     <b>traps</b>   Display the traps set in the server.  See the source listing for further information.

     <b>addtrap</b> <u>address</u> [<u>port</u>] [<u>interface</u>]
             Set a trap for asynchronous messages.  See the source listing for further information.

     <b>clrtrap</b> <u>address</u> [<u>port</u>] [<u>interface</u>]
             Clear a trap for asynchronous messages.  See the source listing for further information.

     <b>reset</b>   Clear the statistics counters in various modules of the server.  See the source listing for
             further information.

<b>BUGS</b>
     The <b>ntpdc</b> utility is a crude hack.  Much of the information it shows is deadly boring and could only be
     loved by its implementer.  The program was designed so that new (and temporary) features were easy to
     hack in, at great expense to the program's ease of use.  Despite this, the program is occasionally use-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ful.&nbsp;useful.</font>
     ful.
