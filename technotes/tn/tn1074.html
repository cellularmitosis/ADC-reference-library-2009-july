This Note discusses someof the most common installation issues that you or your developertechnical support team may encounter and how to resolve them.</P><P id = "introtext">This Note focuses on QuickTime for Windows v 2.1.2. If you areusing an earlier version, it is recommended that you upgrade to2.1.2, since this will resolve many installation problems that mayoccur with earlier versions. You can download the latest version,which is available at&lt;<A HREF = "http://quicktime.apple.com/sw/sw.html">http://quicktime.apple.com/sw/sw.html</A>&gt;.</P><P id = "introtext">The first section of this Note discusses the dialogs that occurduring the installation of QTW 2.1.2. The second section provides youwith some useful tips for using the Control Panel to customize yourinstallation. The third section talks about common problems relatedto installation and how to resolve them. Finally, the last sectionexplains the best way to un-install QTW.</P><!-- end_intro_text --><!-- begin_date --><h3>&nbsp;Updated: [Oct 01 1996]</h3><!-- end_date -->                </TD>             </TR>          </TABLE>          <!-- end_header_box --> <BR><BR><hr width=500 align=center>          <BR><BR> <!-- begin_content --><A NAME="RTFToC1"></A><H2>Installation Dialogs Explained</H2><P>The QTW 2.1.2 installer brings up a number of dialogs to help walkyou through the installation process.</P><P>On starting the installer you may receive a message stating thatanother QuickTime program or library has been detected in memory. Itasks if you want to restart Windows. If you do not wish to restartWindows, you can simply go to your Task List, select the QuickTimetasks, and end them. However, this requires quitting the installerand then starting it again once you have ended the tasks.</P><H3>The License Agreement Dialog</H3><P>Normally, the first dialog box that appears when running theinstaller is the License Agreement Dialog. This dialog is new withQTW version 2.1.2. You should read it and click the Agree button tocontinue with installation. If you select the Disagree button, theinstallation is canceled. There may be some installations of QTW2.1.2 that do not include the license agreement dialog. This isbecause QTW application developers do have the option to remove thisdialog.</P><P align=center><img src="images/tn1074_003.gif" alt="" width=589 height=368></P><H3>The Begin Install Dialog</H3><P>The Begin Install dialog is the next to appear when you selectAgree from the previous dialog. If you choose the Help button fromthis dialog box, you will find some helpful setup information.However, there is one clarification that should be made to thisinformation. It states that you must have at least 6 MB of availablespace on your hard drive. This isn't exactly true. The finishedinstallation will take up 6 MB of disk space. However, theinstallation process actually requires just over 10 MB of disk space.So, in reality, you need approximately 10.1 MB of disk spaceavailable for installation.</P><P align=center><img src="images/tn1074_004.gif" alt="" width=355 height=197></P><H3>The Check Existing Versions Dialog</H3><P>When you choose the Install button from the Begin Install dialog,a new dialog appears: Check Existing Versions. This dialog gives youthe option to check for existing versions of QTW. If you select thisoption, the installer looks for any files from an earlierinstallation of QTW and marks them for deletion. The files won'tactually be deleted at this time. After the installation is complete,the installer looks for any remaining files marked for deletion thatwere not overwritten by the new installation, and will delete them atthat time. Be aware, however, that the installer won't checkdirectories on read-only volumes, such as CD-ROMS. Also, be awarethat the 16-bit installer will only check for existing versions of16-bit QTW files. Similarly, the 32-bit installer will only check forexisting versions of 32-bit QTW files.</P><P align=center><img src="images/tn1074_005.gif" alt="" width=414 height=168></P><P>It is recommended that you select the Check Existing Versionsoption to insure a clean install. You select it by clicking on theStart button. If you do not wish to check for existing versions, youmust select the Skip button.</P><P>Assuming that you have decided to check for any existing versionsas recommended, you now see a dialog box displaying the directoriesas they are being checked. Below the directory name are two optionsthat you may select at any time during the checking process: </P><UL>   <LI>Skip Disk: Skips checking the current disk and begins checking   the next disk.<BR><BR></li>      <LI>Skip All: Stops checking completely.      <P align=center><img src="images/tn1074_006.gif" alt="" width=412 height=167></P><BR><BR></li></UL><P>When a directory is found that contains one or more files from aearlier installation, the checking stops and the dialog notifies youof the directory name and gives you the following options: </P><UL>   <LI>Delete: Marks for deletion the QTW files within the specified   directory.<BR><BR></li>      <LI>Skip: Skips checking this directory and continues to the next.<BR><BR></li>      <LI>Skip Disk: Skips checking the current disk an begins checking   the next disk.<BR><BR></li>      <LI>Skip All: Stops checking completely.<BR><BR></li></UL><P>When checking is completed (or Skip All was selected), theComplete Install dialog appears. At this point no changes have beenmade to your system. Remember, files have only been marked fordeletion, but not actually deleted. Selecting Exit from this dialogwill leave your system untouched. Most likely, you will selectInstall, which will bring you to the Installing Files dialog.</P><P>Note: There may be some QTW 2.1.2 installations that do not giveusers this option of checking existing versions. These installerswill automatically check for existing versions with no option for theuser to cancel. This is because QTW application developers do havethe ability to make this option automatic.</P><H3>The Installing Files Dialog</H3><P>The Installing Files dialog displays a progress bar while thefiles are being installed. Any existing files with the same name willbe overwritten. Once all files are installed, any files marked fordeletion that did not get overwritten will be deleted. The progressbar will then hit 100%, which will bring up a small dialog statingUpdating INI Files, which tells you that it is updating the WIN.INIand SYSTEM.INI files, as well as the registry as appropriate on Win95and WinNT.</P><P align=center><img src="images/tn1074_007.gif" alt="" width=323 height=186></P><P>While the files are installing, the progress bar may beinterrupted by the error dialog box displayed below. To resolve this,you should first click the OK button which will cancel theinstallation. Next, make sure that you don't have the system controlpanel window open. Do not pay attention to the instructions in theerror dialog because it doesn't make sense in this situation. If,after reattempting installation, you still get the error, shut downWindows and reboot the system.</P><P align=center><img src="images/tn1074_008.gif" alt="" width=479 height=126></P><P>Next, Program Manager pops up as the installer creates a QTWprogram group for Program Manager. This is followed by the Successdialog which tells you that the installation was successful. It givesyou the option to Exit or Play Sample at this point. When you selectPlay Sample, the Movie Player is launched with the sample movie in anidle state.</P><P align=center><img src="images/tn1074_009.gif" alt="" width=368 height=178></P><P>To play the movie, you need to choose one of the following threeways to start it: </P><OL>   <LI>The keyboard method: press the spacebar, hit enter or hit   return.<BR><BR></li>      <LI>Click the play button.<BR><BR></li>      <LI>Double-click on the movie image itself.<BR><BR></li></OL>    <P>The movie will loop continuously until you stop it. Choose one   of the following three ways to stop the movie: </P><OL>      <LI>The keyboard method: press the spacebar, hit enter or hit   return.<BR><BR></li>      <LI>Click the pause button (which previously was the play button)<BR><BR></li>      <LI>Single-click on the movie image.<BR><BR></li></OL><P>When you select Play Sample and the Movie Player is launched, itis at that point that your installation is complete. If you selectExit instead of Play Sample, a dialog will appear asking if you aresure you don't want to play the sample movie. When you click Yes,installation is complete. If you click No, the Success dialogreappears so that you again have the option to play the sample movie.The only purpose of playing the sample movie is to verify that theinstallation was successful.</P><P align=center><img src="images/tn1074_010.gif" alt="" width=313 height=284></P><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></p><P><A NAME="RTFToC2"></A></P><H2>Control Panel Tips To Customize Installation</H2><P>The QuickTime Control Panel is useful to verify your setup. Youcan also use it to customize your installation. See theTroubleshooting section later in this Note for instances when you maywant to modify the QuickTime Control Panel. Here are some QuickTimeControl Panel tips: </P><H3>Tip #1</H3><P><CITE>Click the Verify Setup button from the QuickTime ControlPanel.</CITE> This will either verify a successful installation witha message No Problems Found, or it will display any missing filesdesignating an unsuccessful installation.</P><H3>Tip #2</H3><P><CITE>Don't use the Apply button when you've made modifications tothe QuickTime Control Panel. </CITE> The Apply button will writechanges to the QTW.INI file, but will not take effect until after theControl Panel is closed. Therefore, it is better to use the Closebutton, which asks you if you want to apply your changes if you have,in fact, made changes. When you select Yes, the modifications areactually applied and the Control Panel is closed at the same time.</P><H3>Tip #3</H3><P><CITE>Restart Windows after making modifications to the QuickTimeControl Panel, especially if you were having problems.</CITE> Thisinsures that changes will take effect when you next start MoviePlayer.</P><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></p><H2><A NAME="RTFToC3"></A>Troubleshooting</H2><P>This section contains error messages and problems related toinstallation and how to resolve them.</P><P>In general, for most installation problems you should first checkthe QTW version that is installed. If it is a version earlier that2.1.2, the software should be upgraded. This will resolve a lot ofinstallation problems. The interactive way to determine the installedversion of QuickTime for Windows is to run Movie Player (player.exein the Windows directory) and click on Help|About Movie Player.</P><H3>Errors During Installation</H3><P>If the installer reports an error indicating that it can't writeto a file or that the file is being shared by another application,reboot the system.</P><P>If the installer reports an error during the "modifying .INIfiles" stage, the problem is that your WIN.INI file is too big. TheQTW installer calls Windows' SetProfileString(), which fails ifWin.ini is larger than 32KB. This is most likely caused by the filebecoming clogged with hundreds of lines of PostScript fontdeclarations or something similar.</P><P>The workaround is to rename WIN.INI to something else, theninstall QuickTime for Windows. This creates a new WIN.INI that hasjust a few lines in it. You can then use a text editor to move thoselines to the appropriate sections near the beginning of the big .INIfile. Delete the small WIN.INI and rename the big file back toWIN.INI.</P><H3>An Error During Re-Install</H3><P>Sometimes when you do a re-install you may receive an errormessage saying that the QTINSTAL.EXE file is missing. If you look forthis file, you will find that it really is missing! Because this isyour executable installer file, you need to re-install from theoriginal installation location (CD-ROM, network server, diskette,etc.)</P><H3>Fixing Audio Break-up Problems</H3><P>Some audio cards and drivers use a large amount of CPU time. Thiscan cause break-up of the audio accompanied by poor videoperformance. The original SoundBlaster Pro, for example, has problemswhen the total audio data rate exceeds 22050 bytes per second. Toimprove performance, the audio data rate can be limited by the use ofseveral settings in the QTW Control Panel's More|Audio screen. Hereare two ways to limit the rate to 22050: </P><OL>   <LI>For mono audio at 22050 bytes per second, set:       <P>Sample Rate Requested hz: 22050</P>      <P>Sample Depth: 8 bit</P>      <P>Channels: Mono</P><BR><BR></li>      <LI>For stereo audio at 22050 bytes per second, set:       <P>Sample Rate Requested hz: 11025</P>      <P>Sample Depth: 8 bit</P>      <P>Channels: Stereo</P>      <P>Note: Automatic Rate Adjustment should only be selected if your   only performance problem is the audio slowly drifting out of synch   with the video.</P>      <P>To save these settings, click Close, and restart Windows (to be   on the safe side) before retesting performance.</P><BR><BR></li></OL><H3>Audio-Video Synchronization Problems</H3><P>QTW 2.1.2 contains an automatic-audio-rate-adjustment featurewhich was meant to correct audio playback problems on systems thatcontain an ESS sound chip. While this goal is usually achieved, onsome systems undesirable side-effects such as high-pitched sound mayoccur.</P><P>The solution to this problem (when it occurs) is as follows: </P><BLOCKQUOTE><OL>   <LI>Go to the QuickTime Control Panel and select More|Audio.<BR><BR></li>      <LI>Change the Sample Rate-Requested hz: to "default".<BR><BR></li>      <LI>Make sure that Automatic Rate Adjustment is selected.<BR><BR></li>      <LI>Click Close, and then restart Windows (to be on the safe   side).<BR><BR></li>      <LI>Play the calibration movie, SAMPLE.MOV, from the Windows   directory. This will recalibrate the...sound chip.<BR><BR></li>      <LI>Exit Movie Player and go back to the QuickTime Control Panel.<BR><BR></li>      <LI>Select More|Audio and deselect Automatic Rate Adjustment.<BR><BR></li>      <LI>Click Apply, and then Close. Sound should now be fine.<BR><BR></li></OL></BLOCKQUOTE><H3>Encountering DynaLink Errors</H3><P>A Dynalink error may occur if, for some reason, there are olderversions of QTW files installed. This would only occur in 16-bit QTW.</P><P>To resolve this problem, you should first try reinstalling QTW2.1.2, making sure that you select the Check for Existing Versionsoption during installation. See the Installation Dialogs section ofthis Note for more details.</P><P>If the problem still occurs, you are probably running anapplication from a read-only volume, such as a CD-ROM, which has anolder version of QTW on it. Your only option at this point is touninstall QTW 2.1.2 (see the section Un-installing QuickTime forWindows). Then you can install your application from the CD-ROM whichwill install the required early version of QTW.</P><H3>Fixing Video Draw Problems</H3><P>If QuickTime for Windows doesn't recognize or falsely recognizesthe display board, or if you simply suspect that your problems arerelated to drawing the Movie image on the screen, you need to changethe Video Draw Method. The recommended way to do this is with theQuickTime Control Panel; however, it can also be done by editing theQTW.INI file.</P><P>To do this from the Control Panel, follow these steps: </P><BLOCKQUOTE><OL>   <LI>Select More|Video|Draw Method from the QuickTime Control   Panel.<BR><BR></li>      <LI>Change the Optimization to: Driver.<BR><BR></li>      <LI>Click Close, and restart Windows (to be on the safe side).<BR><BR></li>      <LI>If that doesn't work, try the other Optimizations. They are   listed in order of speed (fastest to slowest), so try the faster   ones first.<BR><BR></li></OL></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Editing the QTW.INI file, however, is <CITE>not</CITE>recommended. The reason is that it's easy to get it wrong. The onlytime you might have to do this is if your video is so messed up thatyou can't even bring up the Control panel without crashing. In thatcase, you need to edit the QTW.INI file.</P><P>To do this by editing the QTW.INI file, add or change the [Video]section of QTW.INI to read: </P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=550><TR>	<td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><pre>  [Video]  Optimize=Driver</pre>	</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P>Note that this is how you fix 16-bit QTW. To fix 32-bit QTW, youchange the Section name from [Video] to [Video 32].</P><P>If 'Driver' doesn't work, try 'BMP', 'RAW', and 'DIB'.</P><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></p><H2><A NAME="RTFToC4"></A>Un-Installing QuickTime for Windows</H2><P>QuickTime for Windows v. 2.1.2 has an un-installer that works withWindows 95 and Windows NT. It does not work, however, with Windows3.1.</P><P>There are several reasons why you may want to uninstall QTW 2.1.2.For example, you may want to free up disk space, or you may need torun an application from a CD-ROM that requires an older version ofQTW. You should not un-install QTW to free up memory because, whenQTW is not being called, it is not loaded into memory at all andtherefore does not use any unnecessary overhead.</P><P>If you must uninstall QTW 2.1.2 and you're using Windows 3.1,remove all files in the Windows directory and Windows Systemdirectory with the date of 8/27/96 and time stamp of 2: 12: 00AM. Theonly file you do not want to delete is the 2.1.2 installer file, sothat you can re-install QTW 2.1.2 in the future. This is the safestway to manually un-install QTW.</P><P>Follow these steps to manually un-install QTW: </P><BLOCKQUOTE><OL>   <LI>In the File Manager, go to the Windows directory.<BR><BR></li>      <LI>Select View|Sort by date<BR><BR></li>      <LI>Click and select the first file with the date of 8/27/96 and   time stamp of 2: 12: 00AM.<BR><BR></li>      <LI>Shift-Click the last file in the list with the same date and   time stamp so that all files with this date and time stamp are   highlighted.<BR><BR></li>      <LI>Control-Click on the QTINSTAL.EXE file so that you don't   remove the 2.1.2 installer. This file is no longer highlighted.      <P>Note: For 32-bit, it's QT32INST.EXE, not QTINSTAL.EXE.</P><BR><BR></li>      <LI>Delete the highlighted files.<BR><BR></li>      <LI>Repeat steps 1 through 6 for the Windows System directory but   skip step 5, since the QTINSTAL.EXE file doesn't exist in this   directory.<BR><BR></li></OL></BLOCKQUOTE><H2>Playing MPEG Videos Through QTW, But Only Under Special Configurations</H2><P>Currently, there are no known MPEG boards that work with QTW. In the past, the REALmagic MPEG boards did work with QTW; the latest REALmagic boards, however, do not. Those users with old REALmagic boards may be able to play MPEG videos through QTW, but only under the following configuration: </P><OL TYPE="1" START="1">    <LI>Windows 3.1<BR><BR></li>    <LI>One of the discontinued REALmagic boards: ReelMagic, REALmagic Lite, or REALmagic Rave<BR><BR></li>    <LI>The discontinued REALmagic driver, version 2.01.<BR><BR></li></OL> <P>Most users may not have this configuration and, therefore, must play MPEG videos using the application or method provided with their MPEG board.</P><P>Because there was support for MPEG through QTW in the past, versions of QTW 2.0.0 - 2.1.0 associate .MPG files with the QuickTime Movie Player. This means that when you open a .MPG file, Movie Player will launch and attempt to play the MPEG video. Now that MPEG support for QTW is no longer available, Movie Player will still launch but display a message stating that QuickTime cannot play this video. The problem was fixed in QTW 2.1.1 by removing the .MPG file association.</P><P>This file association problem in the earlier versions led some hardware manufacturers to ask their customers not to install QuickTime or applications that install QuickTime. These manufacturers are not aware of the fix. Thus, any users concerned about installing QTW because their computer manufacturer recommends against it should feel safe to install QTW 2.1.2 and applications that install QTW 2.1.1 or later.</P><H3>Steps to Insure That an Old Installer Doesn't Associate .MPG Files With QuickTime</H3><P>If you are installing an application that installs a version of QTW earlier than version 2.1.1, you should follow the steps below to insure that the old installer doesn't associate .MPG files with QuickTime: </P><OL TYPE="1" START="1">    <LI>Check the current file association for .MPG files and make a note of it.<BR><BR></li>    <LI>Install QTW 2.1.2. <BR><BR></li>    <LI>Install the application. <BR><BR></li>    <LI>Check the file association for .MPG files again. <BR><BR></li>    <LI>If the file association for .MPG files was not changed, you are done.     If it has changed, proceed to step 6.<BR><BR></li>    <LI>Change the .MPG file association back to what it was in step 1.<BR><BR></li>    <LI>Reinstall QTW 2.1.2 since it was overwritten by an older version.<BR><BR></li></OL><P>The reason this series of steps works is because when the application's installer attempts to install the older version of QTW in step 3 above, the installer will see that there is already a newer version installed and skip the QTW part of its installation. However, there is a possibility that the application's installer was not written to notice that a newer version of QuickTime was already installed and, as a result, the older version of QTW will be installed. This is what would cause the .MPG file association to be changed in step 4 from what it originally was in step 1. You can then correct the problem by changing the .MPG file association back to what it was and then reinstalling QTW 2.1.2.</P><H3>Variations in Methods for Changing .MPG File Association</H3><P>The method for changing the .MPG file association will vary depending of the version of Windows being used. For Windows 3.1, in the File Manager, you need to select Association from the File menu. For Windows 95, you need to open an explorer window and select Options from the View menu. Then, you click on File Type and edit the file association.</P><P><STRONG>Note</STRONG>: If the file association for .MPG files was changed by an earlier installation of QTW, installing QTW 2.1.1 or 2.1.2. will not restore the file association back to what it originally was. Thus, .MPG files will continue to launch QuickTime, even with the new version installed. You need to manually correct the file association using the method described above. If you don't know what the original .MPG file association was, you need to contact your MPEG vendor to get it.</P><BR><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></p><H2><A NAME="Summary"></A>Summary</H2><P>Because there are many set-up options and other issues to considerwhen installing QTW, the typical user may encounter problems.
