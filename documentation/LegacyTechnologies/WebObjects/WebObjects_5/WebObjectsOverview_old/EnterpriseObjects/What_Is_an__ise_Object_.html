Is an Enterprise Object?</font></h2><!-- apple_doc: pageHeadingEnd -->

<p><font face="Times">An enterprise object is like any other object in that it couples
data with the methods for operating on that data. However, an enterprise
object class has certain characteristics that distinguish it from
other classes:</font></p>
<ul><p><li>It has properties
that map to stored or persistent data; an enterprise object instance typically
corresponds to a single row or record in a database. </li></p>
<p><li>It knows how to interact with other parts of WebObjects to
give and receive values for its properties. This is done through
a mechanism known as <b>key-value coding</b>, which enables
the setting and getting of these properties.</li></p></ul>
<p><font face="Times">In addition to providing classes that manage a set of enterprise
objects in memory, WebObjects defines an API to which enterprise
objects must conform, as well as default implementations for this
API. As a result, you only need to concentrate on the parts of your enterprise
object classes specific to your application.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">To maximize the reusability and extensibility of your objects,
they shouldn't embed knowledge of the user interface or database
alongside the business logic. For example, if you embed knowledge
of your user interface, you can't reuse the objects because each application's
user interface is different. Similarly, if you embed knowledge of
your database, you'll have to update your objects every time you
modify the database.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">If not in the business objects, then where does this knowledge
go? It's handled by WebObjects as shown in  <a href="#BABDDGHB">Figure 3-1</a>.</font></p>
<a name = "BABDDGHB"></a><p><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande"><b>Figure
3-1 Connecting enterprise objects to data
and the user interface</b></font></p> <img src = "../Art/EOFApproach.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/EOFApproach.gif]">

<p><font face="Times">WebObjects provides a database-to-objects mapping, called
a <b>model</b>, so your objects are independent of the
database. WebObjects also provides an objects-to-interface mapping
so they are independent of the user interface. This approach enables
you to create libraries of enterprise objects that can be used in
as many applications as you need, with any user interface, and with
any database server. You're able to concentrate on coding the
logic of your business while WebObjects takes care of the rest.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">For example, you could create a class of enterprise objects
called Customer that defines such business rules as "customers
must have a work or home phone number," or "the customer cannot
spend more than his credit limit." Without rewriting your business
logic, you could use these objects in a public web-based application
and an internal customer service application. You could also switch
the database that serves the customer data.</font></p>
<a name = "TPXREF106"></a><h3><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande">Enterprise
Objects and the Model-View-Controller Paradigm</font></h3>
<p><font face="Times">A common and useful paradigm for object-oriented applications,
particularly business applications, is Model-View-Controller (MVC).
Derived from Smalltalk-80, MVC proposes three types of objects in
an application, separated by abstract boundaries and communicating
with each other across those boundaries.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Model objects represent special knowledge and expertise. For
example, model objects can hold a company's data and define the
logic that manipulates that data. Model objects are not directly
displayed. They often are reusable, distributed, persistent, and
portable to a variety of platforms.</font></p><br><table border = "0" BGCOLOR="#E6E6E6">

<tr>
<td scope="row"><p><b>Note: </b>WebObjects
uses the term "model" differently from MVC. In WebObjects, a model
establishes and maintains a correspondence between an enterprise
object class and data stored in a relational database. In MVC, model
objects represent the special knowledge of the application.</p></td>
</tr>

</table><br>
<p><font face="Times">View objects represent things visible on the user interface
(windows, for example, or buttons). A View object is "ignorant"
of the data it displays. View objects tend to be very reusable and
so provide consistency between applications.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Acting as a mediator between Model objects and View objects
in an application is a Controller object. There is usually one per
application or window. A Controller object communicates data back
and forth between the Model objects and the View objects. Since what
a Controller does is very specific to an application, it is generally
not reusable even though it often comprises much of an application's
code.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Because of the Controller's central mediating role, Model
objects need not know about the state and events of the user interface,
and View objects need not know about the programmatic interfaces
of the Model objects.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">From the perspective of this paradigm, enterprise objects
are Model objects. However, WebObjects also extends the MVC paradigm.
Enterprise objects are also independent of their persistent storage
mechanism. Enterprise objects do not need to know about the database
that holds their data, and the database doesn't need to know about
the enterprise objects formed from its data.</font></p>
