<h3> Obtaining Information From Monitor</h3>
</a><a name="7160">
The Applications page gives an overall view of a deployment. It shows which applications are configured, how many instances each application has, and which of these is currently running. You get to the Applications page by clicking the Applications button in Monitor's banner. A screen similar to the following example is displayed:<p>
</a><a name="7197">
<p><img src="ApplicationsData.gif"><p>
</a><a name="4987">
Click a hyperlink in the Application column to start a session with an instance of that application.<p>
</a><a name="7217">
The Application Detail View page of the Monitor application provides you with detailed information about all configured instances of a WebObjects application. Click the Detail View button next to an application in the Applications page to go to the detail page, which looks similar to the following example: <p>
</a><a name="4991">
<p><img src="AppInstanceDetailData.gif
"><p>
</a><a name="7228">
At the top of the page is the title of the application. When one or more instances of an application are running then, this title becomes a hyperlink. Clicking on the hyperlink opens a new browser window and connects to the running application.<p>
</a><a name="6680">
The tables of the Application Detail View contain various information and controls:
