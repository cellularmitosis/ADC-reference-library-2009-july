/*	File:		TwoColLDEF.c	Contains:	Two-column LDEF code resource					looks for a comma in the text of each cell and draws				the text that follows the comma half-way across the cell					so a cell containing the text				+--------------+				| abc,def      |				+--------------+				will instead appear as				+--------------+				| abc   def    |		 		+--------------+	    				To see this LDEF in action, paste it into the ModalList				sample program and recompile the program so that the LNew call uses				the definition procedure 128 rather than 0	Written by: Greg Robbins		Copyright:	Copyright © 1993-1999 by Apple Computer, Inc., All Rights Reserved.				You may incorporate this Apple sample source code into your program(s) without				restriction.
