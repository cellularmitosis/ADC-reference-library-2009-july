Performance using virtual memoryshould be substantially improved. When compared to the currentlyshipping virtual memory, when VM is turned on, the system boots upfaster, Power Macintosh applications launch faster, and QuickTimemovies play smoother. The following sections describe some of thefeatures of this new VM.</P><H4>VM Performance Issues</H4>   <p>We improved the page aging algorithm.</p>         <p>Every 8 page faults, we aged the physical RAM pages and   refilled the "victim" list consisting of the pages that are to be   replaced in the next 8 page faults. The function which did this   could take up to 46 ms to age 48 MB of RAM on a Power Macintosh   7500.</p>      <p>We replaced the algorithm used by this function with a much   simpler and faster algorithm. Worst case for the new algorithm is   about the same as the current algorithm because it only has to   look at every physical page about once. The pause every 8 page   faults is gone.</p>         <p>Pages are written to disk multiple times because the act of   writing a page to disk marks the virtual memory page dirty.</p>         <p>When a dirty logical page is replaced, a virtual memory   optimization finds up to 6 additional dirty pages contiguous in   the virtual memory backing store file, marks the pages clean, and   then writes them out to disk with a single write request. Since   it's likely that dirty logical pages close to a dirty logical page   will have a similar "age" and thus will likely be replaced in the   near future, too, this optimization will likely make future page   faults faster.</p>      <p>However, LockMemory marks all of the pages locked as dirty and   since LockMemory is called on pages written by DMA I/O devices,   the just-cleaned pages are dirtied when they are written. That   results in an I/O trace to the virtual memory backing store file   that can look something like "write 7 pages, read one page, write   7 pages, read one page " instead of the intended "write 7 pages,   read 1 page, read 1 page, read 1 page, read 1 page, read 1 page,   read 1 page, read 1 page, write 7 pages, read 1 page..."</p><H4>New VM API call</H4><P>A new API call, LockMemoryForOutput, has been added to the_MemoryDispatch trap. This new routine works exactly like LockMemoryexcept that it does not dirty the locked pages. LockMemoryForOutputis meant to be used for DMA operations that just read memory. DMAoperations that write to memory must use LockMemory to ensure thatthe pages are marked dirty. LockMemoryForOutput is called through the_MemoryDispatch trap using selector 10.</P><P>The following glue will be added to Memory.h for the new call: <BR></P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=550><TR>	<td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><pre>/* Lock memory for output */#pragma parameter __D0 LockMemoryForOutput(__A0, __S1)extern pascal OSErr LockMemoryForOutput(void *address, unsigned long count)TWOWORDINLINE(0x700A, 0xA05C);</pre>	</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P><BR>Developers can determine if LockMemoryForOutput is available bytesting for the gestaltVMHasLockMemoryForOutput bit (bit 1) in thegestaltVMAttr Gestalt selector. If bit 1 is set, LockMemoryForOutputis available.</P><H4>VM Bug Fixes</H4><P><I>System stability improvements</I></P>      <p>We fixed several internal calls which had the potential of   hanging or crashing your machine when passed invalid arguments.   Because of a bug in VM, CFM could occasionally leave a file open   when it should not be left open. Several crashing conditions in   HoldMemory and LockMemory were repaired. Other fixes which had   previously been made in PowerPC VM were rolled into 68K VM as   well.</p>         <p><I>Added two new SysError values</I></p>         <p>If VM's deferred user function table ran out of entries, VM   would trash low memory starting at location 0. We now call   SysError with dsVMDeferredFuncTableFull (112) instead of trashing   memory off of a NULL pointer. You can get this error in several   ways. One way is to defer already-deferred i/o requests. Another   way is to install a Time Manager task which has already been   installed.</p>      <p>VM was ignoring all errors while reading or writing to the "VM   Storage" backing store file. If there was an error, the system   would likely crash later with a seemingly unrelated problem.   There's no way to continue or recover if this happens, so VM now   calls SysError with dsVMBadBackingStore (113) instead of   continuing on with a bad page or memory. This error can happen   whenever your backing store volume returns an error. Examples can   be genuine disk i/o errors, losing battery power on a   SCSI-disk-mode PowerBook, turning off an external hard disk which   contains your backing store, and so forth.</p>         <p><I>Calls which may be deferred to VM safe time</I></p>         <P>The following parts of the system are patched by virtual memory   so that they may possibly be deferred to VM safe time: </P>      <CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=550><TR>	<td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><pre>PostEventTime Manager tasksRead, Write, Control, &amp; Status driver callsVBL tasksSlot VBL tasksADBOpSCSIDispatch</pre>	</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER>      <P>Inside Macintosh: Memory page 3-11 has a discussion of page   faults and deferring user code while the driver of the paging   device in busy. The list on page 3-12 is incomplete; the types of   code listed above are a more complete list, based on the current   VM sources.</P>         <P><I>VM now holds some stack for Control and Status calls</I>   </P>      <P>VM now holds 2K of stack for all _Control and _Status calls.   This 2K of stack was previously being held for _Read and _Write   calls.</P><P>These changes apply to all machines which can run virtual memory(i.e., all machines except the Macintosh Plus, SE, Classic, LC,Portable, PowerBook 100, or Macintosh II without a PMMU).</P><H3>Code Fragment Manager</H3><P>We now load libraries better in low memory situations when virtualmemory is off. This should help products which use a fair amount ofmemory (e.g., multimedia games) on small memory configurationentry-level Macintosh computers. In particular, a "private copy" ofthe code for a shared library is now placed in the application heapif there is sufficient room in the application heap, but there is noroom in temporary memory or the system heap. The Code FragmentManager will use no more than the difference between the minimummemory partition size and the actual memory partition size for thisprivate copy.</P><P>We bypass the file system cache (using the technique documented inInside Macintosh: Files on page 2-95) when reading fragments inmemory. We use BlockMoveData in more places. These changes result infaster application loading.</P><P>A possible confusing issue for developers is that the CodeFragment Manager may return different error codes under System 7.5.5than it did under System 7.5.3 or earlier, especially in the case ofa missing weakly imported library (called a <CITE>soft import </CITE>in Inside Macintosh: PowerPC System Software.) The error code returnedwill depend upon the options passed to GetSharedLibrary. Inparticular the errors cfragNoLibraryErr (-2804) and cfragLibConnErr(-2817) might be returned for very similar reasons. Developers shouldtreat these errors as interchangeable. You should check for theexistence of weakly imported symbol by using the code in InsideMacintosh: PowerPC System Software on page 1-25, rather than bycalling GetSharedLibrary and depending upon a specific error codebeing returned.</P><P>These changes apply to all PowerPC based Macintosh computers.There are no changes to the 68K version of the Code Fragment Managerin this release.</P><H3>Modern Memory Manager</H3><P>If an application tried to allocate a small negative amount ofmemory it would crash with a type 11 error. Inside the Modern MemoryManager, we changed a local variable from signed long to unsignedlong, and added checking for overflow from high positive numbers tolow negative ones. This affects all PowerPC Macintosh computers.</P><H3>Background-Only Applications</H3><P>If two (or more) background-only applications were running andboth called MaxApplZone, the system would hang, because the ProcessManager was not correctly saving and restoring the process state foreach application. (This is the bug documented in Technote PS 2,"Background Only Applications.") This bug had existed since theintroduction of faceless background applications. We now correctlysave and restore the process state for each application. This affectsall machines.</P><H3>Floppy disk insertion and asynchronous i/o bug</H3><P>On a Macintosh 6100, 7100, or 8100 machine, when a floppy disk wasinserted and there was asynchronous file system activity going on,the machine could hang. An internal routine was incorrect because theROM was finalized while some experimentation was going on with howthe file system works. Machines with later ROMs are fine. We patchthe 6100/7100/8100 ROM to bring this ROM family up to date. This onlyaffects these three classes of machine. It affects them at any clockspeed.</P><H3>Floppy disk formatting</H3><P>On fast processors (180 Mhz or better, 604e), floppy diskformatting would sometimes fail because the code didn't wait longenough to switch heads to the second side. This left the second sideunformatted. We changed the timing in the floppy disk formattingroutines for this case, and now format floppies correctly. Somemachines may have an extension called "PowerMac Format Patch" whichdoes the same thing. If System 7.5.5 installer detects thisextension, it should delete it. (The extension will not install itscode under System 7.5.5 or later.)</P><H3>Emulator cache flush bug</H3><P>If the emulator was requested to flush a non-existing memoryrange, the emulator could get stuck in an infinite loop. We now checkthe range to be flushed and exit if invalid memory is specified. Thisfix affects the PowerBook 5300, 2300, and PCI-based desktop Macintoshcomputers.</P><H3>CalcCMask</H3><P>When color searchprocs were used with CalcCMask the resulting bitmask was randomly shifted to the left creating a jagged edge. Thisshifting effect was caused by a logic error in an internal QuickDrawmacro. The macro returned incorrect mask values (0 / 0xFF instead of0 / 1) to CalcCMask when the destination pixel depth was 1 bit.</P><H3>File Manager flush bug</H3><P>The File Manager was making a request to flush a non-existingmemory range. Because of the Emulator cache flush bug describedabove, the emulator would get stuck in an infinite loop. We patch_GetFPos, _SetFPos, and _Read to fix this problem. This fix affectsthe PowerBook 5300, 2300, and PCI-based desktop Macintosh computers.</P><H3>Infrared Remote</H3><P>On machines which support Infrared Remote Control, there were twoproblems which could arise. If the CPU was powered up using theremote control, further remote control commands were ignored. If theCPU was powered up normally via the keyboard, the remote controlcommands would work correctly. However if the volume up or downbutton was held down (causing repeated Infrared Remote commands) fora sufficient length of time, infrared commands would stop working.This was caused by a patch which wasn't getting installed under somecircumstances. This fix applies to all machines which supportInfrared Remote Control.</P><H3>LocalTalk DMA</H3><P>Fixes a potential data corruption problem when the Macintosh5400/120 is configured as follows: as a server with multiple clientsconnected, and simultaneously as an Apple Remote Access server withat least one Apple Remote Access client connected and that client islogged onto a server via Apple Remote Access. When lots of trafficwas being generated, the clients could experience data corruptionwhen copying files to or from the Macintosh 5400/120 server. We alsofixed a problem where LocalTalk DMA 1.0 would load on machineswithout the proper hardware.</P><H3>IR Talk</H3><P>System 7.5.3 Revision 2 forgot to include the control panel anddriver for IR Talk, so a machine which shipped with System 7.5.3installed and upgraded directly to System 7.5.3 Revision 2 did nothave the same IR Talk drivers as a machine which had System 7.5Update 2.0 installed, or a machine which had System 7.5 Version 7.5.3installed.</P><H3>Ethernet on 5400/6400</H3><P>On the Macintosh 5400 and 6400 models, the Ethernet support had abug which manifested itself on very busy Ethernets. These modelscould have slow communications because of dropped packets. This wasdue to an internal setting which gave higher priority to certainkinds of packets. Now all packets have the same priority.</P><H3>SCSI Manager</H3><P>Added a call to LockMemoryForOutput() as described in the VirtualMemory paragraph.</P><P>We changed the interrupt level at which SCSI completion routinesget executed from level 2 to level 1. Because the interrupt level wasat level 2 the SCSI completion routines slowed the performance ofexpansion cards (such as video capture and sound cards) whoseinterrupt level was also at level 2. This affects only PowerPCmachines running a native version of SCSI Manager 4.3.</P><P>We corrected several errors with the MESH SCSI Controller (foundon the desktop PowerPC Macintosh computers.) ACK could be releasedbefore REQ. There was a disconnect/reconnect bug with reads on oldtape drives. We could misread interrupts from the MESH chip.</P><P>We fixed two bugs related to the internal SCSI bus on PCI Macswith Fast SCSI. First, we could occasionally mishandle a reconnect ifit came in at precisely the same instant we were attempting a newcommand on the bus. Second, there was a bug in the Mesh controllerwhich could cause it to give a command done interrupt before thetarget had released REQ. On a fast machine it was possible to issue anew command to the chip while REQ was still on the bus. Thecontroller interpreted this as a new byte and we transferred ittwice. This only happens on asynchronous in phases such as messagein, asynchronous data in or status phase. The usual result of thisbug was a hang. We now wait for REQ to be removed by the devicebefore issuing a new command to the chip.</P><H3>Sharing printers</H3><P>Under some conditions involving a blank name in Sharing Setup andthe use of shared printers, you could fail to print with a "ResourceNot Found" error. This was because System 7.5 Update 2.0 deleted theblank Pascal string used by Sharing Setup. We reinstall the blankuser name string if it is missing. This would only affect somePerforma users and some users who had never set their user name, butupgraded with System 7.5 Update 2.0.</P><H3>PCI startup hang</H3><P>On 180 Mhz and faster PCI Macs, there was a bug initializing thePCI bridge chip. This made the PCI bus inaccessible during systemstartup, resulting in a hang. We now initialize the PCI bridge chipmore reliably.</P><H3>Interrupt Service Routines</H3><P>If you exit an interrupt service routine at a lower interruptlevel than that set when you entered the routine, the interrupt levelisn't cleared properly, and you won't process any interrupts of lowerpriority until an interrupt of the original priority or higher isencountered. This affects PCI Macs and Macs with PowerPC upgradecards installed. The work around for developers is to ensure that youexit any interrupt service routine at the same priority as that whichwas set when you entered the routine. We fixed a Sound Managerinterrupt service routine which was doing this on desktop Macs withPowerPC upgrade cards.</P><H3>Control Panels and Shared Libraries</H3><P>This was noticed during the testing of System 7.5.5. We discovereda third party control panel which was linked with MathLib (probablybecause it linked with CLib.) Because MathLib is also in ROM, spacewas allocated for the MathLib globals twice. Because control panelsrun in the Finder process space, the MathLib globals space wasallocated in the Finder's application heap, not in the system heap.</P><P>On most machines, the MathLibs globals allocated by the ROMcombined with the 22K of MathLib globals allocated by the linkedMathLib library are small enough to fit in the free and purgablespace left in the Finder's application heap. But on the PowerMac7500/8500/9500, the MathLib globals allocated by the ROM are also22K, and the combined 44K of MathLib globals uses all but a few bytesof the Finder's application heap. This results in repeated "Out OfMemory" warnings whenever you try to do anything in the Finder.</P><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><P><A NAME="RTFToC2"></A></P><H2>Future System Software Support</H2><P>With the release of System 7.5.5 Update, Apple is delivering itsfinal system software release for the Macintosh Plus, SE, Classic,Portable, PowerBook 100, SE FDHD, SE/30, LC, II, IIx, and IIcx.
