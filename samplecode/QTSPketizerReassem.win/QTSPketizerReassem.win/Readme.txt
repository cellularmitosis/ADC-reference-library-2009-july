ReadMe QTSPackitizerReassembler

GETTING STARTED
The projects in this folder are all MS-Dev Visual C/C++ projects
that expect to find the QuickTime header files and libraries in the
folder QTDevWin, which is assumed to be in the parent of the parent
of the folder containing the .dsw files. If you have placed the required
header files and libraries elsewhere, you will need to change
the access paths of the projects.

QUICKTIME STREAMING SAMPLE CODE
This folder contains sample code for QuickTime Streaming
RTPMediaPacketizer components and RTPReassembler components.
These components packetize or reassemble multimedia data that
is streamed over RTP.

Sample Code Organization
The sample code is organized into four MS-Dev Visual C/C++
(version 5.0) projects, two for Component Video RTP components and
two for IMA Audio RTP components.  Each project defines two
targets, Release and Debug versions of a Win32 packetizer DLL or
a Win32 reassembler DLL.

Building Win32 Component (.qtx) Files
Each Win32 component file can be built in three stages.  First
build the DLL, then build the QTML resources using Rez.exe
(included in the QuickTime SDK), and, finally, combine the DLL
and resources into a single .qtx file using RezWack.exe (also
in the QuickTime SDK).

Each project contains two batch files to facilitate this
process, one for each DLL target. The batch files are called
automatically when you rebuild the project.

Enjoy,
