TERMINFO(5)                                     File Formats                                     TERMINFO(5)



<b>NAME</b>
       terminfo - terminal capability data base

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       /usr/share/terminfo/*/*

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       <u>Terminfo</u>  is  a  data  base  describing  terminals,  used by screen-oriented programs such as <!-- a --><b>nvi</b>(1)<!-- /a -->,
       <!-- a --><b>rogue</b>(1)<!-- /a --> and libraries such as <!-- a --><b>curses</b>(3X)<!-- /a -->.  <u>Terminfo</u> describes terminals by giving a set of capabili-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ties&nbsp;capabilities</font>
       ties  which  they  have,  by  specifying  how to perform screen operations, and by specifying padding
       requirements and initialization sequences.

       Entries in <u>terminfo</u> consist of a sequence of `,' separated fields (embedded  commas  may  be  escaped
       with  a  backslash  or  notated as \054).  White space after the `,' separator is ignored.  The first
       entry for each terminal gives the names which are known for the terminal, separated  by  `|'  charac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ters.&nbsp;characters.</font>
       ters.   The  first  name  given is the most common abbreviation for the terminal, the last name given
       should be a long name fully identifying the terminal, and all others are understood as  synonyms  for
       the  terminal  name.   All names but the last should be in lower case and contain no blanks; the last
       name may well contain upper case and blanks for readability.

       Lines beginning with a `#' in the first column are treated as  comments.   While  comment  lines  are
       legal  at  any  point,  the output of <u>captoinfo</u> and <u>infotocap</u> (aliases for <u>tic</u>) will move comments so
       they occur only between entries.

       Newlines and leading tabs may be used for formatting entries for readability.  These are removed from
       parsed  entries.  The <u>infocmp</u> <u>-f</u> option relies on this to format if-then-else expressions: the result
       can be read by <u>tic</u>.

       Terminal names (except for the last, verbose entry) should be chosen using the following conventions.
       The  particular  piece  of  hardware making up the terminal should have a root name, thus ``hp2621''.
       This name should not contain hyphens.  Modes that the hardware can be in, or user preferences, should
       be  indicated  by  appending  a  hyphen and a mode suffix.  Thus, a vt100 in 132 column mode would be
       vt100-w.  The following suffixes should be used where possible:


                           <b>Suffix</b>                  <b>Meaning</b>                   <b>Example</b>
                           -<u>nn</u>      Number of lines on the screen            aaa-60
                           -<u>n</u>p      Number of pages of memory                c100-4p
                           -am      With automargins (usually the default)   vt100-am
                           -m       Mono mode; suppress color                ansi-m
                           -mc      Magic cookie; spaces when highlighting   wy30-mc
                           -na      No arrow keys (leave them in local)      c100-na
                           -nam     Without automatic margins                vt100-nam
                           -nl      No status line                           att4415-nl
                           -ns      No status line                           hp2626-ns
                           -rv      Reverse video                            c100-rv
                           -s       Enable status line                       vt100-s
                           -vb      Use visible bell instead of beep         wy370-vb
                           -w       Wide mode (&gt; 80 columns, usually 132)    vt100-w

       For more on terminal naming conventions, see the <a href="../man7/term.7.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/7/term"><b>term(7)</b></a><b></b> manual page.

   <b>Capabilities</b>
       The following is a complete table of the capabilities included in a terminfo  description  block  and
       available to terminfo-using code.  In each line of the table,

       The <b>variable</b> is the name by which the programmer (at the terminfo level) accesses the capability.

       The  <b>capname</b> is the short name used in the text of the database, and is used by a person updating the
       database.  Whenever possible, capnames are chosen to be the same as or similar to the ANSI X3.64-1979
       standard (now superseded by ECMA-48, which uses identical or very similar names).  Semantics are also
       intended to match those of the specification.

       The termcap code is the old <b>termcap</b> capability name (some capabilities are new, and have names  which
       termcap did not originate).

       Capability names have no hard length limit, but an informal limit of 5 characters has been adopted to
       keep them short and to allow the tabs in the source file <b>Caps</b> to line up nicely.

       Finally, the description field attempts to convey the semantics of the capability.  You may find some
       codes in the description field:

       (P)    indicates that padding may be specified

       #[1-9] in the description field indicates that the string is passed through tparm with parms as given
              (#<u>i</u>).

       (P*)   indicates that padding may vary in proportion to the number of lines affected

       (#<u>i</u>)   indicates the <u>i</u>th parameter.


       These are the boolean capabilities:

        The XSI Curses standard added these.  They are some post-4.1 versions  of  System  V  curses,  e.g.,
        Solaris  2.5  and  IRIX  6.x.  The <b>ncurses</b> termcap names for them are invented; according to the XSI
        Curses standard, they have no termcap names.  If your compiled terminfo entries use these, they  may
        not be binary-compatible with System V terminfo entries after SVr4.1; beware!

       Entries may continue onto multiple lines by placing white space at the beginning of each line  except
       the  first.  Comments may be included on lines beginning with ``#''.  Capabilities in <u>terminfo</u> are of
       three types: Boolean capabilities which indicate that  the  terminal  has  some  particular  feature,
       numeric  capabilities  giving  the  size of the terminal or the size of particular delays, and string
       capabilities, which give a sequence which can be used to perform particular terminal operations.


   <b>Types</b> <b>of</b> <b>Capabilities</b>
       All capabilities have names.  For instance, the fact that ANSI-standard terminals have <u>automatic</u> <u>mar</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">gins&nbsp;margins</font>
       <u>gins</u>  (i.e., an automatic return and line-feed when the end of a line is reached) is indicated by the
       capability <b>am</b>.  Hence the description of ansi includes <b>am</b>.  Numeric capabilities are followed by  the
       character `#' and then a positive value.  Thus <b>cols</b>, which indicates the number of columns the termi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nal&nbsp;terminal</font>
       nal has, gives the value `80' for ansi.  Values for numeric capabilities may be specified in decimal,
       octal  or  hexadecimal,  using  the  C  programming language conventions (e.g., 255, 0377 and 0xff or
       0xFF).

       Finally, string valued capabilities, such as <b>el</b> (clear to end of line sequence) are given by the two-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">character&nbsp;twocharacter</font>
       character code, an `=', and then a string ending at the next following `,'.

       A  number  of  escape  sequences  are provided in the string valued capabilities for easy encoding of
       characters there.  Both <b>\E</b> and <b>\e</b> map to an ESCAPE character, <b>^x</b> maps to a control-x for  any  appro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">priate&nbsp;appropriate</font>
       priate  x,  and the sequences <b>\n</b> <b>\l</b> <b>\r</b> <b>\t</b> <b>\b</b> <b>\f</b> <b>\s</b> give a newline, line-feed, return, tab, backspace,
       form-feed, and space.  Other escapes include <b>\^</b> for <b>^</b>, <b>\\</b> for <b>\</b>, <b>\</b>, for comma, <b>\:</b> for <b>:</b>, and  <b>\0</b>  for
       null.   (<b>\0</b>  will  produce \200, which does not terminate a string but behaves as a null character on
       most terminals, providing CS7 is specified.  See <a href="../man1/stty.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/stty">stty(1)</a>.)  Finally, characters may be given as three
       octal digits after a <b>\</b>.

       A delay in milliseconds may appear anywhere in a string capability, enclosed in $&lt;..&gt; brackets, as in
       <b>el</b>=\EK$&lt;5&gt;, and padding characters are supplied by <u>tputs</u> to provide this delay.  The delay must be  a
       number  with  at  most  one  decimal place of precision; it may be followed by suffixes `*' or '/' or
       both.  A `*' indicates that the padding required is proportional to the number of lines  affected  by
       the  operation,  and  the  amount  given  is the per-affected-unit padding required.  (In the case of
       insert character, the factor is still the number of <u>lines</u> affected.)  Normally, padding  is  advisory
       if the device has the <b>xon</b> capability; it is used for cost computation but does not trigger delays.  A
       `/' suffix indicates that the padding is mandatory and forces a delay of the  given  number  of  mil-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">liseconds&nbsp;milliseconds</font>
       liseconds even on devices for which <b>xon</b> is present to indicate flow control.

       Sometimes  individual  capabilities must be commented out.  To do this, put a period before the capa-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">bility&nbsp;capability</font>
       bility name.  For example, see the second <b>ind</b> in the example above.


   <b>Fetching</b> <b>Compiled</b> <b>Descriptions</b>
       If the environment variable TERMINFO is set, it is interpreted as the pathname of  a  directory  con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">taining&nbsp;containing</font>
       taining the compiled description you are working on.  Only that directory is searched.

       If  TERMINFO  is  not  set,  the <b>ncurses</b> version of the terminfo reader code will instead look in the
       directory <b>$HOME/.terminfo</b> for a compiled description.  If it fails to find one there, and  the  envi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ronment&nbsp;environment</font>
       ronment  variable  TERMINFO_DIRS is set, it will interpret the contents of that variable as a list of
       colon- separated directories to be searched (an empty entry is interpreted as  a  command  to  search
       <u>/usr/share/terminfo</u>).   If no description is found in any of the TERMINFO_DIRS directories, the fetch
       fails.

       If neither TERMINFO nor TERMINFO_DIRS is set, the last place tried will be the system terminfo direc-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tory,&nbsp;directory,</font>
       tory, <u>/usr/share/terminfo</u>.

       (Neither  the <b>$HOME/.terminfo</b> lookups nor TERMINFO_DIRS extensions are supported under stock System V
       terminfo/curses.)


   <b>Preparing</b> <b>Descriptions</b>
       We now outline how to prepare descriptions of terminals.  The most effective way to prepare a  termi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nal&nbsp;terminal</font>
       nal  description  is by imitating the description of a similar terminal in <u>terminfo</u> and to build up a
       description gradually, using partial descriptions with <u>vi</u> or some other  screen-oriented  program  to
       check  that  they  are correct.  Be aware that a very unusual terminal may expose deficiencies in the
       ability of the <u>terminfo</u> file to describe it or bugs in the screen-handling code of the test  program.

       To  get the padding for insert line right (if the terminal manufacturer did not document it) a severe
       test is to edit a large file at 9600 baud, delete 16 or so lines from the middle of the screen,  then
       hit the `u' key several times quickly.  If the terminal messes up, more padding is usually needed.  A
       similar test can be used for insert character.


   <b>Basic</b> <b>Capabilities</b>
       The number of columns on each line for the terminal is given by the <b>cols</b> numeric capability.  If  the
       terminal  is  a CRT, then the number of lines on the screen is given by the <b>lines</b> capability.  If the
       terminal wraps around to the beginning of the next line when it reaches the  right  margin,  then  it
       should  have the <b>am</b> capability.  If the terminal can clear its screen, leaving the cursor in the home
       position, then this is given by the <b>clear</b> string capability.  If  the  terminal  overstrikes  (rather
       than  clearing a position when a character is struck over) then it should have the <b>os</b> capability.  If
       the terminal is a printing terminal, with no soft copy unit, give it both <b>hc</b> and <b>os</b>.  (<b>os</b> applies  to
       storage  scope terminals, such as TEKTRONIX 4010 series, as well as hard copy and APL terminals.)  If
       there is a code to move the cursor to the left edge of the current row, give this as  <b>cr</b>.   (Normally
       this  will  be  carriage  return, control M.)  If there is a code to produce an audible signal (bell,
       beep, etc) give this as <b>bel</b>.

       If there is a code to move the cursor one position to the left (such as  backspace)  that  capability
       should  be  given  as  <b>cub1</b>.   Similarly, codes to move to the right, up, and down should be given as
       <b>cuf1</b>, <b>cuu1</b>, and <b>cud1</b>.  These local cursor motions should not alter the text they pass over, for exam-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ple,&nbsp;example,</font>
       ple, you would not normally use `<b>cuf1</b>= ' because the space would erase the character moved over.

       A very important point here is that the local cursor motions encoded in <u>terminfo</u> are undefined at the
       left and top edges of a CRT terminal.  Programs should never attempt to  backspace  around  the  left
       edge,  unless  <b>bw</b>  is given, and never attempt to go up locally off the top.  In order to scroll text
       up, a program will go to the bottom left corner of the screen and send the <b>ind</b> (index) string.

       To scroll text down, a program goes to the top left corner of the screen and sends  the  <b>ri</b>  (reverse
       index)  string.   The  strings  <b>ind</b>  and <b>ri</b> are undefined when not on their respective corners of the
       screen.

       Parameterized versions of the scrolling sequences are <b>indn</b> and <b>rin</b> which have the same  semantics  as
       <b>ind</b>  and <b>ri</b> except that they take one parameter, and scroll that many lines.  They are also undefined
       except at the appropriate edge of the screen.

       The <b>am</b> capability tells whether the cursor sticks at the right edge of the screen when text  is  out-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">put,&nbsp;output,</font>
       put, but this does not necessarily apply to a <b>cuf1</b> from the last column.  The only local motion which
       is defined from the left edge is if <b>bw</b> is given, then a <b>cub1</b> from the left  edge  will  move  to  the
       right  edge  of  the  previous row.  If <b>bw</b> is not given, the effect is undefined.  This is useful for
       drawing a box around the edge of the screen, for example.  If  the  terminal  has  switch  selectable
       automatic  margins, the <u>terminfo</u> file usually assumes that this is on; i.e., <b>am</b>.  If the terminal has
       a command which moves to the first column of the next line, that command can be given  as  <b>nel</b>  (new-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">line).&nbsp;(newline).</font>
       line).   It does not matter if the command clears the remainder of the current line, so if the termi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nal&nbsp;terminal</font>
       nal has no <b>cr</b> and <b>lf</b> it may still be possible to craft a working <b>nel</b> out of one or both of them.

       These capabilities suffice to describe hard-copy and "glass-tty" terminals.  Thus the model 33  tele-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">type&nbsp;teletype</font>
       type is described as

       33|tty33|tty|model 33 teletype,
            bel=^G, cols#72, cr=^M, cud1=^J, hc, ind=^J, os,

       while the Lear Siegler ADM-3 is described as

       adm3|3|lsi adm3,
            am, bel=^G, clear=^Z, cols#80, cr=^M, cub1=^H, cud1=^J,
            ind=^J, lines#24,


   <b>Parameterized</b> <b>Strings</b>
       Cursor  addressing  and other strings requiring parameters in the terminal are described by a parame-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">terized&nbsp;parameterized</font>
       terized string capability, with <a href="../man3/printf.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/printf"><u>printf</u>(3S)</a> like escapes <b>%x</b> in it.  For example, to address  the  cur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sor,&nbsp;cursor,</font>
       sor,  the <b>cup</b> capability is given, using two parameters: the row and column to address to.  (Rows and
       columns are numbered from zero and refer to the physical screen visible  to  the  user,  not  to  any
       unseen  memory.)   If  the  terminal  has memory relative cursor addressing, that can be indicated by
       <b>mrcup</b>.

       The parameter mechanism uses a stack and special <b>%</b> codes to manipulate it.  Typically a sequence will
       push  one of the parameters onto the stack and then print it in some format.  Print (e.g., "%d") is a
       special case.  Other operations, including "%t" pop their operand from the stack.  It is  noted  that
       more complex operations are often necessary, e.g., in the <b>sgr</b> string.

       The <b>%</b> encodings have the following meanings:


       %%   outputs `%'

       %<u>[[</u>:<u>]flags][width[.precision]][</u>doxXs<u>]</u>
            as in <b>printf</b>, flags are [-+#] and space

       %c   print pop() like %c in <b>printf</b>

       %s   print pop() like %s in <b>printf</b>

       %p[1-9]
            push <u>i</u>'th parameter

       %P[a-z]
            set dynamic variable [a-z] to pop()

       %g[a-z]
            get dynamic variable [a-z] and push it

       %P[A-Z]
            set static variable [a-z] to pop()

       %g[A-Z]
            get static variable [a-z] and push it

            The  terms  "static" and "dynamic" are misleading.  Historically, these are simply two different
            sets of variables, whose values are not reset between calls to <b>tparm</b>.  However, that fact is not
            documented  in  other implementations.  Relying on it will adversely impact portability to other
            implementations.

       %'<u>c</u>' char constant <u>c</u>

       %{<u>nn</u>}
            integer constant <u>nn</u>

       %l   push strlen(pop)

       %+ %- %* %/ %m
            arithmetic (%m is mod): push(pop() op pop())

       %&amp; %| %^
            bit operations (AND, OR and exclusive-OR): push(pop() op pop())

       %= %&gt; %&lt;
            logical operations: push(pop() op pop())

       %A, %O
            logical AND and OR operations (for conditionals)

       %! %~
            unary operations (logical and bit complement): push(op pop())

       %i   add 1 to first two parameters (for ANSI terminals)

       %? <u>expr</u> %t <u>thenpart</u> %e <u>elsepart</u> %;
            This forms an if-then-else.  The %e <u>elsepart</u> is optional.  Usually the %?  <u>expr</u>  part  pushes  a
            value  onto the stack, and %t pops it from the stack, testing if it is nonzero (true).  If it is
            zero (false), control passes to the %e (else) part.

            It is possible to form else-if's a la Algol 68:
            %? c1 %t b1 %e c2 %t b2 %e c3 %t b3 %e c4 %t b4 %e %;

            where ci are conditions, bi are bodies.

            Use the <b>-f</b> option of <b>tic</b> or <b>infocmp</b> to see the structure of if-the-else's.  Some strings,  e.g.,
            <b>sgr</b>  can  be  very  complicated  when written on one line.  The <b>-f</b> option splits the string into
            lines with the parts indented.

       Binary operations are in postfix form with the operands in the usual order.  That is, to get x-5  one
       would use "%gx%{5}%-".  %P and %g variables are persistent across escape-string evaluations.

       Consider  the  HP2645, which, to get to row 3 and column 12, needs to be sent \E&amp;a12c03Y padded for 6
       milliseconds.  Note that the order of the rows and columns is inverted here, and  that  the  row  and
       column are printed as two digits.  Thus its <b>cup</b> capability is "cup=6\E&amp;%p2%2dc%p1%2dY".

       The  Microterm ACT-IV needs the current row and column sent preceded by a <b>^T</b>, with the row and column
       simply encoded in binary, "cup=^T%p1%c%p2%c".  Terminals which use "%c" need to be able to  backspace
       the  cursor  (<b>cub1</b>),  and  to  move  the  cursor up one line on the screen (<b>cuu1</b>).  This is necessary
       because it is not always safe to transmit <b>\n</b> <b>^D</b> and <b>\r</b>, as the system may  change  or  discard  them.
       (The  library  routines dealing with terminfo set tty modes so that tabs are never expanded, so \t is
       safe to send.  This turns out to be essential for the Ann Arbor 4080.)

       A final example is the LSI ADM-3a, which uses row and  column  offset  by  a  blank  character,  thus
       "cup=\E=%p1%'  '%+%c%p2%'  '%+%c".   After sending `\E=', this pushes the first parameter, pushes the
       ASCII value for a space (32), adds them (pushing the sum on the stack in place of  the  two  previous
       values) and outputs that value as a character.  Then the same is done for the second parameter.  More
       complex arithmetic is possible using the stack.


   <b>Cursor</b> <b>Motions</b>
       If the terminal has a fast way to home the cursor (to very upper left corner of screen) then this can
       be  given  as <b>home</b>; similarly a fast way of getting to the lower left-hand corner can be given as <b>ll</b>;
       this may involve going up with <b>cuu1</b> from the home position, but a program should never do this itself
       (unless  <b>ll</b> does) because it can make no assumption about the effect of moving up from the home posi-
       tion.  Note that the home position is the same as addressing to (0,0): to the top left corner of  the
       screen, not of memory.  (Thus, the \EH sequence on HP terminals cannot be used for <b>home</b>.)

       If  the terminal has row or column absolute cursor addressing, these can be given as single parameter
       capabilities <b>hpa</b> (horizontal position absolute) and  <b>vpa</b>  (vertical  position  absolute).   Sometimes
       these  are  shorter than the more general two parameter sequence (as with the hp2645) and can be used
       in preference to <b>cup</b>.  If there are parameterized local motions (e.g., move <u>n</u> spaces  to  the  right)
       these  can  be  given as <b>cud</b>, <b>cub</b>, <b>cuf</b>, and <b>cuu</b> with a single parameter indicating how many spaces to
       move.  These are primarily useful if the terminal does not have <b>cup</b>, such as the TEKTRONIX 4025.

       If the terminal needs to be in a special mode when running a program that  uses  these  capabilities,
       the  codes  to  enter  and exit this mode can be given as <b>smcup</b> and <b>rmcup</b>.  This arises, for example,
       from terminals like the Concept with more than one page of memory.  If the terminal has  only  memory
       relative  cursor addressing and not screen relative cursor addressing, a one screen-sized window must
       be fixed into the terminal for cursor addressing to work properly.  This is also used  for  the  TEK-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">TRONIX&nbsp;TEKTRONIX</font>
       TRONIX  4025,  where  <b>smcup</b>  sets the command character to be the one used by terminfo.  If the <b>smcup</b>
       sequence will not restore the screen after an <b>rmcup</b> sequence is output (to the state  prior  to  out-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">putting&nbsp;outputting</font>
       putting <b>rmcup</b>), specify <b>nrrmc</b>.


   <b>Area</b> <b>Clears</b>
       If  the terminal can clear from the current position to the end of the line, leaving the cursor where
       it is, this should be given as <b>el</b>.  If the terminal can clear from the beginning of the line  to  the
       current position inclusive, leaving the cursor where it is, this should be given as <b>el1</b>.  If the ter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">minal&nbsp;terminal</font>
       minal can clear from the current position to the end of the display, then this should be given as <b>ed</b>.
       <b>Ed</b>  is  only  defined  from  the  first column of a line.  (Thus, it can be simulated by a request to
       delete a large number of lines, if a true <b>ed</b> is not available.)


   <b>Insert/delete</b> <b>line</b> <b>and</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>motions</b>
       If the terminal can open a new blank line before the line where the cursor is, this should  be  given
       as  <b>il1</b>;  this  is  done  only from the first position of a line.  The cursor must then appear on the
       newly blank line.  If the terminal can delete the line which the cursor is on, then  this  should  be
       given  as  <b>dl1</b>; this is done only from the first position on the line to be deleted.  Versions of <b>il1</b>
       and <b>dl1</b> which take a single parameter and insert or delete that many lines can be given as <b>il</b> and <b>dl</b>.

       If  the  terminal  has  a  settable  scrolling region (like the vt100) the command to set this can be
       described with the <b>csr</b> capability, which takes two parameters:  the  top  and  bottom  lines  of  the
       scrolling region.  The cursor position is, alas, undefined after using this command.

       It  is possible to get the effect of insert or delete line using <b>csr</b> on a properly chosen region; the
       <b>sc</b> and <b>rc</b> (save and restore cursor) commands  may  be  useful  for  ensuring  that  your  synthesized
       insert/delete  string does not move the cursor.  (Note that the <a href="../man3/ncurses.3x.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/ncurses"><b>ncurses</b>(3X)</a> library does this synthe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sis&nbsp;synthesis</font>
       sis automatically, so you need not compose insert/delete strings for an entry with <b>csr</b>).

       Yet another way to construct insert and delete might be to use a combination of index with  the  mem-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ory-lock&nbsp;memory-lock</font>
       ory-lock  feature  found  on  some  terminals  (like  the  HP-700/90  series,  which however also has
       insert/delete).

       Inserting lines at the top or bottom of the screen can also be done using <b>ri</b> or <b>ind</b> on many terminals
       without a true insert/delete line, and is often faster even on terminals with those features.

       The  boolean <b>non_dest_scroll_region</b> should be set if each scrolling window is effectively a view port
       on a screen-sized canvas.  To test for this capability, create a scrolling region in  the  middle  of
       the  screen,  write something to the bottom line, move the cursor to the top of the region, and do <b>ri</b>
       followed by <b>dl1</b> or <b>ind</b>.  If the data scrolled off the bottom of the region by the <b>ri</b> re-appears, then
       scrolling  is non-destructive.  System V and XSI Curses expect that <b>ind</b>, <b>ri</b>, <b>indn</b>, and <b>rin</b> will simu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">late&nbsp;simulate</font>
       late destructive scrolling; their documentation cautions you not to define <b>csr</b> unless this  is  true.
       This  <b>curses</b>  implementation  is more liberal and will do explicit erases after scrolling if <b>ndstr</b> is
       defined.

       If the terminal has the ability to define a window as part of memory, which all commands  affect,  it
       should  be  given  as the parameterized string <b>wind</b>.  The four parameters are the starting and ending
       lines in memory and the starting and ending columns in memory, in that order.

       If the terminal can retain display memory above, then the <b>da</b> capability should be given;  if  display
       memory  can  be  retained  below,  then  <b>db</b>  should be given.  These indicate that deleting a line or
       scrolling may bring non-blank lines up from below or that scrolling back with <b>ri</b> may bring down  non-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">blank&nbsp;nonblank</font>
       blank lines.


   <b>Insert/Delete</b> <b>Character</b>
       There  are two basic kinds of intelligent terminals with respect to insert/delete character which can
       be described using <u>terminfo.</u>  The most common insert/delete  character  operations  affect  only  the
       characters  on  the  current line and shift characters off the end of the line rigidly.  Other termi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nals,&nbsp;terminals,</font>
       nals, such as the Concept 100 and the Perkin Elmer Owl, make a distinction between typed and  untyped
       blanks  on the screen, shifting upon an insert or delete only to an untyped blank on the screen which
       is either eliminated, or expanded to two untyped blanks.  You can determine the kind of terminal  you
       have  by  clearing  the  screen  and then typing text separated by cursor motions.  Type "abc    def"
       using local cursor motions (not spaces) between the "abc" and the "def".  Then  position  the  cursor
       before  the  "abc"  and put the terminal in insert mode.  If typing characters causes the rest of the
       line to shift rigidly and characters to fall off the end, then your  terminal  does  not  distinguish
       between blanks and untyped positions.  If the "abc" shifts over to the "def" which then move together
       around the end of the current line and onto the next as you insert, you have the second type of  ter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">minal,&nbsp;terminal,</font>
       minal,  and should give the capability <b>in</b>, which stands for "insert null".  While these are two logi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cally&nbsp;logically</font>
       cally separate attributes (one line versus multi-line insert mode, and special treatment  of  untyped
       spaces) we have seen no terminals whose insert mode cannot be described with the single attribute.

       Terminfo  can  describe  both  terminals which have an insert mode, and terminals which send a simple
       sequence to open a blank position on the current line.  Give as <b>smir</b> the sequence to get into  insert
       mode.   Give  as  <b>rmir</b> the sequence to leave insert mode.  Now give as <b>ich1</b> any sequence needed to be
       sent just before sending the character to be inserted.  Most terminals with a true insert  mode  will
       not give <b>ich1</b>; terminals which send a sequence to open a screen position should give it here.

       If  your  terminal  has both, insert mode is usually preferable to <b>ich1</b>.  Technically, you should not
       give both unless the terminal actually requires both to be used in  combination.   Accordingly,  some
       non-curses  applications  get  confused  if both are present; the symptom is doubled characters in an
       update using insert.  This requirement is now rare; most <b>ich</b> sequences do not require previous  smir,
       and  most  smir  insert  modes  do not require <b>ich1</b> before each character.  Therefore, the new <b>curses</b>
       actually assumes this is the case and uses either <b>rmir</b>/<b>smir</b>  or  <b>ich</b>/<b>ich1</b>  as  appropriate  (but  not
       both).   If  you have to write an entry to be used under new curses for a terminal old enough to need
       both, include the <b>rmir</b>/<b>smir</b> sequences in <b>ich1</b>.

       If post insert padding is needed, give this as a number of milliseconds in <b>ip</b> (a string option).  Any
       other  sequence  which may need to be sent after an insert of a single character may also be given in
       <b>ip</b>.  If your terminal needs both to be placed into an `insert mode' and a  special  code  to  precede
       each  inserted  character, then both <b>smir</b>/<b>rmir</b> and <b>ich1</b> can be given, and both will be used.  The <b>ich</b>
       capability, with one parameter, <u>n</u>, will repeat the effects of <b>ich1</b> <u>n</u> times.

       If padding is necessary between characters typed while not in insert mode, give this as a  number  of
       milliseconds padding in <b>rmp</b>.

       It  is  occasionally  necessary  to move around while in insert mode to delete characters on the same
       line (e.g., if there is a tab after the insertion position).  If your terminal allows motion while in
       insert  mode  you  can give the capability <b>mir</b> to speed up inserting in this case.  Omitting <b>mir</b> will
       affect only speed.  Some terminals (notably Datamedia's) must not have <b>mir</b> because of the  way  their
       insert mode works.

       Finally,  you  can  specify <b>dch1</b> to delete a single character, <b>dch</b> with one parameter, <u>n</u>, to delete <u>n</u>
       <u>characters,</u> and delete mode by giving <b>smdc</b> and <b>rmdc</b> to enter and exit delete mode (any mode the  ter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">minal&nbsp;terminal</font>
       minal needs to be placed in for <b>dch1</b> to work).

       A  command to erase <u>n</u> characters (equivalent to outputting <u>n</u> blanks without moving the cursor) can be
       given as <b>ech</b> with one parameter.


   <b>Highlighting,</b> <b>Underlining,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Visible</b> <b>Bells</b>
       If your terminal has one or more kinds of display attributes, these can be represented in a number of
       different  ways.  You should choose one display form as <u>standout</u> <u>mode</u>, representing a good, high con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">trast,&nbsp;contrast,</font>
       trast, easy-on-the-eyes, format for highlighting error messages and other attention getters.  (If you
       have  a  choice,  reverse  video plus half-bright is good, or reverse video alone.)  The sequences to
       enter and exit standout mode are given as <b>smso</b> and <b>rmso</b>, respectively.  If the code to change into or
       out  of  standout  mode leaves one or even two blank spaces on the screen, as the TVI 912 and Teleray
       1061 do, then <b>xmc</b> should be given to tell how many spaces are left.

       Codes to begin underlining and end underlining can be given as <b>smul</b> and <b>rmul</b>  respectively.   If  the
       terminal  has  a  code to underline the current character and move the cursor one space to the right,
       such as the Microterm Mime, this can be given as <b>uc</b>.

       Other capabilities to enter various highlighting modes include <b>blink</b> (blinking) <b>bold</b> (bold  or  extra
       bright)  <b>dim</b>  (dim  or  half-bright) <b>invis</b> (blanking or invisible text) <b>prot</b> (protected) <b>rev</b> (reverse
       video) <b>sgr0</b> (turn off <u>all</u> attribute modes) <b>smacs</b> (enter alternate character set mode) and <b>rmacs</b> (exit
       alternate  character  set  mode).  Turning on any of these modes singly may or may not turn off other
       modes.

       If there is a sequence to set arbitrary combinations of modes, this  should  be  given  as  <b>sgr</b>  (set
       attributes),  taking  9  parameters.   Each  parameter  is  either 0 or nonzero, as the corresponding
       attribute is on or off.  The 9 parameters are, in order: standout, underline,  reverse,  blink,  dim,
       bold,  blank,  protect,  alternate character set.  Not all modes need be supported by <b>sgr</b>, only those
       for which corresponding separate attribute commands exist.

       For example, the DEC vt220 supports most of the modes:


                                <b>tparm</b> <b>parameter</b>   <b>attribute</b>    <b>escape</b> <b>sequence</b>

                                none              none         \E[0m
                                p1                standout     \E[0;1;7m
                                p2                underline    \E[0;4m
                                p3                reverse      \E[0;7m
                                p4                blink        \E[0;5m
                                p5                dim          not available
                                p6                bold         \E[0;1m
                                p7                invis        \E[0;8m
                                p8                protect      not used
                                p9                altcharset   ^O (off) ^N (on)

       We begin each escape sequence by turning off any existing modes, since  there  is  no  quick  way  to
       determine  whether  they  are  active.  Standout is set up to be the combination of reverse and bold.
       The vt220 terminal has a protect mode, though it is not commonly used  in  sgr  because  it  protects
       characters  on the screen from the host's erasures.  The altcharset mode also is different in that it
       is either ^O or ^N, depending on whether it is off or on.  If all modes are turned on, the  resulting
       sequence is \E[0;1;4;5;7;8m^N.

       Some  sequences  are  common  to  different modes.  For example, ;7 is output when either p1 or p3 is
       true, that is, if either standout or reverse modes are turned on.

       Writing out the above sequences, along with their dependencies yields


                              <b>sequence</b>    <b>when</b> <b>to</b> <b>output</b>     <b>terminfo</b> <b>translation</b>

                              \E[0       always              \E[0
                              ;1         if p1 or p6         %?%p1%p6%|%t;1%;
                              ;4         if p2               %?%p2%|%t;4%;
                              ;5         if p4               %?%p4%|%t;5%;
                              ;7         if p1 or p3         %?%p1%p3%|%t;7%;
                              ;8         if p7               %?%p7%|%t;8%;
                              m          always              m
                              ^N or ^O   if p9 ^N, else ^O   %?%p9%t^N%e^O%;

       Putting this all together into the sgr sequence gives:

           sgr=\E[0%?%p1%p6%|%t;1%;%?%p2%t;4%;%?%p1%p3%|%t;7%;
               %?%p4%t;5%;%?%p7%t;8%;m%?%p9%t\016%e\017%;,

       Remember that if you specify sgr, you must also specify sgr0.  Also, some implementations rely on sgr
       being  given if sgr0 is, Not all terminfo entries necessarily have an sgr string, however.  Many ter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">minfo&nbsp;terminfo</font>
       minfo entries are derived from termcap entries which have no sgr string.  The only drawback to adding
       an sgr string is that termcap also assumes that sgr0 does not exit alternate character set mode.

       Terminals  with the ``magic cookie'' glitch (<b>xmc</b>) deposit special ``cookies'' when they receive mode-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">setting&nbsp;modesetting</font>
       setting sequences, which affect the display algorithm rather than having extra bits for each  charac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ter.&nbsp;character.</font>
       ter.   Some terminals, such as the HP 2621, automatically leave standout mode when they move to a new
       line or the cursor is addressed.  Programs using standout mode should exit standout mode before  mov-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;moving</font>
       ing the cursor or sending a newline, unless the <b>msgr</b> capability, asserting that it is safe to move in
       standout mode, is present.

       If the terminal has a way of flashing the screen to indicate an error quietly  (a  bell  replacement)
       then this can be given as <b>flash</b>; it must not move the cursor.

       If  the  cursor needs to be made more visible than normal when it is not on the bottom line (to make,
       for example, a non-blinking underline into an easier to find block or blinking underline)  give  this
       sequence  as  <b>cvvis</b>.   If there is a way to make the cursor completely invisible, give that as <b>civis</b>.
       The capability <b>cnorm</b> should be given which undoes the effects of both of these modes.

       If your terminal correctly generates underlined characters (with no special codes needed) even though
       it  does not overstrike, then you should give the capability <b>ul</b>.  If a character overstriking another
       leaves both characters on the screen, specify the capability <b>os</b>.  If overstrikes are erasable with  a
       blank, then this should be indicated by giving <b>eo</b>.


   <b>Keypad</b> <b>and</b> <b>Function</b> <b>Keys</b>
       If  the terminal has a keypad that transmits codes when the keys are pressed, this information can be
       given.  Note that it is not possible to handle terminals where the keypad only works in  local  (this
       applies,  for  example,  to the unshifted HP 2621 keys).  If the keypad can be set to transmit or not
       transmit, give these codes as <b>smkx</b> and <b>rmkx</b>.  Otherwise the keypad is  assumed  to  always  transmit.
       The  codes  sent  by the left arrow, right arrow, up arrow, down arrow, and home keys can be given as
       <b>kcub1,</b> <b>kcuf1,</b> <b>kcuu1,</b> <b>kcud1,</b> and <b>khome</b> respectively.  If there are function keys such as f0, f1,  ...,
       f10,  the  codes they send can be given as <b>kf0,</b> <b>kf1,</b> <b>...,</b> <b>kf10</b>.  If these keys have labels other than
       the default f0 through f10, the labels can be given as <b>lf0,</b> <b>lf1,</b> <b>...,</b> <b>lf10</b>.  The codes transmitted by
       certain  other  special  keys  can be given: <b>kll</b> (home down), <b>kbs</b> (backspace), <b>ktbc</b> (clear all tabs),
       <b>kctab</b> (clear the tab stop in this column), <b>kclr</b> (clear screen or erase key),  <b>kdch1</b>  (delete  charac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ter),&nbsp;character),</font>
       ter),  <b>kdl1</b> (delete line), <b>krmir</b> (exit insert mode), <b>kel</b> (clear to end of line), <b>ked</b> (clear to end of
       screen), <b>kich1</b> (insert character or enter insert mode), <b>kil1</b> (insert  line),  <b>knp</b>  (next  page),  <b>kpp</b>
       (previous  page),  <b>kind</b> (scroll forward/down), <b>kri</b> (scroll backward/up), <b>khts</b> (set a tab stop in this
       column).  In addition, if the keypad has a 3 by 3 array of keys including the four  arrow  keys,  the
       other  five keys can be given as <b>ka1</b>, <b>ka3</b>, <b>kb2</b>, <b>kc1</b>, and <b>kc3</b>.  These keys are useful when the effects
       of a 3 by 3 directional pad are needed.

       Strings to program function keys can be given as <b>pfkey</b>, <b>pfloc</b>, and <b>pfx</b>.  A string to  program  screen
       labels should be specified as <b>pln</b>.  Each of these strings takes two parameters: the function key num-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ber&nbsp;number</font>
       ber to program (from 0 to 10) and the string to program it with.  Function key numbers  out  of  this
       range may program undefined keys in a terminal dependent manner.  The difference between the capabil-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ities&nbsp;capabilities</font>
       ities is that <b>pfkey</b> causes pressing the given key to be the same as the user typing the given string;
       <b>pfloc</b>  causes  the  string  to  be executed by the terminal in local; and <b>pfx</b> causes the string to be
       transmitted to the computer.

       The capabilities <b>nlab</b>, <b>lw</b> and <b>lh</b> define the number of programmable screen labels and their width  and
       height.   If  there  are commands to turn the labels on and off, give them in <b>smln</b> and <b>rmln</b>.  <b>smln</b> is
       normally output after one or more pln sequences to make sure that the change becomes visible.


   <b>Tabs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Initialization</b>
       If the terminal has hardware tabs, the command to advance to the next tab stop can  be  given  as  <b>ht</b>
       (usually  control  I).   A ``back-tab'' command which moves leftward to the preceding tab stop can be
       given as <b>cbt</b>.  By convention, if the teletype modes indicate that tabs are being expanded by the com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">puter&nbsp;computer</font>
       puter  rather  than  being  sent  to the terminal, programs should not use <b>ht</b> or <b>cbt</b> even if they are
       present, since the user may not have the tab stops properly set.  If the terminal has  hardware  tabs
       which  are  initially set every <u>n</u> spaces when the terminal is powered up, the numeric parameter <b>it</b> is
       given, showing the number of spaces the tabs are set to.  This is normally used by the  <u>tset</u>  command
       to  determine  whether  to set the mode for hardware tab expansion, and whether to set the tab stops.
       If the terminal has tab stops that can be saved in non-volatile memory, the terminfo description  can
       assume that they are properly set.

       Other  capabilities  include  <b>is1</b>,  <b>is2</b>, and <b>is3</b>, initialization strings for the terminal, <b>iprog</b>, the
       path name of a program to be run to initialize the terminal, and <b>if</b>, the name of  a  file  containing
       long  initialization  strings.   These strings are expected to set the terminal into modes consistent
       with the rest of the terminfo description.  They are normally sent  to  the  terminal,  by  the  <u>init</u>
       option of the <u>tput</u> program, each time the user logs in.  They will be printed in the following order:
       run the program <b>iprog</b>; output <b>is1</b>; <b>is2</b>; set the margins using <b>mgc</b>, <b>smgl</b> and <b>smgr</b>; set tabs using  <b>tbc</b>
       and <b>hts</b>; print the file <b>if</b>; and finally output <b>is3</b>.

       Most  initialization  is  done  with  <b>is2</b>.   Special terminal modes can be set up without duplicating
       strings by putting the common sequences in <b>is2</b> and special cases in <b>is1</b> and <b>is3</b>.  A pair of sequences
       that  does  a harder reset from a totally unknown state can be analogously given as <b>rs1</b>, <b>rs2</b>, <b>rf</b>, and
       <b>rs3</b>, analogous to <b>is2</b> and <b>if</b>.  These strings are output by the <u>reset</u> program, which is used when  the
       terminal  gets into a wedged state.  Commands are normally placed in <b>rs1</b>, <b>rs2</b> <b>rs3</b> and <b>rf</b> only if they
       produce annoying effects on the screen and are not necessary when logging in.  For example, the  com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
       mand  to  set  the vt100 into 80-column mode would normally be part of <b>is2</b>, but it causes an annoying
       glitch of the screen and is not normally needed since the terminal is usually already  in  80  column
       mode.

       If  there are commands to set and clear tab stops, they can be given as <b>tbc</b> (clear all tab stops) and
       <b>hts</b> (set a tab stop in the current column of every row).  If a more complex sequence is needed to set
       the tabs than can be described by this, the sequence can be placed in <b>is2</b> or <b>if</b>.

   <b>Delays</b> <b>and</b> <b>Padding</b>
       Many  older  and  slower  terminals do not support either XON/XOFF or DTR handshaking, including hard
       copy terminals and some very archaic CRTs (including, for example, DEC VT100s).   These  may  require
       padding characters after certain cursor motions and screen changes.

       If  the  terminal uses xon/xoff handshaking for flow control (that is, it automatically emits ^S back
       to the host when its input buffers are close to full), set <b>xon</b>.  This capability suppresses the emis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion&nbsp;emission</font>
       sion  of padding.  You can also set it for memory-mapped console devices effectively that do not have
       a speed limit.  Padding information should still be included so that routines can make  better  deci-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sions&nbsp;decisions</font>
       sions about relative costs, but actual pad characters will not be transmitted.

       If  <b>pb</b>  (padding  baud rate) is given, padding is suppressed at baud rates below the value of <b>pb</b>.  If
       the entry has no padding baud rate, then whether padding is emitted or not is  completely  controlled
       by <b>xon</b>.

       If  the terminal requires other than a null (zero) character as a pad, then this can be given as <b>pad</b>.
       Only the first character of the <b>pad</b> string is used.


   <b>Status</b> <b>Lines</b>
       Some terminals have an extra `status line' which is not normally  used  by  software  (and  thus  not
       counted in the terminal's <b>lines</b> capability).

       The  simplest  case  is  a status line which is cursor-addressable but not part of the main scrolling
       region on the screen; the Heathkit H19 has a status line of this kind, as would a 24-line VT100  with
       a  23-line scrolling region set up on initialization.  This situation is indicated by the <b>hs</b> capabil-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ity.&nbsp;capability.</font>
       ity.

       Some terminals with status lines need special sequences to access the  status  line.   These  may  be
       expressed  as a string with single parameter <b>tsl</b> which takes the cursor to a given zero-origin column
       on the status line.  The capability <b>fsl</b> must return to the main-screen cursor  positions  before  the
       last <b>tsl</b>.  You may need to embed the string values of <b>sc</b> (save cursor) and <b>rc</b> (restore cursor) in <b>tsl</b>
       and <b>fsl</b> to accomplish this.

       The status line is normally assumed to be the same width as the width of the terminal.   If  this  is
       untrue, you can specify it with the numeric capability <b>wsl</b>.

       A command to erase or blank the status line may be specified as <b>dsl</b>.

       The boolean capability <b>eslok</b> specifies that escape sequences, tabs, etc., work ordinarily in the sta-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tus&nbsp;status</font>
       tus line.

       The <b>ncurses</b> implementation does not yet use any of these capabilities.  They are documented  here  in
       case they ever become important.


   <b>Line</b> <b>Graphics</b>
       Many  terminals have alternate character sets useful for forms-drawing.  Terminfo and <b>curses</b> build in
       support for the drawing characters supported by the VT100, with some characters from the AT&amp;T  4410v1
       added.  This alternate character set may be specified by the <b>acsc</b> capability.

       The  best  way  to  define a new device's graphics set is to add a column to a copy of this table for
       your terminal, giving the character which (when emitted between <b>smacs</b>/<b>rmacs</b> switches)  will  be  ren-
       dered  as  the corresponding graphic.  Then read off the VT100/your terminal character pairs right to
       left in sequence; these become the ACSC string.


   <b>Color</b> <b>Handling</b>
       Most color terminals are either `Tektronix-like' or `HP-like'.  Tektronix-like terminals have a  pre-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">defined&nbsp;predefined</font>
       defined  set  of  N  colors (where N usually 8), and can set character-cell foreground and background
       characters independently, mixing them into N * N color-pairs.  On HP-like terminals, the use must set
       each  color  pair  up separately (foreground and background are not independently settable).  Up to M
       color-pairs may be set up from 2*M different colors.  ANSI-compatible terminals are Tektronix-like.

       Some basic color capabilities are independent of the color method.  The numeric  capabilities  <b>colors</b>
       and <b>pairs</b> specify the maximum numbers of colors and color-pairs that can be displayed simultaneously.
       The <b>op</b> (original pair) string resets foreground and background colors to their default values for the
       terminal.   The  <b>oc</b> string resets all colors or color-pairs to their default values for the terminal.
       Some terminals (including many PC terminal emulators) erase screen areas with the current  background
       color rather than the power-up default background; these should have the boolean capability <b>bce</b>.

       To  change  the  current  foreground or background color on a Tektronix-type terminal, use <b>setaf</b> (set
       ANSI foreground) and <b>setab</b> (set ANSI background) or <b>setf</b> (set foreground) and <b>setb</b> (set  background).
       These  take  one parameter, the color number.  The SVr4 documentation describes only <b>setaf</b>/<b>setab</b>; the
       XPG4 draft says that "If the terminal supports ANSI escape sequences  to  set  background  and  fore-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ground,&nbsp;foreground,</font>
       ground, they should be coded as <b>setaf</b> and <b>setab</b>, respectively.  If the terminal supports other escape
       sequences to set background and foreground, they should be coded as <b>setf</b> and <b>setb</b>, respectively.  The
       <u>vidputs()</u> function and the refresh functions use <b>setaf</b> and <b>setab</b> if they are defined."

       The  <b>setaf</b>/<b>setab</b> and <b>setf</b>/<b>setb</b> capabilities take a single numeric argument each.  Argument values 0-7
       of <b>setaf</b>/<b>setab</b> are portably defined as follows (the middle column is the symbolic  #define  available
       in the header for the <b>curses</b> or <b>ncurses</b> libraries).  The terminal hardware is free to map these as it
       likes, but the RGB values indicate normal locations in color space.


                                   <b>Color</b>       <b>#define</b>       <b>Value</b>       <b>RGB</b>
                                   black     <b>COLOR_BLACK</b>       0     0, 0, 0
                                   red       <b>COLOR_RED</b>         1     max,0,0
                                   green     <b>COLOR_GREEN</b>       2     0,max,0
                                   yellow    <b>COLOR_YELLOW</b>      3     max,max,0
                                   blue      <b>COLOR_BLUE</b>        4     0,0,max
                                   magenta   <b>COLOR_MAGENTA</b>     5     max,0,max
                                   cyan      <b>COLOR_CYAN</b>        6     0,max,max
                                   white     <b>COLOR_WHITE</b>       7     max,max,max

       The argument values of <b>setf</b>/<b>setb</b> historically correspond to a different mapping, i.e.,

                                   <b>Color</b>       <b>#define</b>       <b>Value</b>       <b>RGB</b>

                                   blue      <b>COLOR_BLUE</b>        1     0,0,max

                                   cyan      <b>COLOR_CYAN</b>        3     0,max,max
                                   red       <b>COLOR_RED</b>         4     max,0,0
                                   magenta   <b>COLOR_MAGENTA</b>     5     max,0,max
                                   yellow    <b>COLOR_YELLOW</b>      6     max,max,0
                                   white     <b>COLOR_WHITE</b>       7     max,max,max
       It is important to not confuse the two sets of color capabilities; otherwise red/blue will be  inter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">changed&nbsp;interchanged</font>
       changed on the display.

       On  an  HP-like  terminal, use <b>scp</b> with a color-pair number parameter to set which color pair is cur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rent.&nbsp;current.</font>
       rent.

       On a Tektronix-like terminal, the capability <b>ccc</b> may be present to indicate that colors can be  modi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fied.&nbsp;modified.</font>
       fied.   If  so, the <b>initc</b> capability will take a color number (0 to <b>colors</b> - 1)and three more parame-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ters&nbsp;parameters</font>
       ters which describe the color.  These three parameters default to  being  interpreted  as  RGB  (Red,
       Green,  Blue) values.  If the boolean capability <b>hls</b> is present, they are instead as HLS (Hue, Light-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ness,&nbsp;Lightness,</font>
       ness, Saturation) indices.  The ranges are terminal-dependent.

       On an HP-like terminal, <b>initp</b> may give a capability for changing a color-pair value.   It  will  take
       seven  parameters;  a  color-pair number (0 to <b>max_pairs</b> - 1), and two triples describing first back-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ground&nbsp;background</font>
       ground and then foreground colors.  These parameters must be (Red, Green, Blue) or  (Hue,  Lightness,
       Saturation) depending on <b>hls</b>.

       On  some color terminals, colors collide with highlights.  You can register these collisions with the
       <b>ncv</b> capability.  This is a bit-mask of attributes not to be used when colors are enabled.  The corre-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">spondence&nbsp;correspondence</font>
       spondence with the attributes understood by <b>curses</b> is as follows:


                                           <b>Attribute</b>      <b>Bit</b>   <b>Decimal</b>
                                           A_STANDOUT     0     1
                                           A_UNDERLINE    1     2
                                           A_REVERSE      2     4
                                           A_BLINK        3     8
                                           A_DIM          4     16
                                           A_BOLD         5     32
                                           A_INVIS        6     64
                                           A_PROTECT      7     128

                                           A_ALTCHARSET   8     256

       For example, on many IBM PC consoles, the underline attribute collides with the foreground color blue
       and is not available in color mode.  These should have an <b>ncv</b> capability of 2.

       SVr4 curses does nothing with <b>ncv</b>, ncurses recognizes it and optimizes the output in favor of colors.


   <b>Miscellaneous</b>
       If  the terminal requires other than a null (zero) character as a pad, then this can be given as pad.
       Only the first character of the pad string is used.  If the terminal does not have a  pad  character,
       specify npc.  Note that ncurses implements the termcap-compatible <b>PC</b> variable; though the application
       may set this value to something other than a null, ncurses will test <b>npc</b> first and use napms  if  the
       terminal has no pad character.

       If  the terminal can move up or down half a line, this can be indicated with <b>hu</b> (half-line up) and <b>hd</b>
       (half-line down).  This is primarily useful for superscripts and subscripts on  hard-copy  terminals.
       If  a hard-copy terminal can eject to the next page (form feed), give this as <b>ff</b> (usually control L).

       If there is a command to repeat a given character a given number of times (to save time  transmitting
       a large number of identical characters) this can be indicated with the parameterized string <b>rep</b>.  The
       first parameter is the character to be repeated and the second is the number of times to  repeat  it.
       Thus, tparm(repeat_char, 'x', 10) is the same as `xxxxxxxxxx'.

       If  the  terminal has a settable command character, such as the TEKTRONIX 4025, this can be indicated
       with <b>cmdch</b>.  A prototype command character is chosen which is used in all capabilities.  This charac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ter&nbsp;character</font>
       ter  is  given in the <b>cmdch</b> capability to identify it.  The following convention is supported on some
       UNIX systems: The environment is to be searched for a <b>CC</b> variable, and if found, all  occurrences  of
       the prototype character are replaced with the character in the environment variable.

       Terminal  descriptions  that  do  not  represent  a  specific kind of known terminal, such as <u>switch</u>,
       <u>dialup</u>, <u>patch</u>, and <u>network</u>, should include the <b>gn</b> (generic) capability so that programs can  complain
       that they do not know how to talk to the terminal.  (This capability does not apply to <u>virtual</u> termi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nal&nbsp;terminal</font>
       nal descriptions for which the escape sequences are known.)

       If the terminal has a ``meta key'' which acts as a shift key, setting the 8th bit  of  any  character
       transmitted, this fact can be indicated with <b>km</b>.  Otherwise, software will assume that the 8th bit is
       parity and it will usually be cleared.  If strings exist to turn this ``meta mode'' on and off,  they
       can be given as <b>smm</b> and <b>rmm</b>.

       If  the terminal has more lines of memory than will fit on the screen at once, the number of lines of
       memory can be indicated with <b>lm</b>.  A value of <b>lm</b>#0 indicates that the number of lines  is  not  fixed,
       but that there is still more memory than fits on the screen.

       If  the terminal is one of those supported by the UNIX virtual terminal protocol, the terminal number
       can be given as <b>vt</b>.

       Media copy strings which control an auxiliary printer connected to the terminal can be given as  <b>mc0</b>:
       print  the contents of the screen, <b>mc4</b>: turn off the printer, and <b>mc5</b>: turn on the printer.  When the
       printer is on, all text sent to the terminal will be sent to the printer.  It  is  undefined  whether
       the text is also displayed on the terminal screen when the printer is on.  A variation <b>mc5p</b> takes one
       parameter, and leaves the printer on for as many characters as the value of the parameter, then turns
       the  printer  off.   The  parameter should not exceed 255.  All text, including <b>mc4</b>, is transparently
       passed to the printer while an <b>mc5p</b> is in effect.


   <b>Glitches</b> <b>and</b> <b>Braindamage</b>
       Hazeltine terminals, which do not allow `~' characters to be displayed should indicate <b>hz</b>.

       Terminals which ignore a line-feed immediately after an <b>am</b> wrap,  such  as  the  Concept  and  vt100,
       should indicate <b>xenl</b>.

       If  <b>el</b>  is  required to get rid of standout (instead of merely writing normal text on top of it), <b>xhp</b>
       should be given.

       Teleray terminals, where tabs turn all characters moved over to blanks, should indicate <b>xt</b>  (destruc-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tive&nbsp;(destructive</font>
       tive  tabs).  Note: the variable indicating this is now `dest_tabs_magic_smso'; in older versions, it
       was teleray_glitch.  This glitch is also taken to mean that it is not possible to position the cursor
       on  top  of a ``magic cookie'', that to erase standout mode it is instead necessary to use delete and
       insert line.  The ncurses implementation ignores this glitch.

       The Beehive Superbee, which is unable to correctly transmit the escape or control C  characters,  has
       <b>xsb</b>,  indicating  that  the  f1 key is used for escape and f2 for control C.  (Only certain Superbees
       have this problem, depending on the ROM.)  Note that in older terminfo versions, this capability  was
       called `beehive_glitch'; it is now `no_esc_ctl_c'.

       Other specific terminal problems may be corrected by adding more capabilities of the form <b>x</b><u>x</u>.


   <b>Similar</b> <b>Terminals</b>
       If  there  are  two  very  similar terminals, one (the variant) can be defined as being just like the
       other (the base) with certain exceptions.  In the definition of the variant,  the  string  capability
       <b>use</b>  can  be  given  with  the name of the base terminal.  The capabilities given before <b>use</b> override
       those in the base type named by <b>use</b>.  If there are multiple <b>use</b>  capabilities,  they  are  merged  in
       reverse  order.   That  is, the rightmost <b>use</b> reference is processed first, then the one to its left,
       and so forth.  Capabilities given explicitly in the entry override those brought  in  by  <b>use</b>  refer-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ences.&nbsp;references.</font>
       ences.

       A  capability  can be canceled by placing <b>xx@</b> to the left of the use reference that imports it, where
       <u>xx</u> is the capability.  For example, the entry

                   2621-nl, smkx@, rmkx@, use=2621,

       defines a 2621-nl that does not have the <b>smkx</b> or <b>rmkx</b> capabilities, and hence does not  turn  on  the
       function  key  labels when in visual mode.  This is useful for different modes for a terminal, or for
       different user preferences.


   <b>Pitfalls</b> <b>of</b> <b>Long</b> <b>Entries</b>
       Long terminfo entries are unlikely to be a problem; to date, no entry has even approached  terminfo's
       4096-byte  string-table maximum.  Unfortunately, the termcap translations are much more strictly lim-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ited&nbsp;limited</font>
       ited (to 1023 bytes), thus termcap translations of long terminfo entries can cause problems.

       The man pages for 4.3BSD and older versions of <b>tgetent()</b> instruct the user to  allocate  a  1024-byte
       buffer  for  the termcap entry.  The entry gets null-terminated by the termcap library, so that makes
       the maximum safe length for a termcap entry 1k-1 (1023) bytes.  Depending on what the application and
       the  termcap  library being used does, and where in the termcap file the terminal type that <b>tgetent()</b>
       is searching for is, several bad things can happen.

       Some termcap libraries print a warning message or exit if they find an entry that's longer than  1023
       bytes;  others do not; others truncate the entries to 1023 bytes.  Some application programs allocate
       more than the recommended 1K for the termcap entry; others do not.

       Each termcap entry has two important sizes associated with it: before "tc" expansion, and after  "tc"
       expansion.  "tc" is the capability that tacks on another termcap entry to the end of the current one,
       to add on its capabilities.  If a termcap entry does not use the "tc" capability, then of course  the
       two lengths are the same.

       The  "before  tc expansion" length is the most important one, because it affects more than just users
       of that particular terminal.  This is the length of the entry as it exists in /etc/termcap, minus the
       backslash-newline  pairs,  which <b>tgetent()</b> strips out while reading it.  Some termcap libraries strip
       off the final newline, too (GNU termcap does not).  Now suppose:

       *    a termcap entry before expansion is more than 1023 bytes long,

       *    and the application has only allocated a 1k buffer,

       *    and the termcap library (like the one in BSD/OS 1.1 and GNU) reads  the  whole  entry  into  the
            buffer, no matter what its length, to see if it's the entry it wants,

       *    and  <b>tgetent()</b>  is  searching  for a terminal type that either is the long entry, appears in the
            termcap file after the long entry, or does not appear in the file at all (so that <b>tgetent()</b>  has
            to search the whole termcap file).

       Then  <b>tgetent()</b>  will  overwrite memory, perhaps its stack, and probably core dump the program.  Pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">grams&nbsp;Programs</font>
       grams like telnet are particularly vulnerable; modern telnets pass along  values  like  the  terminal
       type  automatically.   The results are almost as undesirable with a termcap library, like SunOS 4.1.3
       and Ultrix 4.4, that prints warning messages when it reads an overly long termcap entry.  If a  term-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cap&nbsp;termcap</font>
       cap library truncates long entries, like OSF/1 3.0, it is immune to dying here but will return incor-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rect&nbsp;incorrect</font>
       rect data for the terminal.

       The "after tc expansion" length will have a similar effect to the above,  but  only  for  people  who
       actually set TERM to that terminal type, since <b>tgetent()</b> only does "tc" expansion once it's found the
       terminal type it was looking for, not while searching.

       In summary, a termcap entry that is longer than 1023 bytes can  cause,  on  various  combinations  of
       termcap  libraries and applications, a core dump, warnings, or incorrect operation.  If it's too long
       even before "tc" expansion, it will have this effect even for users of some other terminal types  and
       users whose TERM variable does not have a termcap entry.

       When  in -C (translate to termcap) mode, the <b>ncurses</b> implementation of <a href="../man1/tic.1m.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/tic"><b>tic</b>(1)</a> issues warning messages
       when the pre-tc length of a termcap translation is too long.   The  -c  (check)  option  also  checks
       resolved (after tc expansion) lengths.

   <b>Binary</b> <b>Compatibility</b>
       It  is  not wise to count on portability of binary terminfo entries between commercial UNIX versions.
       The problem is that there are at least two versions of terminfo (under HP-UX and AIX) which  diverged
       from System V terminfo after SVr1, and have added extension capabilities to the string table that (in
       the binary format) collide with System V and XSI Curses extensions.

<b>EXTENSIONS</b>
       Some SVr4 <b>curses</b> implementations, and all previous to SVr4, do not interpret the %A and %O  operators
       in parameter strings.

       SVr4/XPG4  do  not  specify  whether  <b>msgr</b> licenses movement while in an alternate-character-set mode
       (such modes may, among other things, map CR and NL to characters that do not trigger local  motions).
       The <b>ncurses</b> implementation ignores <b>msgr</b> in <b>ALTCHARSET</b> mode.  This raises the possibility that an XPG4
       implementation making the opposite interpretation may need terminfo entries made for <b>ncurses</b> to  have
       <b>msgr</b> turned off.

       The  <b>ncurses</b>  library  handles insert-character and insert-character modes in a slightly non-standard
       way to get better update efficiency.  See the <b>Insert/Delete</b> <b>Character</b> subsection above.

       The parameter substitutions for <b>set_clock</b> and <b>display_clock</b> are not documented in  SVr4  or  the  XSI
       Curses standard.  They are deduced from the documentation for the AT&amp;T 505 terminal.

       Be  careful  assigning the <b>kmous</b> capability.  The <b>ncurses</b> wants to interpret it as <b>KEY_MOUSE</b>, for use
       by terminals and emulators like xterm that can return mouse-tracking  information  in  the  keyboard-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">input&nbsp;keyboardinput</font>
       input stream.

       Different  commercial  ports of terminfo and curses support different subsets of the XSI Curses stan-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dard&nbsp;standard</font>
       dard and (in some cases) different extension sets.  Here is a summary, accurate as of October 1995:

       <b>SVR4,</b> <b>Solaris,</b> <b>ncurses</b> -- These support all SVr4 capabilities.

       <b>SGI</b> -- Supports the SVr4 set, adds one undocumented extended string capability (<b>set_pglen</b>).

       <b>SVr1,</b> <b>Ultrix</b> -- These support a restricted subset of terminfo capabilities.  The  booleans  end  with
       <b>xon_xoff</b>; the numerics with <b>width_status_line</b>; and the strings with <b>prtr_non</b>.

       <b>HP/UX</b>  -- Supports the SVr1 subset, plus the SVr[234] numerics <b>num_labels</b>, <b>label_height</b>, <b>label_width</b>,
       plus function keys 11 through 63, plus <b>plab_norm</b>, <b>label_on</b>, and  <b>label_off</b>,  plus  some  incompatible
       extensions in the string table.

       <b>AIX</b>  --  Supports  the  SVr1  subset, plus function keys 11 through 63, plus a number of incompatible
       string table extensions.

       <b>OSF</b> -- Supports both the SVr4 set and the AIX extensions.
