From         there the analog audio would go to the sound hardware on the         Macintosh. It would then be converted back to digital data         and given to the Sound Manager. The Sound Manager would then         pass the audio to any application that was recording the CD         audio input source. If play through was turned on, the sound         hardware would automatically route the analog sound back out         to the speakers (or headphones), requiring no CPU         intervention or overhead to hear the audio. The multiple         conversions of the audio introduced the possibility of noise         and reduced sound quality as well as making it difficult to         precisely know, to a sample accuracy, what was being         played.</P>                  <P>That has all changed with Mac OS 9.0.</P>     <P><A HREF = "#top">Back to top</A></P><BR>         <P><A NAME=Section2></A></P>                  <H2>The way it is now</H2>                  <P>Starting with Mac OS 9.0, on all ROM-in-RAM Macs         (currently the iMac, iMac DV, iBook, Blue &amp; White Power         Macintosh G3, Power Macintosh G4, and Bronze Keyboard PowerBook         G3 Series) there is a new sound input device called "Internal CD." When         Internal CD is the selected input source, the Macintosh         reads digital data directly from the CD and plays it as          high-quality digital audio from CD using standard Sound Input         Manager recording calls. However, the Internal CD input         driver does not have to be selected to allow the user listen         to the CD, it only has to be selected to record from.</P>                  <center><img src="images/tn1187_002.gif" alt="tn1187.gif.2" align=bottom width=486 height=218></center>                  <P>Instead of using the digital to analog converters         built into the CD-ROM drive (which may be of questionable         quality to audio purists), the audio is read as digital         data, much like a normal file would be read off of a CD.         This digital audio is then passed to the Sound Manager which         plays it, as it would play any sound.</P>                  <P>This allows the sound to be played by the built-in         sound hardware and the built-in speakers of the Macintosh,         or out via some other hardware, such as USB speakers.         Previously it was not possible for the internal audio CD to         be played out via third-party hardware.</P>                  <P>The flow of audio data now looks like this:</P>                  <CENTER><img src="images/tn1187_003.gif" alt="tn1187.gif.3" align=bottom width=337 height=153></CENTER>                  <P>However, this also means that the CPU is now         running code that plays the audio. A very minor performance         penalty is extracted for this new functionality. The         measured statistics are about 0.5% CPU usage on a PowerBook         G3 300MHz when the sound output setting is set to 44.1 kHz.         This number doesn't include the cost of the Sound Manager         sound channel which is needed for the sound output.</P>     <P><A HREF = "#top">Back to top</A></P><BR>         <P><A NAME=Section3></A></P>                  <H2>How your application needs to change</H2>                  <P>There is no longer an option of selecting the         internal CD from the Built-in input driver. If the user's         CPU is able to support digital CD audio the option of doing         it the old analog way has been removed for a consistent user         interface between different Macintoshes.</P>                  <P>If you would like to give the users of your         application the ability to record digital CD audio using the         new Internal CD input source, you will have to choose it as         the recording source. It is a completely different sound         input driver, not a different input source of the Built-in         sound input device. You will need some method of selecting         different input sources because you cannot assume that it         will be the default input device.</P>                  <P>Apple <B>does not</B> recommend that you have the         user use the Sound control panel to change the default input         source unless the user wants a global change. Typically this         is the not the case, as only one application wants to record         from the Internal CD input source&nbsp;--&nbsp;most applications         will want to record from the microphone or sound in input.         Therefore having the user change the system wide behavior is         the wrong thing to do.</P>                  <P>Having your own interface element for this is the         preferred method for changing all sound settings in your         application. The proper way to choose the Internal CD input         source is to construct a list of all sound input drivers         (using repeated calls to <CODE>SPBGetIndexedDevice</CODE>)         to populate a menu or a list. The application should store         these settings in its preferences and configure the sound         input driver and sound output component accordingly each         time the application starts. <B>Do not</B> have the user set         these settings in the Sound control and rely on them always         being the default sound settings.</P>                  <P>There are a few key points that should be pointed         out regarding the Internal CD input source:</P>                  <UL>            <LI>Because it is a separate input device, the user can            record from the microphone in one application (for            instance, Speech Recognition), and listen to CD audio at            the same time.</LI>                        <LI>The Internal CD input device will be busy when an            application is recording from the CD.

For now you should            update your code to be able to deal with not being able            to check or set the play through setting of an input            source. Remember, the <CODE>siPlayThruOnOff</CODE>            selector is optional, so not all input devices support            it.</LI>         </UL><P><A HREF = "#top">Back to top</A></P><BR>         <P><A NAME=Section4></A></P>                  <H2>How your CD/DVD driver needs to change</H2>                  <P>Developers of CD or DVD drivers may wish to support         the new Internal CD input driver.

If you are the author of a CD or DVD driver,         you should work to add this functionality to your driver as         quickly as possible.</P>                  <P>The Apple CD/DVD driver allows for digital CD audio         only on Macintoshes which have ATAPI CD or DVD drives. It         does not support SCSI CD drives. Macintoshes with SCSI CD         drives using the Apple CD/DVD driver will behave as they         always have.</P>                  <P>The iBook <I>only</I> does digital CD audio, as its         sound chip does not have an analog to digital converter         (remember, it doesn't have a built in microphone either).         All iBooks will play audio CD using the above API. If a user         installs a third-party CD driver on the iBook, it is         imperative that it supports digital CD audio or the user         will loose the ability to hear their audio CDs.</P>                  <P>The Power Macintosh G4 (AGP Graphics) only does         digital CD audio as there is no internal CD audio analog         connection on the motherboard. Though the computer does         support analog recording via an external microphone, it does         not have an internal analog connection.</P>                  <H3>3D Sound</H3>                  <P>The 3D sound enhancement that is offered is a         simple filter. It is one of a class of filters called         "stereo spreaders." This type of enhancement works well with         some types of music, and not so well with others, so make         sure you allow the user to choose their personal preference         of on or off.</P>                  <P>Because of the additional signal from the stereo         spreader is being added back into the original signal, the         overall signal is reduced to avoid the possibility of         clipping. This has the effect of reducing the overall volume         level of the sound when the 3D effect is turned on (and a         raising of the volume when it is turned off). The user can         compensate for this by turning up the volume on the Mac, the         CD, or their speakers.</P>                  <P>The current implementation of the 3D-Stereo         component takes about 1.4% of the CPU on a 300MHz PowerBook         G3.</P>    <P><A HREF = "#top">Back to top</A></P><BR>         <P><A NAME=Summary></A></P>                  <H2>Summary</H2>                  <P>As you can see, applications do not have to do         anything special and will just continue to work&nbsp;--&nbsp;         assuming that they were properly coded with the correct         error handling and user interface.
