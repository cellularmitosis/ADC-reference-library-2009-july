/*	File:		DMFkey.c		Description:Uses the Display Manager 2.0 (found in System 7.5.2 and later, or in				the version 2.0 Display Enabler system extension which ships with				AppleVision multisync displays) to change the monitor screen resolution				the specified HxV resolutions.								This FKey will flip between 640x480 and BIG.				BIG is up to 2000x2000 if your monitor supports it.								For information on the use of the RequestVideo sample code, please 				refer to the	documentation found in the Display Manager Development				Kit, or just look at the code and comments to figure it out.	Author:		EWA	Copyright: 	Copyright: © 1996-1999 by Apple Computer, Inc.				all rights reserved.		Disclaimer:	You may incorporate this sample code into your applications without				restriction, though the sample code has been provided "AS IS" and the				responsibility for its operation is 100% yours.
