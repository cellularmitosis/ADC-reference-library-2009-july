/* These are the overridden new and delete routines.
   Most applications will want to override at least these four versions of new/delete if they override any of them.

   In Mac OS, it's not necessary to override the array versions of operator new and delete if all
   they would do is call the non-array versions; the C++ standard library, as an extension
   to the C++ standard, does this for you.

   Developers should consult the section [lib.support.dynamic] in the C++ standard to see the requirements
   on the generic operators new and delete; the system may expect that your overridden operators meet all these
   requirements.

   Your operators may be called by the system, even early in start-up before constructors have been executed.  */

/* Bug 4067110 is that if your program has no weak symbols at all, the linker will not set the
   WEAK_DEFINES bit in the Mach-O header and as a result the new and delete operators above won't
   be seen by system libraries.  This is mostly a problem for test programs and small examples,
   since almost all real C++ programs complicated enough to override new and delete will have at
   least one weak symbol.  However, this is a small example, so:  */
