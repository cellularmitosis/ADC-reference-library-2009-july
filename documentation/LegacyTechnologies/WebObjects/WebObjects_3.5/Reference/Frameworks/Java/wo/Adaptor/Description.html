<P>

Adaptor is an abstract class that represents objects that can receive events from a WebObjects adaptor. A <i>WebObjects adaptor</i> is a process that handles communication between the server and a WebObjects application. The WebObjects application (a WebApplication instance) communicates with the adaptor using messages defined in the Adaptor class. 
<P>
WebObjects offers several choices of adaptors that you can use, all of which handle HTTP requests. You may want to write your own adaptor to handle other kinds of requests, such as DO, CORBA, or DCOM. If you write your own adaptor, you will also need to write your own Adaptor subclass. 
<P>The purpose of the Adaptor class is to perform these tasks:
<UL><LI>Register with the application's run loop to begin receiving events.
<P><LI>Receive incoming events from the run loop and package them as Request objects. 
<P><LI>Forward the Request to the WebApplication by sending it the message <b>handleRequest</b>. 
<P><LI>Receive the Response object from the WebApplication and send it to the client using an RPC mechanism. 
</UL>
<P>All of the provided WebObjects adaptors use a subclass of Adaptor named DefaultAdaptor to communicate with WebApplication. The source code for the DefaultAdaptor implementation is distributed with WebObjects in the directory <i>NEXT_ROOT</i><b>/NextLibrary/WOAdaptors/CGI/Source/Application</b>. Use this class as an example when creating your own Adaptor subclass.




<H2>Creating a New Adaptor Instance</H2>
<P>
You specify the adaptor(s) you want to use on the command line when you start a WebObjects application. If you autostart the application or if you do not specify the adaptor, the application uses the default HTTP adaptor (DefaultAdaptor). To specify a custom subclass of Adaptor, use the <b>-a</b> option. For example, the following command starts up the DodgeDemo example using a subclass of Adaptor named MyHTTPSAdaptor.
<P><PRE>DodgeDemoJava.exe -a MyHTTPSAdaptor</PRE>
<P>When the <A HREF="../WebApplication/WebApplication.html" target="_top">WebApplication</a> object encounters the <B>-a</b> option, it sends itself an <b>adaptorWithName</b> message. This method constructs the Adaptor subclass (MyHTTPSAdaptor in this example).
 
<P>You can specify more than one adaptor per application if they are of different types. (For example, you could have a separate adaptor with its own port for communicating directly with Java applets on the browser.) If you specify multiple HTTP adaptors, only the last one specified will be used. 


<H2><A NAME="Arguments">Adaptor-Specific Command Line Arguments</a></H2>
<P>
If you specify an adaptor on the application command line, you can pass arguments to the Adaptor class as well. You can pass any options defined by your subclass. The application passes all options following a <b>-a</b> option up until the next <b>-a</b>, <b>-c</b>, or <b>-d</b> option or the application name to the adaptor. 
<P>
For a list of options you can specify for the DefaultAdaptor, see  the document <i><A href="../../../../../ServingWebObjects/ServingWebObjectsTOC.html" target="_top">Serving WebObjects</a></i>.



<H2><A name="Events">Adaptor and the Request-Response Loop</a></H2>
<P>
A WebObjects application's request-response loop (or run loop) begins when the WebApplication receives a <b>run</b> message. Before the <b>run</b> method begins the loop, it traverses its list of adaptors and sends each one of them a <b>registerForEvents</b> message. The <b>registerForEvents</b> method performs all tasks necessary to ensure that the Adaptor can begin receiving events. When the application is being terminated, WebApplication traverses its list of adaptors again and issues an <b>unregisterForEvents</b> message to each one of them. This method undoes whatever was done in <b>registerForEvents</b> so that the Adaptor stops receiving events. 
<P>
When the Adaptor receives an HTTP request, it reads the method lines, HTTP header information, and any HTTP content from the request message, and creates a <a href="../Request/Request.html" target="_top">Request</a> object. 
<P>
After it has created the Request object, the Adaptor sends it to the WebApplication using the message <b>handleRequest</b>. Upon receiving the request, WebApplication starts a request-response cycle. This cycle results in a response that must be sent back to the server. (That is, the <b>handleRequest</b> message returns a <A HREF="../Response/Response.html" target="_top">Response</a> object.) the Adaptor receives the Response and translates it into a message that it can send back to the adaptor.
