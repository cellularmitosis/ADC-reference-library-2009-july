The reason for duplicating them**	is so that the StringUtils code can be small and linked in with other code that**	stays resident at all times.  It is possible that when you call code to do**	something as seemingly innocent as getting the length of a string, memory can**	move.  This is because the code you are calling isn't necessarily in memory.**	If the code segment that contains the code you are calling isn't in ram, then**	it has to be loaded.  Loading the code may cause memory compaction, and therefore**	memory can move.  The pointer to the string is already pushed on the stack prior**	to the call, so if you passed a pointer into an unlocked handle, after calling**	the code, that handle may have moved, and therefore the pointer is invalid.****	To prevent the above problem, alternate names were used for these common library**	functions.  Link this code into the same segment that holds main(), and you will**	be guaranteed that they will be in memory whenever you call them. */short	clen(char *cptr);	/*	**	¶ Return the length of the c-string.	**	**	INPUT:	cptr		Pointer to c-string to get length for.	**	RESULT:	short		Length of c-string.	**	**	Return the length of the c-string. */char	*ccat(char *s1, char *s2);	/*	**	¶ Catenate two c-strings.	**	**	INPUT:	s1			Destination string to catenate onto.	**			s2			String to catenate with.	**	RESULT:	char *		Pointer to target string.	**	**	Catenate two c-strings (s2 onto end of s1). */char	*ccpy(char *s1, char *s2);	/*	**	¶ Copy a c-string.	**	**	INPUT:	s1			Destination string for copy.	**			s2			String to copy.	**	RESULT:	char *		Pointer to target string.	**	**	Copy a c-string (s2 onto s1). */short	pcmp(StringPtr s1, StringPtr s2);	/*	**	¶ Compare two pascal-strings.	**	**	INPUT:	s1		String effectively to the "left" of the compare.	**			s2		String effectively to the "right" of the compare.	**	RESULT:	short	Signed value.
