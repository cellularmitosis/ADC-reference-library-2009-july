<h3>About This Documentation</h3>
NeXT's Technical Publications group has developed this frame-based system for reference documentation. Here are some tips for using this system:
<ul>
<li>Long method names may wrap in the left table-of-contents frame. To fix this, make the frame wider.
<br>
<br>
<li>You can easily print the complete specification for a class or interface. Just make sure the content frame is selected before you print.
<br>
<br>
<li>The Examples link is inactive. We plan to have links to "live" examples sometime in the near future. 
<br>
<br>
<li>Longer or more important classes have "Class at a Glance" sections. Minor classes do not have these sections.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Note</b>: This documentation package covers only the Objective-C versions of the WebObjects classes. A Java interface for most classes is also available. To see the documentation for the Java classes, see <a href="../Java/wo.html" target="_top">next.wo package</a>.

We are interested in your comments about this method of presenting reference documentation. Please send them to <A HREF="mailto:techpubs_feedback@next.com">techpubs_feedback@group.apple.com</A>.
