It doesn't bother;	with saving registers A0 and D0, because they are trashed;	anyway by TextEdit.;AsmClickLoop	PROC		EXPORT			IMPORT		GETOLDCLICKLOOP			IMPORT		PASCALCLICKLOOP						MOVEM.L		D1-D2/A1,-(SP)		; D0 and A0 need not be saved						CLR.L		-(SP)				; make space for procedure pointer			JSR			GETOLDCLICKLOOP		; get the old clickLoop			MOVEA.L		(SP)+,A0			; into A0						MOVEM.L		(SP)+,D1-D2/A1		; restore the world as it was			JSR			(A0)				; and execute old clickLoop			MOVEM.L		D1-D2/A1,-(SP)		; D0 and A0 need not be saved			JSR			PASCALCLICKLOOP		; do our clickLoop			MOVEQ		#1,D0				; clear the zero flag so TextEdit keeps going			MOVEM.L		(SP)+,D1-D2/A1		; restore the world as it was			RTS			END
