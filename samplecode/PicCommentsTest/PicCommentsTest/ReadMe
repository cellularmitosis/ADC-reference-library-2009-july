Code for Technical Note #91: Picture Comments - The Real DealJoseph Maurer, June '92While putting together the latest revision of TN#91, with some "how to" code snippets included, I realized that you might want to play around with a complete working application, in order to investigate further the interpretation of picture comments by various printer drivers under various circumstances.As it happens, this type of program never gets "finished"; just take it as it is, and go ahead with wild experimentation!Comments, suggestions etc. are welcome: AppleLink VELOCIO.
