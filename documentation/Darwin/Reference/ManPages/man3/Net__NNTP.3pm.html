Net::NNTP(3pm)                        Perl Programmers Reference Guide                        Net::NNTP(3pm)



<b>NAME</b>
       Net::NNTP - NNTP Client class

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
           use Net::NNTP;

           $nntp = Net::NNTP-&gt;new("some.host.name");
           $nntp-&gt;quit;

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       "Net::NNTP" is a class implementing a simple NNTP client in Perl as described in RFC977. "Net::NNTP"
       inherits its communication methods from "Net::Cmd"

<b>CONSTRUCTOR</b>
       new ( [ HOST ] [, OPTIONS ])
           This is the constructor for a new Net::NNTP object. "HOST" is the name of the remote host to
           which a NNTP connection is required. If not given then it may be passed as the "Host" option
           described below. If no host is passed then two environment variables are checked, first
           "NNTPSERVER" then "NEWSHOST", then "Net::Config" is checked, and if a host is not found then
           "news" is used.

           "OPTIONS" are passed in a hash like fashion, using key and value pairs.  Possible options are:

           <b>Host</b> - NNTP host to connect to. It may be a single scalar, as defined for the "PeerAddr" option
           in IO::Socket::INET, or a reference to an array with hosts to try in turn. The "host" method will
           return the value which was used to connect to the host.

           <b>Timeout</b> - Maximum time, in seconds, to wait for a response from the NNTP server, a value of zero
           will cause all IO operations to block.  (default: 120)

           <b>Debug</b> - Enable the printing of debugging information to STDERR

           <b>Reader</b> - If the remote server is INN then initially the connection will be to nnrpd, by default
           "Net::NNTP" will issue a "MODE READER" command so that the remote server becomes innd. If the
           "Reader" option is given with a value of zero, then this command will not be sent and the connec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;connection</font>
           tion will be left talking to nnrpd.

<b>METHODS</b>
       Unless otherwise stated all methods return either a <u>true</u> or <u>false</u> value, with <u>true</u> meaning that the
       operation was a success. When a method states that it returns a value, failure will be returned as
       <u>undef</u> or an empty list.

       article ( [ MSGID|MSGNUM ], [FH] )
           Retrieve the header, a blank line, then the body (text) of the specified article.

           If "FH" is specified then it is expected to be a valid filehandle and the result will be printed
           to it, on success a true value will be returned. If "FH" is not specified then the return value,
           on success, will be a reference to an array containg the article requested, each entry in the
           array will contain one line of the article.

           If no arguments are passed then the current article in the currently selected newsgroup is
           fetched.

           "MSGNUM" is a numeric id of an article in the current newsgroup, and will change the current
           article pointer.  "MSGID" is the message id of an article as shown in that article's header.  It
           is anticipated that the client will obtain the "MSGID" from a list provided by the "newnews" com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand,&nbsp;command,</font>
           mand, from references contained within another article, or from the message-id provided in the
           response to some other commands.

           If there is an error then "undef" will be returned.

       body ( [ MSGID|MSGNUM ], [FH] )
           Like "article" but only fetches the body of the article.

       head ( [ MSGID|MSGNUM ], [FH] )
           Like "article" but only fetches the headers for the article.

       articlefh ( [ MSGID|MSGNUM ] )
       bodyfh ( [ MSGID|MSGNUM ] )
       headfh ( [ MSGID|MSGNUM ] )
           These are similar to <u>article()</u>, <u>body()</u> and <u>head()</u>, but rather than returning the requested data
           directly, they return a tied filehandle from which to read the article.

       nntpstat ( [ MSGID|MSGNUM ] )
           The "nntpstat" command is similar to the "article" command except that no text is returned.  When
           selecting by message number within a group, the "nntpstat" command serves to set the "current
           article pointer" without sending text.

           Using the "nntpstat" command to select by message-id is valid but of questionable value, since a
           selection by message-id does <b>not</b> alter the "current article pointer".

           Returns the message-id of the "current article".

       group ( [ GROUP ] )
           Set and/or get the current group. If "GROUP" is not given then information is returned on the
           current group.

           In a scalar context it returns the group name.

           In an array context the return value is a list containing, the number of articles in the group,
           the number of the first article, the number of the last article and the group name.

       ihave ( MSGID [, MESSAGE ])
           The "ihave" command informs the server that the client has an article whose id is "MSGID".  If
           the server desires a copy of that article, and "MESSAGE" has been given the it will be sent.

           Returns <u>true</u> if the server desires the article and "MESSAGE" was successfully sent,if specified.

           If "MESSAGE" is not specified then the message must be sent using the "datasend" and "dataend"
           methods from Net::Cmd

           "MESSAGE" can be either an array of lines or a reference to an array.

       last ()
           Set the "current article pointer" to the previous article in the current newsgroup.

           Returns the message-id of the article.

       date ()
           Returns the date on the remote server. This date will be in a UNIX time format (seconds since
           1970)

       postok ()
           "postok" will return <u>true</u> if the servers initial response indicated that it will allow posting.

       authinfo ( USER, PASS )
           Authenticates to the server (using AUTHINFO USER / AUTHINFO PASS) using the supplied username and
           password.  Please note that the password is sent in clear text to the server.  This command
           should not be used with valuable passwords unless the connection to the server is somehow pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tected.&nbsp;protected.</font>
           tected.

       list ()
           Obtain information about all the active newsgroups. The results is a reference to a hash where
           the key is a group name and each value is a reference to an array. The elements in this array
           are:- the last article number in the group, the first article number in the group and any infor-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mation&nbsp;information</font>
           mation flags about the group.

       newgroups ( SINCE [, DISTRIBUTIONS ])
           "SINCE" is a time value and "DISTRIBUTIONS" is either a distribution pattern or a reference to a
           list of distribution patterns.  The result is the same as "list", but the groups return will be
           limited to those created after "SINCE" and, if specified, in one of the distribution areas in
           "DISTRIBUTIONS".

       newnews ( SINCE [, GROUPS [, DISTRIBUTIONS ]])
           "SINCE" is a time value. "GROUPS" is either a group pattern or a reference to a list of group
           patterns. "DISTRIBUTIONS" is either a distribution pattern or a reference to a list of distribu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;distribution</font>
           tion patterns.

           Returns a reference to a list which contains the message-ids of all news posted after "SINCE",
           that are in a groups which matched "GROUPS" and a distribution which matches "DISTRIBUTIONS".

       next ()
           Set the "current article pointer" to the next article in the current newsgroup.

           Returns the message-id of the article.

       post ( [ MESSAGE ] )
           Post a new article to the news server. If "MESSAGE" is specified and posting is allowed then the
           message will be sent.

           If "MESSAGE" is not specified then the message must be sent using the "datasend" and "dataend"
           methods from Net::Cmd

           "MESSAGE" can be either an array of lines or a reference to an array.

           The message, either sent via "datasend" or as the "MESSAGE" parameter, must be in the format as
           described by RFC822 and must contain From:, Newsgroups: and Subject: headers.

       postfh ()
           Post a new article to the news server using a tied filehandle.  If posting is allowed, this
           method will return a tied filehandle that you can <u>print()</u> the contents of the article to be
           posted.  You must explicitly <u>close()</u> the filehandle when you are finished posting the article,
           and the return value from the <u>close()</u> call will indicate whether the message was successfully
           posted.

       slave ()
           Tell the remote server that I am not a user client, but probably another news server.

       quit ()
           Quit the remote server and close the socket connection.

       <b>Extension</b> <b>methods</b>

       These methods use commands that are not part of the RFC977 documentation. Some servers may not sup-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">port&nbsp;support</font>
       port all of them.

       newsgroups ( [ PATTERN ] )
           Returns a reference to a hash where the keys are all the group names which match "PATTERN", or
           all of the groups if no pattern is specified, and each value contains the description text for
           the group.

       distributions ()
           Returns a reference to a hash where the keys are all the possible distribution names and the val-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ues&nbsp;values</font>
           ues are the distribution descriptions.

       subscriptions ()
           Returns a reference to a list which contains a list of groups which are recommended for a new
           user to subscribe to.

       overview_fmt ()
           Returns a reference to an array which contain the names of the fields returned by "xover".

       active_times ()
           Returns a reference to a hash where the keys are the group names and each value is a reference to
           an array containing the time the groups was created and an identifier, possibly an Email address,
           of the creator.

       active ( [ PATTERN ] )
           Similar to "list" but only active groups that match the pattern are returned.  "PATTERN" can be a
           group pattern.

       xgtitle ( PATTERN )
           Returns a reference to a hash where the keys are all the group names which match "PATTERN" and
           each value is the description text for the group.

       xhdr ( HEADER, MESSAGE-SPEC )
           Obtain the header field "HEADER" for all the messages specified.

           The return value will be a reference to a hash where the keys are the message numbers and each
           value contains the text of the requested header for that message.

       xover ( MESSAGE-SPEC )
           The return value will be a reference to a hash where the keys are the message numbers and each
           value contains a reference to an array which contains the overview fields for that message.

           The names of the fields can be obtained by calling "overview_fmt".

       xpath ( MESSAGE-ID )
           Returns the path name to the file on the server which contains the specified message.

       xpat ( HEADER, PATTERN, MESSAGE-SPEC)
           The result is the same as "xhdr" except the is will be restricted to headers where the text of
           the header matches "PATTERN"

       xrover
           The XROVER command returns reference information for the <!-- a -->article(s)<!-- /a --> specified.

           Returns a reference to a HASH where the keys are the message numbers and the values are the Ref-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">erences:&nbsp;References:</font>
           erences: lines from the articles

       listgroup ( [ GROUP ] )
           Returns a reference to a list of all the active messages in "GROUP", or the current group if
           "GROUP" is not specified.

       reader
           Tell the server that you are a reader and not another server.

           This is required by some servers. For example if you are connecting to an INN server and you have
           transfer permission your connection will be connected to the transfer daemon, not the NNTP dae-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mon.&nbsp;daemon.</font>
           mon. Issuing this command will cause the transfer daemon to hand over control to the NNTP daemon.

           Some servers do not understand this command, but issuing it and ignoring the response is harm-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">less.&nbsp;harmless.</font>
           less.

<b>UNSUPPORTED</b>
       The following NNTP command are unsupported by the package, and there are no plans to do so.

           AUTHINFO GENERIC
           XTHREAD
           XSEARCH
           XINDEX

<b>DEFINITIONS</b>
       MESSAGE-SPEC
           "MESSAGE-SPEC" is either a single message-id, a single message number, or a reference to a list
           of two message numbers.

           If "MESSAGE-SPEC" is a reference to a list of two message numbers and the second number in a
           range is less than or equal to the first then the range represents all messages in the group
           after the first message number.

           <b>NOTE</b> For compatibility reasons only with earlier versions of Net::NNTP a message spec can be
           passed as a list of two numbers, this is deprecated and a reference to the list should now be
           passed

       PATTERN
           The "NNTP" protocol uses the "WILDMAT" format for patterns.  The WILDMAT format was first devel-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">oped&nbsp;developed</font>
           oped by Rich Salz based on the format used in the UNIX "find" command to articulate file names.
           It was developed to provide a uniform mechanism for matching patterns in the same manner that the
           UNIX shell matches filenames.

           Patterns are implicitly anchored at the beginning and end of each string when testing for a
           match.

           There are five pattern matching operations other than a strict one-to-one match between the pat-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tern&nbsp;pattern</font>
           tern and the source to be checked for a match.

           The first is an asterisk "*" to match any sequence of zero or more characters.

           The second is a question mark "?" to match any single character. The third specifies a specific
           set of characters.

           The set is specified as a list of characters, or as a range of characters where the beginning and
           end of the range are separated by a minus (or dash) character, or as any combination of lists and
           ranges. The dash can also be included in the set as a character it if is the beginning or end of
           the set. This set is enclosed in square brackets. The close square bracket "]" may be used in a
           set if it is the first character in the set.

           The fourth operation is the same as the logical not of the third operation and is specified the
           same way as the third with the addition of a caret character "^" at the beginning of the test
           string just inside the open square bracket.

           The final operation uses the backslash character to invalidate the special meaning of an open
           square bracket "[", the asterisk, backslash or the question mark. Two backslashes in sequence
           will result in the evaluation of the backslash as a character with no special meaning.

           Examples
           "[^]-]"
               matches any single character other than a close square bracket or a minus sign/dash.

           *bdc
               matches any string that ends with the string "bdc" including the string "bdc" (without
               quotes).

           "[0-9a-zA-Z]"
               matches any single printable alphanumeric ASCII character.

           "a??d"
               matches any four character string which begins with a and ends with d.
