<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH270-CJBEFJFE" title="Viewing File Status"></a><h2>Viewing File Status</h2>
<p>As you work on a project, the version control status of its
files in relation to the repository change. Xcode tells you which
files you have changed in your local copy of the project, which
files need to be updated to the latest version in the repository,
and so forth.</p>
<p>Xcode uses a one-letter code to represent the status of each
file. Here&#8217;s what each code means:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Blank: The
file is up to date with the latest version in the repository. You
haven&#8217;t changed your local copy of it.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p><strong>?</strong> Unknown: The file is not in the repository.
See <span class="content_text"><a href="SCMManagingFiles.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH270-BAJECHHJ">“Adding Files to the Repository.”</a></span></p></li>
<li class="li"><p><strong>-</strong> Dash: The file is in a directory that&#8217;s
not in the repository, or this is a directory that&#8217;s not in the
repository. To add a directory to the repository, you must use your
client tool. After that, add the files in the directory using Xcode.
If you don&#8217;t use Xcode to add the files, Xcode will not add the
files to the project file. In turn, when you commit your changes,
Xcode will not notify other developers that files have been added
to the project.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p><strong>U</strong> Update: The latest version of the file
in the repository is newer than your version. To check for conflicts
between your version and the latest revision and then get the latest revision
if there are no conflicts, select the file in the detail view and
choose SCM &gt; Update To &gt; Latest.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p><strong>C</strong> Conflict: Your changes may conflict with
the changes in the latest version. To see conflicts, select the
file in the detail view and choose SCM &gt; Compare With &gt; Latest.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p><strong>M</strong> Modified: The next time you commit your
changes to the file, either by selecting it and choosing SCM &gt;
Commit Changes or by choosing SCM &gt; Commit Entire Project, the
modified version of this file is added to the repository.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p><strong>A</strong> To Be Added: The next time you commit
your changes, this file is added to the repository.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p><strong>R</strong> To Be Removed: The next time you commit
your changes, this file is removed from the repository.</p></li></ul>
<p>You can view the version control status of files in several
places: The SCM Group, the detail view, and the SCM Results window.</p>
<p>The SCM group in the Groups &amp; Files list in the project
window shows the status of all the files that differ from the latest
version in the repository or for which you&#8217;ve specified a version
control operation to be performed later, such as adding a new file
to the repository. <span class="content_text">Figure 22-1</span> shows the SCM group.</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH270-BAJJFJGG" title="Figure 22-1The SCM group in the Groups &amp;amp; Files list"></a><p><strong>Figure 22-1&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The SCM group in the Groups &amp;
Files list</p><img src = "../Art/scm_group.gif" alt = "" width="555" height="314"></div><br/>
<p>Xcode&#8217;s detail view lists all the files in a project. When
using version control, you can add the SCM column to the detail
view by selecting the project group in the Groups &amp; Files list and
choosing View &gt; Detail View Columns &gt; SCM. The SCM column
shows the status of each file in the project. <span class="content_text">Figure 22-2</span> shows
the SCM column in Xcode&#8217;s detail view.</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH270-BAJECFAE" title="Figure 22-2The SCM column in Xcode&amp;#8217;s detail view"></a><p><strong>Figure 22-2&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The SCM column in Xcode&#8217;s detail
view</p><img src = "../Art/scm_column.gif" alt = "" width="659" height="282"></div><br/>
<p>The SCM Results window provides the same information the SCM
group does, plus an editor and the SCM results pane. The window
appears when you double-click the SCM group or when you choose SCM
&gt; SCM Results. The button on the bottom-right corner of the top
pane toggles between the file list pane and the SCM results pane. <span class="content_text">Figure 22-3</span> shows the
SCM Results window with the SCM results pane and the editor pane.</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH270-BAJJDEDC" title="Figure 22-3The SCM Results and editor panes in the SCM Results window"></a><p><strong>Figure 22-3&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The SCM Results and editor panes
in the SCM Results window</p><img src = "../Art/scm_results.gif" alt = "" width="528" height="334"></div><br/>
<p>You can refresh the status of the files in your project anytime
by choosing SCM &gt; Refresh Entire Project.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH270-BAJECHHJ" title="Adding Files to the Repository"></a><h2>Adding Files to the Repository</h2>
<p>After you add a file to your local copy of a managed Xcode
project, its status is ? (unknown). This means that the file is
not part of the repository. If you want to add the file to the repository
the next time you commit your changes, select the file in the project window
or the SCM Results window and choose SCM &gt; Add to Repository.
The status of the file changes from ? to A. <span class="content_text">Figure 22-4</span> shows
files in the SCM group to be added to the repository in the next
commit.</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH270-BAJBADCD" title="Figure 22-4Files to be added to the repository"></a><p><strong>Figure 22-4&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Files to be added to the repository</p>
<img src = "../Art/file_added.gif" alt = "" width="554" height="314"></div><br/>
<p>When you commit file additions, you must commit the project
file (<code>project.pbxproj</code>)
as well, at the same time. This lets other developers know there&#8217;s
a new file in the project as soon as you commit the addition. If
you don&#8217;t commit the project file when you commit the file removal
(that is, you select a file with a status of A, choose SCM &gt;
Commit Changes, and commit it without also selecting the project
file), other developers will not be able to get the added file into
their local copies of the project because Xcode wouldn&#8217;t know
that a file was added to the project.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH270-BAJJIEGC" title="Updating Files"></a><h2>Updating Files</h2>
<p>When a file in your local copy of a project becomes outdated,
Xcode assigns it a status of U. This means that another developer
has submitted changes to that file to the repository and your working
copy doesn&#8217;t include them. You can update your local copy of a
file that needs updating one of two ways:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Select the
file in the project window and choose SCM &gt; Update To &gt; Latest.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Choose SCM &gt; Update Entire Project to update all files
in the SCM group that have a status of U.</p></li></ul>
<p>When the project file (<code>project.pbxproj</code>)
has a status of U, you need to update the project file and reopen
the project in Xcode. <span class="content_text">Figure 22-5</span> shows the SCM
group of an Xcode project whose project file needs to be updated.</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH270-BAJEFCHG" title="Figure 22-5The SCM group in an Xcode project whose project file needs to be updated"></a><p><strong>Figure 22-5&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The SCM group in an Xcode project
whose project file needs to be updated</p><img src = "../Art/project_needs_update.gif" alt = "" width="494" height="300"></div><br/>
<p>To update the project file, select <code>project.pbxproj</code> in
the SCM group and choose SCM &gt; Update To &gt; Latest. Alternatively,
you can choose SCM &gt; Update Entire Project. After the update operation
is completed, close the project and reopen it.</p>
<p>If you updated only the project file, when you reopen the
project, the SCM group may display files with a status of U using
red text. These files were added to the project after your last
update. To get the new files into your working copy, select them
in the project window and chose SCM &gt; Update To &gt; Latest.
After the update operation is complete, choose SCM &gt; Refresh
Entire Project to refresh the status of the files in your working
copy.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH270-DontLinkElementID_1" title="Removing Files From the Repository"></a><h2>Removing Files From the Repository</h2>
<p>To remove a file from your local copy of a project and from
the repository when you commit the operation, remove the file as
you normally would; that is, select the file in the project window
and choose Edit &gt; Delete or press Command-Delete. The Delete References
dialog, shown in <span class="content_text">Figure 22-6</span>, appears.</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH270-BAJDAGEE" title="Figure 22-6The Delete References dialog"></a><p><strong>Figure 22-6&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The Delete References dialog</p>
<img src = "../Art/remove_file_1.gif" alt = "" width="565" height="269"></div><br/>
<p>To remove the file from your local copy of the project, click
Delete References &amp; Files. The Remove From SCM Repository dialog
appears, shown in <span class="content_text">Figure 22-7</span>.</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH270-BAJGJAEI" title="Figure 22-7The Remove From SCM Repository dialog"></a><p><strong>Figure 22-7&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The Remove From SCM Repository dialog</p>
<img src = "../Art/remove_file_2.gif" alt = "" width="565" height="271"></div><br/>
<p>To tell Xcode you want the file removed from the repository,
click Remove. The file&#8217;s status changes to R and the filename
appears in gray, as shown in <span class="content_text">Figure 22-8</span>.</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH270-BAJDIHFI" title="Figure 22-8File to be removed from the repository"></a><p><strong>Figure 22-8&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>File to be removed from the repository</p>
<img src = "../Art/remove_file_3.gif" alt = "" width="565" height="333"></div><br/>
<p>When you commit the file-removal operation, you must commit
the project file (<code>project.pbxproj</code>),
at the same time. Other developers can then keep their project files
in sync with the project directory by updating their local copies.
If you don&#8217;t commit the project file when you commit the file-removal
operation (for example, you select a file with a status of R, choose
SCM &gt; Commit Changes, and commit it without also selecting the project
file), Xcode notifies other developers that the file you removed
needs to be updated. When they update their local copy with the
repository, the file is removed from their local copy, but their
copy of the project file still references the nonpresent file, and
the file appears in red in the detail view. This may confuse developers,
who will then have to find out why a file that&#8217;s supposed to be
in their project directories is missing.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH270-DontLinkElementID_2" title="Renaming Files"></a><h2>Renaming Files</h2>
<p>Renaming a file produces two version control operations: the
removal of the file under the old name and the addition of the file
with the new name. Therefore, Xcode shows the R status next to the
old name and the A status next to the new name.</p>
<div class="warningbox"><img src="../../../../../../../Resources/Images/icon_warning.gif" alt="!" width="20" height="20" border="0" class="warningicon" /><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH270-DontLinkElementID_231" title="Warning:"></a><p><strong>Warning:</strong>&nbsp;

When you rename a managed file, the change information
for the file under the old name is unavailable under the new name.</p><p></p><div class="clear"></div></div>
<p>To rename a file, select the file in the project window and
choose File &gt; Rename. The Rename dialog appears, as shown in <span class="content_text">Figure 22-9</span>.</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH270-BAJDGIFD" title="Figure 22-9Renaming a managed file"></a><p><strong>Figure 22-9&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Renaming a managed file</p>
<img src = "../Art/rename_file_1.gif" alt = "" width="494" height="301"></div><br/>
<p>To proceed with the rename, click Rename. The SCM group in
the Groups &amp; Files list, as well as the detail view, show that
the file under the old name will be removed and the file with the
new name will be added, as shown in <span class="content_text">Figure 22-10</span>.</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH270-BAJIADHH" title="Figure 22-10Uncommitted rename operation"></a><p><strong>Figure 22-10&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Uncommitted rename operation</p>

<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH270-CJBDEAGG" title="Viewing Revisions"></a><h2>Viewing Revisions</h2>
<p>The SCM pane in the inspector or a file&#8217;s Info window contains
a list of each revision of the file. The information displayed in
the list includes the revision number, the author, and a message
about the changes made. The change message may be truncated in the
list. To see the entire change message for a revision, select the
revision in the revision list. The change message, as well as the
other properties of the list, appears in the text field below the revision
list. <span class="content_text">Figure 22-11</span> shows the revision of a file in an Info
window.</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH270-BAJGJGHG" title="Figure 22-11Info window displaying the revisions of a file"></a><p><strong>Figure 22-11&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Info window displaying the revisions

<p>You can compare any two versions of a file by selecting them
in the list and clicking the Compare or Diff buttons, as appropriate.
To update your copy of the file to a specific revision, select the
revision and click Update.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH270-BAJFGEFH" title="Comparing Revisions"></a><h2>Comparing Revisions</h2>
<p>With Xcode you can compare different versions of a file in
a project. This way, you can see changes made to a file from version
to version. For example, you can compare your locally modified version
of a file with the latest revision submitted by another member of
your team. Or you can compare the two most recent revisions in the
repository to see what has changed.</p>
<p>To compare your version of a file or project with a version
in the repository, use the Compare With and Diff With commands in
the SCM menu. You can also select any two revisions of a file in
its Info window and compare them using the Compare and Diff buttons.</p>
<p>Xcode gives you a choice of tools to use when comparing files.
The Compare With command lets you compare files using a visual tool,
such as FileMerge. Alternatively, you can have Xcode perform the
comparison using the differencing facility of your client.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH270-CJBHDBJD" title="The Compare Command"></a><h3>The Compare Command</h3>
<p>The Compare With command allows you to compare files using
a visual tool. <span class="content_text">Figure 22-12</span> shows the result of comparing two revisions
of a file.</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH270-BAJBBHED" title="Figure 22-12Comparing two revisions of a file using FileMerge"></a><p><strong>Figure 22-12&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Comparing two revisions of a file
using FileMerge</p><img src = "../Art/comparing.gif" alt = "" width="676" height="393"></div><br/>
<p>To compare your version of a file with a revision in the repository:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><p>Select the
file in the project window.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Choose SCM &gt; Compare With and select the revision to compare
against:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Latest.
Choose this option to compare a file with the latest version in
the repository.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Base. Choose this option to compare a file with the version
you checked out of the repository.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Revision. Choose this option to get the revision list for
the selected file. This option is useful if you&#8217;re not sure of
the revision you want to compare against.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Specific Revision. When you know the revision you want to
compare against, choose this option and enter the revision number
in the dialog that appears.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>File. Choose this option to compare a file in your project
with any file on disk. Choose the other file from the dialog that
appears.</p></li></ul></li></ol>
<p>You can also compare any two revisions of a file in its Info
window by doing the following:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><p>Select the
file, open its Info window, and click SCM.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Select the revisions you want to compare in the revision list
and click Compare.</p></li></ol>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH270-DontLinkElementID_3" title="The Diff Command"></a><h3>The Diff Command</h3>
<p>Another way to compare revisions using Xcode is to identify
the differences between them by using the differencing facility
of your client tool. Xcode displays the output of the <code>diff</code> command
in a separate editor window. <span class="content_text">Figure 22-13</span> shows an example
of comparing two revisions of a file using <code>svn

two revisions of a file</p><img src = "../Art/diffing.gif" alt = "" width="475" height="429"></div><br/>
<p>You can specify the format used in the comparison in the Differencing
section in the SCM pane in the Xcode Preferences window. See <span class="content_text"><a href="SCMManagingFiles.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH270-BAJHAGFI">“Specifying Comparison and Differencing Options”</a></span> for details.</p>
<p>To identify the differences between your copy of a file with
a revision in the repository, select the file in the project window,
choose SCM &gt; Diff With, and choose a version to compare against.
The options you can choose from are:</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Latest. Choose
this option to compare a file with the latest revision in the repository.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Base. Choose this option to compare a file with the revision
you checked out of the repository.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Revision. Choose this option to get the revision list for
the selected file. This option is useful if you&#8217;re not sure which
revision you want to compare against.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Specific Revision. When you know the revision you want to
compare against, choose this option and enter the revision number
in the dialog that appears.</p></li></ul>
<p>You can also identify the differences between any two revisions
of a file in its Info window by doing the following:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><p>Select the
file, open its Info window, and click SCM.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Select the revisions you want to compare from the revision
list and click Diff.</p></li></ol>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH270-BAJHAGFI" title="Specifying Comparison and Differencing Options"></a><h3>Specifying Comparison and Differencing
Options</h3>
<p>Xcode stores personal settings such as comparison and differencing
preferences, whether Xcode saves open files before performing version
control operations, and so forth, in your user file (<code>&lt;username&gt;.pbxuser</code>)
in the project package (<code>&lt;project_name&gt;.xcode</code>).
You specify those settings in the SCM pane in the Xcode Preferences
window, shown in <span class="content_text">Figure 22-14</span>. (See <span class="content_text"><a href="../SCMManagingProjects/SCMManagingProjects.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH269-BAJFCAII">“Project Packages”</a></span> for more
information on project packages.)</p>

window</p><img src = "../Art/scm_preferences.gif" alt = "" width="560" height="321"></div><br/>
<p>The Comparison Handling section of the SCM preferences pane
allows you to specify how comparisons are performed:</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>The &#8220;View
comparisons using&#8221; pop-up menu lets you choose the tool you want
Xcode to invoke when you execute the Compare command. You can choose
between FileMerge, BBEdit, or Other to specify an application of
your choosing.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>The &#8220;Display local files on the&#8221; pop-up menu specifies
whether local files are displayed on the left or the right in FileMerge
comparison windows.</p></li></ul>
<p>The Operations section specifies whether Xcode saves files
before performing version control operations through the &#8220;Save
files before SCM operations&#8221; option.</p>
<p>The Differencing section lets you specify how you want the
differencing performed:</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>The Format
pop-up menu specifies the output format used to display the results
of the comparison. The possible formats are:</p><ul class="nested"><li class="nested li"><p>Default. This is the
default output format used by your client&#8217;s <code>diff</code> command.</p></li>
<li class="nested li"><p>Contextual. The output uses the context format, displaying
differences between the two revisions with the number of lines of
context specified in the Lines text field.</p></li>
<li class="nested li"><p>Side by Side. The output is a side-by-side comparison of the
files.</p></li>
<li class="nested li"><p>Unified. Uses the unified format, which is similar to the
context format but omits redundant lines of context.</p></li></ul></li>
<li class="li"><p>Ignore blank lines. Ignore changes that insert or remove blank
lines.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Ignore whitespace. Ignore whitespace when comparing lines.</p></li></ul>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH270-BAJFIJFJ" title="Committing Changes"></a><h2>Committing Changes</h2>
<p>When you&#8217;re done making changes to a file and you want to
submit your modifications to the repository, you can tell Xcode
to commit the file in one of two ways:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Select the
file in the project window and choose SCM &gt; Commit Changes.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Choose SCM &gt; Commit Entire Project. This commits changes
in every file listed in the SCM group with the status A, M, or R.</p></li></ul>
<p>Both actions bring up a dialog with a text field in which
you enter a message describing your changes. To execute the command,
click Commit.</p>
<p>If your client tool encounters a problem during the commit
process (for example, a file to be processed is outdated), Xcode
displays a dialog showing your client&#8217;s error message, as shown
in <span class="content_text">Figure 22-15</span>.</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH270-BAJJDAIG" title="Figure 22-15Dialog indicating that changes cannot be committed because there are files that need to be updated"></a><p><strong>Figure 22-15&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Dialog indicating that changes cannot
be committed because there are files that need to be updated</p>
<img src = "../Art/update_required.gif" alt = "" width="494" height="316"></div><br/>
<p>You must correct the problem by, for example, updating any
files with a status of U, before you can commit your changes.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH270-BAJDEAHC" title="Resolving Conflicts"></a><h2>Resolving Conflicts</h2>
<p>A file with a status of C contains changes that clash with
the latest revision in the repository. For example, you may have
removed a method from a class definition that another developer
published changes to before you had a chance to commit your own changes.
To view how your version of a file in conflict differs from the
latest revision, use the Compare or Diff commands. See <span class="content_text"><a href="SCMManagingFiles.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH270-BAJFGEFH">“Comparing Revisions”</a></span> for
details.</p>
<p>Version control systems cannot resolve conflicts. They can
only make you aware of the presence of conflicts. In some cases,
you may be able to resolve the conflict yourself. However, in the
majority of cases (if you work in a team), you need to communicate
with the person who published the changes that conflict with your
own before determining the best way to resolve the conflict.</p>
<p>There are two ways of resolving a conflict between your version
of a file and the latest revision in the repository:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Merge the
changes published to the repository with your local changes and
edit the resulting file as necessary:</p><ol class="ol"><li class="li"><p>In the project window,
select the file with the conflict.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Choose SCM &gt; Update To &gt; Latest.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Edit the file to resolve the conflicts.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Save the file. If you&#8217;re using Subversion, you must also
choose SCM &gt; Resolved.</p></li></ol></li>
<li class="li"><p>Discard your copy of the file in favor of the latest revision
in the repository: </p><ul class="simple-spaceabove"><li><p>Select the file
in the project window and choose SCM &gt; Discard Changes.</p></li></ul></li></ul>
<p>Conflicts in the project file (<code>project.pbxproj</code>)
result from developers adding, removing, or renaming files from
their local copies and committing those files without committing
the project file at the same time. You cannot resolve conflicts
in the project file. If your copy of the project file gets a status
of C, choose SCM &gt; Update Entire Project or select the project file
in the project window and choose SCM &gt; Update To &gt; Latest.
You may get a dialog like the one in <span class="content_text">Figure 22-16</span>.</p>

<p>Click Discard My Changes to discard your modifications to
the project file and use the latest version in the repository. If
the dialog in <span class="content_text">Figure 22-17</span> appears, click Read From Disk to force Xcode
to re-read the project file from disk (which is the latest version
in the repository).</p>

<p>If Xcode is unable to open your project due to a corrupted
project file, you must use your client tool to update the project
file to the latest version in the repository. See <span class="content_text"><a href="../UsingCVS/UsingCVS.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH226-BCIECAGC">“Updating a Local Project File to the Latest Version in a CVS Repository”</a></span> and <span class="content_text"><a href="../UsingSubversion/UsingSubversion.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH271-BBCFDFAD">“Updating the Project File to the Latest Version in a Subversion Repository”</a></span> for more information.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH270-DontLinkElementID_4" title="Development Workflow"></a><h2>Development Workflow</h2>
<p>When working on a managed project, you have two major objectives:
To maintain you local copy of the project up to date with the latest
version in the repository and to keep the repository up to date
with your changes. If you update your working copy regularly, you reduce
the probability that the changes you make conflict with the changes
other members of your team have published to the repository.</p>
<p>This section describes the workflow you should follow when
working on a managed project with Xcode that allows you to keep
your local copy of it up to date with the latest published changes
and to submit your changes to the repository as appropriate to keep your
teammates abreast of your work.</p>
<p>When working on a managed project, you should perform the
following tasks on a regular basis&#8212;hourly, daily, weekly, or as
convenient&#8212;depending on your team&#8217;s needs and requirements:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Update your
local copy with the latest version in the repository.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Make changes to your local copy of the project.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Resolve conflicts.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Publish your changes.</p></li></ul>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH270-DontLinkElementID_5" title="Update Your Local Copy"></a><h3>Update Your Local Copy</h3>
<p>Before you start making changes to a project, you should make
sure your local copy contains the latest changes your peers have
published.</p>
<p>To determine whether your project is up to date, choose Refresh
Entire Project from Xcode&#8217;s SCM menu. You need to update any files
that have a status of U. Files with a status of C are in conflict.
You should examine the files in conflict before deciding whether
to update them. See <span class="content_text"><a href="SCMManagingFiles.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH270-BAJJIEGC">“Updating Files”</a></span> and <span class="content_text"><a href="SCMManagingFiles.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH270-BAJDEAHC">“Resolving Conflicts”</a></span> for details.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH270-DontLinkElementID_6" title="Make Changes"></a><h3>Make Changes</h3>
<p>To modify files all you need to do is edit them. (If you&#8217;re
using a version control system that locks files in your local copy,
you need to choose SCM &gt; Edit before you can save your changes
to disk.)</p>
<p>Making structural changes to a project, such as adding or
removing files, creating or removing groups in the Groups &amp;
Files list, and configuring build settings produce changes in the
project file (<code>project.pbxproj</code>).
You must commit the project file after making structural changes
to a project, along with the files you operated on.</p>
<p>In general, you should make structural changes to a project
only after updating it from the repository. You should then commit
those operations immediately, along with the project file, before
making additional modifications. Then inform the rest of your team
so that they update their project files to the new version. This
procedure helps reduce conflicts between your teammates&#8217; copies
of the project file and the latest version in the repository, as
well as keep the contents of their local project directories and
their corresponding project files in sync. See <span class="content_text"><a href="../SCMManagingProjects/SCMManagingProjects.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH269-BAJFCAII">“Project Packages,”</a></span> <span class="content_text"><a href="SCMManagingFiles.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH270-BAJJIEGC">“Updating Files,”</a></span>

<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH270-DontLinkElementID_7" title="Resolve Conflicts"></a><h3>Resolve Conflicts</h3>
<p>Before you commit your changes to the repository, refresh
the status of the project to determine whether conflicts exist.
In Xcode, choose SCM &gt; Refresh Entire Project. If the SCM group
in the Groups &amp; Files list doesn&#8217;t contain files with a status
of C, you can commit your changes. Otherwise, you must resolve the
conflicts. See <span class="content_text"><a href="SCMManagingFiles.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH270-BAJDEAHC">“Resolving Conflicts”</a></span> for details.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH270-DontLinkElementID_8" title="Publish Your Changes"></a><h3>Publish Your Changes</h3>
<p>After you&#8217;ve confirmed that your local modifications don&#8217;t
conflict with published changes, you may commit them to the repository.
See <span class="content_text"><a href="SCMManagingFiles.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH270-BAJFIJFJ">“Committing Changes”</a></span> for more information.</p>
