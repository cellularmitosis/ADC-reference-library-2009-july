<h2> Subcomponents and Component References</h2>
</a><a name="6943">
A "node" in a template's object graph can represent a <em>subcomponent</em> (also &#32;called a reusable component) as well as a dynamic or static HTML element. A dynamic element called a <em>component reference</em> represents all occurrences of the subcomponent in the parent component. At run-time, the component reference binds itself to the separate instances. <a href="WOClasses22.html#157">Figure &#32;30</a> is an example of an object graph for a page with a subcomponent.<p>
</a><a name="4933">
A subcomponent can fire actions against its parent component (using &#32;<strong>performParentAction:</strong>), and if the parent's state changes, its state is &#32;synchronized accordingly. In other words, its state is updated to reflect changes according to its bindings with the parent.<p>
</a><a name="3679">
An element ID is assigned to each instance of a subcomponent. When a &#32;request-handling message traverses an object graph and reaches the component reference, it resolves references to its instances according to &#32;the element ID of each instance. <p>
