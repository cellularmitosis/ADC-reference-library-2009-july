//	This file implements a dialog demonstrating live feedback with sliders
//	and scroll bars. In this case, we have one of each control. They are
//	connected to a text field showing the current value as well as each
//	other, i.e. moving one automatically adjusts the other.

//	Here's our ControlActionUPP that also handles the indicator. At last, we can
//	actually use the same function callback for both! There is a difference when
//	called with the indicator as the part, as opposed to the up/down arrows, etc.
//	If we are called because the indicator is being dragged, the value has already
//	been calculated for us. If we are being called because the scroll bar arrows
//	have been pressed, then we must determine how much to scroll by and set the
//	scroll bar value accordingly. This allows us to have control over the amount
//	that arrows scroll by. We can allow the indicator dragging to determine the
//	value because the indicator always shows a percentage.
