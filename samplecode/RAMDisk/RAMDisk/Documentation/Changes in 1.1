Changes in 1.1__________________________________________________In the file RAMInit.c, in the procedure GrowUnitTable(), there wasa line which read: newUnitTableBase = NewPtrSysClear(sizeof(newUnitEntryCount * sizeof(long)));this line should be newUnitTableBase = NewPtrSysClear(newUnitEntryCount * sizeof(long));Because of this bug, trying to grow the unit table will overwrite otherparts of the system heap and potentially crash.  Thanks to Mike Wiesefor finding this bug.__________________________________________________
