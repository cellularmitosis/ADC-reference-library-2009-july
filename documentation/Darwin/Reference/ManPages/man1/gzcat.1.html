<b>NAME</b>
       gzip, gunzip, zcat - compress or expand files

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>gzip</b> [ <b>-acdfhlLnNrtvV19</b> ] [<b>-S</b> <b>suffix</b>] [ <u>name</u> <u>...</u>  ]
       <b>gunzip</b> [ <b>-acfhlLnNrtvV</b> ] [<b>-S</b> <b>suffix</b>] [ <u>name</u> <u>...</u>  ]
       <b>zcat</b> [ <b>-fhLV</b> ] [ <u>name</u> <u>...</u>  ]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       <u>Gzip</u>  reduces  the  size  of the named files using Lempel-Ziv coding (LZ77).  Whenever possible, each
       file is replaced by one with the extension <b>.gz,</b> while keeping the same ownership  modes,  access  and
       modification times.  (The default extension is <b>-gz</b> for VMS, <b>z</b> for MSDOS, OS/2 FAT, Windows NT FAT and
       Atari.)  If no files are specified, or if a file name is "-", the standard input is compressed to the
       standard  output.   <u>Gzip</u>  will only attempt to compress regular files.  In particular, it will ignore
       symbolic links.

       If the compressed file name is too long for its file system, <u>gzip</u> truncates  it.   <u>Gzip</u>  attempts  to
       truncate only the parts of the file name longer than 3 characters.  (A part is delimited by dots.) If
       the name consists of small parts only, the longest parts are truncated. For example,  if  file  names
       are  limited  to  14 characters, gzip.msdos.exe is compressed to gzi.msd.exe.gz.  Names are not trun-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cated&nbsp;truncated</font>
       cated on systems which do not have a limit on file name length.

       By default, <u>gzip</u> keeps the original file name and timestamp in the compressed file.  These  are  used
       when  decompressing  the  file  with  the <b>-N</b> option. This is useful when the compressed file name was
       truncated or when the time stamp was not preserved after a file transfer.

       Compressed files can be restored to their original form using <u>gzip</u> <u>-d</u> or  <u>gunzip</u>  or  <u>zcat.</u>   If  the
       original  name  saved  in the compressed file is not suitable for its file system, a new name is con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">structed&nbsp;constructed</font>
       structed from the original one to make it legal.

       <u>gunzip</u> takes a list of files on its command line and replaces each file whose  name  ends  with  .gz,
       -gz,  .z, -z, _z or .Z and which begins with the correct magic number with an uncompressed file with-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">out&nbsp;without</font>
       out the original extension.  <u>gunzip</u> also recognizes the special extensions <b>.tgz</b> and  <b>.taz</b>  as  short-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">hands&nbsp;shorthands</font>
       hands  for <b>.tar.gz</b> and <b>.tar.Z</b> respectively.  When compressing, <u>gzip</u> uses the <b>.tgz</b> extension if neces-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sary&nbsp;necessary</font>
       sary instead of truncating a file with a <b>.tar</b> extension.

       <u>gunzip</u> can currently decompress files created by <u>gzip,</u> <u>zip,</u>  <u>compress,</u>  <u>compress</u>  <u>-H</u>  or  <u>pack.</u>   The
       detection of the input format is automatic.  When using the first two formats, <u>gunzip</u> checks a 32 bit
       CRC. For <u>pack,</u> <u>gunzip</u> checks the uncompressed length. The standard <u>compress</u> format was  not  designed
       to  allow consistency checks. However <u>gunzip</u> is sometimes able to detect a bad .Z file. If you get an
       error when uncompressing a .Z file, do not assume that the .Z file  is  correct  simply  because  the
       standard  <u>uncompress</u>  does  not  complain. This generally means that the standard <u>uncompress</u> does not
       check its input, and happily generates garbage output.  The SCO compress -H format  (lzh  compression
       method) does not include a CRC but also allows some consistency checks.

       Files  created  by  <u>zip</u> can be uncompressed by gzip only if they have a single member compressed with
       the 'deflation' method. This feature is only intended to help conversion  of  tar.zip  files  to  the
       tar.gz  format.   To  extract  a <u>zip</u> file with a single member, use a command like <u>gunzip</u> <u>&lt;foo.zip</u> or
       <u>gunzip</u> <u>-S</u> <u>.zip</u> <u>foo.zip</u>.  To extract zip files with several members, use <u>unzip</u> instead of <u>gunzip.</u>

       <u>zcat</u> is identical to <u>gunzip</u> <b>-c.</b>  (On some systems, <u>zcat</u> may be installed as  <u>gzcat</u>  to  preserve  the
       original  link  to  <u>compress.)</u>   <u>zcat</u>  uncompresses either a list of files on the command line or its
       standard input and writes the uncompressed data on standard output.  <u>zcat</u> will uncompress files  that
       have  the  correct magic number whether they have a <b>.gz</b> suffix or not. In POSIX mode zcat will append
       <b>.Z</b> to all filenames that do not have that suffix.

       <u>Gzip</u> uses the Lempel-Ziv algorithm used in <u>zip</u> and PKZIP.  The amount of compression obtained depends
       on  the  size of the input and the distribution of common substrings.  Typically, text such as source
       code or English is reduced by 60-70%.  Compression is generally much better than that achieved by LZW
       (as used in <u>compress</u>), Huffman coding (as used in <u>pack</u>), or adaptive Huffman coding (<u>compact</u>).

       Compression  is  always  performed, even if the compressed file is slightly larger than the original.
       The worst case expansion is a few bytes for the gzip file header, plus 5 bytes every 32K block, or an
       expansion  ratio  of  0.015%  for large files. Note that the actual number of used disk blocks almost
       never increases.  <u>gzip</u> preserves the mode, ownership and timestamps  of  files  when  compressing  or
       decompressing.

       The  <u>gzip</u>  file  format  is  specified  in  P.  Deutsch,  GZIP file format specification version 4.3,
       &lt;<a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1952.txt">ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1952.txt</a>, Internet RFC 1952 (May 1996).  The <u>zip</u> deflation format  is
       specified   in   P.   Deutsch,   DEFLATE   Compressed   Data   Format   Specification   version  1.3,
       &lt;<a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1951.txt">ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1951.txt</a>, Internet RFC 1951 (May 1996).


<b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-a</b> <b>--ascii</b>
              Ascii text mode: convert end-of-lines using local conventions. This option is  supported  only
              on some non-Unix systems. For MSDOS, CR LF is converted to LF when compressing, and LF is con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">verted&nbsp;converted</font>
              verted to CR LF when decompressing.

       <b>-c</b> <b>--stdout</b> <b>--to-stdout</b>
              Write output on standard output; keep original files unchanged.  If there  are  several  input
              files, the output consists of a sequence of independently compressed members. To obtain better
              compression, concatenate all input files before compressing them.

       <b>-d</b> <b>--decompress</b> <b>--uncompress</b>
              Decompress.

       <b>-f</b> <b>--force</b>
              Force compression or decompression even if the file has multiple links  or  the  corresponding
              file  already  exists, or if the compressed data is read from or written to a terminal. If the
              input data is not in a format recognized by <u>gzip,</u> and if the option --stdout  is  also  given,
              copy  the  input data without change to the standard output: let <u>zcat</u> behave as <u>cat.</u>  If <b>-f</b> is
              not given, and when not running in the background, <u>gzip</u> prompts to verify whether an  existing
              file should be overwritten.

       <b>-h</b> <b>--help</b>
              Display a help screen and quit.

       <b>-l</b> <b>--list</b>
              For each compressed file, list the following fields:

                  compressed size: size of the compressed file
                  uncompressed size: size of the uncompressed file
                  ratio: compression ratio (0.0% if unknown)
                  uncompressed_name: name of the uncompressed file

              The  uncompressed  size  is  given  as  -1 for files not in gzip format, such as compressed .Z
              files. To get the uncompressed size for such a file, you can use:

                  zcat file.Z | wc -c

              In combination with the --verbose option, the following fields are also displayed:

                  method: compression method
                  crc: the 32-bit CRC of the uncompressed data
                  date &amp; time: time stamp for the uncompressed file

              The compression methods currently supported are deflate, compress, lzh (SCO compress  -H)  and
              pack.  The crc is given as ffffffff for a file not in gzip format.

              With  --name, the uncompressed name,  date and time  are those stored within the compress file
              if present.

              With --verbose, the size totals and compression ratio for all files is also displayed,  unless
              some sizes are unknown. With --quiet, the title and totals lines are not displayed.

       <b>-L</b> <b>--license</b>
              Display the <u>gzip</u> license and quit.

       <b>-n</b> <b>--no-name</b>
              When  compressing, do not save the original file name and time stamp by default. (The original
              name is always saved if the name had to be truncated.) When decompressing, do not restore  the
              original  file name if present (remove only the <u>gzip</u> suffix from the compressed file name) and
              do not restore the original time stamp if present (copy it from  the  compressed  file).  This
              option is the default when decompressing.

       <b>-N</b> <b>--name</b>
              When compressing, always save the original file name and time stamp; this is the default. When
              decompressing, restore the original file name and time stamp if present. This option is useful
              on systems which have a limit on file name length or when the time stamp has been lost after a
              file transfer.

       <b>-q</b> <b>--quiet</b>
              Suppress all warnings.

       <b>-r</b> <b>--recursive</b>
              Travel the directory structure recursively. If any of the file names specified on the  command
              line are directories, <u>gzip</u> will descend into the directory and compress all the files it finds
              there (or decompress them in the case of <u>gunzip</u> ).

       <b>-S</b> <b>.suf</b> <b>--suffix</b> <b>.suf</b>
              Use suffix .suf instead of .gz. Any suffix can be given, but suffixes other than  .z  and  .gz
              should be avoided to avoid confusion when files are transferred to other systems.  A null suf-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fix&nbsp;suffix</font>
              fix forces gunzip to  try decompression on all given files regardless of suffix, as in:

                  gunzip -S "" *       (*.* for MSDOS)

              Previous versions of gzip used the .z suffix. This  was  changed  to  avoid  a  conflict  with
              <!-- a --><u>pack</u>(1)<!-- /a --><u>.</u>

       <b>-t</b> <b>--test</b>
              Test. Check the compressed file integrity.

       <b>-v</b> <b>--verbose</b>
              Verbose. Display the name and percentage reduction for each file compressed or decompressed.

       <b>-V</b> <b>--version</b>
              Version. Display the version number and compilation options then quit.

       <b>-#</b> <b>--fast</b> <b>--best</b>
              Regulate  the  speed  of compression using the specified digit <u>#</u>, where <b>-1</b> or <b>--fast</b> indicates
              the fastest compression method (less compression) and <b>-9</b> or <b>--best</b> indicates the slowest  com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pression&nbsp;compression</font>
              pression  method  (best  compression).   The  default compression level is <b>-6</b> (that is, biased
              towards high compression at expense of speed).

<b>ADVANCED</b> <b>USAGE</b>
       Multiple compressed files can be concatenated. In this case, <u>gunzip</u> will extract all members at once.
       For example:

             gzip -c file1  &gt; foo.gz
             gzip -c file2 &gt;&gt; foo.gz

       Then

             gunzip -c foo

       is equivalent to

             cat file1 file2

       In  case  of damage to one member of a .gz file, other members can still be recovered (if the damaged
       member is removed). However, you can get better compression by compressing all members at once:

             cat file1 file2 | gzip &gt; foo.gz

       compresses better than

             gzip -c file1 file2 &gt; foo.gz

       If you want to recompress concatenated files to get better compression, do:

             gzip -cd old.gz | gzip &gt; new.gz

       If a compressed file consists of several members, the uncompressed  size  and  CRC  reported  by  the
       --list option applies to the last member only. If you need the uncompressed size for all members, you
       can use:

             gzip -cd file.gz | wc -c

       If you wish to create a single archive file with multiple  members  so  that  members  can  later  be
       extracted independently, use an archiver such as tar or zip. GNU tar supports the -z option to invoke
       gzip transparently. gzip is designed as a complement to tar, not as a replacement.

<b>ENVIRONMENT</b>
       The environment variable <b>GZIP</b> can hold a set of default options for <u>gzip.</u>  These options  are  inter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">preted&nbsp;interpreted</font>
       preted first and can be overwritten by explicit command line parameters. For example:
             for sh:    GZIP="-8v --name"; export GZIP
             for csh:   setenv GZIP "-8v --name"
             for MSDOS: set GZIP=-8v --name

       On Vax/VMS, the name of the environment variable is GZIP_OPT, to avoid a conflict with the symbol set
       for invocation of the program.

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       Exit status is normally 0; if an error occurs, exit status is 1. If a warning occurs, exit status  is
       2.

       Usage: gzip [-cdfhlLnNrtvV19] [-S suffix] [file ...]
              Invalid options were specified on the command line.

       <u>file</u>: not in gzip format
              The file specified to <u>gunzip</u> has not been compressed.

       <u>file</u>: Corrupt input. Use zcat to recover some data.
              The  compressed  file  has  been damaged. The data up to the point of failure can be recovered
              using

                    zcat <u>file</u> &gt; recover

       <u>file</u>: compressed with <u>xx</u> bits, can only handle <u>yy</u> bits
              <u>File</u> was compressed (using LZW) by a program that could deal with more <u>bits</u>  than  the  decom-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">press&nbsp;decompress</font>
              press  code  on this machine.  Recompress the file with gzip, which compresses better and uses
              less memory.

       <u>file</u>: already has .gz suffix -- no change
              The file is assumed to be already compressed.  Rename the file and try again.

       <u>file</u> already exists; do you wish to overwrite (y or n)?
              Respond "y" if you want the output file to be replaced; "n" if not.

       gunzip: corrupt input
              A SIGSEGV violation was detected which usually means that the input file has been corrupted.

       <u>xx.x%</u> Percentage of the input saved by compression.
              (Relevant only for <b>-v</b> and <b>-l</b>.)

       -- not a regular file or directory: ignored
              When the input file is not a regular file or directory, (e.g. a symbolic link,  socket,  FIFO,
              device file), it is left unaltered.

       -- has <u>xx</u> other links: unchanged
              The  input  file  has links; it is left unchanged.  See <a href="ln.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ln"><u>ln</u>(1)</a> for more information. Use the <b>-f</b>
              flag to force compression of multiply-linked files.

<b>CAVEATS</b>
       When writing compressed data to a tape, it is generally necessary to pad the output with zeroes up to
       a  block  boundary.  When the data is read and the whole block is passed to <u>gunzip</u> for decompression,
       <u>gunzip</u> detects that there is extra trailing garbage after the compressed data and emits a warning  by
       default.  You  have  to use the --quiet option to suppress the warning. This option can be set in the
       <b>GZIP</b> environment variable as in:
         for sh:  GZIP="-q"  tar -xfz --block-compress /dev/rst0
         for csh: (setenv GZIP -q; tar -xfz --block-compr /dev/rst0

       In the above example, gzip is invoked implicitly by the -z option of GNU tar. Make sure that the same
       block  size (-b option of tar) is used for reading and writing compressed data on tapes.  (This exam-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ple&nbsp;example</font>
       ple assumes you are using the GNU version of tar.)

<b>BUGS</b>
       The gzip format represents the input size modulo 2^32, so the --list option reports incorrect  uncom-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pressed&nbsp;uncompressed</font>
       pressed  sizes  and  compression  ratios for uncompressed files 4 GB and larger.  To work around this
       problem, you can use the following command to discover a large uncompressed file's true size:

             zcat file.gz | wc -c

       The --list option reports sizes as -1 and crc as ffffffff if the compressed file is on a non seekable
       media.

       In  some  rare  cases,  the  --best option gives worse compression than the default compression level
       (-6). On some highly redundant files, <u>compress</u> compresses better than <u>gzip.</u>
