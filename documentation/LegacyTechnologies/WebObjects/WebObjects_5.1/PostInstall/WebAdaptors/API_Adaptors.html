<br><a name = "TPXREF151"></a><h3><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Apache Module</font></h3>
<p>This adaptor has been tested on Mac OS X (with Apache version
1.3.14) and Solaris (with Apache version 1.3.9). It was not tested
on other Apache 1.3.x versions besides the aforementioned, but it
should work. Note that the adaptor is not backward-compatible with
Apache 1.2.x versions, because the module API changed from version
1.2 to 1.3.</p>
<br><a name = "TPXREF152"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Building the Adaptor </font></h4>
<p>For convenience, this adaptor is configured to run out of
the box on Mac OS X; no further installation or configuration is
necessary. Any request with <tt>.../cgi-bin/WebObjects/...</tt> will
be handled by the WebObjects Apache module. The Apache module overrides
the use of the WebObjects executable in <tt>/Library/Web Server/CGI-Executables</tt>,
though you can optionally disable the Apache module so that the
CGI adaptor handles such requests. </p>
<p>On Mac OS X, recompiling is just a matter of running <code>make</code> in
the <tt>/Developer/Examples/WebObjects/Source/Adaptors</tt> directory. </p>
<p>The Apache WebObjects module has been tested on Solaris, as
well. It has not been tested on Windows 2000, but there's no known
reason it shouldn't work. The <code>apxs</code> rule
in the Makefile works fine on Mac OS X and Solaris, but your experience
may be different on other platforms. If your Apache Web server can
already accept Dynamic Shared Objects (DSOs), you can skip to the
instructions for  <a href="#BCIDGEIH">"Configuring the Apache Server"</a>.</p>
<p>General information regarding building Apache and including
new DSO modules can be found at The Apache Group and in the documentation
included with the Web server and source for Apache v.1.3 or later. </p>
<br><a name = "TPXREF153"></a><h5><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Preparing the Apache Web Server
to Accept the WebObjects Adaptor on Platforms other than Mac OS
X</font></h5>
<p>This guide does not attempt to teach you how to build an Apache
Web server that can accept Dynamic Shared Objects such as the Apache
WebObject adaptor. Please refer to the Apache Web site for more
details. Usually, you must at least configure the Web server in the
following manner: </p>
<pre>./configure --enable-module=so</pre>
<br><a name = "TPXREF154"></a><h5><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Compiling the WebObjects Adaptor
as a Dynamic Shared Object (DSO)</font></h5>
<ol><li>Make sure
that you've installed the following on your system: <ul><li>WebObjects</font></li>
<li>Perl (5.005_02 or later)</font></li>
<li>ANSI-C compliant compiler (e.g. gcc-2.7.2 or later)</font></li>
<li>gnumake (3.74 or later)</font></li>
<li>Apache Web server (1.3.9 or later). The default makefiles
assume that the Apache executable apxs is located in<tt> /usr/sbin/apxs</tt> on
Mac OS X and in <tt>/usr/apache/bin/apxs</tt> on Solaris
(which usually means that the whole Apache package is installed
in <tt>/usr/apache</tt> on Solaris systems). If you
install the Apache package elsewhere, you have to modify make.config
in <tt>NEXT_ROOT/Developer/Examples/WebObjects/Source/Adaptors</tt>.</font></li></ul></font></li>
<li>On platforms other than Mac OS X, make sure that you have
defined and exported an environment variable called <tt>NEXT_ROOT</tt> that
contains the path to your WebObjects installation (e.g. <tt>/opt/Apple</tt>).</font></li>
<li>Make sure that you include the paths to the aforementioned
executables in your <tt>PATH</tt> environment variable,
preferably as close to the beginning as possible.</font></li>
<li>Go to the<tt> NEXT_ROOT/Developer/Examples/WebObjects/Source/Adaptors/</tt> directory;
on Mac OS X, go to <tt>/Developer/Examples/WebObjects/Source/Adaptors/</tt>.
Amend make.config so that the variable <code>ADAPTORS</code> is
only equal to Apache. Run make.</font></li>
<li>If this succeeds in building mod_WebObjects.so in <tt>NEXT_ROOT/Developer/Examples/WebObjects/Source/Adaptors/Apache</tt>,
you will not have to rebuild the Apache server. Configure the Apache
Web server.</font></li>
<li>If this fails to build, you will have to rebuild your Apache
Web server.</font></li></ol>
<br><a name = "BCIDGEIH"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Configuring the Apache Server</font></h4>
<p>Once you have built the adaptor and server, you will need
to configure the Web server to handle WebObjects requests. On Mac
OS X, the WebObjects installer has already properly set the configuration
files, but you may still want to modify their parameters. On other platforms,
you'll have to perform the following steps: </p>
<ol><li>Locate the
Apache configuration file in the Apache package on your system.
Usually it's called httpd.conf. On Mac OS X, this file is located
in the <tt>/etc/httpd</tt> directory. Append these lines
to the end of httpd.conf: <pre># Including WebObjects Configs
Include /System/Library/WebObjects/Adaptors/Apache/apache.conf</pre><p>This
example &quot;Include&quot; line assumes that the apache.conf file
supplied by WebObjects resides in the <tt>/System/Library/WebObjects/Adaptors/Apache</tt> directory
(on OS X). For other platforms other than OS X, it should be located
in <tt>NEXT_ROOT/Library/WebObjects/Adaptors/Apache</tt> directory.</p></font></li>
<li>Copy the newly compiled mod_WebObjects.so to <tt>NEXT_ROOT/Library/WebObjects/Adaptors/Apache</tt> (on
Mac OS X, <tt>/System/Library/WebObjects/Adaptors/Apache</tt>).
Ensure that the LoadModule command in apache.conf is pointing at
the right path. Continuing the example from the previous step: 
<pre>LoadModule WebObjects_module /System/Library/WebObjects/Adaptors/Apache/ mod_WebObjects.so</pre></font></li>
<li>You may also want to configure the parameters located in apache.conf: 
<pre>
WebObjectsDocumentRoot  &lt;the document root for the web server&gt; 
WebObjectsAlias         &lt;the URL key&gt;
WebObjectsConfig        &lt;the URI to the configuration file&gt; &lt;interval between re- reading config&gt;</pre><p>For
example: </p><pre>WebObjectsDocumentRoot /Local/Library/WebServer/Documents
WebObjectsAlias /Apps/WebObjects
WebObjectsConfig webobjects://239.128.14.2:1085 10</pre><p>The default
alias is<tt> /cgi-bin/WebObjects</tt>. By default, the
adaptor contacts the local instance of <code>wotaskd</code> to
retrieve configuration information. Please consult the WebObjects
document for more details.</p><p>WebObjects supports three
mechanisms for reading an adaptor configuration:</p><ol><li>to read from a static
URL: <pre>WebObjectsConfig file:///Local/Library/WebObjects/Configuration/ WebObjects.xml
WebObjectsConfig http://www.company.com/private/woappconfig.xml</pre></font></li>
<li>to find applications running on known hosts: 
<pre>WebObjectsConfig http://woserv1:1085,http://woserv2:1085,http://woserv2:1085  10</pre></font></li>
<li>to discover hosts using multicast: 
<pre>WebObjectsConfig webobjects://239.128.14.2:1085 10</pre><p>The
re-read interval for either the host list or multicast mechanisms
is set by specifying the desired re-read interval in seconds at
the end of the line.</p></font></li></ol></font></li>
<li>You may have to add a handler to enable the adaptor to take
over requests. To do this, add a &lt;Location&gt; directive to the
built Web server's httpd.conf file: <pre>
&lt;Location /cgi-bin/WebObjects*&gt;
SetHandler WebObjects
&lt;/Location&gt;</pre></font></li></ol>
<br><a name = "TPXREF155"></a><h4><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Running the Apache Server</font></h4>
<p>Once you've built and configured the server with the linked
adaptor, you should start it and confirm that it's working by moving
aside the WebObjects CGI adaptor in the cgi-bin directory and making
a few requests. If you still are suspicious that the CGI adaptor
may be handling the requests instead of the DSO module, you can
check this by turning on the logging feature of the adaptor as follows:</p>
<ol><li>As root, <code>touch
/tmp/logWebObjects</code></font></li>
<li>Make a request to some WebObjects application to initialize
the log file.</font></li>
<li>From the shell, <code>tail -f /tmp/WebObjects.log</code></font></li>
<li>If the Apache Web server is configured to use the CGI adaptor,
each request is logged with: <pre>
Info: &lt;CGI&gt; new request: /cgi-bin/WebObjects/MyApp</pre></font></li>
<li>If the Apache Web server is configured to use the WebObjects
Apache module, each request is logged with: 
<pre>Info: &lt;WebObjects Apache Module&gt; new request: /cgi-bin/WebObjects/MyApp</pre></font></li></ol>
