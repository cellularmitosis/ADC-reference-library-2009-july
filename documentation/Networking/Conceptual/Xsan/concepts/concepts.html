<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001165-CH204-DontLinkElementID_1" title="Terminology"></a><h2>Terminology</h2><p>A <strong>SAN</strong> is a high-speed subnetwork of shared storage devices.</p><p>A <strong>node</strong> is a computer attached to a SAN.</p><p>The software that manages Xsan file system functions, such as file locking, space allocation, and data access authorization, is called the <strong>metadata controller</strong>.</p><p>Xsan <strong>file system client</strong> software runs on all nodes in the SAN and communicates with the metadata controller in order to provide Xsan services. The term <strong>file system client</strong> refers to a node that is running the Xsan file system client software.</p><p>The metadata controller uses <strong>callbacks</strong> to communicate with file system clients.</p><p>A redundant array of independent disks (<strong>RAID</strong>) device is a category of disk devices that combines two or more drives increased for fault tolerance and performance. There are several RAID levels: </p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Level 0 provides <strong>data striping</strong>, where blocks of a file are spread across multiple disks, increasing performance; this level does not have any provisions that increase fault tolerance.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Level 1 provides disk mirroring.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Level 3 provides the data striping of Level 0 and also reserves a disk for storing error correction data, thereby increasing performance and fault tolerance.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Level 5 provides data striping at the byte level and maintains stripe error correction information.</p></li></ul><p>A <strong>JBOD</strong> (just a bunch of disks) is a disk that is not configured for RAID.</p><p>A <strong>logical unit number </strong>(LUN) is an aggregation of physical devices. Applications access LUNs through the special files in the system’s <code>/dev/disk</code> directory. For RAID devices, a LUN is typically a RAID-5 with three or more physical drives making up the LUN. For JBOD devices, one JBOD is one LUN. </p><p>A <strong>storage pool</strong> is a grouping of LUNs that have the same characteristics. Another term for storage pool is <strong>stripe group</strong>. One or more storage pools form a mountable <strong>volume</strong>. The number of volumes hosted by a single Xsan metadata controller should not exceed eight.</p><p><strong>Stripe depth</strong> is the number of disks that have been assigned to a storage pool.</p><p>The <strong>stripe breadth</strong> is the maximum amount of data that is read or written before switching to the next LUN in the storage pool. When the last LUN is reached, I/O operations go back to t he first LUN. This is how large logical I/O operations are broken down into stripes across multiple LUNs. For example, if the stripe breadth for a storage pool is set at 4 MB, each I/O operation on that storage pool is physically no more than 4 MB. A 16 MB I/O operation would be broken down into 4 physical I/O operations.</p><p>A <strong>stripe line</strong> is the stripe breadth multiplied by the number of LUNs in the storage pool. To maximize performance, make I/O requests that area stripe line in size.</p><p>For real-time I/O, <code></code><strong>well-formed I/O</strong> is I/O that is a stripe line in size. This size makes the best utilization of the disks in the storage pool and maximizes the transfer rate. For non-real-time I/O, well-formed I/O is I/O that is memory aligned (modulus 4 bytes), 512-byte sector aligned, and modulus sector sized. </p><p>A <strong>block</strong> is the smallest number of bytes that can be read or written.</p><p>Storage pools can be assigned one or more values, known as an <strong>affinity identifiers</strong>, and a file can be assigned one <strong>affinity</strong><code></code>. When a request is made to allocate space in a file for which the affinity has been set, the space is allocated from the storage pool that an affinity identifier that matches the file’s affinity. For example, consider a SAN with some moderate performance JBOD LUNs and some high performance RAID-5 LUNs. By grouping the RAID-5 LUNs into the same storage pool and assigning them a specific affinity identifier, the developer can steer performance critical data to that storage pool. Files containing less critical data or files that do not have an affinity are assigned to the storage pool that consists of JBOD LUNs.</p><p>When a storage pool is in <strong>real-time I/O mode</strong>, file system clients that have processes that do non-real-time I/O must request a non-real-time I/O <strong>token</strong> Xsan throttles the speed of I/O of applications that are not in real-time mode so that their I/O does not interfere with real-time I/O. This document uses the term <strong>gate</strong> to describe processes or file descriptors that are not in real-time I/O mode and the term <strong>ungated</strong> to describe processes or file descriptors that are in real-time I/O mode.</p><p>An <strong>extent</strong> is a chunk of file data whose allocation is contiguous on a storage pool. A file’s data may be stored in one or more extents. Information about an extent includes its file-relative starting byte offset, its file system starting byte offset, the file system ending byte offset, and the ordinal of the storage pool on which the extent resides. File system clients use <strong>extent mapping tables</strong> to load information about a file’s extents. Loading extent information improves performance by eliminating a subsequent trip by the file system client to the metadata controller in order to retrieve extent information for the range mapped by an I/O request.</p><p>When there are two or more storage pools that have the same characteristics, an <strong>allocation strategy</strong> is needed. The strategy can be to round-robin files through the set of storage pools, balance the remaining space in the storage pools, or fill the first storage pool before going to the next storage pool.</p><p>A <strong>disk file system</strong>, such as a UFS or HFS+ file system, resides on the internal drives of a computer or on storage devices that are attached directly to the computer. A <strong>network file system</strong> allows data on internal drives or on directly attached drives to be shared with other computers on the network. Examples of network file systems include Apple Filing Protocol (AFP), Server Message Block (SMB), Common Internet File System (CIFS), or Network File System (NFS). A <strong>distributed file system</strong> is a blend of disk file system and network file system used to simplify data sharing through the creation of a single shared name space across a collection of servers. A <strong>cluster file system</strong> gives multiple computers simultaneous, very high-speed access to all shared data residing on an external, centralized storage pool. The storage pool typically consists of highly available RAID systems. Xsan is a cluster file system.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001165-CH204-DontLinkElementID_2" title="Storage Area Networks"></a><h2>Storage Area Networks</h2>
<p>The proliferation of digital content across organizations in virtually every industry is causing storage needs to grow exponentially. In some industries, such as video processing and biotechnology, storage needs double every year. Three basic types of architectures have evolved to meet these growing storage needs:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p><strong>Direct-attached storage</strong> (DAS). A DAS solution consists of disk drives or storage systems connected directly to a server or workstation. Typically, the storage system is connected to a PCI card in the host server or workstation through a Fibre Channel interface. The server formats the DAS using a compatible disk file system, such as UFS or HFS+. It shares the storage with other computers over Ethernet using a network file sharing protocol, such as AFP, SMB, CIFS, or NFS.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p><code></code><strong>Network-attached storage</strong> (NAS). A NAS is a specialized storage device that connects to a local area network and shares files with clients using network file sharing protocols, such as AFP, SMB, CIFS, or NFS. True NAS devices use a specialized server operating system having limited functionality.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p><strong>Storage Area Network</strong> (SAN). A SAN is a network whose primary purpose is to connect (typically over Fibre Channel) multiple storage devices with multiple computers. Unlike a NAS, which uses network file sharing protocols to deliver stored data to network clients, a SAN connects multiple clients directly to the storage network through Fibre Channel switch. Data traverses the SAN using a high-speed SCSI data transfer protocol. A SAN pools storage resources by creating a network of physical storage devices that can be managed as a single virtual storage entity. A SAN centralizes storage management, which simplifies administration and allows storage resources to be used more efficiently.</p></li></ul>
<p>All three storage architectures benefit from continual improvements in the size and performance of disk subsystems. However, only SANs can scale to meet the capacity and performance demands of users in the design and print, video, and biotechnology industries. SAN solutions streamline access to shared storage, simplifying workgroup collaboration and improving workflow productivity. SAN technology also increases the flexibility and scalability of storage deployments, making it easier for administrators to respond to growing capacity and performance requirements. </p>

<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001165-CH204-221462" title="SAN Components"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001165-CH204-BAJBIECI" title="SAN Components"></a><h2>SAN Components</h2>
<p>Like a local area network (LAN), SANs use software and hardware components to create a fabric of interconnected storage devices and computers. SAN components consist of the following:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Storage hardware. Disk-based storage (such as Xserve RAID) is the primary storage media in any SAN solution. Many SANs also use a tape-based system for backup. Appropriate storage hardware should offer high-availability features to prevent data loss or downtime in the event of a disk failure, power outage, or other issue. </p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Host bus adapter (HBA). An HBA is an adapter (usually a PCI card, such as Apple’s 2GB Fibre Channel PCI card) that’s installed in each node computer in a storage network an is used to connect the node to a Fibre Channel switch.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Fibre Channel switch. This multiport device provides the interconnections required to connect multiple Fibre Channel storage devices to computer nodes. Today’s SAN solutions use 1Gb or 2Gb (100MB/s or 200MB/s) Fibre Channel, an open standard technology for reliable, high-speed storage interconnectivity</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Fibre Channel cables. Fibre Channel cables physically connect all of the nodes in a storage network. Copper cables are most economical and used for short distances; optical cables can transmit stored data over many kilometers.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>SAN file system. SAN file system software is the key software component required for building a SAN. A SAN file system (such as Xsan) virtualizes multiple physical storage devices into a single volume and makes it visible to all computer nodes in the SAN. A SAN file system uses a controller to manage metadata, or data about the data, to track the physical location of files and provide file locking to prevent multiple users from accidentally writing to the same file at the same time. </p></li></ul>

<p>Xsan is designed to meet the needs of professional, education, and business users.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001165-CH204-235772" title="Storage Consolidation and NAS Replacement"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001165-CH204-BAJICDAJ" title="Storage Consolidation and NAS Replacement"></a><h3>Storage Consolidation and NAS Replacement</h3>
<p>Businesses in every vertical industry and government agencies are facing constant growth in data and more stringent government regulations for maintaining compliant records. This growth is placing more demand than ever on their storage infrastructures. Previously, most businesses and government agencies relied on a decentralized storage model with many disparate network-attached storage devices deployed throughout the organization—often one for every department or for each network application. This method offers little flexibility, however, and can result in inefficiencies as storage needs grow disproportionately. IT departments must purchase more storage to meet the growing needs of one application, even if existing storage devices may be being under utilized by other applications. This method also results in management inefficiencies, as multiple storage resources are maintained and allocated independently. </p>
<p><span class="content_text"><a href="concepts.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001165-CH204-235794">Figure 1-2</a></span> compares traditional decentralized storage with the data consolidation that SAN technology provides. With traditional centralized storage, each server is connected to a separate storage device. Some storage resources may be under utilized while others are at or near capacity. With SAN technology, data is consolidated into a single storage pool that all computers in the SAN can directly access (through a Fibre Channel switch). This saves money by increasing the efficiency, flexibility, and scalability of an organization’s existing storage resources. </p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001165-CH204-235794" title="Figure 1-2Decentralized storage compared with SAN storage consolidation"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001165-CH204-BAJJHDEB" title="Figure 1-2Decentralized storage compared with SAN storage consolidation"></a><p><strong>Figure 1-2&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Decentralized storage compared with SAN storage consolidation</p><img src = "../art/xsan_01.jpg" alt = "" ></div><br/>
<p>Today, IT departments look at data consolidation as a way to simplify administration and maximize utilization of existing storage resources. Using SAN technology, they can create a consolidated storage pool that can be centrally managed and allocated to any application, anywhere in the organization. By consolidating storage, reducing data duplication, and increasing the flexibility of existing storage hardware, investing in a SAN solution can reduce the storage requirements of organizations and lower IT costs.</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Traditional IT services. The ability to connect many servers to many storage devices, as shown in <span class="content_text">Figure 1-3</span>, enables IT departments to consolidate data for more flexible and efficient utilization of storage resources. Deploying a dedicated storage network can make network services faster and more reliable, because one server isn’t the single point of access for stored data. Xsan also makes it easy to scale out storage—adding more Xserve RAID systems can increase SAN capacity and performance.</p></li></ul>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001165-CH204-235928" title="Figure 1-3Scalable NAS deployment"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001165-CH204-BAJIHAIG" title="Figure 1-3Scalable NAS deployment"></a><p><strong>Figure 1-3&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Scalable NAS deployment</p>
<img src = "../art/xsan_03.jpg" alt = "" ></div><br/>
<p>Educational institutions are experiencing the same growth in storage needs that are facing businesses today. Affordable storage and tools for efficiently consolidating and managing storage resources are critical in this area. Most educational institutions have moved beyond student information systems and now maintain all student records on disk, including student-generated data, such as multimedia projects. Many schools use server-based home directories to make students’ work available to them from any computer on the network. These advances place enormous demand on storage resources and file sharing services. Xsan will be used in educational institutions primarily for data consolidation and creating scalable, affordable, and easy to maintain alternatives to decentralized NAS storage devices.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001165-CH204-221604" title="Collaborative Workflow Requiring High Bandwidth"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001165-CH204-BAJFCEJA" title="Collaborative Workflow Requiring High Bandwidth"></a><h3>Collaborative Workflow Requiring High Bandwidth</h3>
<p>Professionals in the video and audio industries rely heavily on SANs for storing and sharing huge media files. The SAN—not the LAN—is the key to collaboration and efficient workflow for organizations that specialize in professional video and film editing, audio editing, and effects and motion graphics creation.</p>
<p>Capturing video or audio data from tape to digital storage system—the “ingest” process—demands consistent high-bandwidth performance. The SAN must be able to capture media from an ingest station (or multiple ingest stations) accurately and without dropping frames.</p>
<p>Currently, in post-production video and audio workflows, source media is rarely altered. Any alterations, such as color corrections, are noted in the project file and changed media is written as a separate render file. Each editing workstation usually stores these smaller-sized render files on the local drive. During the finishing process, these modifications are transferred on the LAN and merged to create a final master file. </p>
<p>Deployment of Xsan in professional audio and video processing environments eliminates data duplication between systems, which reduces storage requirements. Once data is captured to the SAN, it can be safely and securely stored, and made available to any authorized client workstations without ever being transferred between systems. Each client can work directly on the shared storage device, and multiple individuals can even work on the same file at the same time, streamlining collaboration because there’s no waiting for files to traverse the network. Integration with LDAP directory services enables administrators to impose user-based access controls to secure digital assets. <span class="content_text"><a href="concepts.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001165-CH204-222361">Figure 1-4</a></span> shows how Xsan would be deployed in a video processing environment.</p>

<p>A computational cluster consists of multiple computers running an application against a single large data set. Computational clusters are increasingly being used in scientific computing, render farms, and other processor-intensive applications. The data set is typically hosted on a file server, and individual cluster nodes access the data using a network file system protocol, such as NFS, which limits scalability and performance. Xsan removes these limitations, providing faster, more scalable data sharing across small (64 nodes or less) and large clusters (more than 64 nodes).</p>
<p>In a small cluster, each node is connected directly to the SAN via Fibre Channel and all nodes can mount the same Xsan volume and read directly from the same files, thereby eliminating data replication.</p>
<p>Large clusters use a variation of NAS-SAN integration. Such clusters typically have one or more head nodes that each manage a portion of the cluster. For example, a large cluster may use one head node for every 25 to 50 cluster nodes. In this case, Xsan handles data management at the head node. Each of the head nodes in the cluster is connected directly to the SAN using a Fibre Channel HBA. These nodes access the data sets directly from the SAN and distribute the data to their nodes using network file system protocols, such as NFS. This method of accessing and distributing data is faster and uses less network bandwidth across the cluster than typical NAS solutions. At the end of the processing run, the processed data is returned to the head nodes, which in turn write directly to the shared SAN volume. <span class="content_text"><a href="concepts.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001165-CH204-234932">Figure 1-5</a></span> illustrates the layout of a large computational cluster.</p>

<p>Xsan software must be installed on each computer, or node, in an Xsan SAN. Xsan software includes two components:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p><strong>metadata controller</strong>—this software manages SAN file system functions such as file locking, space allocation, and data access authorization. During setup, the administrator designates one computer as the metadata controller for the SAN. To maximize SAN availability, additional systems can act as failover metadata controllers that take over in the event that the primary metadata controller is incapacitated by a hardware or software failure.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p><strong>file system clients</strong>—this software runs on all other systems participating in the SAN, running side-by-side with other native file systems that the operating supports, such as HFS+ and UFS. The Xsan file system client software communicates with the metadata controller securely over Ethernet, enabling each client to directly access shared disk space on the SAN.</p></li></ul>
<p>Xsan also includes an administration utility that can be installed on any Mac OS X system to enable secure remote setup, management and monitoring of the Xsan SAN, as well as a command line management utility.</p>
