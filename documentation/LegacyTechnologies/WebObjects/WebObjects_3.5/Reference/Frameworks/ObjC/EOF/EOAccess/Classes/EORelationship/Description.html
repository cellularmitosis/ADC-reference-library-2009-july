<h3>Class Description  </h3>

</a>An EORelationship describes an association between two entities, based on attributes of those two entities. By defining EORelationships in your application's EOModel, you can cause the relationships defined in the database to be automatically resolved as enterprise objects are fetched. For example, a Movie entity may contain its <code>studioId</code> as an attribute, but without an EORelationship <code>studioId</code> will only appear in a movie enterprise object as a number. With an EORelationship explicitly connecting the Movie entity to a Studio entity, a movie enterprise object will automatically be given its studio enterprise object when an EODatabaseChannel fetches it from the database. The two entities that make up a relationship can be in the same model or two different models, as long as they are in the same model group.<p>

You usually define relationships in your EOModel with the EOModeler application, which is documented in the <em>Enterprise Objects Framework Developer's Guide</em>. EORelationships are primarily for use by the Enterprise Objects Framework; unless you have special needs you shouldn't need to access them in your application's code.<p>

A relationship is directional: One entity is considered the source, and the other is considered the destination. The relationship belongs to the source entity, and may only be traversed from source to destination. To simulate a two-way relationship you have to create an EORelationship for each direction. Although the relationship is directional, no inverse is implied (although an inverse relationship may exist).<p>

A relationship maintains an array of joins identifying attributes from the related entities (see the EOJoin class specification for more information). Most relationships simply relate the objects of one entity to those of another by comparing attribute values between them. Such a relationship must be defined as to-one or to-many based on how many objects of the destination match each object of the source. This is called the <em>cardinality</em> of the relationship. In a to-one relationship, there must be exactly one destination object for each source object; in a to-many relationship there can be any number of destination objects for each source object. See "Creating a Simple Relationship," below, for more information.<p>

A chain of relationships across several entities can be flattened, creating a single relationship that spans them all. For example, suppose you have a relationship between movies and directors, and a relationship between directors and talent. You can traverse these relationships to create a flattened relationship going directly from movies to talent. A flattened relationship is determined to be to-many or to-one based on the relationships it spans; if all are to-one, then the flattened relationship is to-one, but if any of them is to-many the flattened relationship is to-many. See "Creating a Flattened Relationship," below, for more information.<p>

Like the other major modeling classes, EORelationship provides a user dictionary that the application can use to store application-specific information related to the relationship.<p>

<h3> Specifying the Join Semantic</h3>

</a>The relationship holds the join semantic; you specify this semantic with <B>setJoinSemantic: </B>. There are four types of join semantic, as specified by the EOJoinSemantic type: EOInnerJoin, EOFullOuterJoin, EOLeftOuterJoin, and EORightOuterJoin. An inner join produces results only for destinations of the join relationship that have non-NULL values. A full outer join produces results for all source records, regardless of the values of the relationships. A left outer join preserves rows in the left (source) table, keeping them even if there's no corresponding row in the right table, while a right outer join preserves rows in the right (destination) table.<p>

<B>Note:	</B>

Not all join semantics are supported by all database servers.

<p><a name="419">

<h3> Creating a Simple Relationship</h3>

</a>A simple relationship is defined by the attributes it compares in connecting its source and destination entities. Each source-destination pair of attributes is encapsulated in an EOJoin object. For example, to create a relationship from the Movie entity to the Studio entity, a join has to be created from the <B>studioId </B> attribute of the Movie entity to the same attribute of the Studio entity. The values of these two attributes must be equal for a match to result. Note that <B>studioId </B> is the primary key attribute for the Studio entity, so there can only be one studio per movie; this relationship is therefore to-one.<p>

This code excerpt creates an EORelationship for the relationship described above and adds it to the EOEntity for the Movie entity:<p>

<blockquote><pre>EOEntity *movieEntity;       // Assume this exists.  

</pre></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><pre>EOEntity *studioEntity;      // Assume this exists.

</pre></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><pre>EOAttribute *studioIDAttribute;

</pre></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><pre>EOAttribute *movieStudioIDAttribute;

</pre></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><pre>EOJoin *toStudioJoin;

</pre></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><pre>EORelationship *toStudioRelationship;

</pre></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><pre>

</pre></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><pre>studioIDAttribute = [studioEntity attributeNamed:@"studioId"];

</pre></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><pre>movieStudioIDAttribute = [movieEntity attributeNamed:@"studioId"];

</pre></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><pre>    

</pre></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><pre>toStudioJoin = [[[EOJoin alloc]

</pre></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><pre>    initWithSourceAttribute:movieStudioIDAttribute

</pre></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><pre>    destinationAttribute:studioIDAttribute] autorelease];

</pre></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><pre>

</pre></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><pre>toStudioRelationship = [[[EORelationship alloc] init] autorelease];

</pre></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><pre>[toStudioRelationship setName:@"studio"];

</pre></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><pre>[movieEntity addRelationship:toStudioRelationship];

</pre></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><pre>[toStudioRelationship addJoin:toStudioJoin];

</pre></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><pre>[toStudioRelationship setToMany:NO];

</pre></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><pre>[toStudioRelationship setJoinSemantic:EOInnerJoin];

</pre></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><pre>

</pre></blockquote><p>

This code first gets the attributes from the source and destination entities, and then creates an EOJoin with them. Next, a new EORelationship is created, its name is set, and it's added to <code>movieEntity</code>. The EOJoin is added to the relationship and the relationship is set to be to-one. Finally, in the <B>setJoinSemantic: </B> line, EOInnerJoin indicates that only objects that actually have a matching destination object will be included in the result when the relationship is traversed. <p>

Creating a to-many relationship in the opposite direction merely swaps the source and destination attributes, and assigns the relationship to the EOEntity for the Studio entity:<p>

<blockquote><pre>EOJoin *toMoviesJoin;

</pre></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><pre>EORelationship *toMoviesRelationship;

</pre></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><pre>toMoviesJoin = [[[EOJoin alloc]

</pre></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><pre>    initWithSourceAttribute:studioIDAttribute

</pre></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><pre>    destinationAttribute:movieStudioIDAttribute] autorelease];

</pre></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><pre>

</pre></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><pre>toMoviesRelationship = [[[EORelationship alloc] init] autorelease];

</pre></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><pre>[toMoviesRelationship setName:@"movies"];

</pre></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><pre>[studioEntity addRelationship:toMoviesRelationship];

</pre></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><pre>[toMoviesRelationship addJoin:toMoviesJoin];

</pre></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><pre>[toMoviesRelationship setToMany:YES];

</pre></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><pre>[toMoviesRelationship setJoinSemantic:EOInnerJoin];

</pre></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><pre>

</pre></blockquote><p>

Note that this relationship is to-many precisely because the destination attribute isn't the primary key for its entity (Movie), and therefore isn't unique with regard to that entity.<p>

A relationship isn't restricted to only one EOJoin. It's entirely possible for a relationship to be defined based on two or more attributes in the source and destination entities. For example, consider an employees database that contains a picture of each employee identified by first and last name. You'd define the relationship by joining each of the first and last names in the Employee entity to the same attribute in the <B>EmpPhoto </B> attribute.<p>

A simple relationship is considered to reference all of the attributes in its joins. You can use the <B>referencesProperty: </B> method to find out if an EORelationship references a particular attribute.<p>

<h3> Creating a Flattened Relationship</h3>

</a>A flattened relationship depends on several simple relationships already existing. Assuming that several do exist, creating a flattened relationship is straightforward. For example, suppose that the Movie entity has a to-many relationship to the Director entity, called <code>toDirectors</code>. The Director entity in turn has a relationship to the Talent entity called <code>toTalent</code>. In the Movies database, the Director table acts as an intermediate table between Movie and Talent. In this situation, it make sense to flatten the relationship Movies has to Director (<code>toDirectors</code>) to give Movie access to the Talent table through Director's <code>toTalent</code> relationship. For more discussion of when to use flattened relationships, see the chapters "Designing Enterprise Objects" and "Advanced Enterprise Object Modeling" in the <em>Enterprise Objects Framework Developer's Guide</em>.<p>

This code excerpt creates a flattened relationship from Movie to Talent:<p>

<blockquote><pre>EOEntity *movieEntity;   // Assume this exists.       

</pre></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><pre>EORelationship *toDirectorsRelationship;

</pre></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><pre>toDirectorsRelationship = [[[EORelationship alloc] init] autorelease];

</pre></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><pre>[toDirectorsRelationship setName:@"directors"];

</pre></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><pre>[toDirectorsRelationship setEntity:movieEntity];

</pre></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><pre>[movieEntity addRelationship:toDirectorsRelationship];

</pre></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><pre>[toDirectorsRelationship setDefinition:@"toDirector.toTalent"];

</pre></blockquote><p>

All that's needed to establish the relationship is a data path (also called the definition) naming each component relationship connected, with the names separated by periods. Note that because the cardinality of a flattened relationship is determinable from its components, no <B>setToMany: </B> message is required here.<p>

A simple relationship is considered to reference all of the relationships in its definition, plus every attribute referenced by the component relationships. You can use the <B>referencesProperty: </B> method to find out if an EORelationship references another relationship or attribute.<p>

EODeleteRuleNullify<br>EODeleteRuleCascade<br>EODeleteRuleDeny<br>EODeleteRuleNoAction<p>For more discussion of what these rules mean, see the method description for <code>deleteRule</code>.<p>

<a name="597">

<h4> <a name="//apple_ref/occ/instm/EORelationship/setEntity:">setEntity:</a></h4>

</a>- (void)<code>setEntity:</code>(EOEntity *)<em>anEntity</em> <p>

Sets the entity of the relationship to <em>anEntity</em>. If the relationship is currently owned by a different entity, this method will remove the relationship from that entity. This method doesn't add the relationship to the new entity. EOEntity's <B>addRelationship: </B> method invokes this method. <p>

You only need to use this method when creating a flattened relationship; use EOEntity's <B>addRelationship: </B> to associate an existing relationship with an entity.<p>

<h4> <a name="//apple_ref/occ/instm/EORelationship/setName:">setName:</a></h4>

</a>- (void)<code>setName:</code>(NSString *)<em>name</em> <p>

Sets the relationship's name to <em>name</em>. Raises a verification exception if <em>name</em> is not a valid relationship name, and NSInvalidArgumentException if <em>name</em> is already in use by an attribute or another relationship in the same entity.<p>

This method forces all objects in the model to be loaded into memory.<p>

<h4> <a name="//apple_ref/occ/instm/EORelationship/setOwnsDestination:">setOwnsDestination:</a></h4>

</a>- (void)<code>setOwnsDestination:</code>(BOOL)flag<p>

Sets according to <em>flag</em> whether a receiver's source object owns its destination objects. The default is NO. When a source object owns its destination objects, it means that the destination objects can't exist independently. For example, in a personnel database, dependents can't exist without having an associated employee. Removing a dependent from an employee's <code>dependents</code> array would have the effect of also deleting the dependent from the database, unless you transferred the dependent to a different employee.<p>

</a>- (void)<code>setPropagatesPrimaryKey:</code>(BOOL)<em>flag</em> <p>

Specifies according to <em>flag</em> whether objects should propagate their primary key to related objects through this relationship. For example, an Employee object might propogate its primary key to an EmployeePhoto object. Objects only propagate their primary key values if the corresponding values in the destination object aren't already set.<p>

<a name="622">

<h4> <a name="//apple_ref/occ/instm/EORelationship/setToMany:">setToMany:</a></h4>

</a>- (void)<code>setToMany:</code>(BOOL)<em>flag</em> <p>

Sets a simple relationship as to-many according to <em>flag</em>. Raises an NSInvalidArgumentException if the receiver is flattened. See the class description for considerations in setting this flag.<p>

<h4> <a name="//apple_ref/occ/instm/EORelationship/validateName:">validateName:</a></h4>

</a>- (NSException *)<code>validateName:</code>(NSString *)<em>name</em> <p>

Validates <em>name</em> and returns <B>nil </B> if its a valid name, or an exception if it isn't. A name is invalid if it has zero length; starts with a character other than a letter, a number, or "@", "#", or "_"; or contains a character other than a letter, a number, "@", "#", "_", or "$". A name is also invalid if the receiver's EOEntity already has an EORelationship with the same name, or if the model has a stored procedure that has an argument with the same name.<p>

<B>setName: </B> uses this method to validate its argument.<p>

<h4> <a name="//apple_ref/occ/instm/EORelationship/validateValue:">validateValue:</a></h4>

</a>- (NSException *)<code>validateValue:</code>(id *)<em>valueP</em><p>

For relationships marked as mandatory, returns a validation exception if the receiver is to-one and <em>valueP</em> is <code>nil</code>, or if the receiver is to-many an <em>valueP</em> has a count of 0. A mandatory relationship is one in which the target of the relationship is required. Returns <code>nil</code> to indicate success.<p>
