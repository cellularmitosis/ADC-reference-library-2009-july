<h3 class="section">9.4 Brief description of <span class="command">gcov</span> data files</h3>

<p><span class="command">gcov</span> uses three files for doing profiling.  The names of these
files are derived from the original <em>source</em> file by substituting
the file suffix with either <span class="file">.bb</span>, <span class="file">.bbg</span>, or <span class="file">.da</span>.  All
of these files are placed in the same directory as the source file, and
contain data stored in a platform-independent method.

   <p>The <span class="file">.bb</span> and <span class="file">.bbg</span> files are generated when the source file
is compiled with the GCC <span class="option">-ftest-coverage</span> option.  The
<span class="file">.bb</span> file contains a list of source files (including headers),
functions within those files, and line numbers corresponding to each
basic block in the source file.

   <p>The <span class="file">.bb</span> file format consists of several lists of 4-byte integers
which correspond to the line numbers of each basic block in the file. 
Each list is terminated by a line number of 0.  A line number of
&minus;1 is used to designate that the source file name (padded to a
4-byte boundary and followed by another &minus;1) follows.  In
addition, a line number of &minus;2 is used to designate that the name
of a function (also padded to a 4-byte boundary and followed by a
&minus;2) follows.

   <p>The <span class="file">.bbg</span> file is used to reconstruct the program flow graph for
the source file.  It contains a list of the program flow arcs (possible
branches taken from one basic block to another) for each function which,
in combination with the <span class="file">.bb</span> file, enables gcov to reconstruct the
program flow.

   <p>In the <span class="file">.bbg</span> file, the format is:
<pre class="smallexample">             name of function #0
             checksum of function #0
             number of basic blocks for function #0 (4-byte number)
             total number of arcs for function #0 (4-byte number)
             count of arcs in basic block #0 (4-byte number)
             destination basic block of arc #0 (4-byte number)
             flag bits (4-byte number)
             destination basic block of arc #1 (4-byte number)
             flag bits (4-byte number)
             ...
             destination basic block of arc #N (4-byte number)
             flag bits (4-byte number)
             count of arcs in basic block #1 (4-byte number)
             destination basic block of arc #0 (4-byte number)
             flag bits (4-byte number)
             ...
</pre>
   <p>A &minus;1 (stored as a 4-byte number) is used to separate each function's
list of basic blocks, and to verify that the file has been read
correctly.

   <p>The function name is stored as a &minus;1 (4 bytes), the length (4 bytes),
the name itself (padded to 4-byte boundary) followed by a &minus;1 (4 bytes).

   <p>The flags are defined as follows:
     <ul>
<li>bit0
On function spanning tree

     <li>bit1
Is a fake edge

     <li>bit2
Is the fall through edge from one block to its immediate successor.

     <li>bit3-bit31
For future expansion

   </ul>

   <p>The <span class="file">.da</span> file is generated when a program containing object files
built with the GCC <span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span> option is executed.  A
separate <span class="file">.da</span> file is created for each source file compiled with
this option, and the name of the <span class="file">.da</span> file is stored as an
absolute pathname in the resulting object file.  This path name is
derived from the object file name by substituting a <span class="file">.da</span> suffix.

   <p>The <span class="file">.da</span> consists of one or more blocks with the following
structure:
<pre class="smallexample">             "magic" number &minus;123 (4-byte number)
     	number of functions (4-byte number)
             length of the "extension block" in bytes
     	extension block (variable length)
       	name of function #0 (the same format as in .bbg file)
             checksum of function #0
     	number of instrumented arcs (4-byte number)
             count of arc #0 (8-byte number)
             count of arc #1 (8-byte number)
             ...
     	count of arc #M_0 (8-byte number)
       	name of function #1 (the same format as in .bbg file)
             checksum of function #1
     	...
</pre>
   <p>Multiple program runs might merge data into a single block, or might
append a new block. The current structure of the extension block is as
follows:
<pre class="smallexample">             number of instrumented arcs in whole program (4-byte number)
             sum all of instrumented arcs in whole program (8-byte number)
             maximal value of counter in whole program (8-byte number)
             number of instrumented arcs in the object file (4-byte number)
             sum all of instrumented arcs in the object file (8-byte number)
             maximal value of counter in the object file (8-byte number)
</pre>
   <p>All three of these files use the functions in <span class="file">gcov-io.h</span> to store
integers; the functions in this header provide a machine-independent
mechanism for storing and retrieving data from a stream.
