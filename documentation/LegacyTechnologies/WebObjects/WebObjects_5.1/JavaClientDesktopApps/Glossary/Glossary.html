<dl>
<dt><b>adaptor, database</b></dt><dd>A
mechanism that connects your application to a particular database
server. For each type of server you use, you need a separate adaptor.
WebObjects provides an adaptor for databases conforming to JDBC.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><b>adaptor, WebObjects</b></dt>

WebObjects applications to an HTTP server.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><b>application object</b></dt>
<dd>An object (of the WOApplication class) that
represents a single instance of a WebObjects application. The application
object's main role is to coordinate the handling of HTTP requests,
but it can also maintain application-wide state information.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><b>attribute</b></dt>
<dd>In Entity-Relationship modeling, an identifiable
characteristic of an entity. For example, lastName can be an attribute
of an Employee entity. An attribute typically corresponds to a column
in a database table. See also entity; relationship.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><b>business logic</b></dt>
<dd>The rules associated with the data in a database
that typically encode business policies. An example is automatically
adding late fees for overdue items.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><b>CGI</b></dt>
<dd>A standard for interfacing external applications
with information servers, such as HTTP or Web servers. Short for
Common Gateway Interface.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><b>class</b></dt>
<dd>In object-oriented languages such as Java, a
prototype for a particular kind of object. A class definition declares
instance variables and defines methods for all members of the class. Objects
that have the same types of instance variables and have access to
the same methods belong to the same class.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><b>class property</b></dt>
<dd>An instance variable in an enterprise object
that meets two criteria: It's based on an attribute in your model,
and it can be fetched from the database. "Class property" can
either refer to an attribute or to a relationship.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><b>Cocoa</b></dt>
<dd>A framework containing all the objects you
need to implement your graphical, event-driven user interface: windows,
dialogs, buttons, menus, scroll bars, and text fields. Cocoa handles

hardware devices and screen buffers, clears areas of the screen
before drawing, and clips views.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><b>column</b></dt>
<dd>In a relational database, the dimension of
a table that holds values for a particular attribute. For example,
a table that contains employee records might have a column titled "LAST_NAME"

columns. See also attribute; table.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><b>Entity-Relationship modeling</b></dt>
<dd>A discipline for examining and representing
the components and interrelationships in a database system. Also known
as E-R modeling, this discipline factors a database system into

to retrieve data from the database server into the client application,
usually into enterprise objects.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><b>foreign key</b></dt>
<dd>An attribute in an entity that gives it access
to rows in another entity. This attribute must be the primary key
of the related entity. For example, an Employee entity can contain
the foreign key deptID, which matches the primary key in the entity
Department. You can then use deptID as the source attribute in Employee
and as the destination attribute in Department to form a relationship
between the entities. See also primary key; relationship.</dd></dl>

enterprise objects to be accessed by name (that is, as key-value
pairs) by other parts of the application.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><b>key-value pair</b></dt>
<dd>See key-value coding.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><b>locking</b></dt>
