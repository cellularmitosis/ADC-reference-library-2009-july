DelegateOnlyComponent Ä:	This sample component pretends to be a data handler.  But, all it does is delegate to the real data handler.  This is a useful component sample to start with if you are writing a component to overide the functionality of another component.  However, since this component relies on being installed after QuickTime is loaded, if it is used to overide a standard QuickTime component, you may need to combine this component with another installation method to have it install properly.  See MyRegisterComponent.  Also, see develop article in issue #15 on Manager Component Registration.FastDitherUsingQT Ä:   This is actually a QuickDraw sample.  Instead of using QuickDraw's dither routines, if shows how you can use QuickTime's fast dithering method to copybits.MCComponent Ä:   This is a sample component that overides the standard movie controller.  This is an untested component which I've spent very little time working on.  I wrote it for fun, and couldn't find any additional time to work on it.  Basically, if you hit the tab key when any movie controller window is active, it will fade the screen to black, and the fade back with just the movie window showing.  Obviously, if you hit the tab key, or close the window, the screen should go back to normal.  Use with caution.  Also, there is actually some good sample code here for fading the screen device of any depth, and also for hiding the menu bar.  I've gotten a report from a developer saying that there is a minor bug in my fade routines (something like a short should be an unsigned short), so, beware.  I'll try to fix it in the future.MyCaptureApp Ä:   This is a sequence grabber sample that is going to accompany a develop column.  It not only demonstrates proper sequence grabber useage (hopefully), but is also includes the QuickTime 2.0 feature of recording different media to separate files.  Also, it allows you to turn off video playthru during record for better frames rates when using an AV Macintosh's hardware YUV compressor.MyComponent Ä:	Sample component shell.  Great if you are writing a new component.  Doesn't support PowerPC native yet.MyGrabOneFrame Ä:   I have received many requests for how to grab a single frame using a 'vdig'.  This is a simple sample to show how.MyMultipleMoviesApp Ä:   This is an updated version of code that accompanied my develop column on Multiple Movie Files.  See issue #17.MyQuickTimeApp Ä:   Simple QuickTime playback application using the standard movie controller.  I use this often because it doesn't disable sound when in the background like MoviePlayer does.  Otherwise, this is a pretty simple sample.  If you are adding QuickTime playback support to your application, you might want to take a look at this.  Also, this and many of my other samples, use an application shell which you should take a look at.  It handles required AppleEvents.  It handles other minor things that many applications leave out.  i.e. disk insertion event, proper zooming...  If you need an application shell, this is a good place to look.MyRegisterComponent Ä:   This is a component that simple registers another component and makes it the default component.  The other component is a 'gnht' resource rather than a 'thng' resource.  The reason is that you don't want the component manager to install the component again.  Please see issue #15 on Manager Component Registration if you don't understand the need for this.
