/*	This file of empty stubs, copied from one included with CodeWarrior,	eliminates the need to include the Sioux libraries.*/#ifndef __CONSOLE__#include <console.h>#endif/* *	The following four functions provide the UI for the console package. *	Users wishing to replace SIOUX with their own console package need *	only provide the four functions below in a library. *//* *	extern short InstallConsole(short fd); * *	Installs the Console package, this function will be called right *	before any read or write to one of the standard streams. * *	short fd:		The stream which we are reading/writing to/from. *	returns short:	0 no error occurred, anything else error. */short InstallConsole(short fd){#pragma unused (fd)	return 0;}/* *	extern void RemoveConsole(void); * *	Removes the console package.  It is called after all other streams *	are closed and exit functions (installed by either atexit or _atexit) *	have been called.  Since there is no way to recover from an error, *	this function doesn't need to return any. */void RemoveConsole(void){}/* *	extern long WriteCharsToConsole(char *buffer, long n); * *	Writes a stream of output to the Console window.
