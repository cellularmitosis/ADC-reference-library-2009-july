					<p>This book is an essential quick reference for the QuickTime and Java programmer. It provides the reader with a wealth of programming examples as well as a handy reference that provides an in-depth, class-by-class description of the API. The authors are part of the original QuickTime engineering team that pioneered and developed QuickTime for Java. A CD-ROM at the back of the book provides the reader with working sample code and other resources, so you can get started right away building your own Java applications and applets. 

<p>If you know Java, you'll want to tap into the power and extensibility of QuickTime. If you know C or C++, this book will introduce you to the core QuickTime technologies and their usage from Java. Each chapter is designed to bring you rapidly up to speed in particular areas of QuickTime usage with neatly explained and commented sample code and tutorials.

<p><ul><li>Offers an overview of the QuickTime architecture 

<li>Presents an inside look at the QuickTime for Java programming model and architecture

<li>Includes programming examples and tutorials that demonstrate key features

<li>Serves as a comprehensive reference of all classes and methods, interfaces and fields in the core QuickTime for Java 1.0 API</ul> </p>
		<p>The two authors include a member of Apple's QuickTime
technical writing team (and the author of numerous computer books),
and the Chief Architect of QuickTime for Java at Apple
Computer (an established authority in the field of Java software
development). </p>
