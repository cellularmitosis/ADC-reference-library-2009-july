CocoaVideoFrameToNSImage sample code11/18/02This sample demonstrates how to step frame-by-frame through a QuickTime movie using the GetNextInterestingTime function, drawing each frame of the movie into a GWorld using a decompression sequence. The contents of the GWorld are then converted into a NSImage object. Finally, the NSImage is composited with a background image and drawn into a NSQuickDrawView using the NSImage drawRect method.Simply launch the application, and press the "NextFrame" button to advance frame-by-frame through the movie (note: for MPEG-4 movies the above technique will work, but not MPEG-1 or 2 because with these movie files all frames are treated as a single large sample in the movie).
