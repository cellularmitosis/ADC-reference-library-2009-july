Some issues will showup in almost all software (for example, some font usage), others are lesscommon. Still, this list cannot cover all possible features that your softwaremay have. For the functionality that is specific to an application, the projectteam has to verify that all features are usable worldwide.</p><p>The "Why It Is Relevant" entry in each section is intended to give you an ideawhich internationalization problems you have to watch out for and to let youdecide whether you have to read the rest. Other items show you good or baddesigns of these features, give you some advice on what to do and what toavoid, and point you to further readings.</p><p>The document makes the following assumptions:</p><ul><li>that you have access to the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/Text/Text-2.html"><i>Text</i> volume of <i>Inside Macintosh,</i></A> second edition, and the revised system software interfaces that go along with it. Check your bookstore for the book or the June 1993 Developer CD for a DocViewer version, E.T.O. 11, or the June 1993 Developer CD for the interfaces.<br><br></li><li>that you have read the chapter "<a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/Text/Text-13.html">Introduction to Text on the Macintosh</A>" in <i>Inside Macintosh: Text</i> or some similar introductory material, so you understand terms such as <i>script system, primary script, system direction,</i> and <i>localization.</i><br><br></li><li>that your software uses TextEdit for all editing, text measuring, or texthighlighting needs and does not install TextEdit hook routines. Doing theseoperations correctly for all script systems without TextEdit or with TextEdithook routines is quite complicated, and discussing all the issues involved isbeyond the scope of this checklist.<br><br></li><li>that you write software that will run on System 7 or later. If you have tosupport System 6, the section <A HREF = "#System">"Running on System 6.x or 7.0"</a>gives you some hints.</li></ul><h2>References</h2><p>This checklist may refer you to the following documentation:</p><ul><li><i>IM:</i> <i>Inside Macintosh;</i> if a name follows, we are talking about avolume of the second edition, if a Roman number follows, about a volume of thefirst edition; published by Addison-Wesley.<br><br></li><li><i>MHIG:</i> <i>Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines;</i> published by Addison-Wesley.<br><br></li><li><i>TN:</i> Macintosh Technical Notes; available on the Developer CD and from manyother sources.<br><br></li><li><i>WWD:</i> <i>Macintosh Worldwide Development: Guide to System Software</i> (beta draft).</li></ul><h2><a name=Generic>Creating a Generic User Interface</a></h2><h2>Why It Is Relevant</h2><p>Ideally, to best serve Macintosh users worldwide and to maximize your revenues,you should localize your software products for all countries that Macintoshsystem software supports. In practice however, localization comes at a cost,and so most products get localized only for some countries, and some products(such as developer tools) don't get localized at all. Still, you should providea minimally usable solution for the countries for which you don't localize.This way you can obtain some additional revenue from these countries, and youavoid disappointing power users worldwide who will often go to great lengths toobtain your software even if it is not available in their country.</p><p>This solution would be a version of your software that is fully functional onany international version of system software and uses a "generic" userinterface that looks good on any version of system software. The user interfaceshould probably use English, because that's the most commonly understoodlanguage among Macintosh users, but otherwise not make any assumptions aboutthe system software localization. If you ship only one version of yoursoftware, and your software is not extremely country-specific (such as taxpreparation software), it should be a generic version.</p><h2>Negative Example</h2><p>An application designed for the United States uses the alert text "The file"^0" could not be found.", and at run time uses ParamText to insert a filename.The byte sequence for the substitution pattern and the surrounding curly quotesis $D2 5E 30 D3. On Korean system software, ParamText checks for 2-bytecharacter boundaries before substituting text. The byte sequence however has adifferent meaning in the Korean character set. It happens that $D2 can be thefirst byte of a 2-byte character, and so ParamText sees $D2 5E as a 2-bytecharacter. There is no caret character in the text, so ParamText does notinsert the filename, and the user never gets to know which file is missing.Using """ ($22) would avoid this problem.</p><h2>Negative Example</h2><p>An application dialog box has static text items whose rectangles extend beyondthe right edge of the window. When the dialog box is shown on a right-to-leftsystem, only part of the text is shown--the rest is clipped because the text isshown right-aligned in the rectangle.</p><h2>Negative Example</h2><p>Some products use the trademark symbols (TM) and (R) in filenames. Thecharacter codes will often be interpreted in a different way and displayed asgibberish on non-Roman systems. Use of the (R) symbol may also be fraudulentin some cases (see <A HREF = "#Trademark">"Trademark Symbols"</a> later in this Note).</p><h2>What to Do</h2><p>For user interface elements such as dialog boxes and menu items, as well as forfilenames, use only those printing ASCII characters that are shared among allMacintosh character sets: $20-$5B and $5D-$7E, plus $11-$14 for system fonts($5C is the backslash [\] in most character sets, but the Yen symbol [&#165;]in the Japanese character set). The shared characters will display correctly inany script. Here is a list of recommended substitutions for the most commonnon-ASCII Roman characters found in U.S. applications:</p><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=550><TR>	<td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><pre>Unicode Name                        Character    Substitutionbullet                              *     $A5    *     $2Aregistered trademark sign           (R)     $A8    (R)   $28 52 29copyright sign                      (c)     $A9    (c)   $28 63 29trademark                           (TM)     $AA    TM    $54 4Dhorizontal ellipsis                 ...     $C9    ...   $2E 2E 2Enonbreaking space                         $CA    space $20   (or empty string)en dash                             -     $D0    -     $2Dem dash                             --     $D1    -     $2Ddouble turned comma quotation mark  &quot;     $D2    &quot;     $22double comma quotation mark         &quot;     $D3    &quot;     $22single turned comma quotation mark  '     $D4    '     $27single comma quotation              '     $D5    '     $27</pre>	</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><p>Where you have to use non-ASCII characters (for example, for the copyrightmessage or your company name), display them in a way that lets you specify thefont, for example, a picture. Make sure that the fontForce flag is turned offwhen the text is drawn--otherwise QuickDraw might use a different font (see<A HREF = "#fontForce">"Disabling the fontForce Feature"</a> later in this Note).</p><p>Design your dialog boxes so that they show a clean layout independent of thesystem direction:</p><ul><li>The appearance and alignment of some standard controls depend on the systemdirection. For example, radio buttons can have the actual button at the left orthe right end of the control rectangle. To make a row of radio buttons alwayslook clean, make all buttons equally wide and align them on both sides.<br><br></li><li>Text items are by default aligned following the system direction. Make surethat their rectangles are fully contained in the window so that the text doesnot get clipped at the window edge. If you have control over the alignment (for example, when using MacApp views), make multiline English text left-aligned--even users of right-to-left systems tend to prefer this.</li></ul><p>If you provide language-specific information or extensions with your software(such as spelling checkers for a word processor, or character conversion tablesfor a telecommunication product), make all of them available to users of thegeneric version in some form--either by bundling them or as readily availableadd-on products.</p><p>Define defaults in your software so that they serve the majority of thecustomers that you want to reach with this version. For example, for thegeneric versions of Apple printer drivers, the default paper size is A4.</p><p>Don't depend on any specific file or folder names in the system softwareenvironment. A localized application might get away with defining the name ofthe Preferences folder in a string resource, but a generic version has to usethe FindFolder routine.</p><p>Test your software at least on Arabic and Japanese system software, and verifythat everything looks and works fine.</p><p>If you provide an Installer with your product, again make sure that theInstaller script does not depend on any specific file or folder names. See the<A HREF = "#Installer">"Installer Scripts"</a> section below.</p><p>For a generic version that is separate from the U.S. version, Apple uses thelanguage code "Z" in human-readable strings and the region code 37 in the'vers' resources.</p><h2>What to Read</h2><p><a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/Toolbox/Toolbox-2.html">IM Macintosh Toolbox Essentials</A> 7-54--7-56 (for FindFolder).</p><h2><a name=System>Running on System 6.x or 7.0</a></h2><h2>Why It Is Relevant</h2><p>Some of the international features documented in <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/Text/Text-2.html">IM Text</A> were introduced in System 7.0 or 7.1, and do not exist in earlier system software. Unfortunately, IM Text, which mainly documents the functionality available in System 7.1, does not tell you in enough detail which features were introduced at which time, and omits documentation for some older routines that you will need if your application has to run onolder system software.</p><h2>What to Do</h2><p>Design your application using the information in <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/Text/Text-2.html">IM Text</A>--it's the most coherent documentation of the international features that's available, and its Appendix D is very useful if you want to modify existing code to take full advantage of System 7.1. Add the usual calls to Gestalt to verify that all special features that you need and that Gestalt knows about are available. Prime candidates for this are the Text Services Manager and the Dictionary Manager.</p><p>Then go back and check that everything that you need is actually available onall systems that your software has to run on. The Technical Note "InsideMacintosh Text and Life Before 7.1" helps you with this task.</p><p>Finally, of course, test your software on all system software versions that itis supposed to run on. Don't forget to test with system software versions inother languages than your own--especially in System 6 there may be somesurprising differences between, say, the Japanese and the Arabic versions ofthe same system software release.</p><h2>What to Read</h2><p><a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/Text/Text-2.html">IM Text</A> 6-6--6-9, 7-17, 8-11, D-1--D-7; WWD; TN TE 26 <A HREF = "../te/te_26.html">"Inside Macintosh Text and Life Before 7.1"</a>.</p><h2><a name=LanguageKits>Working With Language Kits</a></h2><h2>Why It Is Relevant</h2><p>Language kits contain the system extensions and fonts necessary to install asecondary script on any version of System 7.1. The Japanese Language Kit was the firstone to ship recently. While language kits primarily deliver on the promise of WorldScript--to provide a true multiscript environment that lets users createmultilingual documents--they come with a new extension that slightly changesthe programming model of WorldScript: the Language Kit Extension.</p><p>The purpose of this extension is to allow users to use applications that arelocalized for a language that uses a script other than the system script. Forexample, a user can run an application with a Japanese user interface onRussian system software, and have menus and dialogs of that applicationcorrectly display in Japanese.</p><p>To achieve this, the Language Kit Extension effectively defines an "applicationscript" that is separate from the system script. It modifies the globalvariables that define the application font and the system font on aper-application basis. If the application script is correctly defined for theuser interface language of an application, all text defined by the applicationand drawn using the system and application fonts is readable. Where applicationand system software work together to present user interface elements, forexample, in print dialog boxes, the Language Kit Extension does some similartricks to achieve the most readable interface possible.</p><p>Except for GetAppFont and GetSysFont, the Language Kit Extension does notaffect the operation of the routines documented in <i>Inside Macintosh: Text.</i> In particular, it does not affect the decision as to which resources are by default used for generating date and time strings or for sorting in yourapplication or the results returned from GetScriptManagerVariable and GetScriptVariable.</p><p>This behavior unfortunately invalidates an assumption that up to now was safeto make, and that many applications have relied on: that you can always use thesystem or application font to display text obtained from the Text Utilitiesroutines with default parameters, and that your system and application fontsalways belong to the system script.</p><p>The Language Kit Extension determines the script to be used for an applicationby looking at two sources: the application's 'vers' resource and the LanguageRegister database. The Language Register is a utility that comes with thelanguage kits and that allows the user to specify the "language," really thescript, of an application. In case of conflict, the Language Register databaseis used.</p><BR><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=550><TR><td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><P><B>Note:</B><BR>In spite of its name, the Language Kit Extension does not doanything about languages--it's not a magic localization tool. It's just thatusers understand the term <i>language</i> much better than <i>script,</i> andso we have language kits instead of script kits.</P></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><BR><h2>Negative Example</h2><p>Some applications that are localized for Japanese check on launch whether thesystem script is Japanese, and refuse to run otherwise. Obviously, these applicationsare useless on a non-Japanese system with the Japanese Language Kit.</p><h2>Negative Example</h2><p>Some applications display date information about documents by using theobsolete IUDateString routine or by passing nil to the DateString routine, andthen displaying the resulting text in the system font. If, for example, theapplication is localized to Japanese and runs on German system software, itwould get German date strings and display them with a Japanese font, whichsometimes results in gibberish: the Japanese font would replace the "&auml;r"in the long date string "Samstag, 7. M&auml;rz 1992" with a Kanji character.</p><h2>What to Do</h2><p>If you need to check for the presence of specific script systems, callGetScriptVariable (theScriptID, smScriptEnabled).</p><p>Make sure that text that you get from the Text Utilities routines or pass tothem, and the fonts that you use to display such text, match. Simple choicesare to take everything from the system script or everything from theapplication script--the system script may be preferable because that's the onlyone whose formats the user can change with the Date &amp; Time and Numberscontrol panels. For text that goes into documents you should let the userchoose the script or language. You can find the application script code bycalling FontToScript(GetAppFont) with the fontForce flag turned off (see<A HREF = "#fontForce">"Disabling the fontForce Feature"</a> later in this Note), for the system script you simply use smSystemScript. Once you have the script code, you would explicitly request resources and fonts for thisscript--for example, to display the short date:</p><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=550><TR>	<td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><pre>theResourceID := GetScriptVariable(theScript, smScriptNumber);theResource := GetResource('itl0', theResourceID);DateTime(yourDateTime, shortDate, theDateString, theResource);TextFont(GetScriptVariable(theScript, smScriptSysFond));DrawString(theDateString);</pre>	</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><p>In most places where you let the user edit text, you should allow formultistyled text or let the user choose the script or font to be used. A Finddialog box for a multiscript word processor is not very useful if it limits theuser to search strings in the application script.</p><p>Include 'vers' resources in all your files, and use the correct region code forthe region that the files are localized for.</p><p>If your application uses separate files containing resources that are logicallypart of the application, for example, optional Balloon Help files, make sure touse the application signature as the creator for all files. This lets theLanguage Kit Extension know that it should use the same script for userinterface elements defined in the separate files as for those defined in theapplication itself.</p><p>If your application is multilingual, that is, contains user interface resourcesin multiple languages and at launch time determines which language to use forits user interface, you should look at the font returned by GetAppFont todetermine whether the user has registered the application for a specificscript. Unfortunately, there is no way to find out which language the user hasreally selected in the Language Register application, so you should use thedefault language of the application script if you support it. You can callGetScriptVariable (FontToScript (GetAppFont), smScriptLang) to find the defaultlanguage (you have to call InitFonts first, because that's where the LanguageKit Extension sets the application font). If you don't have resources for thatlanguage, you can either fall back to your generic user interface resources orlet the user choose from a list of languages that use the application script.You can use the 'itlm' resource to find out which languages belong towhich script.</p><h2>What to Read</h2><p><a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/Text/Text-2.html">IM Text</A> 4--54 (GetAppFont, GetSysFont), Script Manager (FontToScript,GetScriptVariable), B-12--B-17 ('itlm' resource).</p><h2><a name=fontForce>Disabling the fontForce Feature</a></h2><h2>Why It Is Relevant</h2><p>Since some applications have hard-coded fonts, a feature was introduced thatallows system software to return information for a font belonging to the systemscript when an application actually requested information for a font belongingto the Roman script. This affects many different operations, from the low-levelFontToScript routine up to the QuickDraw DrawText routine. The feature iscontrolled by the Script Manager's fontForce flag. Users of some non-Romanscript systems can set or clear the flag using the Text control panel in System7.1 or similar control panels in some earlier system software versions. If youuse the Script Manager the way it is intended, but do not turn off thefontForce flag, you may get some surprising results (the descriptions of manyroutines were updated in <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/Text/Text-2.html">IM Text</A> so that they now match the results).</p><h2>What to Do</h2><p>You should disable the fontForce flag for your application, but not modify itfor other applications. Note that the flag is a systemwide global variable, soyou cannot just turn it off in your initialization sequence. You need tworoutines in your application: one that saves the current state of the fontForceflag and clears it, the other that restores the flag to its saved state. Youmust call the state-saving routine at application startup and immediately aftereach call to GetNextEvent/WaitNextEvent, and the restoring routine immediatelybefore each call to GetNextEvent/WaitNextEvent and when quitting yourapplication. If you call other toolbox routines that may in turn callWaitNextEvent (for example, AESend), you have to wrap them just likeWaitNextEvent. This way, your application gets correct results from the Script Manager, and the fontForce feature can still have its effect on other applications.</p><h2>What to Avoid</h2><p>Do not leave the fontForce flag turned on while your application is running(assuming that your code uses the Script Manager as intended). Do not turn offthe fontForce flag for other applications.</p><h2>What to Read</h2><p><a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/Text/Text-2.html">IM Text</A> 6-21--6-25.</p><h2><a name=Fonts>Finding Fonts</a></h2><h2>Why It Is Relevant</h2><p>When your application displays text, it has to use a font that a) is availableon the system, b) supports the character set that was used to write the text,c) is the one selected by the user or by the application if it's available(otherwise you need to find a substitute), d) can be found given theinformation that your application keeps about it. If you hard-code a font in your program (by name or by ID), or if you don't store enough information with your documents, you will not be able to meet all these requirements. The font you pick may not be available in all countries, or may use a character set thatis inappropriate for the text that is being displayed. In addition to that, font IDs are unreliable because fonts may get renumbered during installation.</p><p>In addition to fonts, you may want to specify font sizes, styles, or alignmentin your application. However, not all font sizes and styles make sense in allscripts: Characters smaller than 12 point can be very hard to read in somescripts, and underline is not supported for Japanese fonts. If you specify textalignment, it should usually depend on the script of the text.</p><h2>What to Do</h2><p>Use strategies that vary depending on where the text comes from. The followinghints talk about fonts only; if you want to specify font sizes, styles, or textalignment, extend the recommendations logically.</p><ul><li>To display filenames or other text that comes from the operating system, usea font belonging to the system script (for example, the system font or theapplication font of the system script). Note that when you are running with alanguage kit installed, the default system and application fonts that youaccess by using the systemFont and applFont constants or the GetSysFont andGetAppFont routines may not belong to the system script--they belong to theapplication script, which may have been redefined by the Language KitExtension. To get, say, the system font of the system script, you have to callGetScriptVariable(smSystemScript, smScriptSysFond).<br><br></li><li>To display text that you obtained from Text Utilities routines orinternational resources, use a font whose script matches the script of theresource used. See <A HREF = "#LanguageKits">"Working With Language Kits"</a>earlier in this Note for more details.<br><br></li><li>To display text that is defined in a resource in your application and forwhich you don't rely on the system font, use another resource to define thefont to be used so both can be changed during localization. Use both a fontname and script information to refer to a font.<br><br></li><li>To display text that the user enters, let the user pick the font. Use both afont name and script information to refer to a font when you save the information.</li></ul><h2>What to Avoid</h2><p>Don't use any font ID constants other than systemFont and applFont in your code(and these only if you are sure you want fonts of the application script--see<A HREF = "#LanguageKits">"Working With Language Kits"</a> for details).Don't hard-code font names in your code.</p><h2><a name=FontMenus>Displaying Font Menus and Lists</a></h2><h2>Why It Is Relevant</h2><p>In the WorldScript environment, fonts for several different script systems canbe installed in a system. To display the names of these fonts correctly, youhave to use a font of the same script, because often the font names containcharacters unique to the script that the font belongs to.</p><h2>What to Do</h2><p>If possible, use a font menu that is created by calling AppendResMenu. Thisroutine automatically adds script information to the menu items so that theyare displayed in the system fonts of their respective scripts.</p><p>If you choose any other approach, your application is responsible for using theright font. You have to display each font name either in the font itself or inthe system font of the font's script. For menu items, you can specify thescript to be used by setting the keyboard equivalent field to $1C and the iconnumber field to the script code; the item will then be displayed in the systemfont of the specified script. To use the named font itself in a menu, you haveto write your own menu definition procedure, and for font lists, you also haveto roll your own.</p><p>For any approach, you should use AppendResMenu to create an initial list offonts--this routine finds fonts of all types that exist on the Macintosh, andalso screens out some names that are not intended for the user. See theTechnical Note <A HREF = "../te/te_04.html">"Font Names".</a> for details.</p><p>If your application does not support editing in all script systems (forexample, your text engine does not handle bidirectional text yet), you mightconsider screening out fonts that belong to a script that you don't support.</p><h2>What to Read</h2><p>TN TE 04 <A HREF = "../te/te_04.html">"Font Names".</a></p><h2><a name=Coordinates>Hard-Coding Coordinates</a></h2><h2>Why It Is Relevant</h2><p>When your program is run on a different version of system software, text(especially in dialog boxes) may be displayed in a different font and in adifferent text layout, including different line breaks. Also, when theapplication is localized, the size of the text changes, again resulting in adifferent text layout. When an application is localized for right-to-leftsystems (currently Arabic, Hebrew, and Persian), the dialog box layout isusually completely redesigned to flow from right to left instead of from leftto right. If you make assumptions about the text layout or the dialog boxlayout in your code, it will look strange in either case.</p><h2>What to Do</h2><p>Specify the layout of your windows in resources, and leave some room to groweven for unchanged text (the various system fonts do not all have the samemetrics, not even for the ASCII characters). An even better, although somewhatambitious, solution would be to have your application calculate locations andsizes of dialog items from a description of the relative location of the items,the actual text to be displayed, and system information such as textmeasurements and the system direction.</p><h2>What to Avoid</h2><p>Don't use constants in your code to determine the layout of your windows.</p><h2><a name=Strings>Hard-Coding Strings and String Lengths</a></h2><h2>Why It Is Relevant</h2><p>Strings that are embedded in your code cannot be localized, as localizersusually do not have access to source code. During localization, string lengthswill change.</p><p>Names of files and folders in the system environment may be changed duringlocalization or by the user, so your application should not make anyassumptions about them.</p><h2>What to Do</h2><p>Put all strings that may ever be displayed to the user into resources. Usestrlen (C) or Length (Pascal) to find out about the byte length of a string, ora routine using CharByte or CharacterByteType to find out about the number ofcharacters in the string. The number of characters may be interesting for theuser (some word processors display character, word, and paragraph counts);Macintosh toolbox routines only care about the byte length.</p><p>To get access to files or folders in the system environment, for example, thePreferences folder or specific control panels, use the FindFolder routine orsearch for a file using its type and creator.</p><h2>What to Avoid</h2><p>Any constant strings in your code other than debugger messages, any constantstring lengths, any assumptions about names outside your application.</p><h2>What to Read</h2><p><a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/Toolbox/Toolbox-2.html">IM Macintosh Toolbox Essentials</A> 7-54--7-56 (for FindFolder).</p><h2><a name=Concatenating>Concatenating Strings</a></h2><h2>Why It Is Relevant</h2><p>If you concatenate two strings, you implicitly make three assumptions: that thestrings are written using the same script system, that the order of the twostrings in the resulting string is fixed, and that the forms of the twosubstrings do not need to change. These assumptions often do not hold when thestrings are written in different languages than the one you had in mind.Different languages have different sentence structures and use inflection indifferent ways, and may have to be represented in different script systems.</p><h2>Negative Example</h2><p>Your application concatenates "Undo " and a command name such as "Cut" toobtain a more specific "Undo Cut" menu item. If the application then is localized toGerman, the concatenation reads "Widerrufen Ausschneiden", which does not make sense--the reverse order, "Ausschneiden Widerrufen", would be correct.</p><h2>Negative Example</h2><p>Your application concatenates an adjective and a noun in an applicationdeveloped in English. In French, not only would the order be noun-adjective,but also the adjective would need to be adjusted to match the gender and thenumber of the noun.</p><h2>What to Do</h2><p>Store entire sentences in your resources whenever possible. If you need toinsert some text that can be determined only at run time, for example, textthat the user has entered or a filename, use ParamText or some other mechanismfor string substitution to insert this specific text into an otherwise completesentence. See the next section for details.</p><h2>What to Avoid</h2><p>Routines such as strcat, sprintf (C), concat (Pascal), CString::operator+ (MacApp).</p><h2><a name=Substitution>String Substitution</a></h2><h2>What It Is</h2><p>Replacing a pattern in an otherwise complete sentence (for example, "^1" within"Could not find file "^1".") with actual data (in this case, the name of thefile your program could not find). The Dialog Manager's ParamText routine isone mechanism that lets you do this; the ReplaceText routine may be used inother contexts such as menus.</p><h2>Why It Is Relevant</h2><p>Using string substitution instead of string concatenation to construct dialogbox messages is a good first step towards localizability. However, you have tobe careful not to make assumptions about sentence structure and other syntacticpeculiarities of languages. If you can put quotation marks around the text thatyou are inserting, you are probably safe. Otherwise, you have to considercarefully what the completed sentence would look like in variouslanguages.</p><p>A special problem occurs if the text you are inserting is in a different scriptthan the template that it is being inserted into. For example, you may want totell the user that you could not find a Hebrew font that a document is using,and the error message template has been localized to Russian. Neither theDialog Manager nor the MacApp views used for error message display can handlemultiscript text. Therefore the Hebrew font name will usually be displayed asgibberish on any non-Hebrew system unless you write your own alert mechanismusing multistyled TextEdit.</p><h2>Positive Example</h2><p>You want to tell the user that a file could not be found, and use the string"Could not find file "^1"." This makes it easy to localize the message, andalso easy to insert the filename.</p><h2>Positive Example</h2><p>The Finder often has to insert numbers into strings, for example, "5 files and1 folder are in the Trash for a total of 52K." As the form of the nouns has tobe adjusted to the numbers in ways that vary widely from language to language,the Finder uses a pattern language that lets a programmer or localizer specifywhich forms to use for 0, 1, or many. This makes it possible to display correctmessages for most languages (unfortunately not for Russian, which has morenumber-dependent forms of a noun).</p><h2>Negative Example</h2><p>You define a string such as "^0 ^1 ^2." in a resource and use it in your program to construct various different messages. This string is functionally equivalent to concatenation, so it usually causes all the problems mentioned in the "Concatenating Strings" section. Localizers may be able to correct the problem with the orderof substrings, say, by changing the string to "^1 ^0 ^2.", but only if they know all the messages constructed with this string and the new order applies to all of them. Usually, however, this is not possible.</p><h2>Negative Example</h2><p>You want to save some space and therefore split three similar messages intofour partial strings, stored in a resource: "Caution! This disk is ^0.", "locked," "damaged," "not initialized." Substituting the last string into the first nicely results in "Caution! This disk is not initialized.". The Italian version of this however should read "Attenzione! Questo disco non &egrave; inizializzato.", and this can not be achieved by simply translating the partial strings and substitution, because in Italian the "non" (not) goes before the verb "&egrave;" (is). If the strings are not used in other contexts, a localizer may fix the problem by moving the verb into the insertion strings, but this solution is not generally possible.</p><h2>What to Do</h2><p>Use ParamText or other substitution mechanisms only to insert filenames, fontnames, or text entered by the user into otherwise complete sentences. If youcan put quotation marks around the substitution pattern, as in "Could not findfile "^1".", you are usually safe.</p><p>If you implement a mechanism similar to ParamText to insert text into stringsthat are not shown in a dialog box, check for 2-byte characters when lookingfor the "^" character--the same byte value can also be used as the second byteof a 2-byte character.</p><p>If your text is in a handle and both the inserted text and the template arewritten in the same script, you can use the ReplaceText routine, which willautomatically check for character boundaries; otherwise you have to use theCharByte or CharacterByteType routines to do it yourself.</p><p>If you insert text that may require changes to the surrounding text in anylanguage, or if the inserted text needs to be adjusted, you have to provide a way for localizers to describe the correct sentence forms. Typical candidates are:</p><ul><li>inserting numbers: It must be possible to adjust the nouns, for example, "0files," "1 file."<br><br></li><li>inserting nouns: It must be possible to adjust articles, adjectives, and verbforms to the number and gender of the noun. See the next item for an example.<br><br></li><li>using pronouns: It must be possible to adjust the pronoun and relatedarticles, adjectives, and verb forms to the number and gender of the noun thatthe pronoun refers to. An example for this and the previous item is thesentence "The ^0 could not be ^1 because it could not be found.", with possiblesubstitution strings "application" and "files" for "^0" and "opened" for "^1".In French, you cannot just insert the corresponding nouns "application" and"fichiers" and the participle "ouvert" into a template "Le ^0 n'a pas pu&ecirc;tre ^1 car il est introuvable." Instead, you have to adjust the article"le," the auxiliary verb "a," the participle "ouvert," the pronoun "il," theverb "est," and the adjective "introuvable" to arrive at the complete sentences"L'application n'a pas pu &ecirc;tre ouverte car elle est introuvable." and"Les fichiers n'ont pas pu &ecirc;tre ouverts car ils sont introuvables."</li></ul><p>If the inserted text can be in a different script than the template (forexample, you insert a font name or text taken from a multiscript document), youcannot use ParamText or ReplaceText for the substitution, and you cannot usethe Dialog Manager for displaying the resulting string. In this case you haveto use multistyled TextEdit to construct a text record with appropriate styleinformation and to display it. In cases where the real script of the insertedtext cannot be determined (for example, filenames), this additional effort maynot make sense. Here users may have to live with an occasional display ofgibberish.</p><h2>What to Avoid</h2><p>Do not use ParamText to construct sentences. Do not use Munger or similarroutines that search byte-by-byte to perform text substitutions. Don't insertfont names or text entered by the user into template text for menu items--it isnot possible to have multiscript menu items without writing your own menudefinition procedure.</p><h2>What to Read</h2><p><a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/Toolbox/Toolbox-2.html">IM Toolbox Essentials</A> 6-46--6-48, 6-129--6-130; <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/Text/Text-2.html">IM Text</A> 5-74--5-75; IMText--TextEdit; <A HREF = "#Characters">"Working With Individual Characters"</a> later in this Note.</p><h2><a name=Truncating>Truncating Strings</a></h2><h2>Why It Is Relevant</h2><p>There are two very different situations where you may need to truncate text:</p><p>a) the data structures you use only allow for limited string lengths and youhave to shorten user input to fit into the string length,</p><p>b) you want to draw a string into a field (on screen or on paper) of limited width.</p><p>In case a), you have to make sure that you copy only entire characters from theuser input to the string in your data structures. For example, if your stringonly allows for 31 bytes, but the user enters sixteen 2-byte characters, youhave to truncate to fifteen 2-byte characters or 30 bytes. Truncating to 31bytes would leave one meaningless byte at the end of the string.</p><p>In case b), you also have to watch out for 2-byte characters, but there areadditional complications such as zero-width characters (often used for applied marks such as Thai vowels), which should never be separated from the preceding base characters, and ligatures, which are usually less wide than the individual component characters. Also, you should use the appropriate character for indicating the truncation. For languages using the Latin writing system, "..." is commonly used, but other languages may use different characters.</p><h2>What to Do</h2><p>In case a), use the CharByte or CharacterByteType routines to check the lastbyte that would fit into your string, and remove it if it is the first byte ofa 2-byte character.</p><p>In case b), use the TruncString or TruncText routines to truncate the text.These routines use the appropriate truncation indicator for the language beingused, handle zero-width characters and ligatures appropriately, and at leastfor truncation at the end also handle 2-byte characters correctly.</p><p>Unfortunately there are some problems if you specify truncation in the middle:Truncated ASCII text on a right-to-left system may look strange because theellipsis is a right-to-left character and so the text pieces are displayed inreverse order, and due to a bug in System 7.1, 2-byte characters are not alwayshandled correctly. It is therefore better not to use the truncMiddle specifier.</p><p>If you want to write your own truncation routine, you should get the characterto indicate the truncation from the default 'itl4' resource's untoken tableusing the tokenEllipsis selector.</p><h2>What to Read</h2><p>Case a): <A HREF = "#Characters">"Working With Individual Characters"</a> below.</p><p>Case b): <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/Text/Text-2.html">IM Text</A> 5-71--5-74.</p><h2><a name=Characters>Working With Individual Characters</a></h2><h2>Why It Is Relevant</h2><p>Some Macintosh character sets contain both 1- and 2-byte characters. Operationsthat deal with individual characters have to allow for 2-byte characters andmake sure that they treat 2-byte characters as an entity.</p><h2>What to Do</h2><p>If you store individual characters, you have to provide space for 2-bytecharacters (you can use the WideChar data type). If you do character operationson strings, you have to check for character boundaries. If your applicationrequires System 7.1 or later, you can use the new CharacterByteType routine forthis, otherwise you have to use the older CharByte routine. CharacterByteTypetakes an explicit script parameter, while CharByte requires you to set the fontin the current grafPort corresponding to the script used for the text.</p><h2>What to Avoid</h2><p>Do not assume that a character equals 1 byte.

For the second purpose,you need a sorting order that makes sense to the user.</p><p>If your application allows the user to use multiple script systems (it should),you also have to take the script(s) used for each string into account.</p><p>Correct sorting according to the user's needs, especially in a multiscriptenvironment, can be quite complicated.

Therequirements for text editing behavior differ dramatically among scriptsystems--an editing engine has to be able to delete 2-byte characters, move thecaret in mixed 1- and 2-byte or in bidirectional text, make discontinuousselections, line-wrap text that does not contain space characters, displaycontextual text in the correct form, and more. Often text in a mixture ofseveral scripts has to be supported.</p><h2>What to Do</h2><p>If at all possible, you should use TextEdit for the text editing needs of yourapplication. TextEdit is not very fancy, but it works correctly with all scripts. If you use multistyled TextEdit, users will be able to mix several scripts in one chunk of text, otherwise they will be limited to one script system.</p><p>If you choose to implement your own text engine, the documentation listed belowwill provide you with some, but unfortunately not with all the information youwill need.</p><p>If you use TextEdit, but provide hook routines to extend its functionality, youhave to make sure that the combination still works correctly with all scripts.This can be a difficult undertaking, and you need to have a good understandingof the issues, as if you were developing your own text engine.</p><BR><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=550><TR><td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><P><B>Note:</B><BR>Two-byte characters that are input by the user will be passed toyou through two consecutive calls to WaitNextEvent, with each call providing 1 byte in the event record.

Apple Japan now routinely requires inline inputfor new Apple software that is to be shipped in Japan.</p><h2>What to Do</h2><p>If your application uses TextEdit as its text engine and supports Apple events(at least the required ones), you can use TSMTE. TSMTE is an extension thatprovides Apple event handlers to handle all events passed on by the TextServices Manager and translate them into appropriate operations on the currentTextEdit record. Using TSMTE, inline input can be implemented in about a day.Currently, TSMTE is available only with the full KanjiTalk 7 system, not withthe Japanese Language Kit, but it will be integrated into future versions ofsystem software--so make sure to check for its presence using Gestalt. You canfind more information about TSMTE in the Technical Note "Inline Input forTextEdit with TSMTE".</p><p>If the above conditions don't apply to your application, you have to work withthe Text Services Manager directly and provide your own Apple event handlers tocommunicate between TSM and your text engine.</p><p>In either case, make sure that your application passes on null events toTSMEvent, since some input methods rely on receiving them.</p><h2>What to Read</h2><p><a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/Text/Text-2.html">IM Text</A>--Text Services Manager; TN TE 27 <A HREF = "../te/te_27.html">Inline Input for TextEdit with TSMTE</a>.</p><h2><a name=Passwords>Passwords</a></h2><h2>Why It Is Relevant</h2><p>For security reasons a password should never be displayed. When your softwareasks the user for a password, it should display a series of identicalcharacters corresponding to the characters that the user has entered.</p><p>The Japanese, Chinese, and Korean scripts, however, need input methods for textinput and conversion. If you do not implement inline input, input methods arehandled by the floating input window, which will happily display the text as itis entered. If you do implement inline input, you can display the text as bullets, but still Japanese and Chinese input methods will occasionally display the text in pop-up menus to let the user choose one of several possible conversions (Korean is different in that conversion from Jamo to Hangul is deterministic).</p><p>Currently, two different approaches are used to solve this problem if thesystem script is a 2-byte script (don't apply either of them if the systemscript is 1-byte):</p><ul><li>Some software switches the keyboard to Roman when asking the user for apassword, thus encouraging the user to use an ASCII password instead of one inthe native script. Users can still switch back to the native script using thekeyboard menu and use a password in their native script. If your applicationuses inline input, users can also avoid having their password displayed bychoosing text that does not have ambiguous conversions.<br><br></li><li>Some software switches the keyboard to Roman and locks it, so users cannotswitch back to the native script, thus forcing them to use an ASCII password.This is the most secure solution, but some users don't like it.</li></ul><h2>What to Do</h2><p>The character to be used to display the password should be obtained from thedefault 'itl4' resource's untoken table using the tokenCenterDot selector.</p><p>You will have to balance security concerns and user-friendliness in yourdecision how to handle input for users of 2-byte systems.</p><p>To switch and lock the keyboard, you use the KeyScript routine, first with thescript code smRoman and then again with either the smKeyDisableKybds or thesmKeyDisableKybdSwitch selector.</p><p>You should not filter out any characters except control characters.</p><h2>What to Read</h2><p><a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/Text/Text-2.html">IM Text</A> 6-36--6-37, 6-61, B-54--B-55 (bullet), 6-17--6-19, 6-80--6-81 (KeyScript).</p><h2><a name=Searching>Text Searching</a></h2><h2>Why It Is Relevant</h2><p>When searching a body of text for a given string, you have to be aware that themeaning of any given byte in the text depends on the character set being used for the text. Finding equal bytes is only one step in finding a matching string. If you offer options such as case-insensitive search or matching "similar" characters (for example, by stripping diacritics), you have to be aware of the script- or language-dependent meanings these options can take.</p><h2>Negative Example</h2><p>Your application searches for the character "{" in text containing Japanese,and selects a byte that is actually the second byte of a 2-byte Kanji character.</p><p><img src="images/ov_20_001.gif" alt="ov_202.gif" width=320 height=16></p><h2>Negative Example</h2><p>Your application searches for the character "(c)" in multistyled text, andselects the one-byte Katakana character having the same code.</p>    <p><img src="images/ov_20_002.gif" alt="ov_203.gif" width=224 height=16></p><h2>Negative Example</h2>Your application searches for the string "Mac" in multistyled text, and misses<p>an occurrence because the user applied a Cyrillic font to it. This might happenif your implementation checks the script of style runs and only looks at thebytes in style runs with the same script code as the search string.</p><p><img src="images/ov_20_003.gif" alt="ov_204.gif" width=288 height=16></p><h2>What to Do</h2><p>Consider the script being used for each piece of text when deciding whether asequence of bytes that matches your string actually has the same meaning. You have to make sure that you select byte sequences consisting only of entire characters (your text may contain both 1- and 2-byte characters). If either the body of text or the search string can be multiscript, or if they can be of different scripts, you should try to verify that equal bytes really represent the same characters in the scripts being used (this may not always be possible). If you offer case-insensitive searching as an option, you have to take the rules for the script system(s) in use into account--the LowerText routine helps with this. If you offer diacritic-insensitive searching as an option, this feature depends on the language used--English users might consider"&auml;" equivalent to "a", German users don't. You may also want to offer the option to look for all possible representations of the same sound--for example,for Japanese, the Hiragana, 1-byte Katakana, 2-byte Katakana, 1-byte Romaji,and 2-byte Romaji representations.</p><h2>What to Avoid</h2><p>Don't consider the Munger routine or Computer Science textbook algorithms morethan a starting point. Don't try do implement case-insensitive search by addingor subtracting constants to byte values, by using the C functionstolower/toupper, or by using the toolbox routines UprText/UprString.</p><h2><a name=Dialog>Moving and Hiding Dialog Items</a></h2><h2>Why It Is Relevant</h2><p>Localizers often have to adjust dialog box layouts to accommodate longerstrings or to switch to a right-to-left system direction. To do this, they needaccess to all dialog items in a resource editor such as ResEdit. On the otherhand, sometimes applications have dialog items that are shown only if someother option is selected, and a common way to hide dialog items is to move themoutside the dialog box. If you do this in your resource definition however,graphical resource editors will not show the item.</p><p>A few applications also move dialog items from one location to anotherprogrammatically. This tends to make it difficult for localizers to adjust thelayout, especially if you specify the new coordinates in your source code.</p><BR><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=550><TR><td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><P><B>Note:</B><BR>With "move dialog items" I don't mean the case that yourecalculate the entire layout of a dialog box before showing it, taking allitems, string lengths and the system direction into account. If you do that,great. Problems show up when your application moves some dialog items withoutrespecting the overall layout.</P></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><BR><h2>What to Do</h2><p>First of all, try not to move or hide dialog items. Both practices conflictwith the human interface principle that an application should provide a stableenvironment. Making a dialog item inactive and showing it in gray is muchnicer. But if you have good reasons to move or hide dialog items, read on.</p><p>When defining a dialog item that may be hidden at some point, put it at thelocation in the dialog box where it shows up when it is not hidden. Mark thedialog resource as initially invisible. Then, to open the dialog box, load itusing GetNewDialog, check the current state of the relevant data and callHideDialogItem for all items that should not be shown, and finally show thedialog box using ShowWindow.</p><p>When moving dialog items, make sure that you get all necessary information fromresources. For example, you can have additional items in the dialog box thatare never shown but are used only to indicate the location that another itemgets moved to. Or (not quite so nice), you can have separate 'nrct' resourcesthat define the new item rectangles. In either case, document well how you areinterpreting the rectangles, and make the information availableto the localizers.</p><h2><a name=Number>Number Formatting</a></h2><h2>Why It Is Relevant</h2><p>Number formats vary from region to region, and in some cases very differentnumber formats are used in the same region depending on the context. Systemsoftware defines a default number format for each region, and starting withSystem 7.1 lets users modify the default using the Numbers control panel. Yoursoftware should use the default number format defined by system software andthe user, and for advanced number handling (for example, in spreadsheets), givethe user the option to define and use specialized number formats.</p><h2>Negative Example</h2><p>Your application displays 123456 as "123,456" on a German system where the userhas not modified the default setting (German uses the period as the defaultthousands separator and the comma as the decimal separator).</p><h2>Negative Example</h2><p>Your application does not accept the string "123,5" on this German system orinterprets it as 1235.</p><h2>Positive Example</h2><p>Your application displays 123456 as "123.456" on a German system where the userhas not modified the default setting.</p><h2>Positive Example</h2><p>Your application accepts the string "123,5" on this German system andinterprets it as 123 and a half.</p><h2>Positive Example</h2><p>Your application lets the user choose a number format using formatspecification strings that have been adjusted to the user's language andpreferences (format specification strings are used in some spreadsheet anddatabase applications and look like "###.###,##;(###.###,##);0").</p><h2>What to Read</h2><p><a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/Text/Text-2.html">IM Text</A> 5-35--5-44, 5-91--5-101; <i>Apple Numerics Manual</i> (second edition) 26-27; "International Number Formatting" in develop 16.</p><h2><a name=Currency>Currency Formats</a></h2><h2>Why It Is Relevant</h2><p>Currency symbols differ, as does the preferred formatting of currency values.System software defines a default currency symbol and format in the system'sdefault 'itl0' resource, and starting with System 7.1, users can change thisdefault symbol to suit their own needs using the Numbers control panel. Butyour application should not assume that the default currency symbol is the onlyone the user ever needs--many companies import, export, or have investments inother countries. Even individuals often have investments in and income frommultiple countries.</p><h2>Positive Example</h2><p>Your spreadsheet offers the user the option to display numbers with currencysymbols. It uses the default currency symbol from the system's default 'itl0'resource as the default, but lets the user pick a different one. It then usesthe currency formatting information in the system's default 'itl0' resource toformat the numbers.</p><h2>What to Do</h2><p>Use the default currency symbol defined in the 'itl0' resource as a starting point.</p><p>As with all text obtained from International Resources, you have to make surethat the resource and the font you use belong to the same script. See the<A HREF = "#LanguageKits">"Working With Language Kits"</a>section earlier in this Note for details.</p><p>You should use at least 32 bits for all currency values--16 bits are not enougheven for small amounts of Yen or Cruzeiro. Double-precision floating-pointnumbers might be an even better choice.</p><h2>What to Read</h2><p><a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/Text/Text-2.html">IM Text</A> B-22--B-25.</p><h2><a name=Time>Date and Time Formats</a></h2><h2>Why It Is Relevant</h2><p>Date and time formats vary from country to country, and starting with System7.1 users can define their own date and time formats using the Date and Timecontrol panel.</p><h2>Negative Example</h2><p>Your application displays March 7, 1992, as "3/7/92" while running on a Germansystem where the user did not change the date and time format (German userswould expect 7.3.92).</p><h2>Positive Example</h2><p>Your application displays this date on German system software as "7.3.92", oras "Samstag, 7. M&auml;rz 1992" using a Roman font.</p><h2>Positive Example</h2><p>In a document, your application lets the user choose which language's date andtime formats to use.</p><h2>What to Do</h2><p>Use the Text Utilities manager to create strings in the appropriate format, orto interpret date and time strings. Make sure that you provide enough space toaccommodate four digits for the year even in the short date format.</p><p>As with all text obtained from Text Utilities, you have to make sure that theresource and the font you use belong to the same script. See the <A HREF = "#LanguageKits">"Working With Language Kits"</a> section earlier in this Note for details.</p><h2>What to Read</h2><p><a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/Text/Text-2.html">IM Text</A> 5-29--5-35.</p><h2><a name=Formats>Other Formats</a></h2><h2>Why It Is Relevant</h2><p>Other formats, for example, for addresses and phone numbers, also vary fromcountry to country. Therefore you cannot assume any particular format in yourapplication. You can also not assume that one format per localized version ofyour application is sufficient, as many users will have business partners orfriends in other countries.</p><h2>What to Do</h2><p>The easiest way out is to use free-form text fields that allow the user toenter arbitrary text as addresses or arbitrary strings of digits and separatorsfor phone numbers. This method however does not allow you to interpret the datain any way, for example, for entry validation or for sorting addresses by region.</p><p>A more ambitious approach would be to use an extensible mechanism that allowsthe definition of several different formats for various countries and picks theright one based on country selection. Your application would probably supplysome format definitions for the countries that your users are most likely tointeract with, and allow the users to define more formats. This approach wouldallow your application to validate input data and to extract information for processing.</p><h2><a name=Paper>Paper and Envelope Sizes</a></h2><h2>Why It Is Relevant</h2><p>Standard paper and envelope sizes vary among countries.</p><h2>What to Do</h2><p>If you develop a printer driver, or if your application supports customizedpaper sizes, specify all paper sizes and related format information inresources so that they can be modified, and allow for a variable number ofpaper sizes so that localizers can add or remove them.</p><h2><a name=Measurement>Measurement Systems</a></h2><h2>Why It Is Relevant</h2><p>Most countries in the world use the metric system (with millimeters, meters,kilometers), but a few countries still use the old English system of measurement (with inches, feet, miles). If your application displays any kind of measurement or any kind of ruler, it should default to the appropriate measurement system.</p><h2>What to Do</h2><p>Use the IsMetric function to find out whether your application should defaultto metric or English measurements. Except for very simple applications, let theuser select the units to use--depending on the functionality of the application, you may offer cm, mm, inch, and add domain-specific units such as pica, point.</p><h2>What to Read</h2><p>IM Operating System Utilities; IM I-505.</p><h2><a name=Resource>Custom Resource Types</a></h2><h2>Why It Is Relevant</h2><p>Often resources need to be modified during localization, for example, totranslate text, adjust window layouts, replace culturally specific icons withothers. Localizers usually are nontechnical people who are not very comfortablewith using Rez and DeRez to get at the content of your resources; they prefertools such as AppleGlot, ResEdit, or Resorcerer. Therefore it helps withlocalization if resource types are used that are already supported by thesetools, or for which templates for these tools can be easily created.</p><h2>What to Do</h2><p>For resources that might need to be modified during localization, use in orderof preference: resource types that are already supported by these tools orresource types that can be described in the template formats supported by these tools. If neither is possible, develop a ResEdit picker or a different graphical editor for your resource type along with your application.</p><h2>What to Avoid</h2><p>Creating new resource types for resources that need to be localized withoutproviding the necessary localization tools. Note that an extended MacApp 'view'or 'View' resource is a new type that needs specialized tools.</p><h2>What to Read</h2><p><i>AppleGlot 2.0 User Guide</i>--Appendix F; <i>ResEdit Reference</i> for ResEditversion 2.1; <i>Resorcerer 1.0 User Manual.</i></p><h2><a name=Menus>Menus</a></h2><h2>Why It Is Relevant</h2><p>The width of the menu bar on the smallest monitors is 512 pixels, and that'snot a lot. When designing your menus, you have to take into account that System7.1 installs up to five icon menus (Apple, Application, Keyboard, Input Method,Help); some system extensions may add even more, and the titles of your ownmenus may expand substantially during localization.</p><p>Also, menus of course need to be defined in resources to be accessible forlocalization. If you change menu items dynamically (for example, from "ShowClipboard" to "Hide Clipboard" or from "Undo" to "Undo Style Change" to "RedoStyle Change"), you have to ensure that a localized version of the applicationhas equivalent localized menu items.</p><h2>What to Do</h2><p>Limit the number of menus in your application so that even with the maximumnumber of icon menus and a small monitor there is still room for the menutitles to grow during localization. If you have great difficulty reducing yourmenus to fit onto small screens, you might consider using abbreviated menutitles for small screens. In this case, make sure to define the abbreviations in resources so they are accessible for localization.</p><p>If you change menu items dynamically, the best solution is to define allpossible strings in 'STR#' resources so that they can be easily localized. Ifyou cannot avoid constructing them on the fly, read the "Concatenating Strings"and "String Substitution" sections earlier in this Note.</p><h2>What to Avoid</h2><p>Avoid adding commands to the system menu bar (for example, to the Finder orother applications). Several system extensions are doing this, but there is notenough room for all of them, and the mechanisms they use are unsupported andmay break. Just don't do it.</p><h2><a name=Keyboard>Keyboard Equivalents (Command Keys)</a></h2><h2>Why It Is Relevant</h2><p>Keyboard equivalents that you define for menus or dialog buttons (Command-keycombinations) should be accessible on any keyboard worldwide. Keyboard layouts,however, vary considerably from region to region and among keyboard models. Thegood news is that you don't have to worry about non-Roman characters here--whenever the user presses the Command key, the system switches to a layout that contains only Roman characters. The bad news is that many characters are on different keys and in different layers than you may expect, so a special character that is readily available on your keyboard may require several modifierkeys on some other user's keyboard. This is complicated by the fact that in some older keyboard layouts the Shift key is ignored when the Command key is held down, in which case many characters arenot available at all.</p><p>One problem that is now less common than it used to be involves Command-Period,which is used by many applications as an equivalent of Cancel or Stop. On somekeyboards (for example, Italian), the period is produced by a key combinationincluding the Shift key. Before System 7, the Shift key was usually ignoredwhen the Command key was held down, so a Command-Period combination could notbe produced on these keyboards. Most keyboard layouts have been modified forSystem 7 so that now Command-Period is usually available, but there is noguarantee that this is true for all current and future keyboard layouts.</p><p>A somewhat different situation arises with Command-?, which some applicationswant to treat as a keyboard equivalent for Help. To type a question mark on aU.S. keyboard, the Shift key has to be pressed, so Command-? can not beproduced on these keyboards (this has not changed in System 7). Therefore manyapplications accept Command-/ instead of Command-?. This however does not makesense to most non-U.S. users, because most non-U.S. keyboards have "?" and "/"on completely different keys. Often the "/" requires a Shift key as well, soCommand-/ is not any more accessible than Command-?.</p><p>All keyboard equivalents involving the space bar are reserved for use by the Script Manager.</p><h2>What to Do</h2><p>In general, try to use only alphabetic characters (A-Z) as predefined keyboardequivalents. It seems that these are available with the Command key on allkeyboards. If 26 keyboard equivalents are not enough for your application, youprobably should consider making keyboard equivalents user-definable instead ofhoping that your users have the same keyboard as you.</p><p>If you support Command-Period for canceling (which has become a standard and soshould be supported in spite of its potential problems), or if you have to use Command-Question-Mark, you have to make sure that you recognize them even if they require the Shift key. Whenever the user presses a key combination involving the Command key while your application is in a state whereCommand-Period or Command-? would make sense, check whether the same key combination without the Command key would translate to a period or question mark. The Technical Note <A HREF = "../te/te_23.html">"International Canceling"</a> explains how to do this. If you really want to provide an alternative key that can be used as an equivalent for keys that require the Shift key (for example, "/" for "?"), define them in a resource so that they can be changed during localization. Much more useful however than providing an equivalent for the equivalent is to make the original command accessible, so make sure that your application always has readily accessible menus or buttons for Cancel, Stop, or Help.</p><h2>What to Avoid</h2><p>Don't change keyboard equivalents for localized versions of your application.As most commercial Macintosh software is published in the United States first,it is quite common for users in other countries to use newly released U.S.software temporarily and later switch to a localized version when it becomesavailable--and in some cases this never happens, so they continue to use U.S.software. As a result, users often run U.S. and localized software at the sametime. It would be very confusing if the keyboard equivalents changed wheneverthey switch from one application to another, or when they switch from the U.S.to a localized version. Keyboard equivalents help only if users don't have tothink about them.</p><h2>What to Read</h2><p>MHIG 128-129; TN TE 23 <A HREF = "../te/te_23.html">"International Canceling"</a>.</p><h2><a name=Graphics>Graphics</a></h2><h2>Why It Is Relevant</h2><p>Graphics are often culturally dependent. Graphics that are meaningful or funnyto a French user may be meaningless or offensive to an Arabic user, or vice versa.</p><p>Text that is embedded in graphics usually has to be localized.</p><h2>What to Do</h2><p>Try to use culturally neutral graphics. Put the graphics into resources thatcan be changed during localization if necessary.</p><p>If you need to have text in the graphics, consider using separate text itemsinstead that you get from string resources and draw over the graphics (but makesure that the coordinates and the font information are also obtained fromresources so they can be changed if necessary). If that's not possible, makesure to use object-oriented graphics (for example, drawn with MacDraw) insteadof bitmaps (as produced by MacPaint). This makes it much easier to change thetext. Use only standard fonts that are available on every Macintosh that yourapplication is likely to reach, and avoid special effects that may not makesense in other languages.</p><h2><a name=Sound>Sound and Voice</a></h2><h2>Why It Is Relevant</h2><p>Similar to graphics, sound can be culturally dependent. Again, sounds that aremeaningful or funny to users in one country may be meaningless or offensive tousers in another.</p><p>Sound names (for example, system beeps) need to be localized.</p><p>Voice annotations need to be localizable just as other recorded sound, but youhave to watch out for additional problems if the voice annotation can beconsidered part of your user interface (as opposed to document content). Forexample, Japanese users prefer computers to use a female voice.</p><h2>What to Do</h2><p>Put all recorded sound into resources or separate QuickTime sound tracks thatcan be easily replaced during localization.</p><h2>What to Avoid</h2><p>Do not generate sound directly from your program code unless you have verifiedthat the sound is culturally neutral. Do not assume that the name of a sound isthe same in all countries.</p><h2><a name=Installer>Installer Scripts</a></h2><h2>Why It Is Relevant</h2><p>When looking for files or folders on the disk that you are installing onto, youcannot assume any specific names, because names are often changed duringlocalization or by the user. Also, the technique that is usually recommended toallow for localization--putting strings into separate resources--does not workhere, because many products are shipped in a generic version that can beinstalled into system software of any language.</p><h2>Negative Example</h2><p>Some Installer scripts try to replace old versions of control panels with newerones, but look for them by name. If a generic version of such a script is usedto update a localized system, it may not be able to find and delete the oldcontrol panel because it has a localized name, but it may still install the newversion. Having two versions of the same control panel in the System Folder mayhave undesirable side effects.</p><h2>What to Do</h2><p>If you need access to the System Folder or folders inside the System Folder,use the Installer special names (for example, special-extn for the Extensionsfolder) or call the FindFolder routine from your external functions. If youneed to check for or delete specific files on the disk, use a user function inwhich you search for them by type and creator, not by name.</p><BR><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=550><TR><td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><P><B>Note:</B><BR>Using the Installer special names is actually somewhat trickybecause the Installer relies on 'fld#' resources and looks for them in severalplaces. The search order of the current Installer, version 3.4.2, is Installerscript, target system, Installer, booted system. What you usually want is thetarget system, so at least for a generic Installer script you should not havean 'fld#' resource in the script.</P></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><BR><h2>What to Avoid</h2><p>Don't use names of files or folders on the target disk directly in yourInstaller scripts. Don't put the names into separate string resources either.Get them from system software or use a user function.</p><h2>What to Read</h2><p><i>Installer 3.3 Scripting Guide</i> 36; IM Macintosh Toolbox Essentials 7-54--7-56(for FindFolder).</p><h2><a name=Encryption>Encryption</a></h2><h2>Why It Is Relevant</h2><p>Encryption is subject to legal restrictions in some countries. For example,U.S. law usually makes it illegal to export software that uses any seriousencryption technique, no matter where it was invented and how well publishedand used the technique already is outside the United States. Capable lawyersmay be able to obtain an export permission.</p><h2>What to Do</h2><p>Contact your lawyers if you consider using encryption in your software.</p><h2><a name=Trademark>Trademark Symbols</a></h2><h2>Why It Is Relevant</h2><p>You can use the symbol (R) for a trademark only in countries where thetrademark has been registered--use in other countries is fraudulent.</p><h2>What to Do</h2><p>Use the (R) symbol only for names and on material for which it is known thatit will reach only countries where the name has been registered. On materialsthat are shipped worldwide (for example, packaging, manuals, and so on) or forwhich the ultimate destination is not always known, don't use the (R) symbol.Instead, use a "universal" credit line such as Apple's "Apple and the Applelogo are trademarks of Apple Computer, Inc., registered in the U.S.and other countries."</p><p>You can freely use the (TM) symbol, as it has no legal effect.</p><h2>Acknowledgements</h2><p>This checklist would not have been possible without all the people who taughtme everything, gave me all the examples, asked questions, answered questions,and reviewed the document: Andrew Wilson, Akira Nonaka, Chris Hansten, DaveBice, Debbie Gordon, Doug Scott, Eric Chen, Eric Soldan, Gidi Shalom-Bendor,Hani Abdelazim, Jay Schaffer, Jean-Pierre Ciudad, Jeannette Cheng, JenniferHan, Joan Trainer, Joel Cannon, John Harvey, John McConnell, Joseph Maurer,Kenny Tung, Kerry Laidlaw, Lorenzo Sangalli, Maha Hassan, Mark Zeren, MichaelSilver, Mimi Obinata, Mina Noro&ntilde;a, Mohamed Shoukry, Peri Altan, PeterEdberg, Peter Sparks, Ron Metzker, Sue Bartalo, Susan Torres, Stuart Cheshire,Vichai Lelapinyokul, Yishai Steinhart, Yasuo Kida, and many others.
