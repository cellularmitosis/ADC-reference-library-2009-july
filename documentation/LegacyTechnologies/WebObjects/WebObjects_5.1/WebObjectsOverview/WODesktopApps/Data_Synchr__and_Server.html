The server then sends <em>copies</em> ofthe requested objects to the client. When the client receives theobjects, it updates its user interface with values from the requestedobjects.</p><br><a name = "BAJBHHIC"></a><p><b><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">Figure6-7 Data flow in a Java Client application</font></b></p> <img src = "../Art/javaclient_expanded.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/javaclient_expanded.gif]"><p>Although requested objects are copied from the server to theclient, and these objects exist in parallel object graphs on bothserver and client, the enterprise objects on the client usuallydo not exactly mirror the enterprise objects on the server. Theobjects on the client usually have a subset of the properties ofthe objects on the server. You can partition your application'senterprise objects so the objects that exist on the client havea restricted set of data and behaviors. This ability allows youto restrict sensitive data and business logic to the server. Forexample, in  <a href="#BAJBHHIC">Figure 6-7</a>, the client side enterprise objects don't havethe "whole" property, the price the seller paid to the manufacturer.</p><p>Once the client has fetched data, this data is cached andis represented internally by the client's object graph. As usersmodify the data (or delete or add "rows" of data), the client applicationupdates the client's object graph to reflect the new state. Whenthe client application initiates a save, the changed objects are"pushed" to the server. If the business logic on the servervalidates these changes, the changes are committed to the database. </p><p>Note that Java Client automatically updates the client withchanges that have occurred on the server. Whenever the client makesa request, the server passes updates along to the client with whateverinformation the client requested. Similarly, Java Client has the opportunityto update the client before client-side objects remotely invokemethods on server-side objects.</p><br>    <br><a href="Managing_th_r_Interface.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/previous.gif" border="0"></a><a href="Dynamic_Use__Generation.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/next.gif" border="0"></a>&nbsp;<br><br><p><hr><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">&#169; 2002 Apple Computer, Inc.
