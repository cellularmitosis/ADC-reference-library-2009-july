<b>WIDGET-SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       Command-Line Name:<b>-disabledbackground</b>                                                                 |
       Database Name:  <b>disabledBackground</b>                                                                    |
       Database Class: <b>DisabledBackground</b>                                                                    |

              Specifies the background color to use when the entry is disabled.  If this option is the empty |
              string, the normal background color is used.                                                   |

       Command-Line Name:<b>-disabledforeground</b>                                                                 |
       Database Name:  <b>disabledForeground</b>                                                                    |
       Database Class: <b>DisabledForeground</b>                                                                    |

              Specifies the foreground color to use when the entry is disabled.  If this option is the empty |
              string, the normal foreground color is used.                                                   |

       Command-Line Name:<b>-invalidcommand</b> <b>or</b> <b>-invcmd</b>                                                          |
       Database Name:  <b>invalidCommand</b>                                                                        |
       Database Class: <b>InvalidCommand</b>                                                                        |

              Specifies  a  script  to  eval when <b>validateCommand</b> returns 0.  Setting it to {} disables this |
              feature (the default).  The best use of this option is to set  it  to  <u>bell</u>.   See  <b>Validation</b> |
              below for more information.                                                                    |

       Command-Line Name:<b>-readonlybackground</b>                                                                 |
       Database Name:  <b>readonlyBackground</b>                                                                    |
       Database Class: <b>ReadonlyBackground</b>                                                                    |

              Specifies the background color to use when the entry is readonly.  If this option is the empty |
              string, the normal background color is used.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-show</b>
       Database Name:  <b>show</b>
       Database Class: <b>Show</b>

              If this option is specified, then the true contents of the entry are not displayed in the win-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dow.&nbsp;window.</font>
              dow.  Instead, each character in the entry's value will be displayed as the first character in
              the value of this option, such as ``*''.  This is useful, for example, if the entry is  to  be
              used  to  enter a password.  If characters in the entry are selected and copied elsewhere, the
              information copied will be what is displayed, not the true contents of the entry.              |

       Command-Line Name:<b>-state</b>                                                                              |
       Database Name:  <b>state</b>                                                                                 |
       Database Class: <b>State</b>                                                                                 |

              Specifies one of three states for the entry:  <b>normal</b>, <b>disabled</b>, or <b>readonly</b>.  If the entry  is |
              readonly, then the value may not be changed using widget commands and no insertion cursor will |
              be displayed, even if the input focus is in the widget; the contents of the widget  may  still |
              be selected.  If the entry is disabled, the value may not be changed, no insertion cursor will |
              be displayed, the contents will not be selectable, and the entry may be displayed in a differ- |
              ent color, depending on the values of the <b>-disabledforeground</b> and <b>-disabledbackground</b> options. |

       Command-Line Name:<b>-validate</b>                                                                           |
       Database Name:  <b>validate</b>                                                                              |
       Database Class: <b>Validate</b>                                                                              |

              Specifies the mode in which validation should operate: <b>none</b>, <b>focus</b>, <b>focusin</b>, <b>focusout</b>, <b>key</b>, or |
              <b>all</b>.  It defaults to <b>none</b>.  When you want validation, you must explicitly state which mode you |
              wish to use.  See <b>Validation</b> below for more.                                                   |

       Command-Line Name:<b>-validatecommand</b> <b>or</b> <b>-vcmd</b>                                                           |
       Database Name:  <b>validateCommand</b>                                                                       |
       Database Class: <b>ValidateCommand</b>                                                                       |

              Specifies a script to eval when you want to validate the input into the entry widget.  Setting |
              it  to  {}  disables this feature (the default).  This command must return a valid tcl boolean |
              value.  If it returns 0 (or the valid tcl boolean equivalent) then it means you reject the new |
              edition  and  it  will  not occur and the <b>invalidCommand</b> will be evaluated if it is set. If it |
              returns 1, then the new edition occurs.  See <b>Validation</b> below for more information.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-width</b>
       Database Name:  <b>width</b>
       Database Class: <b>Width</b>

              Specifies an integer value indicating the desired width of the entry window,  in  average-size
              characters of the widget's font.  If the value is less than or equal to zero, the widget picks
              a size just large enough to hold its current text.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The <b>entry</b> command creates a new window (given by the <u>pathName</u> argument) and makes it  into  an  entry
       widget.   Additional  options, described above, may be specified on the command line or in the option
       database to configure aspects of the entry such as its colors, font, and relief.  The  <b>entry</b>  command
       returns  its  <u>pathName</u>  argument.  At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a window
       named <u>pathName</u>, but <u>pathName</u>'s parent must exist.

       An entry is a widget that displays a one-line text string and allows that string to be  edited  using
       widget  commands  described  below,  which are typically bound to keystrokes and mouse actions.  When
       first created, an entry's string is empty.  A portion of the  entry  may  be  selected  as  described
       below.  If an entry is exporting its selection (see the <b>exportSelection</b> option), then it will observe
       the standard X11 protocols for handling the  selection;   entry  selections  are  available  as  type
       <b>STRING</b>.   Entries also observe the standard Tk rules for dealing with the input focus.  When an entry
       has the input focus it displays an  <u>insertion</u>  <u>cursor</u>  to  indicate  where  new  characters  will  be
       inserted.

       Entries  are capable of displaying strings that are too long to fit entirely within the widget's win-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dow.&nbsp;window.</font>
       dow.  In this case, only a portion of the string will be displayed;  commands described below may  be
       used  to change the view in the window.  Entries use the standard <b>xScrollCommand</b> mechanism for inter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">acting&nbsp;interacting</font>
       acting with scrollbars (see the description of the <b>xScrollCommand</b> option  for  details).   They  also
       support scanning, as described below.


<b>VALIDATION</b>                                                                                                   |
       Validation  works by setting the <b>validateCommand</b> option to a script which will be evaluated according |
       to the <b>validate</b> option as follows:                                                                    |


       <b>none</b>                                                                                                  ||
                 Default.  This means no validation will occur.                                              |

       <b>focus</b>                                                                                                 ||
                 <b>validateCommand</b> will be called when the entry receives or loses focus.                      |

       <b>focusin</b>                                                                                               ||
                 <b>validateCommand</b> will be called when the entry receives focus.                               |

       <b>focu-</b>                                                                                                 |
       <b>sout</b>                                                                                              |   |
                 <b>validateCommand</b> will be called when the entry loses focus.                                  |

       <b>key</b>                                                                                                   ||
                 <b>validateCommand</b> will be called when the entry is edited.                                    |

       <b>all</b>                                                                                                   ||
                 <b>validateCommand</b> will be called for all above conditions.                                    |

       It is possible to perform percent substitutions on the <b>validateCommand</b> and  <b>invalidCommand</b>,  just  as |
       you would in a <b>bind</b> script.  The following substitutions are recognized:                              |


       <b>%d</b>                                                                                                    ||
            Type of action: 1 for <b>insert</b>, 0 for <b>delete</b>, or -1 for focus, forced or textvariable  validation. |

       <b>%i</b>                                                                                                    ||
            Index of char string to be inserted/deleted, if any, otherwise -1.                               |

       <b>%P</b>                                                                                                    ||
            The  value of the entry should edition occur.  If you are configuring the entry widget to have a |
            new textvariable, this will be the value of that textvariable.                                   |

            The current value of entry before edition.                                                       |

       <b>%S</b>                                                                                                    ||

            The type of validation currently set.                                                            |

       <b>%V</b>                                                                                                    ||
            The type of validation that triggered the callback (key, focusin, focusout, forced).             |

            The name of the entry widget.                                                                    |

       In  general,  the  <b>textVariable</b>  and <b>validateCommand</b> can be dangerous to mix.  Any problems have been |
       overcome so that using the <b>validateCommand</b> will not interfere with the traditional  behavior  of  the |
       entry  widget.   Using the <b>textVariable</b> for read-only purposes will never cause problems.  The danger |
       comes when you try set the <b>textVariable</b> to something that the <b>validateCommand</b> would not accept, which |
       causes  <b>validate</b> to become <u>none</u> (the <b>invalidCommand</b> will not be triggered).  The same happens when an |
       error occurs evaluating the <b>validateCommand</b>.                                                          |

       Primarily, an error will occur when the <b>validateCommand</b> or <b>invalidCommand</b> encounters an error in  its |
       script  while  evaluating or <b>validateCommand</b> does not return a valid tcl boolean value.  The <b>validate</b> |
       option will also set itself to <b>none</b> when you edit the entry widget from within either  the  <b>validate-</b> |
       <b>Command</b> or the <b>invalidCommand</b>.  Such editions will override the one that was being validated.  If you |
       wish to edit the entry widget (for example set it to {}) during validation and still have  the  <b>vali-</b> |
       <b>date</b> option set, you should include the command                                                       |
                   <u>after</u> <u>idle</u> <u>{%W</u> <u>config</u> <u>-validate</u> <u>%v}</u>                                                       |
       in  the <b>validateCommand</b> or <b>invalidCommand</b> (whichever one you were editing the entry widget from).  It |
       is also recommended to not set an associated <b>textVariable</b> during validation, as that  can  cause  the |
       entry widget to become out of sync with the <b>textVariable</b>.


<b>WIDGET</b> <b>COMMAND</b>
       The  <b>entry</b>  command  creates  a  new Tcl command whose name is <u>pathName</u>.  This command may be used to
       invoke various operations on the widget.  It has the following general form:
              <u>pathName</u> <u>option</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
       <u>Option</u> and the <u>arg</u>s determine the exact behavior of the command.

       Many of the widget commands for entries take one or more indices as arguments.  An index specifies  a
       particular character in the entry's string, in any of the following ways:

       <u>number</u>      Specifies  the character as a numerical index, where 0 corresponds to the first character
                   in the string.

       <b>anchor</b>      Indicates the anchor point for the selection, which is  set  with  the  <b>select</b>  <b>from</b>  and
                   <b>select</b> <b>adjust</b> widget commands.

       <b>end</b>         Indicates  the  character just after the last one in the entry's string.  This is equiva-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lent&nbsp;equivalent</font>
                   lent to specifying a numerical index equal to the length of the entry's string.

       <b>insert</b>      Indicates the character adjacent to and immediately following the insertion cursor.

       <b>sel.first</b>   Indicates the first character in the selection.  It is an error to use this form  if  the
                   selection isn't in the entry window.

       <b>sel.last</b>    Indicates  the character just after the last one in the selection.  It is an error to use
                   this form if the selection isn't in the entry window.

       <b>@</b><u>number</u>     In this form, <u>number</u> is treated as an x-coordinate in the entry's window;  the  character
                   spanning  that x-coordinate is used.  For example, ``<b>@0</b>'' indicates the left-most charac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ter&nbsp;character</font>
                   ter in the window.

       Abbreviations may be used for any of the forms above, e.g. ``<b>e</b>'' or ``<b>sel.f</b>''.  In  general,  out-of-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">range&nbsp;out-ofrange</font>
       range indices are automatically rounded to the nearest legal value.

       The following commands are possible for entry widgets:

       <u>pathName</u> <b>bbox</b> <u>index</u>
              Returns  a  list  of four numbers describing the bounding box of the character given by <u>index</u>.
              The first two elements of the list give the x and y coordinates of the  upper-left  corner  of
              the  screen  area covered by the character (in pixels relative to the widget) and the last two
              elements give the width and height of the character, in pixels.  The bounding box may refer to
              a region outside the visible area of the window.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>cget</b> <u>option</u>
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <u>option</u>.  <u>Option</u> may have any of
              the values accepted by the <b>entry</b> command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>configure</b> ?<u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no <u>option</u> is specified, returns a
              list  describing  all of the available options for <u>pathName</u> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for informa-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;information</font>
              tion on the format of this list).  If <u>option</u> is specified with  no  <u>value</u>,  then  the  command
              returns a list describing the one named option (this list will be identical to the correspond-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;corresponding</font>
              ing sublist of the value returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).  If  one  or  more  <u>option-value</u>
              pairs  are  specified,  then the command modifies the given widget <!-- a -->option(s)<!-- /a --> to have the given
              <!-- a -->value(s)<!-- /a -->;  in this case the command returns an empty string.  <u>Option</u> may have any of the  val-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ues&nbsp;values</font>
              ues accepted by the <b>entry</b> command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>delete</b> <u>first</u> ?<u>last</u>?
              Delete  one  or  more  elements  of  the  entry.  <u>First</u> is the index of the first character to
              delete, and <u>last</u> is the index of the character just after the last one  to  delete.   If  <u>last</u>
              isn't  specified  it  defaults  to  <u>first</u>+1, i.e. a single character is deleted.  This command
              returns an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>get</b>
              Returns the entry's string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>icursor</b> <u>index</u>
              Arrange for the insertion cursor to be displayed just before the  character  given  by  <u>index</u>.
              Returns an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>index</b> <u>index</u>
              Returns the numerical index corresponding to <u>index</u>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>insert</b> <u>index</u> <u>string</u>
              Insert  the  characters  of  <u>string</u>  just before the character indicated by <u>index</u>.  Returns an
              empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>scan</b> <u>option</u> <u>args</u>
              This command is used to implement scanning on entries.  It has two forms, depending on <u>option</u>:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>scan</b> <b>mark</b> <u>x</u>
                     Records  <u>x</u>  and  the  current view in the entry window;  used in conjunction with later
                     <b>scan</b> <b>dragto</b> commands.  Typically this command is associated with a mouse  button  press
                     in the widget.  It returns an empty string.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>scan</b> <b>dragto</b> <u>x</u>
                     This  command  computes the difference between its <u>x</u> argument and the <u>x</u> argument to the
                     last <b>scan</b> <b>mark</b> command for the widget.  It then adjusts the view left or  right  by  10
                     times the difference in x-coordinates.  This command is typically associated with mouse
                     motion events in the widget, to produce the effect of dragging the entry at high  speed
                     through the window.  The return value is an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <u>option</u> <u>arg</u>
              This command is used to adjust the selection within an entry.  It has several forms, depending
              on <u>option</u>:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>adjust</b> <u>index</u>
                     Locate the end of the selection nearest to the character given  by  <u>index</u>,  and  adjust
                     that  end  of  the selection to be at <u>index</u> (i.e including but not going beyond <u>index</u>).
                     The other end of the selection is made the anchor point for future <b>select</b> <b>to</b>  commands.
                     If  the  selection  isn't  currently  in  the entry, then a new selection is created to
                     include the characters between <u>index</u> and the most recent selection anchor point, inclu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sive.&nbsp;inclusive.</font>
                     sive.  Returns an empty string.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>clear</b>
                     Clear  the selection if it is currently in this widget.  If the selection isn't in this
                     widget then the command has no effect.  Returns an empty string.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>from</b> <u>index</u>
                     Set the selection anchor point to just before the character given  by  <u>index</u>.   Doesn't
                     change the selection.  Returns an empty string.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>present</b>
                     Returns 1 if there is are characters selected in the entry, 0 if nothing is selected.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>range</b> <u>start</u> <u>end</u>
                     Sets the selection to include the characters starting with the one indexed by <u>start</u> and
                     ending with the one just before <u>end</u>.  If <u>end</u> refers to the same character as  <u>start</u>  or
                     an earlier one, then the entry's selection is cleared.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>to</b> <u>index</u>
                     If  <u>index</u> is before the anchor point, set the selection to the characters from <u>index</u> up
                     to but not including the anchor point.  If <u>index</u> is the same as the  anchor  point,  do
                     nothing.   If <u>index</u> is after the anchor point, set the selection to the characters from
                     the anchor point up to but not including <u>index</u>.  The anchor point is determined by  the
                     most  recent  <b>select</b>  <b>from</b>  or  <b>select</b> <b>adjust</b> command in this widget.  If the selection
                     isn't in this widget then a new selection is created using the most recent anchor point
                     specified for the widget.  Returns an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>vali-</b>                                                                                        |
       <b>date</b>                                                                                     |            |
              This command is used to force an evaluation of the <b>validateCommand</b> independent of  the  condi- |
              tions  specified  by  the  <b>validate</b>  option.  This is done by temporarily setting the <b>validate</b> |
              option to <b>all</b>.  It returns 0 or 1.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b> <u>args</u>
              This command is used to query and change the horizontal position of the text in  the  widget's
              window.  It can take any of the following forms:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b>
                     Returns  a list containing two elements.  Each element is a real fraction between 0 and
                     1;  together they describe the horizontal span that is  visible  in  the  window.   For
                     example,  if  the  first element is .2 and the second element is .6, 20% of the entry's
                     text is off-screen to the left, the middle 40% is visible in the window, and 40% of the
                     text  is  off-screen  to the right.  These are the same values passed to scrollbars via
                     the <b>-xscrollcommand</b> option.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b> <u>index</u>
                     Adjusts the view in the window so that the character given by <u>index</u> is displayed at the
                     left edge of the window.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b> <b>moveto</b> <u>fraction</u>
                     Adjusts  the  view  in the window so that the character <u>fraction</u> of the way through the
                     text appears at the left edge of the window.  <u>Fraction</u> must be a fraction between 0 and
                     1.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b> <b>scroll</b> <u>number</u> <u>what</u>
                     This  command shifts the view in the window left or right according to <u>number</u> and <u>what</u>.
                     <u>Number</u> must be an integer.  <u>What</u> must be either <b>units</b> or <b>pages</b> or  an  abbreviation  of
                     one of these.  If <u>what</u> is <b>units</b>, the view adjusts left or right by <u>number</u> average-width
                     characters on the display;  if it is <b>pages</b> then the view adjusts by <u>number</u>  screenfuls.
                     If  <u>number</u>  is  negative  then characters farther to the left become visible;  if it is
                     positive then characters farther to the right become visible.


<b>DEFAULT</b> <b>BINDINGS</b>
       Tk automatically creates class bindings for entries that give them the  following  default  behavior.
       In the descriptions below, ``word'' refers to a contiguous group of letters, digits, or ``_'' charac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ters,&nbsp;characters,</font>
       ters, or any single character other than these.

       [1]    Clicking mouse button 1 positions the insertion cursor just before  the  character  underneath
              the mouse cursor, sets the input focus to this widget, and clears any selection in the widget.
              Dragging with mouse button 1 strokes out a selection between  the  insertion  cursor  and  the
              character under the mouse.

       [2]    Double-clicking  with mouse button 1 selects the word under the mouse and positions the inser-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;insertion</font>
              tion cursor at the end of the word.  Dragging after a double click will stroke out a selection
              consisting of whole words.

       [3]    Triple-clicking  with  mouse  button  1 selects all of the text in the entry and positions the
              insertion cursor at the end of the line.

       [4]    The ends of the selection can be adjusted by dragging with mouse button 1 while the Shift  key
              is  down;  this will adjust the end of the selection that was nearest to the mouse cursor when
              button 1 was pressed.  If the button is double-clicked before dragging then the selection will
              be adjusted in units of whole words.

       [5]    Clicking  mouse  button  1 with the Control key down will position the insertion cursor in the
              entry without affecting the selection.

       [6]    If any normal printing characters are typed in an entry, they are inserted at the point of the
              insertion cursor.

       [7]    The  view  in the entry can be adjusted by dragging with mouse button 2.  If mouse button 2 is
              clicked without moving the mouse, the selection is copied into the entry at  the  position  of
              the mouse cursor.

       [8]    If the mouse is dragged out of the entry on the left or right sides while button 1 is pressed,
              the entry will automatically scroll to make more text visible (if  there  is  more  text  off-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">screen&nbsp;offscreen</font>
              screen on the side where the mouse left the window).

       [9]    The  Left  and  Right keys move the insertion cursor one character to the left or right;  they
              also clear any selection in the entry and set the selection anchor.  If Left or Right is typed
              with  the  Shift  key  down,  then the insertion cursor moves and the selection is extended to
              include the new character.  Control-Left and Control-Right move the insertion cursor by words,
              and  Control-Shift-Left  and  Control-Shift-Right  move the insertion cursor by words and also
              extend the selection.  Control-b and Control-f behave the same  as  Left  and  Right,  respec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tively.&nbsp;respectively.</font>
              tively.  Meta-b and Meta-f behave the same as Control-Left and Control-Right, respectively.

       [10]   The  Home  key, or Control-a, will move the insertion cursor to the beginning of the entry and
              clear any selection in the entry.  Shift-Home moves the insertion cursor to the  beginning  of
              the entry and also extends the selection to that point.

       [11]   The  End  key,  or Control-e, will move the insertion cursor to the end of the entry and clear
              any selection in the entry.  Shift-End moves the cursor to the end and extends  the  selection
              to that point.

       [12]   The  Select  key  and  Control-Space set the selection anchor to the position of the insertion
              cursor.  They don't affect the current selection.  Shift-Select and Control-Shift-Space adjust
              the  selection  to  the current position of the insertion cursor, selecting from the anchor to
              the insertion cursor if there was not any selection previously.

       [13]   Control-/ selects all the text in the entry.

       [14]   Control-\ clears any selection in the entry.

       [15]   The F16 key (labelled Copy on many Sun workstations) or Meta-w copies  the  selection  in  the
              widget to the clipboard, if there is a selection.

       [16]   The  F20  key (labelled Cut on many Sun workstations) or Control-w copies the selection in the
              widget to the clipboard and deletes the selection.  If there is no  selection  in  the  widget
