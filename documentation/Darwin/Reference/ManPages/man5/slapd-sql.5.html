SLAPD-SQL(5)                                                                                    SLAPD-SQL(5)



<b>NAME</b>
       slapd-sql - SQL backend to slapd

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       /etc/openldap/slapd.conf

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  primary  purpose  of  this <a href="../man8/slapd.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/slapd"><b>slapd</b>(8)</a> backend is to PRESENT information stored in some RDBMS as an
       LDAP subtree without any programming (some SQL and maybe stored procedures can't be  considered  pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">gramming,&nbsp;programming,</font>
       gramming, anyway ;).

       That  is,  for example, when you (some ISP) have account information you use in an RDBMS, and want to
       use modern solutions that expect such information in LDAP (to authenticate users, make email  lookups
       etc.).   Or  you  want  to synchronize or distribute information between different sites/applications
       that use RDBMSes and/or LDAP.  Or whatever else...

       It is NOT designed as a general-purpose backend that uses RDBMS instead of BerkeleyDB (as  the  stan-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dard&nbsp;standard</font>
       dard  BDB backend does), though it can be used as such with several limitations.  You can take a look
       at <a href="http://www.openldap.org/faq/index.cgi?file=378"><b>http://www.openldap.org/faq/index.cgi?file=378</b></a> (OpenLDAP FAQ-O-Matic/General LDAP  FAQ/Directories
       vs. conventional databases) to find out more on this point.

       The  idea  (detailed  below) is to use some metainformation to translate LDAP queries to SQL queries,
       leaving relational schema untouched, so that old applications can continue using it without any modi-
       fications.   This allows SQL and LDAP applications to inter-operate without replication, and exchange
       data as needed.

       The SQL backend is designed to be tunable to virtually any relational schema without having to change
       source  (through  that  metainformation mentioned).  Also, it uses ODBC to connect to RDBMSes, and is
       highly configurable for SQL dialects RDBMSes may use, so it may be used for integration and distribu-
       tion of data on different RDBMSes, OSes, hosts etc., in other words, in highly heterogeneous environ-
       ment.

       This backend is <u>experimental</u>.

<b>CONFIGURATION</b>
       These <b>slapd.conf</b> options apply to the SQL backend database, which  means  that  they  must  follow  a
       "database  sql"  line  and  come before any subsequent "backend" or "database" lines.  Other database
       options not specific to this backend are described in the <a href="slapd.conf.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/slapd.conf"><b>slapd.conf</b>(5)</a> manual page.

<b>DATA</b> <b>SOURCE</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b>
       <b>dbname</b> <b>&lt;datasource</b> <b>name&gt;</b>
              The name of the ODBC datasource to use.

       <b>dbhost</b> <b>&lt;hostname&gt;</b>
       <b>dbpasswd</b> <b>&lt;password&gt;</b>
       <b>dbuser</b> <b>&lt;username&gt;</b>
              The three above options are generally unneeded, because this information  is  taken  from  the
              datasource  specified  by  the  <b>dbname</b> directive.  They allow to override datasource settings.
              Also, several RDBMS' drivers tend to require explicit passing of user/password, even if  those
              are given in datasource (Note: <b>dbhost</b> is currently ignored).

<b>SCOPING</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b>
       These options specify SQL query templates for scoping searches.


       <b>subtree_cond</b> <b>&lt;SQL</b> <b>expression&gt;</b>
              Specifies  a where-clause template used to form a subtree search condition (dn="(.+,)?&lt;dn&gt;$").
              It may differ from one SQL dialect to another (see samples).  By default,  it  is  constructed
              based  on the knowledge about how to normalize DN values (e.g.  <b>"&lt;upper_func&gt;(ldap_entries.dn)</b>
              <b>LIKE</b> <b>CONCAT('%',?)"</b>); see <b>upper_func</b>, <b>upper_needs_cast</b>,  <b>concat_pattern</b>  and  <b>strcast_func</b>  in
              "HELPER CONFIGURATION" for details.


       <b>children_cond</b> <b>&lt;SQL</b> <b>expression&gt;</b>
              Specifies  a  where-clause  template used to form a children search condition (dn=".+,&lt;dn&gt;$").
              It may differ from one SQL dialect to another (see samples).  By default,  it  is  constructed
              based  on the knowledge about how to normalize DN values (e.g.  <b>"&lt;upper_func&gt;(ldap_entries.dn)</b>
              <b>LIKE</b> <b>CONCAT('%,',?)"</b>); see <b>upper_func</b>, <b>upper_needs_cast</b>, <b>concat_pattern</b>  and  <b>strcast_func</b>  in
              "HELPER CONFIGURATION" for details.


       <b>use_subtree_shortcut</b> <b>{</b> <b>NO</b> <b>|</b> <b>yes</b> <b>}</b>
              Do  not use the subtree condition when the searchBase is the database suffix, and the scope is
              subtree; rather collect all entries.


<b>STATEMENT</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b>
       These options specify SQL query templates for loading  schema  mapping  metainformation,  adding  and
       deleting entries to ldap_entries, etc.  All these and subtree_cond should have the given default val-
       ues.  For the current value it is recommended to look at the sources, or in the log output when slapd
       starts with "-d 5" or greater.  Note that the parameter number and order must not be changed.


       <b>oc_query</b> <b>&lt;SQL</b> <b>expression&gt;</b>
              The  query  that  is used to collect the objectClass mapping data from table <u>ldap</u><b>_</b><u>oc</u><b>_</b><u>mappings</u>;
              see "METAINFORMATION USED" for details.  The default is <b>"SELECT</b> <b>id,</b> <b>name,</b> <b>keytbl,</b> <b>keycol,</b> <b>cre</b>-
              <b>ate_proc,</b> <b>delete_proc,</b> <b>expect_return</b> <b>FROM</b> <b>ldap_oc_mappings"</b>.


       <b>at_query</b> <b>&lt;SQL</b> <b>expression&gt;</b>
              The  query  that  is  used to collect the attributeType mapping data from table <u>ldap</u><b>_</b><u>attr</u><b>_</b><u>map</u>-
              <u>pings</u>; see "METAINFORMATION USED"  for  details.   The  default  is  <b>"SELECT</b>  <b>name,</b>  <b>sel_expr,</b>
              <b>from_tbls,</b>  <b>join_where,</b>  <b>add_proc,</b> <b>delete_proc,</b> <b>param_order,</b> <b>expect_return</b> <b>FROM</b> <b>ldap_attr_map</b>-
              <b>pings</b> <b>WHERE</b> <b>oc_map_id=?"</b>.


       <b>id_query</b> <b>&lt;SQL</b> <b>expression&gt;</b>
              The query that is used to map a DN to an entry in  table  <u>ldap</u><b>_</b><u>entries</u>;  see  "METAINFORMATION
              USED"  for details.  The default is <b>"SELECT</b> <b>id,keyval,oc_map_id,dn</b> <b>FROM</b> <b>ldap_entries</b> <b>WHERE</b> <b>&lt;DN</b>
              <b>match</b> <b>expr&gt;"</b>, where <b>&lt;DN</b> <b>match</b> <b>expr&gt;</b> is constructed based on the knowledge about how to normal-
              ize  DN  values  (e.g.  <b>"dn=?"</b>  if  no  means  to  uppercase strings are available; typically,
              <b>"&lt;upper_func&gt;(dn)=?"</b> is used);  see  <b>upper_func</b>,  <b>upper_needs_cast</b>,  <b>concat_pattern</b>  and  <b>str</b>-
              <b>cast_func</b> in "HELPER CONFIGURATION" for details.


       <b>insentry_stmt</b> <b>&lt;SQL</b> <b>expression&gt;</b>
              The  statement  that is used to insert a new entry in table <u>ldap</u><b>_</b><u>entries</u>; see "METAINFORMATION
              USED" for details.  The default is <b>"INSERT</b> <b>INTO</b> <b>ldap_entries</b> <b>(dn,</b> <b>oc_map_id,</b>  <b>parent,</b>  <b>keyval)</b>
              <b>VALUES</b> <b>(?,</b> <b>?,</b> <b>?,</b> <b>?)"</b>.


       <b>delentry_stmt</b> <b>&lt;SQL</b> <b>expression&gt;</b>
              The  statement  that is used to delete an existing entry from table <u>ldap</u><b>_</b><u>entries</u>; see "METAIN-
              FORMATION USED" for details.  The default is <b>"DELETE</b> <b>FROM</b> <b>ldap_entries</b> <b>WHERE</b> <b>id=?"</b>.


       <b>delobjclasses_stmt</b> <b>&lt;SQL</b> <b>expression&gt;</b>
              The statement that is used to delete an existing entry's ID from  table  <u>ldap</u><b>_</b><u>objclasses</u>;  see
              "METAINFORMATION  USED"  for details.  The default is <b>"DELETE</b> <b>FROM</b> <b>ldap_entry_objclasses</b> <b>WHERE</b>
              <b>entry_id=?"</b>.


<b>HELPER</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b>
       These statements are used to modify the default behavior of the backend according to  issues  of  the
       dialect of the RDBMS.  The first options essentially refer to string and DN normalization when build-
       ing filters.  LDAP normalization is more than upper- (or lower-)casing everything; however, as a rea-
       sonable  trade-off, for case-sensitive RDBMSes the backend can be instructed to uppercase strings and
       DNs by providing the <b>upper_func</b> directive.  Some RDBMSes, to use functions on arbitrary  data  types,
       e.g.  string  constants,  requires  a cast, which is triggered by the <b>upper_needs_cast</b> directive.  If
       required, a string cast function can be provided  as  well,  by  using  the  <b>strcast_func</b>  directive.
       Finally,  a custom string concatenation pattern may be required; it is provided by the <b>concat_pattern</b>
       directive.


       <b>upper_func</b> <b>&lt;SQL</b> <b>function</b> <b>name&gt;</b>
              Specifies the name of a function that converts a given value to uppercase.  This is  used  for
              case  insensitive  matching  when  the  RDBMS  is  case sensitive.  It may differ from one SQL
              dialect to another (e.g. <b>UCASE</b>, <b>UPPER</b> or whatever; see samples).  By default,  none  is  used,
              i.e. strings are not uppercased, so matches may be case sensitive.


       <b>upper_needs_cast</b> <b>{</b> <b>NO</b> <b>|</b> <b>yes</b> <b>}</b>
              Set  this  directive  to  <b>yes</b>  if  <b>upper_func</b>  needs  an explicit cast when applied to literal
              strings.  A cast in the form <b>CAST</b> <b>(&lt;arg&gt;</b> <b>AS</b> <b>VARCHAR(&lt;max</b> <b>DN</b> <b>length&gt;))</b> is used, where  <b>&lt;max</b>  <b>DN</b>
              <b>length&gt;</b> is builtin in back-sql; see macro <b>BACKSQL_MAX_DN_LEN</b> (currently 255; note that slapd's
              builtin limit, in macro <b>SLAP_LDAPDN_MAXLEN</b>, is set to 8192).  This  is  <u>experimental</u>  and  may
              change in future releases.


       <b>strcast_func</b> <b>&lt;SQL</b> <b>function</b> <b>name&gt;</b>
              Specifies  the  name  of  a  function  that converts a given value to a string for appropriate
              ordering.  This is used in "SELECT DISTINCT" statements for strongly typed RDBMSes with little
              implicit  casting (like PostgreSQL), when a literal string is specified.  This is <u>experimental</u>
              and may change in future releases.


       <b>concat_pattern</b> <b>&lt;pattern&gt;</b>
              This statement defines the <b>pattern</b> that is used to concatenate strings.  The <b>pattern</b> MUST con-
              tain  two  question marks, '?', that will be replaced by the two strings that must be concate-
              nated.  The default value is <b>CONCAT(?,?)</b>; a form that is known to be highly portable (IBM db2,
              PostgreSQL)  is  <b>?||?</b>, but an explicit cast may be required when operating on literal strings:
              <b>CAST(?||?</b> <b>AS</b> <b>VARCHAR(&lt;length&gt;))</b>.  On some RDBMSes (IBM db2, MSSQL) the form <b>?+?</b>  is  known  to
              work  as  well.  Carefully check the documentation of your RDBMS or stay with the examples for
              supported ones.  This is <u>experimental</u> and may change in future releases.


       <b>aliasing_keyword</b> <b>&lt;string&gt;</b>
              Define the aliasing keyword.  Some RDBMSes use the word "<u>AS</u>" (the default), others  don't  use
              any.


       <b>aliasing_quote</b> <b>&lt;string&gt;</b>
              Define  the  quoting  char  of  the  aliasing  keyword.   Some  RDBMSes don't require any (the
              default), others may require single or double quotes.


       <b>has_ldapinfo_dn_ru</b> <b>{</b> <b>NO</b> <b>|</b> <b>yes</b> <b>}</b>
              Explicitly inform the backend whether the dn_ru column (DN  in  reverse  uppercased  form)  is
              present  in table <u>ldap</u><b>_</b><u>entries</u>.  Overrides automatic check (this is required, for instance, by
              PostgreSQL/unixODBC).  This is <u>experimental</u> and may change in future releases.


       <b>fail_if_no_mapping</b> <b>{</b> <b>NO</b> <b>|</b> <b>yes</b> <b>}</b>
              When set to <b>yes</b> it forces <u>attribute</u> write operations to fail if no appropriate mapping between
              LDAP  attributes  and  SQL data is available.  The default behavior is to ignore those changes
              that cannot be mapped.  It has no impact on objectClass mapping, i.e. if the <u>structuralObject</u>-
              <u>Class</u>  of  an entry cannot be mapped to SQL by looking up its name in ldap_oc_mappings, an <u>add</u>
              operation will fail regardless of the <b>fail_if_no_mapping</b> switch; see section  "METAINFORMATION
              USED" for details.  This is <u>experimental</u> and may change in future releases.


       <b>allow_orphans</b> <b>{</b> <b>NO</b> <b>|</b> <b>yes</b> <b>}</b>
              When set to <b>yes</b> orphaned entries (i.e. without the parent entry in the database) can be added.
              This option should be used with care, possibly in conjunction with some special  rule  on  the
              RDBMS side that dynamically creates the missing parent.


       <b>baseObject</b> <b>[</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b> <b>]</b>
              Instructs  the  database to create and manage an in-memory baseObject entry instead of looking
              for one in the RDBMS.  If the (optional) <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b> argument is given, the entry is read  from
              that  file in <!-- a --><b>LDIF</b>(5)<!-- /a --> format; otherwise, an entry with objectClass <b>extensibleObject</b> is created
              based on the contents of the  RDN  of  the  <u>baseObject</u>.   This  is  particularly  useful  when
              <u>ldap</u><b>_</b><u>entries</u>  information  is  stored  in a view rather than in a table, and <b>union</b> is not sup-
              ported for views, so that the view can only specify one rule to compute  the  entry  structure
              for one objectClass.  This topic is discussed further in section "METAINFORMATION USED".  This
              is <u>experimental</u> and may change in future releases.


       <b>create_needs_select</b> <b>{</b> <b>NO</b> <b>|</b> <b>yes</b> <b>}</b>
              Instructs the database whether or not entry creation in table <u>ldap</u><b>_</b><u>entries</u> needs a  subsequent
              select  to collect the automatically assigned ID, instead of being returned by a stored proce-
              dure.


       <b>fetch_attrs</b> <b>&lt;attrlist&gt;</b>
       <b>fetch_all_attrs</b> <b>{</b> <b>NO</b> <b>|</b> <b>yes</b> <b>}</b>
              The first statement allows to provide a list of attributes that  must  always  be  fetched  in
              addition  to  those  requested  by  any  specific operation, because they are required for the
              proper usage of the backend.  For instance, all attributes used in ACLs should be listed here.
              The  second  statement is a shortcut to require all attributes to be always loaded.  Note that
              the dynamically generated attributes, e.g. <u>hasSubordinates</u>, <u>entryDN</u> and  other  implementation
              dependent  attributes are <b>NOT</b> generated at this point, for consistency with the rest of slapd.
              This may change in the future.


       <b>check_schema</b> <b>{</b> <b>YES</b> <b>|</b> <b>no</b> <b>}</b>
              Instructs the database to check schema adherence of entries after  modifications,  and  struc-
              tural objectClass chain when entries are built.  By default it is set to <b>yes</b>.


       <b>sqllayer</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> <b>[...]</b>
              Loads  the layer <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> onto a stack of helpers that are used to map DNs from LDAP to SQL rep-
              resentation and vice-versa.  Subsequent args are passed to the  layer  configuration  routine.
              This  is  <u>highly</u>  <u>experimental</u> and should be used with extreme care.  The API of the layers is
              not frozen yet, so it is unpublished.


<b>METAINFORMATION</b> <b>USED</b>
       Almost everything mentioned later is illustrated  in  examples  located  in  the  <b>servers/slapd/back</b>-
       <b>sql/rdbms_depend/</b>  directory  in the OpenLDAP source tree, and contains scripts for generating sample
       database for Oracle, MS SQL Server, mySQL and more (including PostgreSQL and IBM db2).

       The first thing that one must arrange is what set of LDAP  object  classes  can  present  your  RDBMS
       information.

       The easiest way is to create an objectClass for each entity you had in ER-diagram when designing your
       relational schema.  Any relational schema, no matter how normalized it is, was  designed  after  some
       model  of  your  application's  domain (for instance, accounts, services etc. in ISP), and is used in
       terms of its entities, not just tables of normalized schema.  It means that for  every  attribute  of
       every such instance there is an effective SQL query that loads its values.

       Also you might want your object classes to conform to some of the standard schemas like inetOrgPerson
       etc.

       Nevertheless, when you think it out, we must define a way to translate LDAP operation requests to  (a
       series of) SQL queries.  Let us deal with the SEARCH operation.

       Example:  Let's  suppose  that  we store information about persons working in our organization in two
       tables:

         PERSONS              PHONES
         ----------           -------------
         id integer           id integer
         first_name varchar   pers_id integer references persons(id)
         last_name varchar    phone
         middle_name varchar
         ...

       (PHONES contains telephone numbers associated with persons).  A person can have several numbers, then
       PHONES  contains  several records with corresponding pers_id, or no numbers (and no records in PHONES
       with such pers_id).  An LDAP objectclass to present such information could look like this:

         person
         -------
         MUST cn
         MAY telephoneNumber $ firstName $ lastName
         ...

       To fetch all values for cn attribute given person ID, we construct the query:

         SELECT CONCAT(persons.first_name,' ',persons.last_name)
             AS cn FROM persons WHERE persons.id=?

       for telephoneNumber we can use:

         SELECT phones.phone AS telephoneNumber FROM persons,phones
             WHERE persons.id=phones.pers_id AND persons.id=?

       If we wanted to service LDAP requests with filters like (telephoneNumber=123*),  we  would  construct
       something like:

         SELECT ... FROM persons,phones
             WHERE persons.id=phones.pers_id
                 AND persons.id=?
                 AND phones.phone like '%1%2%3%'

       (note  how  the  telephoneNumber  match is expanded in multiple wildcards to account for interspersed
       ininfluential chars like spaces, dashes and so; this occurs  by  design  because  telephoneNumber  is
       defined  after  a  specially recognized syntax).  So, if we had information about what tables contain
       values for each attribute, how to join these tables and arrange these values, we could try  to  auto-
       matically generate such statements, and translate search filters to SQL WHERE clauses.

       To  store  such  information,  we add three more tables to our schema and fill it with data (see sam-
       ples):

         ldap_oc_mappings (some columns are not listed for clarity)
         ---------------
         id=1
         name="person"
         keytbl="persons"
         keycol="id"

       This table defines a mapping between objectclass (its name held in the "name" column),  and  a  table
       that  holds  the  primary  key  for corresponding entities.  For instance, in our example, the person
       entity, which we are trying to present as "person" objectclass, resides in two  tables  (persons  and
       phones),  and  is  identified  by  the  persons.id column (that we will call the primary key for this
       entity).  Keytbl and keycol thus contain "persons" (name of the table), and "id" (name  of  the  col-
       umn).

         ldap_attr_mappings (some columns are not listed for clarity)
         -----------
         id=1
         oc_map_id=1
         name="cn"
         sel_expr="CONCAT(persons.first_name,' ',persons.last_name)"
         from_tbls="persons"
         join_where=NULL
         ************
         id=&lt;n&gt;
         oc_map_id=1
         name="telephoneNumber"
         sel_expr="phones.phone"
         from_tbls="persons,phones"
         join_where="phones.pers_id=persons.id"

       This  table  defines  mappings  between LDAP attributes and SQL queries that load their values.  Note
       that, unlike LDAP schema, these are not <b>attribute</b> <b>types</b> - the attribute "cn" for "person" objectclass
       can  have  its values in different tables than "cn" for some other objectclass, so attribute mappings
       depend on objectclass mappings (unlike attribute types in  LDAP  schema,  which  are  indifferent  to
       objectclasses).  Thus, we have oc_map_id column with link to oc_mappings table.

       Now  we  cut  the  SQL  query  that loads values for a given attribute into 3 parts.  First goes into
       sel_expr column - this is the expression we had between SELECT and FROM keywords, which defines  WHAT
       to load.  Next is table list - text between FROM and WHERE keywords.  It may contain aliases for con-
       venience (see examples).  The last is part of the where clause, which (if it exists at all) expresses
       the condition for joining the table containing values with the table containing the primary key (for-
       eign key equality and such).  If values are in the same table as the primary key, then this column is
       left NULL (as for cn attribute above).

       Having  this information in parts, we are able to not only construct queries that load attribute val-
       ues by id of entry (for this we could store SQL query as a whole), but to construct queries that load
       id's  of  objects  that  correspond to a given search filter (or at least part of it).  See below for
       examples.

         ldap_entries
         ------------
         id=1
         dn=&lt;dn you choose&gt;
         oc_map_id=...
         parent=&lt;parent record id&gt;
         keyval=&lt;value of primary key&gt;

       This table defines mappings between DNs of entries in your LDAP tree, and values of primary keys  for
       corresponding relational data.  It has recursive structure (parent column references id column of the
       same table), which allows you to add any tree <!-- a -->structure(s)<!-- /a --> to your flat relational data.   Having  id
       of objectclass mapping, we can determine table and column for primary key, and keyval stores value of
       it, thus defining the exact tuple corresponding to the LDAP entry with this DN.

       Note that such design (see exact SQL table creation query) implies one important constraint - the key
       must  be  an  integer.   But all that I know about well-designed schemas makes me think that it's not
       very narrow ;) If anyone needs support for different types for keys - he may want to write  a  patch,
       and submit it to OpenLDAP ITS, then I'll include it.

       Also,  several  people  complained  that they don't really need very structured trees, and they don't
       want to update one more table every time they add or delete an instance  in  the  relational  schema.
       Those  people  can use a view instead of a real table for ldap_entries, something like this (by Robin
       Elfrink):

         CREATE VIEW ldap_entries (id, dn, oc_map_id, parent, keyval)
             AS
                 SELECT 0, UPPER('o=MyCompany,c=NL'),
                     3, 0, 'baseObject' FROM unixusers WHERE userid='root'
             UNION
                 SELECT (1000000000+userid),
                     UPPER(CONCAT(CONCAT('cn=',gecos),',o=MyCompany,c=NL')),
                     1, 0, userid FROM unixusers
             UNION
                 SELECT (2000000000+groupnummer),
                     UPPER(CONCAT(CONCAT('cn=',groupnaam),',o=MyCompany,c=NL')),
                     2, 0, groupnummer FROM groups;


       If your RDBMS does not support <b>unions</b> in views, only one objectClass can be mapped  in  <b>ldap_entries</b>,
       and the baseObject cannot be created; in this case, see the <b>baseObject</b> directive for a possible work-
       around.



<b>Typical</b> <b>SQL</b> <b>backend</b> <b>operation</b>
       Having metainformation loaded, the SQL backend uses these tables to determine a set of  primary  keys
       of  candidates (depending on search scope and filter).  It tries to do it for each objectclass regis-
       tered in ldap_objclasses.

       Example: for our query with filter (telephoneNumber=123*) we would get the following query  generated
       (which loads candidate IDs)

         SELECT ldap_entries.id,persons.id, 'person' AS objectClass,
                ldap_entries.dn AS dn
           FROM ldap_entries,persons,phones
          WHERE persons.id=ldap_entries.keyval
            AND ldap_entries.objclass=?
            AND ldap_entries.parent=?
            AND phones.pers_id=persons.id
            AND (phones.phone LIKE '%1%2%3%')

       (for ONELEVEL search) or "... AND dn=?" (for BASE search) or "... AND dn LIKE '%?'" (for SUBTREE)

       Then, for each candidate, we load the requested attributes using per-attribute queries like

         SELECT phones.phone AS telephoneNumber
           FROM persons,phones
          WHERE persons.id=? AND phones.pers_id=persons.id

       Then,  we  use  test_filter()  from  the frontend API to test the entry for a full LDAP search filter
       match (since we cannot effectively make sense of SYNTAX of corresponding LDAP  schema  attribute,  we
       translate  the  filter  into the most relaxed SQL condition to filter candidates), and send it to the
       user.

       ADD, DELETE, MODIFY and  MODRDN  operations  are  also  performed  on  per-attribute  metainformation
       (add_proc etc.).  In those fields one can specify an SQL statement or stored procedure call which can
       add, or delete given values of a given attribute, using the  given  entry  keyval  (see  examples  --
       mostly PostgreSQL, ORACLE and MSSQL - since as of this writing there are no stored procs in MySQL).

       We  just  add  more columns to ldap_oc_mappings and ldap_attr_mappings, holding statements to execute
       (like create_proc, add_proc, del_proc etc.), and flags governing the order of  parameters  passed  to
       those  statements.  Please see samples to find out what are the parameters passed, and other informa-
       tion on this matter - they are self-explanatory for those familiar with the concepts expressed above.


<b>Common</b> <b>techniques</b> <b>(referrals,</b> <b>multiclassing</b> <b>etc.)</b>
       First  of all, let's remember that among other major differences to the complete LDAP data model, the
       concept above does not directly support such things as multiple objectclasses per entry,  and  refer-
       rals.   Fortunately,  they are easy to adopt in this scheme.  The SQL backend suggests one more table
       being added to the schema: ldap_entry_objectclasses(entry_id,oc_name).

       The first contains any number of objectclass names that corresponding entries will be  found  by,  in
       addition  to that mentioned in mapping.  The SQL backend automatically adds attribute mapping for the
       "objectclass" attribute to each objectclass mapping that loads values from this table.  So, you  may,
       for instance, have a mapping for inetOrgPerson, and use it for queries for "person" objectclass...

       Referrals used to be implemented in a loose manner by adding an extra table that allowed any entry to
       host a "ref" attribute, along with a "referral" extra objectClass in table ldap_entry_objclasses.  In
       the  current  implementation, referrals are treated like any other user-defined schema, since "refer-
       ral" is a structural objectclass.  The  suggested  practice  is  to  define  a  "referral"  entry  in
       ldap_oc_mappings,  holding  a  naming attribute, e.g. "ou" or "cn", a "ref" attribute, containing the
       url; in case multiple referrals per entry are needed, a separate table for urls can be created, where
       urls  are  mapped to the respective entries.  The use of the naming attribute usually requires to add
       an "extensibleObject" value to ldap_entry_objclasses.



<b>Caveats</b>
       As previously stated, this backend should not be considered a replacement of other data storage back-
       ends, but rather a gateway to existing RDBMS storages that need to be published in LDAP form.

       The  <b>hasSubordintes</b>  operational  attribute  is  honored by back-sql in search results and in compare
       operations; it is partially honored also in filtering.  Owing to design limitations, a  (brain-dead?)
       filter  of  the form <b>(!(hasSubordinates=TRUE))</b> will give no results instead of returning all the leaf
       entries, because it actually expands into <b>...</b> <b>AND</b> <b>NOT</b> <b>(1=1)</b>.  If  you  need  to  find  all  the  leaf
       entries, please use <b>(hasSubordinates=FALSE)</b> instead.

       A  directoryString  value of the form "__First___Last_" (where underscores should be replaced by spa-
       ces) corresponds to its prettified counterpart "First_Last"; this is not currently honored  by  back-
       sql  if  non-prettified data is written via RDBMS; when non-prettified data is written thru back-sql,
       the prettified values are actually used instead.


<b>PROXY</b> <b>CACHE</b> <b>OVERLAY</b>
       The proxy cache overlay allows caching of LDAP search requests (queries) in a  local  database.   See
       <a href="slapo-pcache.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/slapo-pcache"><b>slapo-pcache</b>(5)</a> for details.

<b>EXAMPLES</b>
       There  are  example  SQL modules in the slapd/back-sql/rdbms_depend/ directory in the OpenLDAP source
       tree.

<b>ACCESS</b> <b>CONTROL</b>
       The <b>sql</b> backend honors access control semantics as indicated in <a href="slapd.access.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/slapd.access"><b>slapd.access</b>(5)</a> (including  the  <b>dis</b>-
       <b>close</b> access privilege when enabled at compile time).
