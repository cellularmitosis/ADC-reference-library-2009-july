SSH_CONFIG(5)               BSD File Formats Manual              SSH_CONFIG(5)

<b>NAME</b>
     <b>ssh_config</b> -- OpenSSH SSH client configuration files

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
     <u>~/.ssh/config</u>
     <u>/etc/ssh</u><b>_</b><u>config</u>

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
     <a href="../man1/ssh.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ssh">ssh(1)</a> obtains configuration data from the following sources in the following order:

           1.   command-line options
           2.   user's configuration file (<u>~/.ssh/config</u>)
           3.   system-wide configuration file (<u>/etc/ssh</u><b>_</b><u>config</u>)

     For each parameter, the first obtained value will be used.  The configuration files contain sections
     separated by ``Host'' specifications, and that section is only applied for hosts that match one of the
     patterns given in the specification.  The matched host name is the one given on the command line.

     Since the first obtained value for each parameter is used, more host-specific declarations should be
     given near the beginning of the file, and general defaults at the end.

     The configuration file has the following format:

     Empty lines and lines starting with `#' are comments.  Otherwise a line is of the format ``keyword
     arguments''.  Configuration options may be separated by whitespace or optional whitespace and exactly
     one `='; the latter format is useful to avoid the need to quote whitespace when specifying configura-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;configuration</font>
     tion options using the <b>ssh</b>, <b>scp</b>, and <b>sftp</b> <b>-o</b> option.  Arguments may optionally be enclosed in double
     quotes (") in order to represent arguments containing spaces.

     The possible keywords and their meanings are as follows (note that keywords are case-insensitive and
     arguments are case-sensitive):

     <b>Host</b>    Restricts the following declarations (up to the next <b>Host</b> keyword) to be only for those hosts
             that match one of the patterns given after the keyword.  A single `*' as a pattern can be used
             to provide global defaults for all hosts.  The host is the <u>hostname</u> argument given on the com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
             mand line (i.e. the name is not converted to a canonicalized host name before matching).

             See <u>PATTERNS</u> for more information on patterns.

     <b>AddressFamily</b>
             Specifies which address family to use when connecting.  Valid arguments are ``any'', ``inet''
             (use IPv4 only), or ``inet6'' (use IPv6 only).

     <b>BatchMode</b>
             If set to ``yes'', passphrase/password querying will be disabled.  This option is useful in
             scripts and other batch jobs where no user is present to supply the password.  The argument
             must be ``yes'' or ``no''.  The default is ``no''.

     <b>BindAddress</b>
             Use the specified address on the local machine as the source address of the connection.  Only
             useful on systems with more than one address.  Note that this option does not work if
             <b>UsePrivilegedPort</b> is set to ``yes''.

     <b>ChallengeResponseAuthentication</b>
             Specifies whether to use challenge-response authentication.  The argument to this keyword must
             be ``yes'' or ``no''.  The default is ``yes''.

     <b>CheckHostIP</b>
             If this flag is set to ``yes'', <a href="../man1/ssh.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ssh">ssh(1)</a> will additionally check the host IP address in the
             <u>known</u><b>_</b><u>hosts</u> file.  This allows ssh to detect if a host key changed due to DNS spoofing.  If the
             option is set to ``no'', the check will not be executed.  The default is ``yes''.

     <b>Cipher</b>  Specifies the cipher to use for encrypting the session in protocol version 1.  Currently,
             ``blowfish'', ``3des'', and ``des'' are supported.  <u>des</u> is only supported in the <a href="../man1/ssh.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ssh">ssh(1)</a> client
             for interoperability with legacy protocol 1 implementations that do not support the <u>3des</u>
             cipher.  Its use is strongly discouraged due to cryptographic weaknesses.  The default is
             ``3des''.

     <b>Ciphers</b>
             Specifies the ciphers allowed for protocol version 2 in order of preference.  Multiple ciphers
             must be comma-separated.  The supported ciphers are ``3des-cbc'', ``aes128-cbc'',
             ``aes192-cbc'', ``aes256-cbc'', ``aes128-ctr'', ``aes192-ctr'', ``aes256-ctr'', ``arcfour128'',
             ``arcfour256'', ``arcfour'', ``blowfish-cbc'', and ``cast128-cbc''.  The default is:

                aes128-cbc,3des-cbc,blowfish-cbc,cast128-cbc,arcfour128,
                arcfour256,arcfour,aes192-cbc,aes256-cbc,aes128-ctr,
                aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr

     <b>ClearAllForwardings</b>
             Specifies that all local, remote, and dynamic port forwardings specified in the configuration
             files or on the command line be cleared.  This option is primarily useful when used from the
             <a href="../man1/ssh.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ssh">ssh(1)</a> command line to clear port forwardings set in configuration files, and is automatically
             set by <a href="../man1/scp.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/scp">scp(1)</a> and <a href="../man1/sftp.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/sftp">sftp(1)</a>.  The argument must be ``yes'' or ``no''.  The default is ``no''.

     <b>Compression</b>
             Specifies whether to use compression.  The argument must be ``yes'' or ``no''.  The default is
             ``no''.

     <b>CompressionLevel</b>
             Specifies the compression level to use if compression is enabled.  The argument must be an
             integer from 1 (fast) to 9 (slow, best).  The default level is 6, which is good for most appli-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cations.&nbsp;applications.</font>
             cations.  The meaning of the values is the same as in <a href="../man1/gzip.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/gzip">gzip(1)</a>.  Note that this option applies
             to protocol version 1 only.

     <b>ConnectionAttempts</b>
             Specifies the number of tries (one per second) to make before exiting.  The argument must be an
             integer.  This may be useful in scripts if the connection sometimes fails.  The default is 1.

     <b>ConnectTimeout</b>
             Specifies the timeout (in seconds) used when connecting to the SSH server, instead of using the
             default system TCP timeout.  This value is used only when the target is down or really unreach-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able,&nbsp;unreachable,</font>
             able, not when it refuses the connection.

     <b>ControlMaster</b>
             Enables the sharing of multiple sessions over a single network connection.  When set to
             ``yes'', <a href="../man1/ssh.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ssh">ssh(1)</a> will listen for connections on a control socket specified using the <b>ControlPath</b>
             argument.  Additional sessions can connect to this socket using the same <b>ControlPath</b> with
             <b>ControlMaster</b> set to ``no'' (the default).  These sessions will try to reuse the master
             instance's network connection rather than initiating new ones, but will fall back to connecting
             normally if the control socket does not exist, or is not listening.

             Setting this to ``ask'' will cause ssh to listen for control connections, but require confirma-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;confirmation</font>
             tion using the SSH_ASKPASS program before they are accepted (see <a href="../man1/ssh-add.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ssh-add">ssh-add(1)</a> for details).  If
             the <b>ControlPath</b> cannot be opened, ssh will continue without connecting to a master instance.

             X11 and <a href="../man1/ssh-agent.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ssh-agent">ssh-agent(1)</a> forwarding is supported over these multiplexed connections, however the
             display and agent forwarded will be the one belonging to the master connection i.e. it is not
             possible to forward multiple displays or agents.

             Two additional options allow for opportunistic multiplexing: try to use a master connection but
             fall back to creating a new one if one does not already exist.  These options are: ``auto'' and
             ``autoask''.  The latter requires confirmation like the ``ask'' option.

     <b>ControlPath</b>
             Specify the path to the control socket used for connection sharing as described in the
             <b>ControlMaster</b> section above or the string ``none'' to disable connection sharing.  In the path,
             `%l' will be substituted by the local host name, `%h' will be substituted by the target host
             name, `%p' the port, and `%r' by the remote login username.  It is recommended that any
             <b>ControlPath</b> used for opportunistic connection sharing include at least %h, %p, and %r.  This
             ensures that shared connections are uniquely identified.

     <b>DynamicForward</b>
             Specifies that a TCP port on the local machine be forwarded over the secure channel, and the
             application protocol is then used to determine where to connect to from the remote machine.

             The argument must be [<u>bind</u><b>_</b><u>address</u>:]<u>port</u>.  IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing
             addresses in square brackets or by using an alternative syntax: [<u>bind</u><b>_</b><u>address</u>/]<u>port</u>.  By
             default, the local port is bound in accordance with the <b>GatewayPorts</b> setting.  However, an
             explicit <u>bind</u><b>_</b><u>address</u> may be used to bind the connection to a specific address.  The
             <u>bind</u><b>_</b><u>address</u> of ``localhost'' indicates that the listening port be bound for local use only,
             while an empty address or `*' indicates that the port should be available from all interfaces.

             Currently the SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols are supported, and <a href="../man1/ssh.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ssh">ssh(1)</a> will act as a SOCKS server.
             Multiple forwardings may be specified, and additional forwardings can be given on the command
             line.  Only the superuser can forward privileged ports.

     <b>EnableSSHKeysign</b>
             Setting this option to ``yes'' in the global client configuration file <u>/etc/ssh</u><b>_</b><u>config</u> enables
             the use of the helper program <a href="../man8/ssh-keysign.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/ssh-keysign">ssh-keysign(8)</a> during <b>HostbasedAuthentication</b>.  The argument must
             be ``yes'' or ``no''.  The default is ``no''.  This option should be placed in the non-hostspe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cific&nbsp;non-hostspecific</font>
             cific section.  See <a href="../man8/ssh-keysign.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/ssh-keysign">ssh-keysign(8)</a> for more information.

     <b>EscapeChar</b>
             Sets the escape character (default: `~').  The escape character can also be set on the command
             line.  The argument should be a single character, `^' followed by a letter, or ``none'' to dis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able&nbsp;disable</font>
             able the escape character entirely (making the connection transparent for binary data).

     <b>ExitOnForwardFailure</b>
             Specifies whether <a href="../man1/ssh.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ssh">ssh(1)</a> should terminate the connection if it cannot set up all requested
             dynamic, local, and remote port forwardings.  The argument must be ``yes'' or ``no''.  The
             default is ``no''.

     <b>ForwardAgent</b>
             Specifies whether the connection to the authentication agent (if any) will be forwarded to the
             remote machine.  The argument must be ``yes'' or ``no''.  The default is ``no''.

             Agent forwarding should be enabled with caution.  Users with the ability to bypass file permis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sions&nbsp;permissions</font>
             sions on the remote host (for the agent's Unix-domain socket) can access the local agent
             through the forwarded connection.  An attacker cannot obtain key material from the agent, how-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ever&nbsp;however</font>
             ever they can perform operations on the keys that enable them to authenticate using the identi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ties&nbsp;identities</font>
             ties loaded into the agent.

     <b>ForwardX11</b>
             Specifies whether X11 connections will be automatically redirected over the secure channel and
             DISPLAY set.  The argument must be ``yes'' or ``no''.  The default is ``no''.

             X11 forwarding should be enabled with caution.  Users with the ability to bypass file permis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sions&nbsp;permissions</font>
             sions on the remote host (for the user's X11 authorization database) can access the local X11
             display through the forwarded connection.  An attacker may then be able to perform activities
             such as keystroke monitoring if the <b>ForwardX11Trusted</b> option is also enabled.

     <b>ForwardX11Trusted</b>
             If this option is set to ``yes'', remote X11 clients will have full access to the original X11
             display.

             If this option is set to ``no'', remote X11 clients will be considered untrusted and prevented
             from stealing or tampering with data belonging to trusted X11 clients.  Furthermore, the
             <!-- a -->xauth(1)<!-- /a --> token used for the session will be set to expire after 20 minutes.  Remote clients
             will be refused access after this time.

             The default is ``no''.

             See the X11 SECURITY extension specification for full details on the restrictions imposed on
             untrusted clients.

     <b>GatewayPorts</b>
             Specifies whether remote hosts are allowed to connect to local forwarded ports.  By default,
             <a href="../man1/ssh.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ssh">ssh(1)</a> binds local port forwardings to the loopback address.  This prevents other remote hosts
             from connecting to forwarded ports.  <b>GatewayPorts</b> can be used to specify that ssh should bind
             local port forwardings to the wildcard address, thus allowing remote hosts to connect to for-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">warded&nbsp;forwarded</font>
             warded ports.  The argument must be ``yes'' or ``no''.  The default is ``no''.

     <b>GlobalKnownHostsFile</b>
             Specifies a file to use for the global host key database instead of <u>/etc/ssh</u><b>_</b><u>known</u><b>_</b><u>hosts</u>.

     <b>GSSAPIAuthentication</b>
             Specifies whether user authentication based on GSSAPI is allowed.  The default is ``no''.  Note
             that this option applies to protocol version 2 only.

     <b>GSSAPIKeyExchange</b>
             Specifies whether key exchange based on GSSAPI may be used. When using GSSAPI key exchange the
             server need not have a host key.  The default is ``no''.  Note that this option applies to pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tocol&nbsp;protocol</font>
             tocol version 2 only.

     <b>GSSAPIDelegateCredentials</b>
             Forward (delegate) credentials to the server.  The default is ``no''.  Note that this option
             applies to protocol version 2 only.

     <b>GSSAPITrustDns</b>
             Set to ``yes'' to indicate that the DNS is trusted to securely canonicalize the name of the
             host being connected to. If ``no'', the hostname entered on the command line will be passed
             untouched to the GSSAPI library.  The default is ``no''.  This option only applies to protocol
             version 2 connections using GSSAPI.

     <b>HashKnownHosts</b>
             Indicates that <a href="../man1/ssh.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ssh">ssh(1)</a> should hash host names and addresses when they are added to
             <u>~/.ssh/known</u><b>_</b><u>hosts</u>.  These hashed names may be used normally by <a href="../man1/ssh.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ssh">ssh(1)</a> and <a href="../man8/sshd.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/sshd">sshd(8)</a>, but they do
             not reveal identifying information should the file's contents be disclosed.  The default is
             ``no''.  Note that existing names and addresses in known hosts files will not be converted
             automatically, but may be manually hashed using <a href="../man1/ssh-keygen.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ssh-keygen">ssh-keygen(1)</a>.

     <b>HostbasedAuthentication</b>
             Specifies whether to try rhosts based authentication with public key authentication.  The argu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment&nbsp;argument</font>
             ment must be ``yes'' or ``no''.  The default is ``no''.  This option applies to protocol ver-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion&nbsp;version</font>
             sion 2 only and is similar to <b>RhostsRSAAuthentication</b>.

     <b>HostKeyAlgorithms</b>
             Specifies the protocol version 2 host key algorithms that the client wants to use in order of
             preference.  The default for this option is: ``ssh-rsa,ssh-dss''.

     <b>HostKeyAlias</b>
             Specifies an alias that should be used instead of the real host name when looking up or saving
             the host key in the host key database files.  This option is useful for tunneling SSH connec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tions&nbsp;connections</font>
             tions or for multiple servers running on a single host.

     <b>HostName</b>
             Specifies the real host name to log into.  This can be used to specify nicknames or abbrevia-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tions&nbsp;abbreviations</font>
             tions for hosts.  The default is the name given on the command line.  Numeric IP addresses are
             also permitted (both on the command line and in <b>HostName</b> specifications).

     <b>IdentitiesOnly</b>
             Specifies that <a href="../man1/ssh.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ssh">ssh(1)</a> should only use the authentication identity files configured in the
             <b>ssh_config</b> files, even if <a href="../man1/ssh-agent.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ssh-agent">ssh-agent(1)</a> offers more identities.  The argument to this keyword
             must be ``yes'' or ``no''.  This option is intended for situations where ssh-agent offers many
             different identities.  The default is ``no''.

     <b>IdentityFile</b>
             Specifies a file from which the user's RSA or DSA authentication identity is read.  The default
             is <u>~/.ssh/identity</u> for protocol version 1, and <u>~/.ssh/id</u><b>_</b><u>rsa</u> and <u>~/.ssh/id</u><b>_</b><u>dsa</u> for protocol
             version 2.  Additionally, any identities represented by the authentication agent will be used
             for authentication.

             The file name may use the tilde syntax to refer to a user's home directory or one of the fol-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lowing&nbsp;following</font>
             lowing escape characters: `%d' (local user's home directory), `%u' (local user name), `%l'
             (local host name), `%h' (remote host name) or `%r' (remote user name).

             It is possible to have multiple identity files specified in configuration files; all these
             identities will be tried in sequence.

     <b>KbdInteractiveDevices</b>
             Specifies the list of methods to use in keyboard-interactive authentication.  Multiple method
             names must be comma-separated.  The default is to use the server specified list.  The methods
             available vary depending on what the server supports.  For an OpenSSH server, it may be zero or
             more of: ``bsdauth'', ``pam'', and ``skey''.

     <b>LocalCommand</b>
             Specifies a command to execute on the local machine after successfully connecting to the
             server.  The command string extends to the end of the line, and is executed with <u>/bin/sh</u>.  This
             directive is ignored unless <b>PermitLocalCommand</b> has been enabled.

     <b>LocalForward</b>
             Specifies that a TCP port on the local machine be forwarded over the secure channel to the
             specified host and port from the remote machine.  The first argument must be
             [<u>bind</u><b>_</b><u>address</u>:]<u>port</u> and the second argument must be <u>host</u>:<u>hostport</u>.  IPv6 addresses can be spec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ified&nbsp;specified</font>
             ified by enclosing addresses in square brackets or by using an alternative syntax:
             [<u>bind</u><b>_</b><u>address</u>/]<u>port</u> and <u>host</u>/<u>hostport</u>.  Multiple forwardings may be specified, and additional
             forwardings can be given on the command line.  Only the superuser can forward privileged ports.
             By default, the local port is bound in accordance with the <b>GatewayPorts</b> setting.  However, an
             explicit <u>bind</u><b>_</b><u>address</u> may be used to bind the connection to a specific address.  The
             <u>bind</u><b>_</b><u>address</u> of ``localhost'' indicates that the listening port be bound for local use only,
             while an empty address or `*' indicates that the port should be available from all interfaces.

     <b>LogLevel</b>
             Gives the verbosity level that is used when logging messages from <a href="../man1/ssh.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ssh">ssh(1)</a>.  The possible values
             are: QUIET, FATAL, ERROR, INFO, VERBOSE, DEBUG, DEBUG1, DEBUG2, and DEBUG3.  The default is
             INFO.  DEBUG and DEBUG1 are equivalent.  DEBUG2 and DEBUG3 each specify higher levels of ver-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">bose&nbsp;verbose</font>
             bose output.

     <b>MACs</b>    Specifies the MAC (message authentication code) algorithms in order of preference.  The MAC
             algorithm is used in protocol version 2 for data integrity protection.  Multiple algorithms
             must be comma-separated.  The default is:
             ``hmac-md5,hmac-sha1,hmac-ripemd160,hmac-sha1-96,hmac-md5-96''.

     <b>NoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost</b>
             This option can be used if the home directory is shared across machines.  In this case local-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">host&nbsp;localhost</font>
             host will refer to a different machine on each of the machines and the user will get many warn-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ings&nbsp;warnings</font>
             ings about changed host keys.  However, this option disables host authentication for localhost.
             The argument to this keyword must be ``yes'' or ``no''.  The default is to check the host key
             for localhost.

     <b>NumberOfPasswordPrompts</b>
             Specifies the number of password prompts before giving up.  The argument to this keyword must
             be an integer.  The default is 3.

     <b>PasswordAuthentication</b>
             Specifies whether to use password authentication.  The argument to this keyword must be ``yes''
             or ``no''.  The default is ``yes''.

     <b>PermitLocalCommand</b>
             Allow local command execution via the <b>LocalCommand</b> option or using the <b>!</b><u>command</u> escape sequence
             in <a href="../man1/ssh.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ssh">ssh(1)</a>.  The argument must be ``yes'' or ``no''.  The default is ``no''.

     <b>Port</b>    Specifies the port number to connect on the remote host.  The default is 22.

     <b>PreferredAuthentications</b>
             Specifies the order in which the client should try protocol 2 authentication methods.  This
             allows a client to prefer one method (e.g. <b>keyboard-interactive</b>) over another method (e.g.
             <b>password</b>) The default for this option is: ``gssapi-with-mic, hostbased, publickey, keyboard-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">interactive,&nbsp;keyboardinteractive,</font>
             interactive, password''.

     <b>Protocol</b>
             Specifies the protocol versions <a href="../man1/ssh.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ssh">ssh(1)</a> should support in order of preference.  The possible
             values are `1' and `2'.  Multiple versions must be comma-separated.  The default is ``2,1''.
             This means that ssh tries version 2 and falls back to version 1 if version 2 is not available.

     <b>ProxyCommand</b>
             Specifies the command to use to connect to the server.  The command string extends to the end
             of the line, and is executed with <u>/bin/sh</u>.  In the command string, `%h' will be substituted by
             the host name to connect and `%p' by the port.  The command can be basically anything, and
             should read from its standard input and write to its standard output.  It should eventually
             connect an <a href="../man8/sshd.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/sshd">sshd(8)</a> server running on some machine, or execute <b>sshd</b> <b>-i</b> somewhere.  Host key man-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">agement&nbsp;management</font>
             agement will be done using the HostName of the host being connected (defaulting to the name
             typed by the user).  Setting the command to ``none'' disables this option entirely.  Note that
             <b>CheckHostIP</b> is not available for connects with a proxy command.

             This directive is useful in conjunction with <a href="../man1/nc.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/nc">nc(1)</a> and its proxy support.  For example, the
             following directive would connect via an HTTP proxy at 192.0.2.0:

                ProxyCommand /usr/bin/nc -X connect -x 192.0.2.0:8080 %h %p

     <b>PubkeyAuthentication</b>
             Specifies whether to try public key authentication.  The argument to this keyword must be
             ``yes'' or ``no''.  The default is ``yes''.  This option applies to protocol version 2 only.

     <b>RekeyLimit</b>
             Specifies the maximum amount of data that may be transmitted before the session key is renego-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tiated.&nbsp;renegotiated.</font>
             tiated.  The argument is the number of bytes, with an optional suffix of `K', `M', or `G' to
             indicate Kilobytes, Megabytes, or Gigabytes, respectively.  The default is between `1G' and
             `4G', depending on the cipher.  This option applies to protocol version 2 only.

     <b>RemoteForward</b>
             Specifies that a TCP port on the remote machine be forwarded over the secure channel to the
             specified host and port from the local machine.  The first argument must be [<u>bind</u><b>_</b><u>address</u>:]<u>port</u>
             and the second argument must be <u>host</u>:<u>hostport</u>.  IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing
             addresses in square brackets or by using an alternative syntax: [<u>bind</u><b>_</b><u>address</u>/]<u>port</u> and
             <u>host</u>/<u>hostport</u>.  Multiple forwardings may be specified, and additional forwardings can be given
             on the command line.  Only the superuser can forward privileged ports.

             If the <u>bind</u><b>_</b><u>address</u> is not specified, the default is to only bind to loopback addresses.  If
             the <u>bind</u><b>_</b><u>address</u> is `*' or an empty string, then the forwarding is requested to listen on all
             interfaces.  Specifying a remote <u>bind</u><b>_</b><u>address</u> will only succeed if the server's <b>GatewayPorts</b>
             option is enabled (see <a href="sshd_config.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/sshd_config">sshd_config(5)</a>).

     <b>RhostsRSAAuthentication</b>
             Specifies whether to try rhosts based authentication with RSA host authentication.  The argu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment&nbsp;argument</font>
             ment must be ``yes'' or ``no''.  The default is ``no''.  This option applies to protocol ver-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion&nbsp;version</font>
             sion 1 only and requires <a href="../man1/ssh.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ssh">ssh(1)</a> to be setuid root.

     <b>RSAAuthentication</b>
             Specifies whether to try RSA authentication.  The argument to this keyword must be ``yes'' or
             ``no''.  RSA authentication will only be attempted if the identity file exists, or an authenti-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cation&nbsp;authentication</font>
             cation agent is running.  The default is ``yes''.  Note that this option applies to protocol
             version 1 only.

     <b>SendEnv</b>
             Specifies what variables from the local <a href="../man7/environ.7.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/7/environ">environ(7)</a> should be sent to the server.  Note that
             environment passing is only supported for protocol 2.  The server must also support it, and the
             server must be configured to accept these environment variables.  Refer to <b>AcceptEnv</b> in
             <a href="sshd_config.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/sshd_config">sshd_config(5)</a> for how to configure the server.  Variables are specified by name, which may
             contain wildcard characters.  Multiple environment variables may be separated by whitespace or
             spread across multiple <b>SendEnv</b> directives.  The default is not to send any environment vari-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ables.&nbsp;variables.</font>
             ables.

             See <u>PATTERNS</u> for more information on patterns.

     <b>ServerAliveCountMax</b>
             Sets the number of server alive messages (see below) which may be sent without <a href="../man1/ssh.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ssh">ssh(1)</a> receiving
             any messages back from the server.  If this threshold is reached while server alive messages
             are being sent, ssh will disconnect from the server, terminating the session.  It is important
             to note that the use of server alive messages is very different from <b>TCPKeepAlive</b> (below).  The
             server alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel and therefore will not be spoofa-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ble.&nbsp;spoofable.</font>
             ble.  The TCP keepalive option enabled by <b>TCPKeepAlive</b> is spoofable.  The server alive mecha-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nism&nbsp;mechanism</font>
             nism is valuable when the client or server depend on knowing when a connection has become inac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tive.&nbsp;inactive.</font>
             tive.

             The default value is 3.  If, for example, <b>ServerAliveInterval</b> (see below) is set to 15 and
             <b>ServerAliveCountMax</b> is left at the default, if the server becomes unresponsive, ssh will dis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">connect&nbsp;disconnect</font>
             connect after approximately 45 seconds.  This option applies to protocol version 2 only.

     <b>ServerAliveInterval</b>
             Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the server,
             <a href="../man1/ssh.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ssh">ssh(1)</a> will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the server.
             The default is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the server.  This option
             applies to protocol version 2 only.

     <b>SmartcardDevice</b>
             Specifies which smartcard device to use.  The argument to this keyword is the device <a href="../man1/ssh.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ssh">ssh(1)</a>
             should use to communicate with a smartcard used for storing the user's private RSA key.  By
             default, no device is specified and smartcard support is not activated.

     <b>StrictHostKeyChecking</b>
             If this flag is set to ``yes'', <a href="../man1/ssh.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ssh">ssh(1)</a> will never automatically add host keys to the
             <u>~/.ssh/known</u><b>_</b><u>hosts</u> file, and refuses to connect to hosts whose host key has changed.  This pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">vides&nbsp;provides</font>
             vides maximum protection against trojan horse attacks, though it can be annoying when the
             <u>/etc/ssh</u><b>_</b><u>known</u><b>_</b><u>hosts</u> file is poorly maintained or when connections to new hosts are frequently
             made.  This option forces the user to manually add all new hosts.  If this flag is set to
             ``no'', ssh will automatically add new host keys to the user known hosts files.  If this flag
             is set to ``ask'', new host keys will be added to the user known host files only after the user
             has confirmed that is what they really want to do, and ssh will refuse to connect to hosts
             whose host key has changed.  The host keys of known hosts will be verified automatically in all
             cases.  The argument must be ``yes'', ``no'', or ``ask''.  The default is ``ask''.

     <b>TCPKeepAlive</b>
             Specifies whether the system should send TCP keepalive messages to the other side.  If they are
             sent, death of the connection or crash of one of the machines will be properly noticed.  How-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ever,&nbsp;However,</font>
             ever, this means that connections will die if the route is down temporarily, and some people
             find it annoying.

             The default is ``yes'' (to send TCP keepalive messages), and the client will notice if the net-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">work&nbsp;network</font>
             work goes down or the remote host dies.  This is important in scripts, and many users want it
             too.

             To disable TCP keepalive messages, the value should be set to ``no''.

     <b>Tunnel</b>  Request <!-- a -->tun(4)<!-- /a --> device forwarding between the client and the server.  The argument must be
             ``yes'', ``point-to-point'' (layer 3), ``ethernet'' (layer 2), or ``no''.  Specifying ``yes''
             requests the default tunnel mode, which is ``point-to-point''.  The default is ``no''.

     <b>TunnelDevice</b>
             Specifies the <!-- a -->tun(4)<!-- /a --> devices to open on the client (<u>local</u><b>_</b><u>tun</u>) and the server (<u>remote</u><b>_</b><u>tun</u>).

             The argument must be <u>local</u><b>_</b><u>tun</u>[:<u>remote</u><b>_</b><u>tun</u>].  The devices may be specified by numerical ID or
             the keyword ``any'', which uses the next available tunnel device.  If <u>remote</u><b>_</b><u>tun</u> is not speci-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fied,&nbsp;specified,</font>
             fied, it defaults to ``any''.  The default is ``any:any''.

     <b>UsePrivilegedPort</b>
             Specifies whether to use a privileged port for outgoing connections.  The argument must be
             ``yes'' or ``no''.  The default is ``no''.  If set to ``yes'', <a href="../man1/ssh.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ssh">ssh(1)</a> must be setuid root.
             Note that this option must be set to ``yes'' for <b>RhostsRSAAuthentication</b> with older servers.

     <b>User</b>    Specifies the user to log in as.  This can be useful when a different user name is used on dif-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ferent&nbsp;different</font>
             ferent machines.  This saves the trouble of having to remember to give the user name on the
             command line.

     <b>UserKnownHostsFile</b>
             Specifies a file to use for the user host key database instead of <u>~/.ssh/known</u><b>_</b><u>hosts</u>.

     <b>VerifyHostKeyDNS</b>
             Specifies whether to verify the remote key using DNS and SSHFP resource records.  If this
             option is set to ``yes'', the client will implicitly trust keys that match a secure fingerprint
             from DNS.  Insecure fingerprints will be handled as if this option was set to ``ask''.  If this
             option is set to ``ask'', information on fingerprint match will be displayed, but the user will
             still need to confirm new host keys according to the <b>StrictHostKeyChecking</b> option.  The argu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment&nbsp;argument</font>
             ment must be ``yes'', ``no'', or ``ask''.  The default is ``no''.  Note that this option
             applies to protocol version 2 only.

             See also <u>VERIFYING</u> <u>HOST</u> <u>KEYS</u> in <a href="../man1/ssh.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ssh">ssh(1)</a>.

     <b>XAuthLocation</b>
             Specifies the full pathname of the <!-- a -->xauth(1)<!-- /a --> program.  The default is <u>/usr/X11R6/bin/xauth</u>.

<b>PATTERNS</b>
     A <u>pattern</u> consists of zero or more non-whitespace characters, `*' (a wildcard that matches zero or more
     characters), or `?' (a wildcard that matches exactly one character).  For example, to specify a set of
     declarations for any host in the ``.co.uk'' set of domains, the following pattern could be used:

           Host *.co.uk

     The following pattern would match any host in the 192.168.0.[0-9] network range:

           Host 192.168.0.?

     A <u>pattern-list</u> is a comma-separated list of patterns.  Patterns within pattern-lists may be negated by
     preceding them with an exclamation mark (`!').  For example, to allow a key to be used from anywhere
     within an organisation except from the ``dialup'' pool, the following entry (in authorized_keys) could
     be used:

           from="!*.dialup.example.com,*.example.com"

<b>FILES</b>
     ~/.ssh/config
             This is the per-user configuration file.  The format of this file is described above.  This
             file is used by the SSH client.  Because of the potential for abuse, this file must have strict
             permissions: read/write for the user, and not accessible by others.

     /etc/ssh_config
             Systemwide configuration file.  This file provides defaults for those values that are not spec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ified&nbsp;specified</font>
             ified in the user's configuration file, and for those users who do not have a configuration
             file.  This file must be world-readable.
