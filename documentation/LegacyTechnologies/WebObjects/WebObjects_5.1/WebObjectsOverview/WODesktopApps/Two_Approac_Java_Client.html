They only differ at the user interfacelevel.</p><p>Think of the relationship this way: a Java Client applicationis a completely customized Direct to Java Client application. Whereasthe user interface in Direct to Java Client applications is generateddynamically at run time, the user interface in Java Client applicationsis built by hand.</p><p>If you need the precise user interface customization thatthe non-direct approach allows, it's much easier to integratea custom interface file in a Direct to Java Client application thanto develop a completely custom Java Client application (though thisis possible and supported). That way, you get the best of both worlds:the advantages of Direct to Java Client and the advantages of custominterfaces built with the non-direct approach.</p><p>The primary advantage of Direct to Java Client is that itsnot necessary to write source code to generate or manage an application'suser interface. This allows you to focus on writing business logicinstead. Although the direct approach lets you manage user interfaces withoutwriting much source code, the approach offers a number of mechanismsto customize user interfaces:</p><ul><li>Java ClientAssistant</font></li><li>Rule Editor</font></li><li>freezing XML</font></li><li>freezing <code>.nib</code> files</font></li><li>using custom controller classes</font></li><li>using factory delegates</font></li></ul><p>The user interfaces for the two approaches to Java Clientdevelopment each have a particular character. However, keep in mindthat it's possible to customize each type of interface to looklike the other.</p><br><a name = "TPXREF118"></a><p><b><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">Figure6-2 A typical Java Client application</font></b></p> <img src = "../Art/javaclientapp.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/javaclientapp.gif]"><br><a name = "TPXREF119"></a><p><b><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">Figure6-3 A typical Direct to Java Client application</font></b></p> <img src = "../Art/queryonall.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/queryonall.gif]"><br>    <br><a href="When_To_Cho_Java_Client.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/previous.gif" border="0"></a><a href="Choosing_an_Approach.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/next.gif" border="0"></a>&nbsp;<br><br><p><hr><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">&#169; 2002 Apple Computer, Inc.
