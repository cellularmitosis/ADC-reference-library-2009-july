I lifted this…// whole library from one of my games and chopped it down for purposes of Glypha.// The original game treated "external" and "cockpit" sounds as seperate channels…// (such that cockpit sounds could only "override" other cockpit sounds and…// external sounds could only override other external sounds.// In any event, this is the primary function called from throughout Glypha.// This function is called with a sound ID and a priority (just some number) and…// the function then determines if one of the two sound channels is free to play…// the sound.  It determines this by way of priorities.  If a sound channel is…// idle and playing no sound, its channel priority is 0.  Since the priority of…// the sound you want to play is assumed to be greater than 0, it will, without…// a doubt, be allowed to play on an idle channel.  If however there is already…// a sound playing (the channel's priority is not equal to 0), the sound with the…// largest priority wins.  Mind you though that there are two channels to choose…// between.  Therefore, the function compares the priority passed in with the…// sound channel with the lowest priority.void PlayExternalSound (short soundID, short priority){							// A little error-checking.	if ((soundID >= 0) && (soundID < kMaxSounds))	{		if (soundOn)		// More error-checking.		{					// Find channel with lowest priority.			if (externalPriority < externalPriority2)			{				// Compare priority with that of channel 1.				if (priority >= externalPriority)					PlaySound1(soundID, priority);			}			else			{				// Compare priority with that of channel 2.				if (priority >= externalPriority2)					PlaySound2(soundID, priority);			}		}	}}//--------------------------------------------------------  ExternalCallBack// Callback routine.  If this looks ugly, blame Apple's Universal Headers.// The callback routine is called after a sound finishes playing.  The…// callback routine is extremely useful in that it enables us to know when…// to set the sound channels priority back to 0 (meaning no sound playing).// Keep in mind (by the way) that this funciton is called at interrupt time…// and thus may not cause memory to be moved.  Also, note that also because…// of the interupt situation, we need to handle setting A5 to point to our…// app's A5 and then set it back again.#if GENERATINGCFMRoutineDescriptor ExternalCallBackRD = 		BUILD_ROUTINE_DESCRIPTOR(uppSndCallBackProcInfo, ExternalCallBack);#endifpascal void ExternalCallBack (SndChannelPtr theChannel, SndCommand *theCommand){#if !GENERATINGCFM	long		thisA5, gameA5;#endif		if (theCommand->param1 == kSoundDone)	// See if it's OUR callback.	{#if !GENERATINGCFM		gameA5 = theCommand->param2;			// Extract our A5 from sound command.		thisA5 = SetA5(gameA5);				// Point A5 to our app (save off current A5).#endif				externalPriority = 0;				// Set global to reflect no sound playing.		#if !GENERATINGCFM		thisA5 = SetA5(thisA5);				// Restire A5.#endif	}}//--------------------------------------------------------  ExternalCallBack2// This function is identical to the above function but handles sound channel 2.#if GENERATINGCFMRoutineDescriptor ExternalCallBackRD2 = 		BUILD_ROUTINE_DESCRIPTOR(uppSndCallBackProcInfo, ExternalCallBack2);#endifpascal void ExternalCallBack2 (SndChannelPtr theChannel, SndCommand *theCommand){#if !GENERATINGCFM	long		thisA5, gameA5;#endif		if (theCommand->param1 == kSoundDone2)	// See if it's OUR callback.	{#if !GENERATINGCFM		gameA5 = theCommand->param2;			// Extract our A5 from sound command.		thisA5 = SetA5(gameA5);				// Point A5 to our app (save off current A5).#endif				externalPriority2 = 0;				// Set global to reflect no sound playing.		#if !GENERATINGCFM		thisA5 = SetA5(thisA5);				// Restire A5.#endif	}}//--------------------------------------------------------  LoadBufferSounds// This function loads up all the sounds we'll need in the game and then…// strips off their header so that we can pass them as buffer commands.// Sounds are stored in our resource fork as 'snd ' resources.
