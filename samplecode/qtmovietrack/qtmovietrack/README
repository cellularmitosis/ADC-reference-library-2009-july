README - QTMovieTrackThe QTMovieTrack sample code shows how to create movie tracks, which are a new addition in QuickTime 4.1. A movie track essentially allows you to embed one movie within another movie. The embedded movie and the containing movie can have different time bases, which means (among other things) that they can play at different rates and have different looping properties. QTMovieTrack allows you to embed a movie (specified either using a URL or an alias) within another movie. The important code is found in the file QTMovieTrack.c.Enjoy, QuickTime Team
