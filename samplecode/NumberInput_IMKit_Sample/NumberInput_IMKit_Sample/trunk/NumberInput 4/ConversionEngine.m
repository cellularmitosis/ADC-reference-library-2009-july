	Important:  The pre-Mac OS X v10.4 methods of NSNumberFormatter are not compatible with the methods added for Mac OS X v10.4. An NSNumberFormatter object should not invoke methods in these different behavior groups indiscriminately. Use the old-style methods if you have configured the number-formatter behavior to be NSNumberFormatterBehavior10_0. Use the new methods instead of the older-style ones if you have configured the number-formatter behavior to be NSNumberFormatterBehavior10_4.
	Note also that number formatters created in Interface Builder use the Mac OS X v10.0 behaviorâ€”see NSNumberFormatter on Mac OS X v10.4.
