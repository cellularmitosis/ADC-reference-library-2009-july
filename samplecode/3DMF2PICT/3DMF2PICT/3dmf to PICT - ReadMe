ð QuickDraw 3D Ð 3DMF to PICTShows how to use a pixmap draw context, in this case to make a pict from a metafile.  The pict is created when you close the window.  We image the 3DMF data from a metafile into a pixmap draw context, and creat the PICT file from that when we close the window.Nick ThompsonDeveloper Support (DEVSUPPORT)AppleLink: NICKT
