in a Project</h1><p>Being able to find information&#8212;both knowing
how to leverage the user interface to locate items in a project,
as well as knowing how to find information about your project&#8212;is
critical to working effectively in Xcode. </p>
<p>The Xcode user interface gives you many different ways to
location project information and items. <span class="content_text"><a href="../pr_project_window/pr_project_window.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-BCIFDFFB">“The Project Window”</a></span> describes
the common paradigms of the Xcode user interface that let you find
and manage project contents, including the Groups &amp; Files list, which
lets you organize and access the items in your project in an outline
view, and the detail view, which lets you quickly filter your project
contents. In addition, the Activity Viewer window lets you see additional
information on Xcode operations, while the Info and inspector windows
let you examine and modify items in your project.</p>
<p>Xcode also maintains a great deal of information about your
project&#8217;s contents, which it uses to assist you in the development
process. The Xcode feature called Code Sense maintains an index
that contains symbolic information for your project; Xcode uses
this information as the basis for a number of features that let
you browse the symbols in your project, view the class hierarchy
of projects that use an object-oriented programming language, and
search your project for symbol definitions.</p>
<p>As you are working on your software product, you often need
to find information on system technologies. Xcode also includes
a full-featured documentation viewer and installs a comprehensive
suite of technical documentation. Using Xcode&#8217;s documentation lookup
features, you can quickly and easily search all or part of Apple&#8217;s
technical documentation for questions, keywords, or symbols.</p>
<p>This chapter describes how to use Xcode to find information
about your project&#8217;s contents and about Apple technologies. It
covers:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Searching
your project for text, symbols, or using regular expressions. </p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Using the Project Symbols smart group to find information
on the symbols in your project.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Viewing classes and class members for projects that include
object-oriented code, using the class browser.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Using the documentation window to browse Apple&#8217;s technical
documentation and search the Reference Library for keywords or symbols.</p></li></ul>

<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-BABFCHDJ" title="Searching in a Project"></a><h2>Searching in a Project</h2>
<p>Xcode provides a number of ways to search for information
in your project. You can search for text, regular expressions, or
symbol definitions in a single file or across multiple files in
your project. You can also easily substitute replacement text for
one or more instances of matching text or symbols, either within
a file or throughout the entire project.</p>
<p>This section describes how to use Xcode&#8217;s project-wide search
features to search through multiple files in your project and its
included frameworks for text, regular expressions, and symbol definitions.
This section also describes how to view search results. The single-file find
is discussed further in <span class="content_text"><a href="../ed_editor_window/ed_editor_window.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000831-BABDCGII">“Searching in a Single File.”</a></span>
In addition, shortcuts for performing searches from an Xcode editor
window are described in <span class="content_text"><a href="../ed_editor_window/ed_editor_window.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000831-TPXREF101">“Shortcuts for Finding Text and Symbol Definitions From an Editor Window.”</a></span></p>
<p>For more information on Code Sense, the technology that provides
symbol definition searches, see <span class="content_text"><a href="pr_navigate.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-BBCJICFB">“Code Sense.”</a></span> </p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-CJBFBGGJ" title="The Project Find Window"></a><h3>The Project Find Window</h3>
<p>The Project Find window allows you to search for information
in some or all of the files included in your project. Using the Project Find
window, you can search your project for text, symbol definitions,
or regular expressions. To open the Project Find window, choose Find
&gt; Find In Project. A window similar to the following appears.</p>
<div class="notebox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-DontLinkElementID_349" title="Note"></a><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp; In
the All-In-One project window layout, choosing Find &gt; Find In
Project opens the Project Find pane in the project page. The Project
Find pane contains the same information as the Project Find window
shown here.</p></div>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-DontLinkElementID_350" title="Figure 8-1The find window"></a><p><strong>Figure 8-1&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The
find window</p><img src = "../Art/findpane.gif" alt = "" width="692" height="426"></div><br/>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-CJBIJJFB" title="Choosing What to Search For"></a><h3>Choosing What to Search For</h3>
<p>Using the fields and menus at the top of the Project Find
window, you can control what Xcode searches for. </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><p>The Find
field specifies what to find. Xcode interprets this field differently,
depending on the value of the pop-up menu to the right of the Replace
field. </p></li>
<li class="li"><p>The pop-up menu to the right of the Replace field specifies
the type of search; it contains the following options:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Textual finds any
text that matches the text in the Find field.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Regular Expression finds any text that matches the regular
expression in the Find field.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Definitions finds any symbol definition matching the symbol
name in the Find field.</p></li></ul></li>
<li class="li"><p>The pop-up menu to the right of the Display Results in Find
Smart Group option controls how Xcode determines a match to the
contents of the Find field. The available options are:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Contains. Choose this
option to find text or symbol definitions that contain what is in
the Find field.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Starts with. Choose this option to find text or symbol definitions
that begin with the contents of the Find field.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Whole words. Choose this option to find text or symbol definitions
that contain only what is in the Find field.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Ends with. Choose this option to find text or symbol definitions
that end with the contents of the Find field.</p></li></ul></li>
<li class="li"><p>The &#8220;Ignore case&#8221; option specifies whether or not the
search is case sensitive.</p></li></ol>
<p>As a shortcut, you can also perform a quick search of selected
text or regular expressions in an editor window, as described in <span class="content_text"><a href="../ed_editor_window/ed_editor_window.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000831-TPXREF101">“Shortcuts for Finding Text and Symbol Definitions From an Editor Window.”</a></span></p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-CJBHEEJJ" title="Specifying Which Files to Search"></a><h3>Specifying Which Files to Search</h3>
<p>To control the scope of a search, use the pop-up menu to the
right of the Find field in the Project Find window. This menu contains
sets of search options that specify which projects and frameworks
to search in. Xcode provides the following default sets of search
options:</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>In Project.
Choose this option to search the files that are directly included
in your project.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>In Project and Frameworks. Choose this option to search both
the files and the frameworks included in your project.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>In Frameworks. Choose this option to search files that are
in the frameworks included by your project.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>In All Open Files. Choose this option to search all open files.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>In Selected Project Items. Choose this option to search only
in the currently selected project items.</p></li></ul>
<p>You can further tailor these default sets of search options
or define your own sets with the Batch Find Options window, described
in <span class="content_text"><a href="pr_navigate.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-BABDIJCC">“Creating Sets of Search Options.”</a></span></p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-CJBJIHCB" title="Viewing Search Results"></a><h3>Viewing Search Results</h3>
<p>When you perform a project-wide find, the results of the search
are collected in the find results pane of the Project Find window;
results are organized according to the file in which they appear,
as shown in the figure below. You can view a particular search result by
selecting it in the Project Find window; Xcode opens the file to
the matching text and displays it in the attached editor. Double-click
a search result to open it in a separate editor window.</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-DontLinkElementID_351" title="Figure 8-2Find Results in the project find window"></a><p><strong>Figure 8-2&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Find
Results in the project find window</p><img src = "../Art/extendedfindresults.gif" alt = "" width="691" height="427"></div><br/>
<p>Each search, and its results, is also collected in the Find
Results smart group that appears in the Groups &amp; Files list
of the project window. If you select the Display Results in Find Smart
Group option, Xcode automatically brings the project window to the
front and discloses the contents of the Find Results smart group
when you perform a search, instead of showing the results in the
Project Find window. </p>
<p>You can see all the searches you have performed by clicking
the disclosure triangle next to the Find Results smart group in
the Groups &amp; Files list. To view the results of a given search,
select that search in the Groups &amp; Files list and, if necessary,
open a detail view. The detail view shows all of the results for
the selected search, as shown below. You can view the combined results
of several searches by selecting those searches in the Groups &amp;
Files list. Double-clicking an item in the Find Results group in
the Groups &amp; Files list opens a Project Find window with the
corresponding search specification as well as a detailed find results
list. This allows you to rerun previous searches. </p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-DontLinkElementID_352" title="Figure 8-3Search results in the project window"></a><p><strong>Figure 8-3&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Search
results in the project window</p><img src = "../Art/findresults.gif" alt = "" width="738" height="447"></div><br/>
<p>The detail view shows the context for each search result and
the file in which the match occurs. The context of a search result
is the surrounding text in which it appears for text searches, and
the type and name of the matching symbol for a symbol definition
search. To show or hide either of these two columns, use the View
&gt; Detail View Columns menu items or Control-click in any column
header and choose the desired column from the contextual menu. </p>
<p>To view the source for a particular result, select the result
in the detail view. If the project window or detail view has an
attached editor, selecting a search result displays the source in
the editor. You can double-click a search result to open the source
for the result in a separate window.</p>
<p>You can sort the results of a search according to the file
in which they occur. Click the Location column heading to sort the
detail view by location. You can also filter the search results
using the Search field in the project window toolbar. Using the
location of the search result as an example again, you can type
all or part of a filename to see only those results that occur in
the file of that name.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-BABDIJCC" title="Creating Sets of Search Options"></a><h3>Creating Sets of Search Options</h3>
<p>The Batch Find Options window lets you modify Xcode&#8217;s default
sets of search options, or define your own sets. This is particularly
useful if you find yourself searching the same set of files over
and over again. Instead of configuring the set of files to search
each time, simply configure it once and save it as a search option
set. To reuse the search option set, simply select it from the pop-up
menu next to the Find button in the Project Find window. </p>
<p>To open the Batch Find Options window, click the Options button
in the Project Find window. You should see a window similar to the
following:</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-DontLinkElementID_353" title="Figure 8-4The Batch Find Options window"></a><p><strong>Figure 8-4&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The
Batch Find Options window</p><img src = "../Art/batchfindoptions.gif" alt = "" width="549" height="452"></div><br/>
<p>The Find Sets menu at the top of the Batch Find Options windows
lists the available search option sets. To create a new set, click
Add. Specify a name for the new set in the dialog that appears.
Xcode creates a new set of search options with default values. To
delete a set of search options, choose that set from the Find Sets
menu and click Delete.</p>
<p>To edit a search option set, choose that set from the Find
Sets menu and set the search options you wish to include. The Batch
Find Options window provides the following options to control which
files Xcode searches:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><p>&#8220;Search
in open documents&#8221; includes all files that are open in an editor
in the search.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>&#8220;Search in open projects&#8221; includes open projects in the
search. You can further control which files in those projects are
searched using the radio buttons below the &#8220;Search in open projects&#8221;
option. </p><p>The top set of radio buttons controls which projects
are searched:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>&#8220;Selected files
in this project&#8221; searches the selected files in the current project.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>&#8220;All files in this project&#8221; searches all files in the
current project.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>&#8220;All open projects&#8221; searches all files in all open projects.</p></li></ul><p>The
bottom set of radio buttons lets you specify whether to include
project or framework files in the search:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>&#8220;Project files and
frameworks&#8221; searches both the project&#8217;s files and the files
of any frameworks included in the project.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>&#8220;Project files only&#8221; confines the search to project files.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>&#8220;Frameworks only&#8221; confines the search to the frameworks
included in the project.</p></li></ul></li>
<li class="li"><p>&#8220;Search in files and folders&#8221; allows you to add specific
files or directories to the search. Any files or directories listed
in the table below this option are included in the search. To add
an entry to this table, click the plus (+) button and choose a file
or directory from the dialog that appears; or drag the file or directory
from the Finder. You can also click in the table and press Return. To
delete a file or directory from this table, select the entry and
click the minus (-) button.</p></li></ol>
<p>You can further restrict the files that are searched by a
search option set using the radio buttons on the right side of the
Batch Find Options window, next to the &#8220;Search in open documents&#8221;
and &#8220;Search in open projects&#8221; options. You have the following
options:</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>&#8220;All candidate
files&#8221; does not limit the searched files further. This searches
all of the files in the search scope specified by the other options
in the Batch Find Options window.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>&#8220;Source files only&#8221; limits the search to files containing
source code.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>&#8220;Filter files using regex patterns&#8221; lets you filter the
files to search using one or more regular expressions. These regular
expressions are specified in the table beneath this radio button.
To add an expression to this list, click the plus (+) button.</p><p>Use
the first column in this table to specify whether Xcode returns
only those files that match a given regular expression or returns
only files that do not match the regular expression. If this column
is blank, Xcode does not use the regular expression. This column
is blank by default for all regular expressions that you add; click
in the column next to the regular expression to choose a different
value.</p></li></ul>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-DontLinkElementID_202" title="Replacing Text in Multiple Files"></a><h3>Replacing Text in Multiple
Files</h3>
<p>You can use the Project Find window to replace some or all
occurrences of the search string specified in the Find field. To
replace text in multiple files:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><p>Type the
substitution text in the Replace field</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Select one or more entries to replace. To choose which occurrences
of the given search string to replace, do either of the following:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Select one or more
entries to replace in the find results pane of the Project Find window.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Choose a search from the Find Results smart group in the project
window. In the detail view, select one or more occurrences of the
search string to replace.</p></li></ul></li>
<li class="li"><p>Click the Replace button in the Project Find window.</p></li></ol>
<p>If the contents of the Project Find window&#8217;s find results
pane are disclosed, Xcode uses the selection in the Project Find
window to determine which occurrences to replace. If the find results
group is closed, Xcode uses the selection in the detail view of
the project window.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-DontLinkElementID_203" title="Viewing Project Symbols and Classes"></a><h2>Viewing Project Symbols and
Classes</h2>
<p>Xcode includes a technology, called Code Sense, that maintains
detailed information about the symbols in and utilized by your project
to assist you in the development process. Code Sense uses the information
in this symbol index, allowing you to browse the symbols and classes
in your project, and perform symbol definition searches. It also
uses this information to provide completion suggestions when editing
source code, as described in <span class="content_text"><a href="../ed_code_completion/ed_code_completion.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH256-CHDBJJFF">“Code Completion.”</a></span> </p>
<p>This section introduces Code Sense and discusses two of the
features that it enables: the Project Symbols smart group and the
class browser. In this chapter you will learn how you can use the
Project Symbols smart group to view symbols and how you can take
advantage of the class browser to find information on the classes
defined in your project and its included frameworks. The other features
provided by Code Sense are described in other parts of this document.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-BBCJICFB" title="Code Sense"></a><h3>Code Sense</h3>
<p>Code Sense makes it simple to find and view information about
your code and to gain easy access to project symbols. Code Sense
maintains detailed information about the code in your project and
in libraries used by your project; this information is stored in
a project index. Using this project index, Code Sense provides support
for features such as the following: </p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Code completion.
Code completion, described in <span class="content_text"><a href="../ed_code_completion/ed_code_completion.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH256-CHDBJJFF">“Code Completion,”</a></span> assists
you in writing code by providing API suggestions from within the
editor. Code completion uses the stored information about the symbols,
as well as the contextual information from your source code, to
offer a list of classes, methods, functions, or other appropriate
symbols for the code you are working on.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Class browser. Using the class browser, you can view the classes
in your project and its included frameworks. From the class browser,
you can easily access declarations, source code, and documentation
for these classes and their members. The class browser is discussed
in the section <span class="content_text"><a href="pr_navigate.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-CJBGADAB">“Viewing Your Class Hierarchy.”</a></span></p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Project Symbol smart group. The Project Symbol smart group
allows you to view all of the symbols in your project directly in
the project window. You can search these symbols or sort them according
to type or name to quickly find the symbols you need. The Project
Symbols smart group also gives you easy access to a symbol&#8217;s definition. The
Project Symbols smart group is described in <span class="content_text"><a href="pr_navigate.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-CJBJCHJD">“Viewing the Symbols in Your Project.”</a></span></p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Searching. Xcode offers numerous ways to search for symbols
and other information in your project. For instance, you can perform
a project-wide search for symbol definitions, or you can select
an identifier in an editor window and jump to its definition. These
and other search features are described in <span class="content_text"><a href="pr_navigate.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-BABFCHDJ">“Searching in a Project.”</a></span></p></li></ul>
<p>The project index used by Code Sense is created the first
time you open a project. Thereafter, the index is updated in the
background as you make changes to your project. Indexing occurs
on a background thread, to keep it from interfering with other operations in
Xcode. The index can be completely rebuilt, if necessary, by opening
the General pane in the project inspector and clicking the Rebuild
Code Sense Index button.</p>
<p>Indexing is enabled by default. You can disable indexing for
all projects that you open. To do so, choose Xcode &gt; Preferences,
click Code Sense, and deselect the &#8220;Enable for all projects&#8221;
checkbox in the Indexing section.</p>
<p>Note that if you turn off indexing, you will be unable to
use those features that rely on the project index, such as code
completion, the class browser, and the other features mentioned
in this section. You can specify whether Xcode includes a particular
file in the project index using the &#8220;Include in index&#8221; checkbox
in the file inspector, described in <span class="content_text"><a href="../ed_file_attr/ed_file_attr.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH255-BABICEHI">“Inspecting File, Folder, and Framework References.”</a></span></p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-CJBJCHJD" title="Viewing the Symbols in Your Project"></a><h3>Viewing the Symbols in Your
Project</h3>
<p>The Project Symbols smart group, one of the built-in smart
groups provided by Xcode, allows you to view all of the symbols
defined in your project. You can sort symbols by type, name, file,
and file path, and you can search for symbols that match a string. To
see the symbols defined in your project, select the Project Symbols
smart group in the Groups &amp; Files list. The detail view displays
the symbols in your project. Here is what you see when you select
the Project Symbols group for a project:</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-DontLinkElementID_354" title="Figure 8-5Viewing symbols in your project"></a><p><strong>Figure 8-5&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Viewing
symbols in your project</p><img src = "../Art/symbolgroup.gif" alt = "" width="724" height="446"></div><br/>
<p>The detail view shows the following information for each symbol:</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>An icon indicating
the symbol type, such as structure, function, method, and so on. The
icon is a visual cue that allows you to glance at a group of symbols
and easily discern the type. The letter in the icon reflects the
symbol type; for example, &#8220;M&#8221; for method, or &#8220;V&#8221; for variable.
The color of the icon indicates the relative grouping of the symbols.
For instance, purple icons indicate top-level elements such as Classes
or Categories while orange icons represent basic types like structures,
unions, typedefs and others.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>The symbol name.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>The symbol type. While the symbol type icon provides a handy
visual cue as to the symbol type, the Kind column states the type
explicitly.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>The file containing the symbol definition or declaration,
and the line number at which the symbol appears.</p></li></ul>
<p>To sort the symbols listed in the project window according
to any of these categories, simply click the appropriate category
heading. In addition, you can use the Search field in the project
window toolbar to narrow the list of symbols to those matching a
string or keyword. You can search the contents of any one of the
categories&#8212;symbol name, symbol kind, or location&#8212;or you can
search them all. In the PathDemo project, for example, you can search
for all symbols declared in files pertaining to views by selecting
&#8220;Search By Location&#8221; from the pop-up menu in the search field
and typing &#8220;view.&#8221; The symbols listed in the detail view are
narrowed to include only those symbols defined in files whose names contain
the word &#8220;view,&#8221; as shown in the following figure. By default,
the search field searches the content of all categories in the detail
view.</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-DontLinkElementID_355" title="Figure 8-6Filtering the symbols in a project"></a><p><strong>Figure 8-6&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Filtering
the symbols in a project</p><img src = "../Art/filtersymbols.gif" alt = "" width="724" height="446"></div><br/>
<p>You can configure which information is displayed in the detail
view, as described in <span class="content_text"><a href="../pr_project_window/pr_project_window.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-BCIJFHCB">“The Detail View.”</a></span></p>
<p>To view the symbol definition, select the symbol in the detail
view. If you have an editor open in the project window or detail
view, the symbol definition appears there. If you prefer a separate
editor window, double-click the symbol to open the file containing
the symbol definition in a separate editor.</p>
<p>If you Control-click a symbol in the detail view, Xcode displays
a menu that contains a number of useful commands. The commands available
to you are: </p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Reveal in
Class Browser. If the selected symbol can be displayed in a class
browser&#8212;for example, a class or a method&#8212;choosing this menu
item opens the class browser window and selects the symbol in the
browser. You can also reveal the selected symbol by choosing View
&gt; Reveal in Class Browser.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Find Symbol Name in Project. When you choose this item, Xcode
searches your project for the selected symbol name. It performs
a textual search, just as if you had typed the symbol name into
the Project Find window and selected &#8220;Textual&#8221; from the search
type menu. The results of the search are displayed in the Find Results
smart group.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Copy Declaration for Method/Function. This command copies
the declaration for the selected symbol to the pasteboard; you can
then paste this declaration into any text field or editor using
Command-V. This command only works for functions and methods.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Copy Invocation for Method/Function. This command copies the
invocation string for the selected symbol to the pasteboard, which
you can then paste into any text field or editor. The invocation
string is the same string that is inserted into your code when you select
a code completion option. This command works only for functions
and methods.</p></li></ul>
<p>You can also reveal the file in which the selected symbol
is defined in the Groups &amp; Files list by choosing View &gt;
Reveal in Group Tree.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-CJBGADAB" title="Viewing Your Class Hierarchy"></a><h3>Viewing Your Class Hierarchy</h3>
<p>If you are programming in an object-oriented language, you
can view the class hierarchy of your project using the Xcode class
browser. To open the class browser, choose Project &gt; Class Browser.
You can also open the class browser by selecting a symbol in the
Project Symbols smart group and choosing View &gt; Reveal in Class
Browser. The following figure shows the class browser for a sample
Cocoa application.</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-DontLinkElementID_356" title="Figure 8-7The Class Browser window"></a><p><strong>Figure 8-7&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The
Class Browser window</p><img src = "../Art/classbrowser.gif" alt = "" width="723" height="452"></div><br/>
<p>Classes and other top-level symbols&#8212;protocols, interfaces,
and categories&#8212;are listed in the Class pane on the left side of
the Class Browser window. When you select a class from this list, Xcode displays
the members of that class in the table to the right of the Class pane. When
you select a member name from this table, the declaration of that
member item is displayed in the editor pane below. To see the item&#8217;s
definition, Option-click its name.</p>
<p>If the class browser does not list any classes, your project
may not be indexed. To rebuild the index, select your project and
open the inspector. Open the General pane and click Rebuild Code
Sense Index.</p>
<p>A book icon beside a class or member&#8217;s name indicates that
documentation is available for that member. You can view this documentation
by clicking the book icon.</p>
<p>The class browser uses fonts to distinguish between different
types of classes and class members: </p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Classes defined
in your project&#8217;s source code are in blue. Classes defined in
a framework are in black.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Members defined in the class are black. Inherited members
are gray.</p></li></ul>
<p>The Option Set pop-up menu and Configure Options button in
the toolbar of the class browser window control which classes and
class members are displayed in the browser. The New Class Browser
button allows you to open additional class browser windows.</p>
<p>To see the file that a class or member in your project is
declared in, select the class or member in the class browser and
choose View &gt; Reveal in Group Tree. This option is also available
in the contextual menu for classes and class members. Xcode reveals
the file in the Groups &amp; Files list in the project window. </p>
<p>You can bookmark a class or class member by selecting it in
the class browser and choosing Find &gt; Add to Bookmarks or by
choosing Add to Bookmarks from the contextual menu. Xcode creates
a bookmark to the class or member&#8217;s definition.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-TPXREF106" title="Choosing What the Class Browser Displays"></a><h4>Choosing What the Class Browser
Displays</h4>
<p>You choose which information Xcode displays in the class browser
using the Option Set pop-up menu at the top of the browser window.
This menu lets you switch between sets of display options. Xcode provides
a few sets of predefined display options that allow you to choose:</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Whether to
view all classes included in your project, or just those defined
in your project</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Whether to view classes as a flat list or a hierarchical list</p></li></ul>
<p>When you view classes as a hierarchical list, you can see
the subclasses of a class by clicking the disclosure triangle next
to that class.</p>
<p>To create your own set of display options or to make changes
to an existing set, click the &#8220;Configure options&#8221; button. Xcode displays
a dialog that lets you further refine which information is displayed
in the class browser. The Class List Display Settings group, on
the left half of the dialog, controls what is displayed in the Class list.
The Member List Display Settings group, on the right, controls what
is displayed in the members list.</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-DontLinkElementID_357" title="Figure 8-8The class browser options dialog"></a><p><strong>Figure 8-8&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The
class browser options dialog</p><img src = "../Art/configclassbrowsercropped.gif" alt = "" width="506" height="280"></div><br/>
<p>To choose how to display classes, use the radio buttons under
Class List Display Settings:</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Choose Hierarchical
Outline to view a hierarchical list of classes, where subclasses
are listed under their superclasses. </p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Choose Flat List to view an alphabetical list of classes,
where all classes are at the same level and sorted alphabetically.</p></li></ul>
<p>The pop-up menus under the Class List Display Settings options
let you choose which items the class browser displays in the Class
list. The first pop-up menu determines which classes the class browser
shows:</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Show Project
Entries Only. Shows only those classes defined in your project.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Show Framework Entries Only. Shows only those classes defined
in the frameworks that your project includes.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Show Project &amp; Framework Entries. Shows all of the classes
defined in your project and in the frameworks that your project
includes.</p></li></ul>
<p>The second pop-up menu determines whether to show only classes,
only protocols and interfaces, or classes, protocols and interfaces.</p>
<p>If you are programming in Objective-C, the Show Obj-C Categories
menu lets you choose how Xcode displays Objective-C categories in
the Class list:</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>As Subclasses.
The class browser lists categories under the classes that they extend.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>As Subclasses for Root Classes. The class browser lists categories
under the root class of the classes that they extend.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Always Merged into Class. The class browser lists all members
of a class and any categories that extend that class together. The
category does not appear as a separate entry in the Class list.</p></li></ul>
<p>The Member List Display Settings let you control which items
are included in the class members table in the class browser. You
can choose the following:</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Whether to
display members inherited from the class&#8217;s superclass. To display inherited
members, select the Show Inherited Members option.</p><p> The inherited
members that the class browser shows are limited by the scope of
the selection in the first pop-up menu under Class List Display
Settings. For example, if you have Show Project Entries Only selected,
the class browser displays only inherited members from inherited
classes in the project. To see all inherited members from all classes,
choose Show Project &amp; Framework Entries from the first pop-up
menu in the Class List Display Settings group.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Whether to display only methods, only data members, or both
methods and data members, using the first pop-up menu in the section. </p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Whether to display only instance members, only class members,
or both instance and class members, using the second pop-up menu
in the section.</p></li></ul>

<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-BABJDEAI" title="Viewing Documentation"></a><h2>Viewing Documentation</h2>
<p>Technical documentation is an important part of the software
development process. As you develop a Mac OS X software product
with Xcode, you&#8217;re likely to use documentation to learn about
the operating system and the technologies it supports, read about
system frameworks, and look up individual API definitions. </p>
<p>Xcode includes its own documentation window, which you can
use to view the technical documentation and other resources distributed
as part of the ADC Reference Library. Xcode&#8217;s documentation window
gives you several ways to find documentation: you can browse documentation
by title and category, search for symbol names, or perform a full-text
search for a word or phrase. In addition, Xcode gives you access
to the latest documentation available from Apple with downloadable
documentation updates.</p>
<p>This section describes the documentation window and the ADC
Reference Library content that is distributed with the Xcode Tools.
It shows you how to use the API lookup and full-text search features
to find Reference Library information, and how to obtain documentation
updates.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-DontLinkElementID_204" title="Using the ADC Reference Library"></a><h3>Using the ADC Reference Library</h3>
<p>Apple's ADC Reference Library is a complete collection of
technical resources for developers, including documentation, sample
code, release notes, technical notes, and technical Q&amp;As. Xcode
integrates this content into your development environment, letting you
browse or search the ADC Reference Library from the documentation
window.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-DontLinkElementID_205" title="Obtaining ADC Reference Library Content"></a><h4>Obtaining
ADC Reference Library Content</h4>
<p>The ADC Reference Library is available on Apple's developer
website and as part of the Xcode Tools installation. You can automatically
detect and download updates to the installed ADC Reference Library
content through Xcode's documentation update mechanism, described
in <span class="content_text"><a href="pr_navigate.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-BABFJGBG">“Obtaining Documentation Updates,”</a></span> or you can subscribe to the Developer Connection
mailing to receive the entire ADC Reference Library on DVD each
quarter. The Developer Connection mailing and Developer DVD Series
are described further on the <span class="content_text"><a href="http://developer.apple.com/membership/mailing.html" target="_top">ADC website</a></span>.</p>
<p>The Documentation package included with the Xcode Developer
Tools installs a subset of the ADC Reference Library content on
your local volume, at <code>/Developer/ADC Reference Library</code>. This
content includes:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><p>HTML versions
of technical documentation, release notes, and API reference.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Category pages that let you browse documents by subject.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Full-text and symbol indexes that let you search all ADC Reference
Library content.</p></li></ol>
<p>This core documentation installation does not include PDF,
sample code, technical notes, or technical Q&amp;As. However, you
can still access this content, referred to as &#8220;extended documentation,&#8221;
from Xcode. You can also find additional sample code, in the form
of sample Xcode projects, at <code>/Developer/Examples</code> on
your local volume.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-BABGIBGA" title="Extended Documentation Locations"></a><h4>Extended Documentation Locations</h4>
<p>When you click a documentation link or search result in the
Xcode documentation window, Xcode first looks for that content at <code>/Developer/ADC
Reference Library</code>. If it does not find the requested
content there, Xcode then looks at the extended documentation locations defined
in Xcode's documentation preferences. If Xcode cannot find the requested
content after checking the extended locations, it notifies you that
it was unable to locate the specified documentation.</p>
<p>Xcode's default extended documentation location points to
the full ADC Reference Library on Apple's developer website. You
can see where Xcode looks for additional documentation in Xcode's
preferences, in the Extended Locations table. You can also add your
own locations. For example, if you have the full ADC Reference Library
content on DVD, you can add a new location specifying that Xcode
look for additional content on that DVD volume.</p>
<p>To add an alternative location for locating extended documentation: </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><p>Open Xcode
Preferences by choosing Xcode &gt; Preferences or typing Command-comma.
Open the Documentation pane.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Under Extended Locations, click the '+' button. </p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Navigate to the volume or folder where the documentation is
located and select the ADC Reference Library folder.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Click Add or press Return to add the new location to the Extended
Locations table. Xcode adds the new documentation location to the
list and makes it active. Click Apply or OK to apply your changes.</p></li></ol>
<p>Xcode looks for content at the extended locations in the order
in which they appear in the table, looking at the top entry first.
You can change the order of a location by dragging its entry to
the appropriate spot in the table. For example, if you want Xcode
to look at the DVD copy of the ADC Reference Library before going
to the web, add the DVD as an extended location and drag that entry
to the top of the list.</p>
<p>If you don't want Xcode to look for documentation at a location
that appears in the Extended Locations table, you can either remove
the entry from the list or disable the location. To remove a location
from the list, select the entry for that location and click the '-'
button. To disable a location, deselect the checkbox in the On column
next to the location. You cannot remove the default Web location,
although you can disable it. </p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-DontLinkElementID_206" title="Browsing ADC Reference Library Content"></a><h3>Browsing ADC Reference Library
Content</h3>
<p>Xcode has its own built-in documentation viewer, shown below,
which allows you to find documentation quickly and easily. To open
the documentation window you can:</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Select an
item from the Help menu.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Option&#8211;double-click a symbol name in an editor.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Click a book icon next to a symbol name in the class browser.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Select text in an editor window and choose Help &gt; Find
Selected Text in API Reference or Help &gt; Find Selected Text in
Documentation.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Control-click the selected text in an editor window and choose
Find Selected Text in API Reference or Find Selected Text in Documentation
from the contextual menu.</p></li></ul>
<p>Reference Library content is organized by category; you can
see these categories in the Search Groups list in the documentation
window, shown in <span class="content_text">Figure 8-9</span>. Many of these categories have additional
subcategories, which you can see by clicking the turn-down arrow
next to the category name. When you select a category or subcategory
in the Search Groups list, Xcode displays its contents in the documentation
pane. Selecting the top-level Reference Library group, or a group
with additional subcategories, displays a navigation page such as
the one below that shows you the categories in this group with a
brief description. From there you can further narrow the subject
matter to look for specific documents. </p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-BABDBCEI" title="Figure 8-9The documentation window"></a><p><strong>Figure 8-9&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The documentation window</p>
<img src = "../Art/docviewer.gif" alt = "" width="811" height="628"></div><br/>
<p>When you perform a full-text or API reference search in Xcode,
Xcode searches only in documents in the currently selected group
and any groups it might contain. To search all of the ADC Reference
Library content, select the Reference Library group in the Search Groups
list.</p>
<p>If you prefer to have more than one document open and visible
at a time, the documentation window lets you open a document in
the documentation window, in a separate Xcode window, or in your
preferred browser. </p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>To open the
current document in a separate Xcode window, Control-click in the content
area of the document and choose Open Page in New Window or Open
Frame in New Window.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>To open the current document in your preferred browser, Control-click
in the content area of the document and choose Open Page in Browser.</p></li></ul>
<p>When following links that appear in the documentation, you
can choose to open those links in the documentation window, in a
separate editor window, or in your preferred browser. </p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>To open a
link in the documentation window, click the link.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>To open a link in a separate Xcode window, you can either
Control-click the link and choose Open Link in New Window from the
contextual menu or simply Command-click the link.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>To open a link in your preferred browser, Control-click the
link and choose Open Link in Browser or simply Option-click the
link.</p></li></ul>
<p>You can also copy a link or an image to the clipboard by Control-clicking
the link or image and choosing Copy Link from the contextual menu.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-BABEDBGE" title="Searching for Documentation"></a><h3>Searching for Documentation</h3>
<p>When you know the term you're looking for, searching is often
the fastest way to find documentation. Xcode's documentation window
supports two search modes:</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>API reference
search. This lets you quickly search the available reference documents for
a symbol name.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Full-text search. This lets you search the available documentation
for a word or phrase. Xcode's full-text search supports simple search
term matches, as well as more complex queries using Boolean operators
and wildcard searches.</p></li></ul>
<p>The current selection in the Search Groups list determines
the scope of both API-reference and full-text searches. For full-text
searches, the selection in the Search Groups list determines the
documentation set that Xcode searches. For example, if you search
for the term &#8220;button&#8221; with the Cocoa category selected in the
Search Groups list, Xcode returns only documents from the Cocoa
category that contain the word &#8220;button.&#8221; </p>
<p>For API-Reference searches, the selection in the Search Group
list determines the programming languages for which Xcode returns
results. To search all available documentation, select Reference
Library in the Search Groups list.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-DontLinkElementID_207" title="API Reference Search"></a><h4>API
Reference Search</h4>
<p>When you are writing code, you often need to find documentation
for a function, method, data type, or other symbol. Xcode's API
reference search lets you quickly find the information you need. </p>
<p>To perform an API reference search in Xcode's documentation
window, select API Search from the pull-down menu of the Search
field and begin typing the name of the symbol. Xcode's API lookup
supports type-ahead; as you type, the detail view displays all of
the symbols whose names start with the string in the Search field,
as shown in <span class="content_text">Figure 8-10</span>. As a shortcut, you can also Option&#8211;double-click
a symbol&#8217;s name in any Xcode editor window to open the documentation
for that symbol in the documentation window.</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-BABEACIB" title="Figure 8-10API search in the documentation viewer"></a><p><strong>Figure 8-10&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>API search in the documentation
viewer</p><img src = "../Art/apisearch.gif" alt = "" width="810" height="627"></div><br/>
<p>The current selection in the Search Group list determines
the programming languages for which Xcode returns results. For example,
if you select &#8220;Reference Library,&#8221; Xcode returns all matching
symbols, regardless of the type or language. If you select Carbon
in the Search Groups list and perform an API lookup, Xcode returns
only matching C and C++ symbols. </p>
<p>You can also specify additional language filters for Xcode's
API-reference search by clicking the Configure Options button in
the documentation window toolbar. In the dialog that Xcode displays,
choose which languages Xcode includes in API-reference searches.
To include a language in the API search, select the checkbox in
the On column next to that language. If you don't want Xcode to
return results for a particular language, deselect the checkbox
next to that language. These filters are applied to all API-reference
searches regardless of the current selection in the Search Groups
list. By default, all of the languages are enabled. Xcode supports
API lookup for C, C++, Java, and Objective-C.</p>
<p>To view the documentation associated with one of the symbols
returned in a search, select its name from the table. The documentation
is displayed in the pane below the table view.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-DontLinkElementID_208" title="Full-Text Search"></a><h4>Full-Text
Search</h4>
<p>Xcode's full-text search lets you search the installed documentation
for a word or phrase. You can enter a simple search term, such as
&#8220;button,&#8221; or create more advanced queries using Boolean operators
and wildcard characters. Xcode's full-text search uses Apple's Search
Kit technology, described in <em><a href="../../../../../../../UserExperience/Conceptual/SearchKitConcepts/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001071" target="_top">Search Kit Programming Guide</a></em></p>
<p>To perform a full-text search choose Full-Text Search from
the pull-down menu in the Search field of the documentation window.
Type your query and press Return. Xcode searches the installed documentation
for the given term or terms and displays the results in the documentation
window, as shown in <span class="content_text">Figure 8-11</span>. The table view
displays the relevance, location, page title, and document title
for each page returned by the search. To view a page returned as
a search result, select that page in the search results table. The scope
of the search is determined by the selection in the Search Groups
list.</p>

<p>By default, Xcode performs an exact-match search. That is,
when you enter a search term, Xcode returns only those documents
that contain the entire term. For example, searching for &#8220;button&#8221;
returns documents containing the word &#8220;button,&#8221; but not documents containing
only the word &#8220;buttons.&#8221; If you type a phrase, such as &#8220;bevel
button,&#8221; Xcode returns those documents that contain both the word &#8220;bevel&#8221;
and the word &#8220;button.&#8221;</p><div class="notebox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-DontLinkElementID_358" title="Note"></a><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp; You
can use a wildcard search, described in <span class="content_text"><a href="pr_navigate.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-BABECIAH">“Wildcard Search,”</a></span> to search
for variations on a term.</p></div>
<p>As a shortcut, you can also search the installed documentation
for text in an editor window. Select the text to search for and
choose Help &gt; Find Selected Text in Documentation. Xcode performs
a full-text search and returns all documents containing that text.</p>
<p>You can further refine your search by combining search terms
using Boolean operators, searching for required terms, or using
a wildcard search. The following sections describe the various queries
you can construct for searching the developer documentation. </p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-DontLinkElementID_209" title="Constructing Queries Using Boolean Operators "></a><h5>Constructing
Queries Using Boolean Operators </h5>
<p>If you wish to further restrict the parameters of your search,
you can combine search terms using Boolean operators. You can create
arbitrarily complex queries to narrow your search to fit your particular
criteria. </p><div class="notebox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-DontLinkElementID_359" title="Note"></a><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp; The
smallest unit at which search results are evaluated is a single
HTML file; in Apple's developer documentation, this typically corresponds
to a section in a chapter, a group of function descriptions, or
a class. If your query is too restrictive, you may not get any results
at all. </p></div>
<p>Xcode supports the following Boolean operators, listed in
order of precedence from highest to lowest:</p><div class="tableholder"><table class="graybox" border = "0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">

<tr>
<td  scope="row"><p><strong>()</strong></p></td>
<td ><p>logical grouping</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td  scope="row"><p><strong>!</strong></p></td>
<td ><p>NOT</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td  scope="row"><p><strong>&amp;</strong></p></td>
<td ><p>AND</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td  scope="row"><p><strong>|</strong></p></td>
<td ><p>OR</p></td>
</tr>

</table></div>
<p>For example, to find documents about the font panel in Mac
OS X, you want to find documents that contain the phrase &#8220;font
panel.&#8221; Just to be safe, you also want to catch any documents
that don't contain the exact phrase &#8220;font panel,&#8221; but do contain
both search terms &#8220;font&#8221; and &#8220;panel.&#8221; You can do that with
the following query:</p>
<p><code>&quot;font panel&quot; | (font &amp;
panel)</code></p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-DontLinkElementID_210" title="Required Terms Search"></a><h5>Required
Terms Search</h5>
<p>Simpler than a Boolean query, a required-terms search lets
you search for terms that must or must not appear in documents returned
as a search result. A required terms search uses the following operators:</p>
<div class="tableholder"><table class="graybox" border = "0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">

<tr>
<td  scope="row"><p><strong>+</strong></p></td>
<td ><p>Indicates a term that must appear in any document returned</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td  scope="row"><p><strong>-</strong></p></td>
<td ><p>Indicates a term that must NOT appear in any document returned</p></td>
</tr>

</table></div>
<p>For example, entering <code>+window</code> returns
all documents containing the word &#8220;window,&#8221; similar to the behavior
you get by simply entering &#8220;window&#8221; as a search term. However, if
you enter <code>+window -dialog</code>,
you will get all documents containing the word &#8220;window,&#8221; but NOT
the word &#8220;dialog.&#8221;</p>
<p>Using Boolean operators to construct the previous query, you
would write:</p>
<p><code>window &amp; (!dialog)</code></p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-BABECIAH" title="Wildcard Search"></a><h5>Wildcard Search</h5>
<p>If you are not sure exactly how a particular term appears
in the documentation, you can use a wildcard search to include all
variations of a search term in the search results. For example,
if you are looking for all documentation about buttons in Mac OS
X, you probably really want to see all documentation containing
either the word &#8220;button&#8221; or the word &#8220;buttons.&#8221; Rather than
have to specify each of these as separate terms,  you can simply
use the wildcard character to construct the following query, which
returns all documents containing the word &#8220;button&#8221; or any word
with the prefix &#8220;button.&#8221; </p>
<p><code>button* </code></p>
<p>You can use the wildcard character anywhere within a search
string. Using a wildcard character at a location other than at the
end of a search term may result in longer search times.</p>

Tools</h3>
<p>To find documentation on a command-line tool, choose Help
&gt; Open man page. Use the &#8220;man page name&#8221; option to display
documentation on a command-line tool. You can optionally specify
a man page section; for example, <code>access(5)</code>.
Use the &#8220;search string&#8221; option to find commands that are related
to a keyword.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-DontLinkElementID_211" title="Working With Documentation Bookmarks"></a><h3>Working With Documentation
Bookmarks</h3>
<p>The Xcode documentation window also supports bookmarks, to
provide easy access to documentation that you use frequently. To
view the available bookmarks in the documentation window, click
the disclosure triangle next to the Bookmarks group in the Search
Groups list of the documentation window. Xcode includes a default
set of bookmarks, but you can delete any of these default bookmarks
or create your own.</p>
<p>To add a bookmark, choose Find &gt; Add to Bookmarks. This
bookmarks the page currently open in the documentation window and
adds the bookmark to the Bookmarks group. You can also add a bookmark
by dragging the document proxy icon in the titlebar of the documentation
window to the Bookmarks group in the Search Groups list.</p>
<p>To open a bookmarked location, select the bookmark in the
Search Groups list. To rename a bookmark, Option-click the name
of the bookmark in the Search Groups list and type the new name.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-BABFJGBG" title="Obtaining Documentation Updates"></a><h3>Obtaining Documentation Updates</h3>
<p>In addition to the full ADC Reference Library content available
with the Xcode Tools DVD and Developer DVD Series, Apple also provides
downloadable packages of the documentation installed on your local
computer at <code>/Developer/ADC Reference Library</code>.
Xcode automatically detects these updates as they become available.
Documentation updates are released more frequently than the full
Xcode Tools package, so this is a quick and easy way to stay up-to-date
with the latest technical information from Apple. </p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-DontLinkElementID_212" title="Checking for Updates"></a><h4>Checking
for Updates</h4>
<p>Xcode automatically checks for a documentation update the
first time you launch Xcode after installing a new version of the
Xcode tools. Any time you access the documentation after the initial
check, Xcode checks for an update if the interval specified in Xcode's Documentation
preferences has passed since the last check. By default, Xcode checks
for updates on a weekly basis, but you can choose a different interval.</p>
<p>To change the interval at which Xcode checks for documentation
updates:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><p>Open the
Documentation pane of Xcode Preferences.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Choose an interval from the &#8220;Check for documentation updates&#8221; pop-up
menu that appears in the Updates settings group. You can choose
to have Xcode check for updates on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.
Click Apply or OK to apply your changes.</p></li></ol>
<p>If you don't want Xcode to automatically check for updates
at all&#8212;for example, if you use Xcode on a computer that does not
usually have an internet connection&#8212;deselect the checkbox next
to the &#8220;Check for documentation updates&#8221; menu. </p>
<p>To check for a documentation update immediately, click the
Check Now button. The &#8220;Last check&#8221; field shows the date and
time at which Xcode last successfully checked for updated documentation.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-DontLinkElementID_213" title="Installing an Update"></a><h4>Installing
an Update</h4>
<p>When it checks for a documentation update, Xcode compares
the version of the documentation on Apple's server to the version
installed on your computer. If the documentation on the server is
newer, Xcode notifies you that updated documentation is available.
To download the documentation package, click Download. </p>
<p>Xcode launches your default browser application to download
the documentation package. When the download is complete, the disk
image automatically mounts. Double-click the documentation package
to launch the Installer. The installer updates the local installation
of the ADC Reference Library at <code>/Developer/ADC Reference
Library</code>.</p>
<p>If Xcode is running when the installation is successfully
completed, Xcode notifies you that the documentation has been updated.
Click OK to reload the Search Groups and ADC Reference Library entry
page in the documentation window. Otherwise, Xcode loads the new
documentation when it next launches.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-CJBEACHC" title="Controlling the Appearance of the Documentation Viewer"></a><h3>Controlling the Appearance
of the Documentation Viewer</h3>
<p>You can change the minimum font size used for viewing documentation.
To do so, open the Documentation pane of the Xcode Preferences window.
To enforce a minimum font size for documents displayed in the documentation
window:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><p>Under Universal
Access, select the &#8220;Never use font sizes smaller than&#8221; option.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Choose a font size from the corresponding pop-up menu.</p></li></ol>
<p>You can temporarily change the font size used to display an
HTML file&#8212;even if its font size is controlled by a CSS file&#8212;by
choosing Format &gt; Font &gt; Bigger or Format &gt; Font &gt; Smaller.</p>
