<b>NAME</b>
       perlfork - Perl's fork() emulation

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
           NOTE:  As of the 5.8.0 release, fork() emulation has considerably
           matured.  However, there are still a few known bugs and differences
           from real fork() that might affect you.  See the "BUGS" and
           "CAVEATS AND LIMITATIONS" sections below.

       Perl provides a <u>fork()</u> keyword that corresponds to the Unix system call of the same name.  On most
       Unix-like platforms where the <u>fork()</u> system call is available, Perl's <u>fork()</u> simply calls it.

       On some platforms such as Windows where the <u>fork()</u> system call is not available, Perl can be built to
       emulate <u>fork()</u> at the interpreter level.  While the emulation is designed to be as compatible as pos-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sible&nbsp;possible</font>
       sible with the real <u>fork()</u> at the level of the Perl program, there are certain important differences
       that stem from the fact that all the pseudo child "processes" created this way live in the same real
       process as far as the operating system is concerned.

       This document provides a general overview of the capabilities and limitations of the <u>fork()</u> emula-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion.&nbsp;emulation.</font>
       tion.  Note that the issues discussed here are not applicable to platforms where a real <u>fork()</u> is
       available and Perl has been configured to use it.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The <u>fork()</u> emulation is implemented at the level of the Perl interpreter.  What this means in general
       is that running <u>fork()</u> will actually clone the running interpreter and all its state, and run the
       cloned interpreter in a separate thread, beginning execution in the new thread just after the point
       where the <u>fork()</u> was called in the parent.  We will refer to the thread that implements this child
       "process" as the pseudo-process.

       To the Perl program that called <u>fork()</u>, all this is designed to be transparent.  The parent returns
       from the <u>fork()</u> with a pseudo-process ID that can be subsequently used in any process manipulation
       functions; the child returns from the <u>fork()</u> with a value of 0 to signify that it is the child
       pseudo-process.

       <b>Behavior</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>features</b> <b>in</b> <b>forked</b> <b>pseudo-processes</b>

       Most Perl features behave in a natural way within pseudo-processes.

       $$ or $PROCESS_ID
               This special variable is correctly set to the pseudo-process ID.  It can be used to identify
               pseudo-processes within a particular session.  Note that this value is subject to recycling
               if any pseudo-processes are launched after others have been <u>wait()</u>-ed on.

       %ENV    Each pseudo-process maintains its own virtual environment.  Modifications to %ENV affect the
               virtual environment, and are only visible within that pseudo-process, and in any processes
               (or pseudo-processes) launched from it.

       <u>chdir()</u> and all other builtins that accept filenames
               Each pseudo-process maintains its own virtual idea of the current directory.  Modifications
               to the current directory using <u>chdir()</u> are only visible within that pseudo-process, and in
               any processes (or pseudo-processes) launched from it.  All file and directory accesses from
               the pseudo-process will correctly map the virtual working directory to the real working
               directory appropriately.

       <u>wait()</u> and <u>waitpid()</u>
               <u>wait()</u> and <u>waitpid()</u> can be passed a pseudo-process ID returned by <u>fork()</u>.  These calls will
               properly wait for the termination of the pseudo-process and return its status.

       <u>kill()</u>  <u>kill()</u> can be used to terminate a pseudo-process by passing it the ID returned by <u>fork()</u>.
               This should not be used except under dire circumstances, because the operating system may not
               guarantee integrity of the process resources when a running thread is terminated.  Note that
               using <u>kill()</u> on a pseudo-<u>process()</u> may typically cause memory leaks, because the thread that
               implements the pseudo-process does not get a chance to clean up its resources.

       <u>exec()</u>  Calling <u>exec()</u> within a pseudo-process actually spawns the requested executable in a separate
               process and waits for it to complete before exiting with the same exit status as that
               process.  This means that the process ID reported within the running executable will be dif-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ferent&nbsp;different</font>
               ferent from what the earlier Perl <u>fork()</u> might have returned.  Similarly, any process manipu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lation&nbsp;manipulation</font>
               lation functions applied to the ID returned by <u>fork()</u> will affect the waiting pseudo-process
               that called <u>exec()</u>, not the real process it is waiting for after the <u>exec()</u>.

       <u>exit()</u>  <u>exit()</u> always exits just the executing pseudo-process, after automatically <u>wait()</u>-ing for any
               outstanding child pseudo-processes.  Note that this means that the process as a whole will
               not exit unless all running pseudo-processes have exited.

       Open handles to files, directories and network sockets
               All open handles are <u>dup()</u>-ed in pseudo-processes, so that closing any handles in one process
               does not affect the others.  See below for some limitations.

       <b>Resource</b> <b>limits</b>

       In the eyes of the operating system, pseudo-processes created via the <u>fork()</u> emulation are simply
       threads in the same process.  This means that any process-level limits imposed by the operating sys-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tem&nbsp;system</font>
       tem apply to all pseudo-processes taken together.  This includes any limits imposed by the operating
       system on the number of open file, directory and socket handles, limits on disk space usage, limits
       on memory size, limits on CPU utilization etc.

       <b>Killing</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>process</b>

       If the parent process is killed (either using Perl's <u>kill()</u> builtin, or using some external means)
       all the pseudo-processes are killed as well, and the whole process exits.

       <b>Lifetime</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>process</b> <b>and</b> <b>pseudo-processes</b>

       During the normal course of events, the parent process and every pseudo-process started by it will
       wait for their respective pseudo-children to complete before they exit.  This means that the parent
       and every pseudo-child created by it that is also a pseudo-parent will only exit after their pseudo-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">children&nbsp;pseudochildren</font>
       children have exited.

       A way to mark a pseudo-processes as running detached from their parent (so that the parent would not
       have to <u>wait()</u> for them if it doesn't want to) will be provided in future.

       <b>CAVEATS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b>


       BEGIN blocks
               The <u>fork()</u> emulation will not work entirely correctly when called from within a BEGIN block.
               The forked copy will run the contents of the BEGIN block, but will not continue parsing the
               source stream after the BEGIN block.  For example, consider the following code:

                   BEGIN {
                       fork and exit;          # fork child and exit the parent
                       print "inner\n";
                   }
                   print "outer\n";

               This will print:

                   inner

               rather than the expected:

                   inner
                   outer

               This limitation arises from fundamental technical difficulties in cloning and restarting the
               stacks used by the Perl parser in the middle of a parse.

       Open filehandles
               Any filehandles open at the time of the <u>fork()</u> will be <u>dup()</u>-ed.  Thus, the files can be
               closed independently in the parent and child, but beware that the <u>dup()</u>-ed handles will still
               share the same seek pointer.  Changing the seek position in the parent will change it in the
               child and vice-versa.  One can avoid this by opening files that need distinct seek pointers
               separately in the child.

       Forking pipe <u>open()</u> not yet implemented
               The "open(FOO, "|-")" and "open(BAR, "-|")" constructs are not yet implemented.  This limita-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;limitation</font>
               tion can be easily worked around in new code by creating a pipe explicitly.  The following
               example shows how to write to a forked child:

                   # simulate open(FOO, "|-")
                   sub pipe_to_fork ($) {
                       my $parent = shift;
                       pipe my $child, $parent or die;
                       my $pid = fork();
                       die "fork() failed: $!" unless defined $pid;
                       if ($pid) {
                           close $child;
                       }
                       else {
                           close $parent;
                           open(STDIN, "&lt;&amp;=" . fileno($child)) or die;
                       }
                       $pid;
                   }

                   if (pipe_to_fork('FOO')) {
                       # parent
                       print FOO "pipe_to_fork\n";
                       close FOO;
                   }
                   else {
                       # child
                       while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) { print; }
                       exit(0);
                   }

               And this one reads from the child:

                   # simulate open(FOO, "-|")
                   sub pipe_from_fork ($) {
                       my $parent = shift;
                       pipe $parent, my $child or die;
                       my $pid = fork();
                       die "fork() failed: $!" unless defined $pid;
                       if ($pid) {
                           close $child;
                       }
                       else {
                           close $parent;
                           open(STDOUT, "&gt;&amp;=" . fileno($child)) or die;
                       }
                       $pid;
                   }

                   if (pipe_from_fork('BAR')) {
                       # parent
                       while (&lt;BAR&gt;) { print; }
                       close BAR;
                   }
                   else {
                       # child
                       print "pipe_from_fork\n";
                       exit(0);
                   }

               Forking pipe <u>open()</u> constructs will be supported in future.

       Global state maintained by XSUBs
               External subroutines (XSUBs) that maintain their own global state may not work correctly.
               Such XSUBs will either need to maintain locks to protect simultaneous access to global data
               from different pseudo-processes, or maintain all their state on the Perl symbol table, which
               is copied naturally when <u>fork()</u> is called.  A callback mechanism that provides extensions an
               opportunity to clone their state will be provided in the near future.

       Interpreter embedded in larger application
               The <u>fork()</u> emulation may not behave as expected when it is executed in an application which
               embeds a Perl interpreter and calls Perl APIs that can evaluate bits of Perl code.  This
               stems from the fact that the emulation only has knowledge about the Perl interpreter's own
               data structures and knows nothing about the containing application's state.  For example, any
               state carried on the application's own call stack is out of reach.

       Thread-safety of extensions
               Since the <u>fork()</u> emulation runs code in multiple threads, extensions calling into non-thread-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">safe&nbsp;non-threadsafe</font>
               safe libraries may not work reliably when calling <u>fork()</u>.  As Perl's threading support gradu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ally&nbsp;gradually</font>
               ally becomes more widely adopted even on platforms with a native <u>fork()</u>, such extensions are
               expected to be fixed for thread-safety.

<b>BUGS</b>
              Having pseudo-process IDs be negative integers breaks down for the integer "-1" because the
               <u>wait()</u> and <u>waitpid()</u> functions treat this number as being special.  The tacit assumption in
               the current implementation is that the system never allocates a thread ID of 1 for user
               threads.  A better representation for pseudo-process IDs will be implemented in future.

              In certain cases, the OS-level handles created by the <u>pipe()</u>, <u>socket()</u>, and <u>accept()</u> opera-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tors&nbsp;operators</font>
               tors are apparently not duplicated accurately in pseudo-processes.  This only happens in some
               situations, but where it does happen, it may result in deadlocks between the read and write
               ends of pipe handles, or inability to send or receive data across socket handles.

              This document may be incomplete in some respects.
