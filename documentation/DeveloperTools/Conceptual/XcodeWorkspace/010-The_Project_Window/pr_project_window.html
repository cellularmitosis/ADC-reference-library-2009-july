The <strong>project window</strong> displays and organizes your source files, targets, and executables. It allows you to access and edit all the pieces of your project. To work effectively in Xcode, you need to recognize the parts of the project window and understand how to use them to navigate your project’s contents.</p><p>Of course, everyone has their own way of organizing their workspace. To help you be as efficient and productive as possible, Xcode provides several project window layouts. A <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002665-DontLinkElementID_7"></a>project window layout specifies a particular arrangement for a project window, as well as ancillary task-specific windows.</p><p>This chapter introduces project window components and describes the available project window layouts. It also introduces other important Xcode windows and provides tips on using the Xcode interface to locate information on project items.</p>

(Static groups are themselves grouped under the project group, which is named after the project and is represented by the blue project icon.) A static group, identified by a yellow folder icon, can contain any number of files and other static groups. Static groups help you organize the files in your project into manageable chunks. The project group is a static group that contains all the files, frameworks, libraries, and other resources included in your project.</p><p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002665-DontLinkElementID_16"></a><strong>Smart groups</strong> are subdivided into two types: built-in smart groups and custom smart groups.</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Built-in smart groups contain particular classes of components, files, symbols, or items. You cannot customize the contents of these groups. There are several built-in smart groups:</p><ul class="nested"><li class="nested li"><p><strong>Targets.</strong> Contains the targets in your project. A <strong>target</strong> contains the instructions for creating a software component or product.

If you prefer the outline view, you can open the group directly in the Groups &amp; Files list. You can also select one or more groups to view their contents in a simple searchable list in the detail view (see <span class="content_text"><a href="pr_project_window.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002665-SW2">“The Detail View”</a></span> for details).</p><p>To view or hide the contents of a group in the Groups &amp; Files list, use its disclosure triangle.</p><p>To view the contents of a group in the detail view, select the group in the Groups &amp; Files list. In general, the detail view shows more item information than the Groups &amp; Files list. </p><p>You can display additional attributes for the items shown in the Groups &amp; Files list using the shortcut menu in the list header (Control-click the header to show the shortcut menu). A column for each attribute appears on the left side of the list.</p><br/><div><img src = "../art/groupsfiles_attributes.jpg" alt = "Group item shortcut menu" ></div><br/><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002665-SW23" title="Displaying and Hiding Smart Groups"></a><h4>Displaying and Hiding Smart Groups</h4><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002665-DontLinkElementID_18"></a><p>As described in <span class="content_text"><a href="pr_project_window.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002665-SW8">“Group Types,”</a></span> an Xcode project has a number of smart groups that organize particular types of project items. These groups help you find information such as symbols or build errors. However, you may not need to display all the smart groups in the Groups &amp; Files list.</p><p>To specify which smart groups the Groups &amp; Files list displays, use the Preferences submenu in the shortcut menu that appears when you Control-click an item in the Groups &amp; Files list.</p><p>To rearrange a smart group, drag it to its new position in the Groups &amp; Files list.</p><p>To delete a group, select it and choose Edit > Delete.

You can split the Groups &amp; Files view for a project by clicking the Split button, shown in <span class="content_text">Figure 1-3</span>.</p><p>Each Groups &amp; Files view can display a different area of the Groups &amp; Files list, making it easy to keep frequently accessed groups handy or to move items between groups. You can drag the resize control between the views to redistribute the space between them. To remove a Groups &amp; Files view, click the Close Split button.</p><p>By default Xcode splits the view vertically. However, you can also split a view horizontally. To split a view horizontally, hold down the Option key while clicking the Split button.</p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002665-SW19" title="Figure 1-3Split Groups &amp;amp; Files view"></a><p><strong>Figure 1-3&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Split Groups &amp; Files view</p><img src = "../art/groupsfiles_split.jpg" alt = "Split Groups &amp; Files view" ></div><br/><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002665-SW2" title="The Detail View"></a><h3>The Detail View</h3><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002665-DontLinkElementID_20"></a><p>As you learned, the Groups &amp; Files view lets you see the contents of your project in an organized outline. In contrast, the detail view shows you items in a flat list. You can quickly search and sort the items in this list, gaining rapid access to important information in your project.</p><p>You control the scope of the information shown in the detail view with your selection in the Groups &amp; Files list. If the selected item is a group, the detail view displays information for all the members of that group and of any subgroups that it contains. You can select multiple items in the Groups &amp; Files list; the detail view displays the selected items and their members.</p><div class="notebox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002665-SW18" title="Note"></a><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;The content of groups such as frameworks and bundles is shown in the detail view only when that framework or bundle is directly selected in the Groups &amp; Files list, to avoid mixing items such as external framework headers and project headers.</p></div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002665-SW26" title="Information Displayed in the Detail View"></a><h4>Information Displayed in the Detail View</h4><p>The type of information displayed in the detail view varies, depending on the item selected in the Groups &amp; Files list. For example, if you select a group of source files in the Groups &amp; Files list, the detail view displays each of the files in that group, along with information about those files, such as the file’s build status or code size. However, build status and code size make no sense for errors and warnings, so when you select the Errors and Warnings group, you see a list of error and warning messages and the locations at which they occur.</p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002665-SW11" title="Figure 1-4Detail view columns"></a><p><strong>Figure 1-4&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Detail view columns</p><img src = "../art/detail_view_columns.jpg" alt = "Detail view columns" ></div><br/><p>This is the information available in the detail view:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p><strong>File kind.</strong> The first column, with an empty column heading, shows an icon indicating the type of the file. For example, a nib file is marked by the Interface Builder file icon. The icon for a C++ class file displays the characters “C++”.</p></li><li class="li"><p><strong>File Name.</strong> The File Name column displays the names of the files.</p></li><li class="li"><p><strong>Build status.</strong> The column marked by the hammer icon displays the build status of each file. If a file has been changed since the active target was last built, this column displays a checkmark, indicating that the file needs to be built. If the file is up to date, this column is empty.</p></li><li class="li"><p><strong>Code.</strong> The Code column displays the size of the compiled code generated from the file.</p></li><li class="li"><p><strong>Build errors.</strong> The column marked by the error icon displays the number of errors in the file. If this column is empty, the file either contains no errors or has not yet been built.</p></li><li class="li"><p><strong>Warnings.</strong> The column marked by the warning icon displays the number of warnings for the file. If this column is empty, the file either has no warnings or has not yet been built.</p></li><li class="li"><p><strong>Target membership.</strong> The column marked by the target icon indicates whether the file is included in the active target. If the checkbox next to a file is checked, then the active target includes that file.</p></li><li class="li"><p><strong>SCM.</strong> The SCM column shows the SCM status of the file.</p></li><li class="li"><p><strong>Path.</strong> The Path column shows the file system path to the item.</p></li><li class="li"><p><strong>Comments.</strong> The Comments column displays any note or other information that you have associated with the file in the Comments pane of the File Info window.</p></li></ul><p>Not all of these columns are visible by default. You can choose which columns are shown in the detail view by using the shortcut menu that appears when you Control-click anywhere in the header. You can display many of these same columns in the Groups &amp; Files list, using the same mechanism. For more information, see <span class="content_text"><a href="pr_project_window.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002665-SW12">“The Groups &amp; Files List”</a></span> and <span class="content_text"><a href="pr_project_window.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002665-SW2">“The Detail View.”</a></span></p><div class="notebox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002665-SW20" title="Note"></a><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;Some columns in the detail view are required, depending on the currently selected group. These columns do not appear in the shortcut menu.</p></div><p>You can display the columns of the detail view in any order. To reorder the columns, drag the heading of any column to its new position.</p><p>You can also reveal the selected item in the detail view in the Groups &amp; Files list. For example, if the current selection in the detail view is an individual source file, Xcode selects that file in the Groups &amp; Files list, disclosing the contents of any static groups that the file belongs to, as necessary. To reveal the detail view selection in the Groups &amp; Files list, choose View > Reveal in Group Tree.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002665-SW6" title="Searching and Sorting in the Detail View"></a><h4>Searching and Sorting in the Detail View</h4><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002665-DontLinkElementID_21"></a><p>With the detail view you have a couple of ways to find and view information. You can sort the contents of the detail view according to the information in any of the visible categories simply by clicking the column heading for that category. For example, to sort by filename, click the File Name heading.</p><p>Using the search field in the toolbar, you can quickly search the contents of the detail view. As you type, Xcode filters the contents of the detail view, displaying only those items that have matching text in at least one of the columns. </p><p>The search field supports several  types of search; you can choose the search type from the pop-up menu in the search field. Xcode supports the following searches:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p><strong>String Matching.</strong> Xcode determines a match using simple string comparison, filtering out items that do not match the string in the search field. This is the default type of search for the search field. It is also the fastest.</p></li><li class="li"><p><strong>Wildcard Pattern.</strong> Xcode uses the wildcard pattern in the search field to find items that contain the specified characters anywhere in any of the visible columns. For example, enter <code>*View*.h</code> to find all header files with “View” in their name.</p></li><li class="li"><p><strong>Regular Expression.</strong> Xcode uses the regular expression in the search field to find matching items. For example, to find all C implementation and header files in a source group, enter <code>\.(c|h)$</code></p></li></ul><p><span class="content_text">Figure 1-5</span> shows an example of a sting matching search.</p><br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002665-SW27" title="Figure 1-5Searching for files with &acirc;&#128;&#156;delegate&acirc;&#128;&#157; in their name"></a><p><strong>Figure 1-5&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Searching for files with “delegate” in their name</p><img src = "../art/project_window_search.jpg" alt = "Searching for files with “delegate” in their name" ></div><br/><p>As you type, the status bar displays the scope of the search—the current selection in the Groups &amp; Files list—and the number of items found.

Ask yourself questions such as the following: How much screen real estate do I have? What do I spend most of my time working on? How many projects do I normally have open at once?</p><p>Configuring your working environment to allow you to be as productive as possible is critical. Whatever your preferred workflow, Xcode provides several project window layouts for you to choose from. Xcode defines the following layouts:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p><strong>Default.</strong> This configuration provides the traditional Xcode project window arrangement, shown in <span class="content_text"><a href="pr_project_window.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002665-SW22">Figure 1-1</a></span>. The default layout combines outline and detail views to let you quickly navigate your project.</p></li><li class="li"><p><strong>Condensed.</strong> This layout provides a smaller, simpler project window with an outline view of your project contents and separate windows for common tasks, such as debugging and building.</p></li><li class="li"><p><strong>All-in-one.</strong> This layout provides a single project window that lets you perform all the tasks typical of software development—such as debugging, viewing build results, searching, and so forth—within a single window.</p></li></ul><p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002665-DontLinkElementID_26"></a>You set the window layout for your environment in the General pane in Xcode preferences. From the Layout menu, choose the Default, Condensed, or All-In-One layouts. Selecting a layout from this menu shows a brief description of the layout below the menu. Note that you cannot change the project window layout when any projects are open; you must first close all open projects. The project window layout is a user-specific setting; it applies to all projects that you open on your computer.</p><p>This section describes each project window layout and the differences between them.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002665-SW29" title="The Default Layout"></a><h3>The Default Layout</h3><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002665-DontLinkElementID_27"></a><p>The default project window layout, shown in <span class="content_text"><a href="pr_project_window.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002665-SW22">Figure 1-1</a></span>, contains three main views:</p><ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p><strong>Groups &amp; Files view.</strong> Contains a list your project contents, as described in <span class="content_text"><a href="pr_project_window.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002665-SW12">“The Groups &amp; Files List.”</a></span></p></li><li class="li"><p><strong>Detail view.</strong> Shows a flat list of the items selected in the Groups &amp; Files list, as described in <span class="content_text"><a href="pr_project_window.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002665-SW2">“The Detail View.”</a></span> In the default layout, you can hide the detail view by collapsing the project window. To hide the detail view, double-click the <img src = "../art/groups_maximize.jpg" alt = "Show/hide Detail View button" > button in the Groups &amp; Files view. Double-clicking the button a second time shows the detail view again.</p><p>In addition, you can customize the project window toolbar shown in each of these states. To do so, collapse or expand the project window to the appropriate state and customize the toolbar in the usual way, described in <span class="content_text"><a href="pr_project_window.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002665-SW13">“The Project Window Toolbar.”</a></span> Xcode stores the contents of the toolbar for each state separately.</p></li><li class="li"><p><strong>Text editor pane.</strong> In the default layout, you can choose to view and edit all files within the project window, using the text editor pane. Or, you can choose to have Xcode use a separate editor window and use only the Groups &amp; Files list and the detail view in the project window.</p></li></ul><p>Although you can accomplish most of your daily development tasks in the project window, Xcode also provides a number of other task-specific windows that let you focus on a particular part of the development process. <span class="content_text">Table 1-1</span> shows the separate windows available in the default layout.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002665-SW14" title="Table 1-1Additional windows available with the default project window layout"></a><div class="tableholder"><table class="graybox" border = "0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><caption class="tablecaption"><strong>Table 1-1&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Additional windows available with the default project window layout</caption><tr><th scope="col" align="left" style="font-weight: bold" bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><p>Window</p></th><th scope="col" align="left" style="font-weight: bold" bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><p>Use to</p></th></tr><tr><td  scope="row"><p>Build Results</p></td><td ><p>View the build system output generated when you build a target.</p></td></tr><tr><td  scope="row"><p>Debugger</p></td><td ><p>Debug your program; you can control execution of your code; view threads, stack frames and variables; and so forth.</p></td></tr><tr><td  scope="row"><p>SCM</p></td><td ><p>View the status of files under source control.</p></td></tr><tr><td  scope="row"><p>Project Find</p></td><td ><p>Search for text, symbol definitions, and regular expressions in your project.</p></td></tr><tr><td  scope="row"><p>Console</p></td><td ><p>View information or messages logged by your program when running in Xcode and interact with the debugger on the command line and see debugger commands and output.</p></td></tr><tr><td  scope="row"><p>Class Browser</p></td><td ><p>View the class hierarchy of your project and browse classes and class members.</p></td></tr><tr><td  scope="row"><p>Breakpoints</p></td><td ><p>View and edit all breakpoints set in your project.</p></td></tr><tr><td  scope="row"><p>Bookmarks</p></td><td ><p>View your project’s bookmarked locations in a dedicated window.</p></td></tr></table></div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002665-SW30" title="The Condensed Layout"></a><h3>The Condensed Layout</h3><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002665-DontLinkElementID_28"></a><p>The condensed layout provides a smaller, more compact version of the project window, shown in <span class="content_text">Figure 1-7</span>.

The Files pane shows only the project group, which contains all files and folders in the project. The Other pane shows all smart groups. If you want access to both your project files and your bookmarked locations in the same pane, you could add the Bookmarks smart group to the Files pane by dragging it from the Other pane to the Files button and then the Files pane.</p><div class="notebox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002665-SW41" title="Note"></a><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp; If the Bookmarks smart group exists in another pane, choosing View > Smart Groups > Bookmarks opens that pane in the project window.

Xcode gives you a number of ways to find and access project contents. In previous sections, you learned how to use the Groups &amp; Files list to see an organized outline view of your project and how to use the detail view to quickly filter project contents. Using these tools, you can view as wide or as narrow a cross-section of your project as you choose.</p><p>These tools, however, aren’t as useful when you wish to view or modify individual items in your project. For this, Xcode provides inspector and Info windows. These windows are for managing the selected item’s essential details. For any particular item in your project, its Info window and the inspector display the same information. However, the two windows behave differently.</p><p>The amount of information visible in the status bar is limited and it reflects only operations in the current project. To let you view a more detailed account of all operations in Xcode, Xcode provides the Activity Viewer window (see <span class="content_text"><a href="pr_project_window.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002665-SW10">“Viewing the Progress of Tasks in Xcode”</a></span>).</p><p>The inspector tracks the current selection in the project window. As you select different files, targets, and groups in the project window, the inspector changes to show information about that item.</p><p>The Info window continues to display information about the items that were selected in the project window when you opened it, regardless of the current selection. You can have multiple Info windows open at a time, each describing a different set of items of your project.</p><p>The Info button in the project window toolbar displays an Info window for the currently selected item. You can add an Inspector button to the toolbar.</p><p>You can also use menu commands (or their keyboard shortcuts) to display Info windows or the inspector window. Choose File > Get Info to display an Info window. Hold down the Option key and choose File > Show Inspector to display the inspector.</p><p>Xcode provides Info windows and inspectors for the following project items:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>File and folder references</p></li><li class="li"><p>User-defined smart groups</p></li><li class="li"><p>Localized file variants</p></li><li class="li"><p>Targets</p></li><li class="li"><p>Executable environments</p></li><li class="li"><p>Build phases</p></li><li class="li"><p>The project itself</p></li></ul><p>The type of information displayed depends on the type of item you are editing. Specific Info windows are described in more detail where the items that they modify—files, targets, projects, groups, and so forth—are discussed. In general, however, if you are at a loss as to how to make a change to a basic project item, try displaying its Info window. Throughout this document, wherever the inspector window is used, remember that you can also use an Info window, and vice versa.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002665-SW10" title="Viewing the Progress of Tasks in Xcode"></a><h2>Viewing the Progress of Tasks in Xcode</h2><p>The <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002665-DontLinkElementID_35"></a>Activity Viewer window lets you watch the tasks currently in progress in Xcode.
