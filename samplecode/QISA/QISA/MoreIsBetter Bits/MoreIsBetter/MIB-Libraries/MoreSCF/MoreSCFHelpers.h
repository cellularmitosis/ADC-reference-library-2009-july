When using framework includes, explicitly include the frameworks we need. Convert nil to NULL.Revision 1.1  2002/01/16 22:52:34  eskimo1First checked in.*/#pragma once/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// MoreIsBetter Setup#include "MoreSetup.h"#if !TARGET_RT_MAC_MACHO	#error MoreSCFHelpers requires the use of Mach-O#endif// MIB Prototypes#include "MoreSCFDigest.h"// System prototypes#include <CoreServices/CoreServices.h>/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////#ifdef __cplusplusextern "C" {#endif/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// TCP/IP Will Dial// You no longer need a helper function to ask the "will this connection // dial the modem" question.
