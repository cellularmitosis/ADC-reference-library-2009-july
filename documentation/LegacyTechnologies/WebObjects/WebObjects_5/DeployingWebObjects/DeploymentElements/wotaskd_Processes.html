Its main task is tostart up instances when hosts are restarted. To accomplish this,wotaskd itself has to be restarted when the host starts up. Thisis done by configuring wotaskd as a service started when the computerboots. By default, a wotaskd process running on port <code>1085</code> isconfigured as a service on all supported platforms. The implementationof this feature is platform-specific. See  <a href="Starting_We_ts_Services.html#BCIGDGEF" target = "_right">"Starting WebObjects Services"</a> for details.</p><p>You need to run a wotaskd process on every machine that youwant to use as an application host. These processes constantly receivelifebeats from the application instances they manage. Lifebeatscommunicate the instance's state and allow wostaskd to determinethe state of the instances it oversees. A wotaskd process assumesthat an application instance is dead if it does not receive a lifebeatwithin a certain period. For details, see  <a sector="mod" href="../Reference/iCommand_Line_Arguments.html" target="_top">"WOAssumeApplicationIsDeadMultiplier" </a>.</p><p>When you restrict access to Monitor with a password, wotaskdprocesses running on hosts configured in Monitor are also protected:They do not respond to <code>http://&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;wotaskd-port&gt;</code>,as described in  <a sector="mod" href="../Installation/iConfirming__d_Is_Active.html" target="_top">"Confirming That wotaskd Is Active" </a>.</p><p>To access the state information of a particular wotaskd process,you use Monitor's Host page. See  <a sector="mod" href="../Deployment/iSetting_Up_Hosts.html" target="_top">"Viewing a Host's Configuration" </a> for more information.</p><br>    <br><a href="Lifebeats.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/previous.gif" border="0"></a><a href="Starting_We_ts_Services.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/next.gif" border="0"></a>&nbsp;<br><hr><p><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">&#169; 2001 Apple Computer, Inc.
