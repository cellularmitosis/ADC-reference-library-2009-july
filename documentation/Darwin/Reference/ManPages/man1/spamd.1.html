<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The purpose of this program is to provide a daemonized version of the spamassassin executable.  The
       goal is improving throughput performance for automated mail checking.

       This is intended to be used alongside "spamc", a fast, low-overhead C client program.

       See the README file in the "spamd" directory of the SpamAssassin distribution for more details.

       Note: Although "spamd" will check per-user config files for every message, any changes to the system-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">wide&nbsp;systemwide</font>
       wide config files will require either restarting spamd or forcing it to reload itself via <b>SIGHUP</b> for
       the changes to take effect.

       Note: If "spamd" receives a <b>SIGHUP</b>, it internally reloads itself, which means that it will change its
       pid and might not restart at all if its environment changed  (ie. if it can't change back into its
       own directory).  If you plan to use <b>SIGHUP</b>, you should always start "spamd" with the <b>-r</b> switch to
       know its current pid.

<b>OPTIONS</b>
       Options of the long form can be shortened as long as they remain unambiguous.  (i.e. <b>--dae</b> can be
       used instead of <b>--daemonize</b>) Also, boolean options (like <b>--user-config</b>) can be negated by adding <u>no</u>
       (<b>--nouser-config</b>), however, this is usually unnecessary.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--allow-tell</b>
           Allow learning and forgetting (to a local Bayes database), reporting and revoking (to a remote
           database) by spamd. The client issues a TELL command to tell what type of message is being
           processed and whether local (learn/forget) or remote (report/revoke) databases should be updated.

           Note that spamd always trusts the username passed in (unless <b>--auth-ident</b> is used) so clients
           could maliciously learn messages for other users. (This is not ususally a concern with an SQL
           Bayes store as users will typically have read-write access directly to the database, and can also
           use "sa-learn" with the <b>-u</b> option to achieve the same result.)

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--create-prefs</b>
           Create user preferences files if they don't exist (default: don't).

       <b>-C</b> <u>path</u>, <b>--configpath</b>=<u>path</u>
           Use the specified path for locating the distributed configuration files.  Ignore the default
           directories (usually "/usr/share/spamassassin" or similar).

       <b>--siteconfigpath</b>=<u>path</u>
           Use the specified path for locating site-specific configuration files.  Ignore the default
           directories (usually "/etc/mail/spamassassin" or similar).

       <b>--cf='config</b> <b>line'</b>
           Add additional lines of configuration directly from the command-line, parsed after the
           configuration files are read.   Multiple <b>--cf</b> arguments can be used, and each will be considered
           a separate line of configuration.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--daemonize</b>
           Detach from starting process and run in background (daemonize).

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a brief help message, then exit without further action.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
           Print version information, then exit without further action.

       <b>-i</b> [<u>ipaddress</u>], <b>--listen-ip</b>[=<u>ipaddress</u>], <b>--ip-address</b>[=<u>ipaddress</u>]
           Tells spamd to listen on the specified IP address (defaults to 127.0.0.1).  If you specify no IP
           address after the switch, spamd will listen on all interfaces.  (This is equal to the address
           0.0.0.0).  You can also use a valid hostname which will make spamd listen on the first address
           that name resolves to.

       <b>-p</b> <u>port</u>, <b>--port</b>=<u>port</u>
           Optionally specifies the port number for the server to listen on (default: 783).

           If the <b>--ssl</b> switch is used, and <b>--ssl-port</b> is not supplied, then this port will be used to
           accept SSL connections instead of unencrypted connections.  If the <b>--ssl</b> switch is used, and
           <b>--ssl-port</b> is set, then unencrypted connections will be accepted on the <b>--port</b> at the same time
           as encrypted connections are accepted at <b>--ssl-port</b>.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--sql-config</b>
           Turn on SQL lookups even when per-user config files have been disabled with <b>-x</b>. this is useful
           for spamd hosts which don't have user's home directories but do want to load user preferences
           from an SQL database.

           If your spamc client does not support sending the "User:" header, like "exiscan", then the SQL
           username used will always be <b>nobody</b>.

       <b>--ldap-config</b>
           Turn on LDAP lookups. This is completely analog to "--sql-config", only it is using an LDAP
           server.

       <b>-Q</b>, <b>--setuid-with-sql</b>
           Turn on SQL lookups even when per-user config files have been disabled with <b>-x</b> and also setuid to
           the user.  This is useful for spamd hosts which want to load user preferences from an SQL
           database but also wish to support the use of <b>-H</b> (Helper home directories.)

       <b>--setuid-with-ldap</b>
           Turn on LDAP lookups even when per-user config files have been disabled with <b>-x</b> and also setuid
           to the user.  This is again completely analog to "--setuid-with-sql", only it is using an LDAP
           server.

       <b>--virtual-config-dir</b>=<u>pattern</u>
           This option specifies where per-user preferences can be found for virtual users, for the <b>-x</b>
           switch. The <u>pattern</u> is used as a base pattern for the directory name.  Any of the following
           escapes can be used:

           %u -- replaced with the full name of the current user, as sent by spamc.
           %l -- replaced with the 'local part' of the current username.  In other words, if the username is
           an email address, this is the part before the "@" sign.
           %d -- replaced with the 'domain' of the current username.  In other words, if the username is an
           email address, this is the part after the "@" sign.
           %% -- replaced with a single percent sign (%).

           So for example, if "/vhome/users/%u/spamassassin" is specified, and spamc sends a virtual
           username of "jm@example.com", the directory "/vhome/users/jm@example.com/spamassassin" will be
           used.

           The set of characters allowed in the virtual username for this path are restricted to:

                   A-Z a-z 0-9 - + _ . , @ =

           All others will be replaced by underscores ("_").

           This path must be a writable directory.  It will be created if it does not already exist.  If a
           file called <b>user_prefs</b> exists in this directory (note: <b>not</b> in a ".spamassassin" subdirectory!),
           it will be loaded as the user's preferences.  The Bayes databases for that user will be stored in
           this directory.

           Note that this <b>requires</b> that <b>-x</b> is used, and cannot be combined with SQL- or LDAP-based
           configuration.

           The pattern <b>must</b> expand to an absolute directory when spamd is running daemonized (<b>-d</b>).

           Currently, use of this without <b>-u</b> is not supported. This inhibits setuid.

       <b>-r</b> <u>pidfile</u>, <b>--pidfile</b>=<u>pidfile</u>
           Write the process ID of the spamd parent to the file specified by <u>pidfile</u>.  The file will be
           unlinked when the parent exits.  Note that when running with the <b>-u</b> option, the file must be
           writable by that user.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--vpopmail</b>
           Enable vpopmail config.  If specified with with <b>-u</b> set to the vpopmail user, this allows spamd to
           lookup/create user_prefs in the vpopmail user's own maildir.  This option is useful for vpopmail
           virtual users who do not have an entry in the system /etc/passwd file.

           Currently, use of this without <b>-u</b> is not supported. This inhibits setuid.

       <b>-s</b> <u>facility</u>, <b>--syslog</b>=<u>facility</u>
           Specify the syslog facility to use (default: mail).  If "stderr" is specified, output will be
           written to stderr. (This is useful if you're running "spamd" under the "daemontools" package.)
           With a <u>facility</u> of "file", all output goes to spamd.log. <u>facility</u> is interpreted as a file name
           to log to if it contains any characters except a-z and 0-9. "null" disables logging completely
           (used internally).

           Examples:      spamd -s mail                 # use syslog, facility mail (default)      spamd -s
           ./mail               # log to file ./mail      spamd -s stderr 2&gt;/dev/null   # log to stderr,
           throw messages away      spamd -s null                 # the same as above      spamd -s file
           # log to file ./spamd.log      spamd -s /var/log/spamd.log   # log to file /var/log/spamd.log

           If logging to a file is enabled and that log file is rotated, the spamd server must be restarted
           with a SIGHUP. (If the log file is just truncated, this is not needed but still recommended.)

           Note that logging to a file does not use locking, so you cannot intermix logging from spamd and
           other processes into the same file.  If you want to mix logging like this, use syslog instead.

           If you use syslog logging, it is essential to send a SIGHUP to the spamd daemon when you restart
           the syslogd daemon.  (This is due to a shortcoming in Perl's syslog handling, where the
           disappearance of the connection to the syslogd is considered a fatal error.)

       <b>--syslog-socket</b>=<u>type</u>
           Specify how spamd should send messages to syslogd.  The options are "unix", "inet" or "none".
           The default is to try "unix" first, falling back to "inet" if perl detects errors in its "unix"
           support.

           Some platforms, or versions of perl, are shipped with dysfunctional versions of the <b>Sys::Syslog</b>
           package which do not support some socket types, so you may need to set this.  If you get error
           messages regarding <b>__PATH_LOG</b> or similar from spamd, try changing this setting.

           The socket type "file" is used internally and should not be specified.  Use the "-s" switch
           instead.

       <b>-u</b> <u>username</u>, <b>--username</b>=<u>username</u>
           Run as the named user.  If this option is not set, the default behaviour is to <u>setuid()</u> to the
           user running "spamc", if "spamd" is running as root.

           Note: "--username=root" is not a valid option.  If specified, "spamd" will exit with a fatal
           error on startup.

       <b>-g</b> <u>groupname</u>, <b>--groupname</b>=<u>groupname</u>
           Run as the named group if --username is being used. If this option is not set when --username is
           used then the primary group for the user given to --username is used.

       <b>-x</b>, <b>--nouser-config</b>, <b>--user-config</b>
           Turn off(on) reading of per-user configuration files (user_prefs) from the user's home directory.
           The default behaviour is to read per-user configuration from the user's home directory.

           This option does not disable or otherwise influence the SQL, LDAP or Virtual Config Dir settings.

       <b>--auth-ident</b>
           Verify the username provided by spamc using ident.  This is only useful if connections are only
           allowed from trusted hosts (because an identd that lies is trivial to create) and if spamc REALLY
           SHOULD be running as the user it represents.  Connections are terminated immediately if
           authentication fails.  In this case, spamc will pass the mail through unchecked.  Failure to
           connect to an ident server, and response timeouts are considered authentication failures.  This
           requires that Net::Ident be installed.

       <b>--ident-timeout</b>=<u>timeout</u>
           Wait at most <u>timeout</u> seconds for a response to ident queries.  Authentication that takes long
           that <u>timeout</u> seconds will fail, and mail will not be processed.  Setting this to 0.0 or less
           results in no timeout, which is STRONGLY discouraged.  The default is 5 seconds.

       <b>-A</b> <u>host,...</u>, <b>--allowed-ips</b>=<u>host,...</u>
           Specify a list of authorized hosts or networks which can connect to this spamd instance. Single
           IP addresses can be given, ranges of IP addresses in address/masklength CIDR format, or ranges of
           IP addresses by listing 3 or less octets with a trailing dot.  Hostnames are not supported, only
           IP addresses.  This option can be specified multiple times, or can take a list of addresses
           separated by commas.  Examples:

           <b>-A</b> <b>10.11.12.13</b> -- only allow connections from 10.11.12.13.

           <b>-A</b> <b>10.11.12.13,10.11.12.14</b> -- only allow connections from 10.11.12.13 and 10.11.12.14.

           <b>-A</b> <b>10.200.300.0/24</b> -- allow connections from any machine in the range "10.200.300.*".

           <b>-A</b> <b>10.</b> -- allow connections from any machine in the range "10.*.*.*".

           By default, connections are only accepted from localhost [127.0.0.1].

       <b>-D</b> [<u>area,...</u>], <b>--debug</b> [<u>area,...</u>]
           Produce debugging output. If no areas are listed, all debugging information is printed.
           Diagnostic output can also be enabled for each area individually; <u>area</u> is the area of the code to
           instrument. For example, to produce diagnostic output on bayes, learn, and dns, use:

                   spamassassin -D bayes,learn,dns

           Higher priority informational messages that are suitable for logging in normal circumstances are
           available with an area of "info".

           For more information about which areas (also known as channels) are available, please see the
           documentation at:

                   C&lt;<a href="http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/DebugChannels">http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/DebugChannels</a>

        <b>--ipv4only</b>, <b>--ipv4-only</b>, <b>--ipv4</b>
           Do not use IPv6 for DNS tests. Use if the existing tests for IPv6 availablity produce incorrect
           results or crashes.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--local</b>
           Perform only local tests on all mail.  In other words, skip DNS and other network tests.  Works
           the same as the "-L" flag to <a href="spamassassin.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/spamassassin">spamassassin(1)</a>.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--paranoid</b>
           Die on user errors (for the user passed from spamc) instead of falling back to user <u>nobody</u> and
           using the default configuration.

       <b>-m</b> <u>number</u> , <b>--max-children</b>=<u>number</u>
           This option specifies the maximum number of children to spawn.  Spamd will spawn that number of
           children, then sleep in the background until a child dies, wherein it will go and spawn a new
           child.

           Incoming connections can still occur if all of the children are busy, however those connections
           will be queued waiting for a free child.  The minimum value is 1, the default value is 5.

           Please note that there is a OS specific maximum of connections that can be queued (Try "perl
           -MSocket -e'print SOMAXCONN'" to find this maximum).

           Note that if you run too many servers for the amount of free RAM available, you run the danger of
           hurting performance by causing a high swap load as server processes are swapped in and out
           continually.

       <b>--min-children</b>=<u>number</u>
           The minimum number of children that will be kept running.  The minimum value is 1, the default
           value is 1.  If you have lots of free RAM, you may want to increase this.

       <b>--min-spare</b>=<u>number</u>
           The lower limit for the number of spare children allowed to run.  A spare, or idle, child is one
           that is not handling a scan request.   If there are too few spare children available, a new
           server will be started every second or so.  The default value is 1.

       <b>--max-spare</b>=<u>number</u>
           The upper limit for the number of spare children allowed to run.  If there are too many spare
           children, one will be killed every second or so until the number of idle children is in the
           desired range.  The default value is 2.

       <b>--max-conn-per-child</b>=<u>number</u>
           This option specifies the maximum number of connections each child should process before dying
           and letting the master spamd process spawn a new child.  The minimum value is 1, the default
           value is 200.

       <b>--round-robin</b>
           By default, "spamd" will attempt to keep a small number of "hot" child processes as busy as
           possible, and keep any others as idle as possible, using something similar to the Apache httpd
           server scaling algorithm.  This is accomplished by the master process coordinating the activities
           of the children.  This switch will disable this scaling algorithm, and the behaviour seen in the
           3.0.x versions will be used instead, where all processes receive an equal load and no scaling
           takes place.

       <b>--timeout-tcp</b>=<u>number</u>
           This option specifies the number of seconds to wait for headers from a client (spamc) before
           closing the connection.  The minimum value is 1, the default value is 30, and a value of 0 will
           disable socket timeouts completely.

       <b>--timeout-child</b>=<u>number</u>
           This option specifies the number of seconds to wait for a spamd child to to process or check a
           message.  The minimum value is 1, the default value is 300, and a value of 0 will disable child
           timeouts completely.

       <b>-H</b> <u>directory</u>, <b>--helper-home-dir</b>=<u>directory</u>
           Specify that external programs such as Razor, DCC, and Pyzor should have a HOME environment
           variable set to a specific directory.  The default is to use the HOME environment variable
           setting from the shell running spamd.  By specifying no argument, spamd will use the spamc
           caller's home directory instead.

       <b>--ssl</b>
           Accept only SSL connections on the associated port.  The <b>IO::Socket::SSL</b> perl module must be
           installed.

           If the <b>--ssl</b> switch is used, and <b>--ssl-port</b> is not supplied, then <b>--port</b> port will be used to
           accept SSL connections instead of unencrypted connections.  If the <b>--ssl</b> switch is used, and
           <b>--ssl-port</b> is set, then unencrypted connections will be accepted on the <b>--port</b>, at the same time
           as encrypted connections are accepted at <b>--ssl-port</b>.

       <b>--ssl-port</b>=<u>port</u>
           Optionally specifies the port number for the server to listen on for SSL connections (default:
           whatever --port uses).  See <b>--ssl</b> for more details.

       <b>--ssl-version</b>=<u>sslversion</u>
           Specify the SSL protocol version to use, one of <b>sslv2</b>, <b>sslv3</b>, <b>tlsv1</b>, or <b>sslv23</b>.  The default,
           <b>sslv23</b>, is the most flexible, accepting a SSLv2 or higher hello handshake, then negotiating use
           of SSLv3 or TLSv1 protocol if the client can accept it.  Specifying <b>--ssl-version</b> implies <b>--ssl</b>.

       <b>--server-key</b> <u>keyfile</u>
           Specify the SSL key file to use for SSL connections.

       <b>--server-cert</b> <u>certfile</u>
           Specify the SSL certificate file to use for SSL connections.

       <b>--socketpath</b> <u>pathname</u>
           Listen on UNIX domain path <u>pathname</u> instead of a TCP socket.

           Warning: the Perl support on BSD platforms for UNIX domain sockets seems to have a bug regarding
           paths of over 100 bytes or so (SpamAssassin bug 4380).  If you see a 'could not find newly-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">created&nbsp;newlycreated</font>
           created UNIX socket' error message, and the path appears truncated, this may be the cause.  Try
           using a shorter path to the socket.

           By default, use of <b>--socketpath</b> will inhibit SSL connections and unencrypted TCP connections.  To
           enable them, specify <b>--port</b> and/or <b>--ssl-port</b> explicitly.

       <b>--socketowner</b> <u>name</u>
           Set UNIX domain socket to be owned by the user named <u>name</u>.  Note that this requires that spamd be
           started as "root", and if "-u" is used, that user should have write permissions to unlink the
           file later, for when the "spamd" server is killed.

       <b>--socketgroup</b> <u>name</u>
           Set UNIX domain socket to be owned by the group named <u>name</u>.  See "--socketowner" for notes on
           ownership and permissions.

       <b>--socketmode</b> <u>mode</u>
           Set UNIX domain socket to use the octal mode <u>mode</u>.  Note that if "-u" is used, that user should
           have write permissions to unlink the file later, for when the "spamd" server is killed.
