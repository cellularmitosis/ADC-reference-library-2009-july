  Enterprise Objects Framework implements a default subclass of
  EOClassDescription in EOAccess, EOEntityClassDescription.
  EOEntityClassDescription extends the behavior of enterprise objects by
  deriving information about them (such as NULL constraints and referential
  integrity rules) from an associated EOModel.<p>
  <p>For more information on using EOClassDescription, the sections below
  can be referred</p>
  <h2>EOClassDescription.Concepts</h2><P>
  <h2>How Does It Work?</h2><p>
  As noted above, Enterprise Objects Framework implements a default subclass of
  EOClassDescription in EOAccess, EOEntityClassDescription. In the typical
  scenario in which an enterprise object has a corresponding model file,
  a particular operation (such as validating a value) results in the broadcast
  of an EOClassDescriptionNeeded... notification (an
  ClassDescriptionNeededForClassNotification or an
  ClassDescriptionNeededForEntityNameNotification ). When an EOModel object
  receives such a notification, it registers the metadata (class description)
  for the EOEntity on which the enterprise object is based. (EOModel and
  EOEntity are defined in EOAccess.)<P>
  An enterprise object takes advantage of the metadata registered for
  it by using the EOClassDescription related methods defined in the
  EOEnterpriseObject interface (and implemented in EOCustomObject and
  EOGenericRecord). Primary among these methods is classDescription,
  which returns the class description associated with the enterprise object.
  Through this class description the enterprise object has access to all
  of the information relating to its entity in a model file.<P>
  In addition to methods that return information based on an enterprise
  object's class description, the EOClassDescription related methods the
  EOEnterpriseObject interface defines include methods that are automatically
  invoked when a particular operation occurs. These include
  validation methods and methods that are invoked whenever an enterprise
  object is inserted or fetched.<P>
  <h2>Using EOClassDescription</h2>
  For the most part, you do not need to programmatically interact with
  EOClassDescription. It extends the behavior of the enterprise objects
  transparently. However, there are two cases in which you need to
  programmatically interact with it:<P>
  <UL>
  <LI>When the EOClassDescription related EOEnterpriseObject methods is
  overridden in an enterprise object class. These methods are used to
  perform validation and to intervene when enterprise objects based
  on EOModels are created and fetched. (The EOModel class is
  defined in EOAccess.) For objects that do not have EOModels, you can
  override a different set of EOEnterpriseObject methods; this is
  described in more detail in the section "Working with
  Objects That Don't Have EOModels" below.
  <LI>When a subclass of EOClassDescription is created</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Working with Objects That Don't Have EOModels</h2><p>
  Although an EOModel is the most common source of an EOClassDescription
  for a class, it isn't the only one. Objects that don't have an EOModel
  can implement EOClassDescription methods directly as instance methods,
  and the rest of the Framework will treat them just as it does enterprise
  objects that have this information provided by an external EOModel.<P>
  There are a few reasons you might want to do this. First of all, if
  the object implements the methods entityName, attributeKeys,
  toOneRelationshipKeys , and toOneRelationshipKeys, EOEditingContexts
  can snapshot the object and thereby provide undo for it.<P>
  Secondly, you might want to implement EOClassDescription's validation
  or referential integrity methods to add these features to the classes.
  <P>
  Implementing EOClassDescription methods on a per class basis in this
  way is a good alternative to creating a subclass of EOClassDescription.
  <P>
  <h2>EOEntityClassDescription</h2>
  There are only three methods in EOClassDescription that have meaningful
  implementations (that is, that don't either return null or simply
  return without doing anything): invalidateClassDescriptionCache,
  registerClassDescription, and propagateDeleteForObject. The default
  behavior of the rest of the methods in Enterprise Objects Framework
  comes from the implementation in the access layer's EOClassDescription
  subclass EOEntityClassDescription. the EOEntityClassDescription
  class specification can be referred to.
  <h2>The EOClassDescription's Delegate</h2>
  A delegate can be assigned to the EOClassDescription class.
  EOClassDescription sends the message shouldPropagateDeleteForObject
  to its delegate when delete propagation is about to take
  place for a particular object. The delegate can either allow or deny
  the operation for a specified relationship key. For more information, see the
  method description for shouldPropagateDeleteForObject.
