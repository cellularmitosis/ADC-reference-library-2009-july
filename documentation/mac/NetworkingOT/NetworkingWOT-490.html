 <B>port alias &nbsp;&nbsp;</B>A port structure flag that identifies a default port. For example, for LocalTalk, the port alias is a port name of "ltlk." Because it has the same STREAMS module name as the default LocalTalk port, if you use the port alias in the configuration string, Open Transport can locate the default port even in those cases where a computer doesn't use the standard default of "ltlkB." See also <B>default port.</B><P>
 <B>port name &nbsp;&nbsp;</B>A unique name that designates the port. It is typically an abbreviation of the port's device type plus a suffix, usually numeric, for example, "enet0," "enet1," and "enet2." For historic reasons, LocalTalk and serial ports use an alphabetic suffix instead. <P>

 <B>privileged options&nbsp;&nbsp;</B> Options whose values can be changed only by privileged clients, although it is sometimes possible for nonprivileged clients to read the value of a privileged option. The Mac OS does not distinguish between priviledged and nonpriviledged clients; so this distinction is irrelevant to Open Transport.<P>

 <B>session layer&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>  The layer of the OSI model that serves as an interface to the transport layer, which is below it. The session layer allows for establishing a session, which is the process of setting up a connection over which a dialog between two applications or processes can occur. Some of the functions that the session layer provides for are flow control, establishment of synchronization points for checks and recovery during file transfer, full-duplex and half-duplex dialogs between processes, and aborts and restarts. <P>

 <B>space&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The state into which a serial line is placed to signal data. Compare with mark.<P>
 <B>start bit&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>A signal that delineates a serial line's change from the mark state to a space. The start bit triggers the synchronization necessary for asynchronous communication.<P>
 <B>state dependence&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>  A condition of a networking protocol or connection in which the response to a request is dependent on a previous request. For example, before a workstation application connected to a file server can read a file, it must have first issued a request to open the file. <P>
 <B>statically assigned socket&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>An AppleTalk socket that is permanently reserved for a designated protocol or process. For example, socket 4 is always reserved as the echo socket, used for echoing packets across a network. Compare <B>dynamically assigned socket.</B><P>
 <B>stop bit&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>A signal that delineates the end of the character frame and places the serial line back into a mark state for a minimum specified time interval. This interval has one of several possible values: 1, 1.5, and 2 stop bits. <P>
 <B>STREAMS module&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>  A module that conforms to the STREAMS architecture. This architecture is a UNIX&#174; standard in which protocols and other service providers are implemented as software modules that communicate between each other using messages. Open Transport software modules are implemented as STREAMS modules. <P>
 <B>subnet&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>  A portion of a network, which is in turn a portion of an internet. <P>
 <B>subnet mask&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>  A number that can be used to determine what portion of an IP address is dedicated to the host identifier and what portion identifies the subnet. <P>

 <B>tr&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>ansaction<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>A process during which one endpoint, the <I>requester</I>, sends a request for a service. The remote endpoint, called the <I>responder</I>, reads the request, performs the service, and sends a reply. When the requester receives the reply, the transaction is complete.<P>
 <B>transaction-based protocol&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>A networking protocol that divides data transmission into transactions. Compare with <B>transactionless protocol.</B> <P>
 <B>transaction ID&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>A number that uniquely identifies a transaction.<P>
 <B>transactionless protocol&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>  A networking protocol that defines how the data is to be organized and delivered from one node to another but does notdivide the data up into transactions. Compare with <B>transaction-based protocol.</B> <P>

 <B>transport layer&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The layer of the OSI model that isolates some of the physical and functional aspects of a network from the upper three layers. It provides for end-to-end accountability, ensuring that all packets of data sent across the network are received and in the correct order. This process involves providing a means of identifying packet loss and supplying a retransmission mechanism. The transport layer may also provide connection and session management services. <P>
 <B>transport service data unit (TSDU)&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>A unit of data that allows an endpoint to separate a data stream into discrete logical units when sending and receiving data across a connection. A TSDU is the largest piece of data that an endpoint can transfer with boundaries and content preserved. Different types of endpoints and different endpoint implementations support different size TSDUs. See also <B>expedited transport service data unit</B> (ETSDU)<B>.</B><P>
