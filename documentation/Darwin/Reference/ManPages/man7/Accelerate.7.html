ACCELERATE(7)        BSD Miscellaneous Information Manual        ACCELERATE(7)

<b>NAME</b>
     <b>Accelerate</b> <b>vecLib</b> <b>vImage</b> <b>AltiVec</b> <b>vMathLib</b> <b>BLAS</b> <b>LAPACK</b> <b>vDSP</b> <b>vBigNum</b> <b>vBasicOps</b> <b>Vector</b> <b>Computation</b>
     <b>Velocity</b> <b>Engine</b> <b>Extended</b> <b>Math</b> <b>Library</b> -- This man page introduces the vector instruction set extensions
     to the PowerPC and Intel architectures known as AltiVec and SSE respectively, the Accelerate umbrella
     framework, its constituent libraries and programming support in Mac OS X.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
     The PowerPC and Intel vector instruction set architectures are based on a separate SIMD style execution
     unit with inherently high data parallelism.  This high degree of parallelism is enhanced with addi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tional&nbsp;additional</font>
     tional parallelism through superscalar dispatch to multiple execution units and execution unit pipe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lines.&nbsp;pipelines.</font>
     lines. Most vector instructions are designed to be fully pipelined with pipeline latencies no greater
     than corresponding operations in the scalar units.  Parallelism with the integer and floating-point
     instructions is enhanced for AltiVec due to relatively few data entanglements between the scalar units
     and the vector unit.

<b>Highlights</b>
     Fixed vector length of 128-bits (16 8-bit elements, 8 16-bit elements, or 4 32-bit elements.  SSE pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">vides&nbsp;provides</font>
     vides 64-bit integer and IEEE-754 floating point support as well.
     Signed and unsigned 8-, 16-, and 32-bit integers, and IEEE floating point values.
     Saturation arithmetic.
     32-register namespace (AltiVec) / 8- or 16-register namespace for SSE.
     No mode switching that would increase the overhead of using the instructions.
     4 operand, non-destructive instructions (AltiVec) / 2+1 operand operations (SSE)
     Operations selected based on utility to digital signal processing algorithms (including 2D and 3D image
     processing).

<b>Who</b> <b>benefits?</b>
     Many of the services provided by MacOS X (e.g., Quartz, QuickTime, OpenGL, CoreAudio) already exploit
     the vector acceleration available on Macintosh computers.  All MacOS X users enjoy these benefits.

     Many applications that run on MacOS X (e.g., iTunes, iMovie) have already been coded to use the vector
     libraries and vector instruction set.  Users of these applications enjoy the benefits of vector accel-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">eration.&nbsp;acceleration.</font>
     eration.

     Software developers who would like their code to use the vector facility on Macintosh computers may
     choose to:
     (1) Make explicit calls to entry points in the Accelerate framework.  Apple has optimized many of these
     routines for the vector engine (see the framework discussion that follows.)
     and/or (2) Program directly to the vector unit using the "Programming Interface Model."

     Note that a programmer must take explicit actions (as above) to engage the vector engine, otherwise it
     remains idle.

<b>Where</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>here:</b>
     Browse a comprehensive introduction to vector programming and the Accelerate framework:
     <a href="http://developer.apple.com/hardware/ve">http://developer.apple.com/hardware/ve</a>
     (includes pages and headers to enable rapid AltiVec &lt;-&gt; SSE translation.)

     Examine the prototypes for functions you can invoke:

     /System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework/Frameworks/*/Headers/*.h

     Include the interfaces in the code you write:

     #include   &lt;Accelerate/Accelerate.h&gt;

     Compile and link your code:

     AltiVec:  cc -faltivec -framework Accelerate file.c
     SSE:      cc  -framework Accelerate file.c (for SSE3 pass -msse3, for SSSE3 pass -mssse3)

<b>Accelerate</b> <b>Umbrella</b> <b>Framework</b>
     The Accelerate umbrella framework encompasses all the libraries provided with MacOS X that Apple has
     optimized for high performance vector and numerical computing.  Subsequent sections describe the sub-
     frameworks that comprise the Accelerate framework.

<b>vImage</b> <b>Framework</b>
     A collection of basic image processing filters such as Convolution, Morphological, and Geometric trans-
     forms. Alpha compositing and histogram operations are also supported, in addition to various conversion
     routines between different image formats.

<b>vecLib</b> <b>Framework</b>
     The vecLib framework is a collection of facilities covering digital signal processing (vDSP), matrix
     computations (BLAS), numerical linear algebra (LAPACK), mathematical routines (vMathLib), basic opera-
     tions (vBasicOps) and large number calculations (vBigNum).

     The vDSP, BLAS and LAPACK components of vecLib run on the scalar and vector domain.  vecLib automati-
     cally detects the presence of the vector engine and uses it.  vMathLib mirrors the existing scalar libm
     on the vector engine and vBasicOps is meant to complement the processor by providing more functionality
     such as a 32x32 vector integer multiply.  vBigNum, vBasicOps and vMathLib run only on the vector
     engine.

     There is also another matrix computation package in vecLib called vBasicOps.  It works somewhat in the
     same spirit as the BLAS.  It is best suited for small problems when the alignment is known ahead of
     time to avoid extra overhead.  In most cases, the use of BLAS instead of vectorOps is recommended.

<b>vDSP</b>
     The vDSP Library provides mathematical functions for applications such as speech, sound, audio, and
     video processing, diagnostic medical imaging, radar signal processing, seismic analysis, and scientific
     data processing.

     The vDSP functions operate on real and complex data types. The functions include data type conversions,
     fast Fourier transforms (FFTs), and vector-to-vector and vector-to-scalar operations.

     The vDSP functions have been implemented in two ways: as vectorized code, using the vector unit on the
     PowerPC and Intel microprocessors, and as scalar code, which runs on all machines. Vector code often
     has special alignment restrictions. If your data is not properly aligned it is common for vDSP to use
     the scalar path as a fallback. For best results, align your data to a multiple of 16 bytes.  (Malloc
     naturally aligns memory blocks that it allocates to 16 bytes on MacOS X.)

     It is noteworthy that vDSP's FFTs are one of the fastest implementations of the Discrete Fourier Trans-
     forms available anywhere.

     The vDSP Library itself is included as part of vecLib in Mac OS X.  The header file, vDSP.h, defines
     data types used by the vDSP functions and symbols accepted as flag arguments to vDSP functions.

     vDSP functions are available in single and double precision.  Note that only the single precision is
     vectorized on PowerPC due to the underlying instruction set architecture of the vector engine on board
     G4 and G5 processors. The Intel vector unit supports both single and double precision, so double preci-
     sion operations can be vectorized on Intel processors.

     For more information about vDSP download the instructions and sample code from &lt;<a href="http://developer.apple.com/hardware/ve/download_summary.html">http://devel-</a>
     <a href="http://developer.apple.com/hardware/ve/download_summary.html">oper.apple.com/hardware/ve/download_summary.html</a>

<b>BLAS</b>
     The Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines (BLAS) are high quality routines for performing basic vector and
     matrix operations. Level 1 BLAS consists of vector-vector operations, Level 2 BLAS consists of matrix-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">vector&nbsp;matrixvector</font>
     vector operations, and Level 3 BLAS have matrix-matrix operations.  The efficiency, portability, and
     the wide adoption of the BLAS have made them commonplace in the development of high quality linear
     algebra software such as LAPACK and in  other technologies requiring fast vector and matrix calcula-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tions.&nbsp;calculations.</font>
     tions.  All the industry standard FORTRAN BLAS entry points and the standard C BLAS entry points are
     exported from the vecLib framework (the latter are  commonly denoted the legacy C BLAS.)  For more
     information refer to &lt;<a href="http://www.netlib.org/blas/faq.html">http://www.netlib.org/blas/faq.html</a>

<b>LAPACK</b>
     LAPACK provides routines for solving systems of simultaneous linear equations, least-squares solutions
     of linear systems of equations, eigenvalue problems, and singular value problems.  The associated
     matrix factorizations (LU, Cholesky, QR, SVD, Schur, generalized Schur) are also provided, as are
     related computations such as reordering of the Schur factorizations and estimating condition numbers.
     Dense and banded matrices are handled, but not general sparse matrices. In all areas, similar function-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ality&nbsp;functionality</font>
     ality is provided for real and complex matrices, in both single and double precision.  LAPACK in vecLib
     makes full use of the optimized BLAS and fully benefits from their performance.  All the industry stan-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dard&nbsp;standard</font>
     dard FORTRAN LAPACK entry points are exported from the vecLib framework.  C programs may make calls to
     the FORTRAN entry points using the prototypes set out in "/System/Library/Frameworks/vecLib.frame-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">work/Headers/clapack.h".&nbsp;"/System/Library/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Headers/clapack.h".</font>
     work/Headers/clapack.h".

     For more information refer to &lt;<a href="http://www.netlib.org/lapack/index.html">http://www.netlib.org/lapack/index.html</a>.

     BLAS and LAPACK follow fortran calling conventions (even from C). Users must be aware that:

     ALL arguments must be passed by reference.  This includes all scalar arguments such as matrix dimension
     M and N, further note there is a difference in the memory arrangement of a two-dimensional array in
     Fortran and C.

     For more information refer to &lt;<a href="http://www.netlib.org/clapack/readme">http://www.netlib.org/clapack/readme</a>.

<b>vBasicOps</b>
     A collection of basic operations such as add, subtract, multiply and divide that complement the vector
     processor's basic operations up to 128 bits.  Consult "/System/Library/Frameworks/vecLib.frame-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">work/Headers/vBasicOps.h"&nbsp;"/System/Library/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Headers/vBasicOps.h"</font>
     work/Headers/vBasicOps.h" for further information.

<b>vBigNum</b>
     Routines for large number calculations from 128 bits.  Consult "/System/Library/Frame-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">works/vecLib.framework/Headers/vBigNum.h"&nbsp;"/System/Library/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Headers/vBigNum.h"</font>
