Although the name implies that the SE/30 borrowsmany characteristics from the SE, there are actually substantial differencesbetween the two machines, and this Note addresses some of those differences.</p><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><a name="Section1"></a><H2>Similarities Between the Macintosh SE and SE/30</H2><p>The main similarities between the SE and the SE/30 are as follows:</p><ul type="circle">	<li>compact design</li>	<li>power supply</li>	<li>analog board</li>	<li>rear housing</li>	<li>SCSI support</li>	<li>ADB support</li>	<li>nine inch video display</li></ul><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><a name="Section2"></a><H2>Differences Between the Macintosh SE and SE/30</H2><p>There are, however, many differences between the two machines.  This sectioncovers those differences with respect to their impact on developers.</p><h3>CPU</h3><p>The Motorola 68030 on the Macintosh SE/30 is clocked at 15.6672 MHz andprovides both 32-bit data and address buses, both 256-byte instruction and datacaches, and a built-in Paged Memory Management Unit (PMMU).  The 68000 in theMacintosh SE is clocked at 7.83 MHz.</p><p>Although the 68030 is capable of a burst mode to more efficiently accesscontiguous blocks of memory, this feature is not enabled on the MacintoshSE/30.  Enabling this feature would require significantly more complex controllogic and faster (read "more expensive") RAM.</p><h3>Coprocessor</h3><p>The Motorola 68882 on the Macintosh SE/30 offers a full implementation of theIEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic.  The 68882 has an optimizedMPU interface that provides up to 1.5 times the performance of the 68881.  TheMacintosh SE does not ship with a coprocessor (although third-partycoprocessors are available).</p><h3>ROM</h3><p>The Macintosh SE/30 ROM is identical to that of the Macintosh IIx; it includesColor QuickDraw, the Slot Manager, and other features of the IIx ROM.  It iscomposed of four 512 Kbit ROMs, for a total of 256K, and it is mounted on oneROM SIMM (ROM SIMMs are expandable to 2 MB).</p><p>System Software 6.0.3 (and later) patches to the ROM affect the Start Manager,the OS utilities, and the Sony driver.</p><h3>RAM</h3><p>The SE/30 includes eight RAM SIMM slots like the Macintosh II family andsupports from 1 MB up to 128 MB (using 16 MB SIMMs), however, the currentSystem Software only supports the first eight megabytes of RAM.  The SE/30 alsosupports 4 MB DRAMs.  For more information on memory configuration, seeMacintosh Technical Note #176, Macintosh Memory Configurations.</p><h3>Video</h3><p>The Macintosh SE/30 video architecture is compatible with the SE: one-bit perpixel monochrome display with 342 lines of 512 pixels each.  There is 64K ofhigh-speed video display RAM to maximize video performance.  The video providesdual display buffers of 21,888 bytes for fast page switching: the primarybuffer starts at $FEE08040 and ends at $FEE0D5C0, and the alternate bufferstarts at $FEE00040 and ends at $FEE055C0.  The physical address of the videobuffers simulates the NuBus address of slot $E on the Macintosh II family.</p><p>Developers need to be cautious with this video implementation, since a call to<code>_SysEnvirons</code> returns true for <code>hasColorQD</code> (since ColorQuickDraw is implemented in the SE/30 ROM), but the default configuration onlyincludes a single monochrome display.</p><p>As with any machine which supports Color QuickDraw, your application shouldtest for the specific functionality which it needs, keeping in mind thatdifferent capabilities may be present on devices other than the main display.For example, an application which requires eight or more bits of color may dothe following:</p><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=550><TR>	<td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><pre>    gotOne := FALSE;                    {Assume we'll fail}    aDevice := GetMainDevice;                {Get the first device}    WHILE (aDevice &lt;&gt; NIL) AND (NOT gotOne) DO        IF (aDevice^^.gdPMap^^.pixelSize &gt;= 8) AND    {Do we have &gt;= 8 bits?}           (BitTest(@aDevice^^.gdFlags,15)) THEN    {And are we color?}            gotOne := TRUE            {Yes! We're done}        ELSE            aDevice := GetNextDevice(aDevice);    {Try next device}    IF gotOne THEN            {We have a screen to use. Maybe put our window up             within aDevice^^.gdRect}</pre>	</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><h3>Processor Direct Slot Expansion</h3><p>The Processor Direct Slot (PDS) in the SE/30 is significantly different fromthe PDS in the SE.  The 68000 PDS in the SE provides a 16-bit bus, whereas the68030 PDS in the SE/30 provides both a 32-bit data bus and a 32-bit addressbus.  Access to the full 32-bit data bus allows for higher performanceexpansion cards than the 16-bit bus of the PDS in the SE.  In addition, many ofthe expansion cards built for the PDS in the SE were hard-wired to the 7.83 MHzclock speed.  Since the clock speed in the SE/30 is 15.6672 MHz, there arefundamental incompatibilities in clock speed, and therefore expansion carddesign.</p><p>The PDS in the SE/30 is a 120-pin, 32-bit PDS which provides both "common" and"machine-specific" signals.  The common signals will be available across all68030 PDS implementations, while the machine-specific signals will be availableon future 68030 PDS implementations and may have new features added.  On theSE/30, the machine-specific signals emulate equivalent signals on the NuBusexpansion interface.  This emulation means that expansion cards on the SE/30may take advantage of the Slot Manager in ROM to communicate with the bus via aDeclaration ROM on the card.</p><p>Connectors for the PDS may be obtained from AMP (part number 535022-1).</p><p>Prototyping cards for the PDS may be obtained from:</p><p>    Creative Solutions<br>    4701 Randolph, Suite 12<br>    Rockville, Md  20852<br>    Attn:  Chris Colburn<br>    (301) 984-0262</p><h3>Disclaimer:</h3>    <P>This listing for Creative Solutions neither implies norconstitutes an endorsement by Apple Computer, Inc.  If your company suppliesthese cards and you would like to be listed, contact us at the address inTechnical Note #0.</p><p>The chassis design of the SE/30 simplifies expansion card installation as cardsmay be mounted vertically instead of horizontally, as in the SE.  Because ofthis orientation, expansion cards can be installed without removing the logicboard.  In addition, there is more room for expansion cards in the SE/30 thanin the SE.</p><h3>System Software Requirements</h3><p>The SE/30 requires System Software version 6.0.3 or later.  Beginning withversion 6.0.3, the installer shipped with the System Software includes aspecific script for the SE/30.</p><h3>Internal Floppy Drive</h3><p>All configurations of the Macintosh SE/30 ship with an internal FDHD (FloppyDrive, High Density) floppy drive (a.k.a., SuperDrive) controlled by the SWIMcontroller chip.  The SWIM chip is capable of supporting 720K and 1.44 MBModified Frequency Modulation (MFM) formats (i.e., MS-DOS 3.5" disks), as wellas the 400K and 800K Group Coded Recording (GCR) formats (Macintosh and AppleII 3.5" ProDOS disks) and the 1.4 MB MFM format (Macintosh 3.5" high-densitydisks).  Note that special disks are required to take advantage of the 1.44 MBand 1.4 MB MFM formats.  These disks have a square cutout in the top leftcorner to differentiate them from standard floppy disks.  These disks may<b>not</b> be used in standard floppy drives (i.e., 400K and 800K) in theMacintosh family.</p><p>Although the SE is capable of supporting two internal 800K floppy drives, theSE/30 only supports a single internal FDHD drive.</p><h3>External Floppy Drive</h3><p>The SE/30 provides support for an external 800K floppy drive; it does notsupport the external 400K floppy drive or the external HD20 hard disk.</p><h3>SCSI</h3><p>The SE/30 uses the same 53C80 and interface logic as the IIx.  This combinationsupports pseudo-DMA burst transfers, and SCSI performance matches that of theIIx.</p><h3>_SysEnvirons</h3><p>On the SE/30, <code>_SysEnvirons</code> version 2 returns 7 in the<code>machineType</code> field and 4 in the <code>processor</code> field.  For moreinformation about <code>_SysEnvirons</code>, see Macintosh Technical Note #129,_SysEnvirons:  System 6.0 and Beyond.</p><h3>Sound</h3><p>The SE/30 uses the Apple Sound Chip, rather than the discrete sound circuitryof the SE.  Although the circuitry provides stereo output to the speaker jack,as of System Software 6.0.3, stereo sound is <b>not</b> implemented, so truestereo is not yet available.  The internal speaker of the SE/30 uses a mixedsignal from both channels, whereas a Macintosh II uses a signal from only onechannel.</p><h3>Clock</h3><p>The battery is not soldered to the motherboard and is replaceable.</p><h3>General</h3><p>All positive 5.0 volt outputs from the SE/30 (ADB, floppy drive, SCSI) are fuseprotected from overloads.  The maximum current that an external deviceconnected to these ports can draw is 800 mA.</p><h3>Upgrade Kits</h3><p>Apple will offer several SE-to-SE/30 upgrade kits for current SE owners in theSpring of 1989.  However, installation of these upgrade kits will prevent theowner from using any current SE expansion cards.</p><p>The first upgrade kit consists of the following:</p><ul type="circle">	<li>Logic board with 1 MB RAM</li>	<li>Chassis</li>	<li>EMI shroud</li>	<li>Ferrite bead for power cable</li>	<li>SE disk drive slot cover and retainer clip (for second floppy drive, if</li>	<li>necessary)</li>	<li>Owner's Manual</li></ul><p>The dealer performing the upgrade is required to return the SE logic board with1 MB RAM to Apple.  A separate upgrade kit is available to upgrade the internalfloppy drive to the FDHD.  This kit is optional, since the SWIM chip on theSE/30 logic board is capable of controlling the 800K floppy drive of the SE.However, upgraded SEs with two internal floppy drives will <b>not</b> be ableto access the second drive, since the SE/30 only supports <b>one</b> internalfloppy drive.</p><h3>Software Compatibility</h3><p>Apple's Product Quality and Support (PQ&amp;S) department has tested over 100of the most popular software packages on the SE/30 and has found that with thelatest versions of these applications, 95% are completely compatible with theSE/30.  Apple notified those developers whose tested packages were determinedto be incompatible, and they are expected to announce upgrades in the nearfuture.</p><p>Information on which packages were and were not compatible is <b>not </b> available, however, most of the incompatibilities were determined to be due toan application making assumptions about the hardware which were not true on theSE/30.  In general, applications which call <code>_SysEnvirons</code> to determinethe current hardware configuration are compatible.</p><h3>For Further Information...</h3><p>You can get further information about developing for the SE/30 from APDA.
