<TITLE> WODisplayGroup, EOEditingContext, and Enterprise Objects</TITLE>

<TABLE><TR><TD WIDTH = 75><TD WIDTH = 400><HR WIDTH = 400> <H1><A NAME="REF40727">WODisplayGroup, EOEditingContext, <BR>and Enterprise Objects </A></H1>                                                
                                                                              
<P>WebObjects applications that access a database use two things that most other              
 WebObjects applications don't, the Enterprise Objects Framework and a WODisplayGroup instance.                                                                        
<P>The Enterprise Objects Framework represents items in your database as objects              
 (enterprise objects). To begin creating a database application, you use the EOModeler application that comes with the Enterprise Objects Framework to create an             
 entity-relationship model. (The Database Wizard can help you create a model.) You          
 create an <i>entity</i> for each table in the database. For each entity, you create attributes    
 that map to the columns in the table. Each entity in turn maps to an enterprise            
 object, which means you can access that entity as an object. The columns in the            
 database's table become the enterprise object's instance variables.                        
<P>When you add an entity to a WebObjects application (either by selecting it in the          
 wizard or by dragging it from EOModeler), it creates a WODisplayGroup. The                 
 WODisplayGroup manages objects associated with a single entity. For example, if            
 you choose the Movie entity, the resulting WODisplayGroup operates on Movie                
 objects. Note, however, that you can also access other kinds of objects through a          
 Movie object's relationships. For example, if a relationship between a MOVIE table         
 and a STUDIO table can be expressed with a join, you could access Studio objects           
 associated with a particular Movie object.                                                 
<P>For more information on creating models, see the chapter "Using EOModeler" in              
 <i>Enterprise Objects Framework Developer's Guide</i>.                                            
<P>The WODisplayGroup has methods that can perform almost any operation on a                  
 database. A WODisplayGroup can fetch, insert, update, delete, and find records in          
 the database as well as manage batches of search results. Thus, WODisplayGroup             
 allows you to create a database application without writing much or any code. All          
 you have to do is bind your dynamic elements to methods in the WODisplayGroup.             
 For a list of commonly used methods and what they do, see "<A HREF="WODisplayGroupMethods.html#REF70199">Common WODisplay                
 Group Methods</A>."                                                                            
<P>WODisplayGroup uses an EOEditingContext to manage the graph of enterprise                  
 objects in your application. The EOEditingContext is stored in the session (WOSes          
 sion instance) as the variable <b>defaultEditingContext</B>. You generally can't see the          
 EOEditingContext in WebObjects Builder, but some of the scripts created by the             
 Database Wizard reference this object. The EOEditingContext is responsible for             
 ensuring that all parts of your application stay in sync. You need to access the           
 EOEditingContext if your application can update database records---you use the             
 EOEditingContext to save the changes.                                                      
 To learn more about how to create a WebObjects database application, work                  
 through the Movies tutorial in <i><A HREF="../../GettingStarted/GettingStartedTOC.html">Getting Started</A></i>. The Movies tutorial teaches you how        
 to use Enterprise Objects with WebObjects. For more detailed information on                
 Enterprise Objects, read the <i>Enterprise Objects Framework Developer's Guide</i>.
