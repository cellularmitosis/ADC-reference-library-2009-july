Êð QuickDraw 3D Ð SimpleViewerShows how to set up and use a QuickDraw 3D viewer object.  If all you need is to be able to display 3DMF metafiles in your application, this is the place to start.  Although this is a limited application in terms of functionality (it is pretty much just the basic five calls needed for the viewer - create, delete, set data, draw and handle event - with the addition of support for cut and paste) it is a complete app, in the sense that it checks that the platform is PPC and uses gestalt to check to see if the viewer shared library is installed.Nick ThompsonDeveloper Support (DEVSUPPORT)AppleLink: NICKT
