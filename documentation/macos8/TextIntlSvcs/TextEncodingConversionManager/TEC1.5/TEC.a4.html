ISO 646, an international standard. It is similar to ASCII, except that for ten code points (corresponding to ASCII characters @ [ \ ] ^ ` { | } ~ ) it does not designate a specific character, and for two other code points (corresponding to ASCII characters $ # ) it allows either of two specified characters. National variants are defined by designating some of these code points to represent specific non-ASCII characters needed for a particular language. A sender and receiver can agree on a particular variant; in the absence of such an agreement, ISO specifies an international reference version, which is now the same as ASCII. For example, the Japanese national variant (known as JIS Roman) replaces ASCII \ with &#165; , and replaces ASCII ~ with _ .<P>

ISO 8859-x. This international standard has multiple parts. ISO 8859-1 is well known as Latin-1, the most common encoding on the Web. ISO 8859 includes other Latin parts, such as Latin-5 (ISO 8859-9, used for Turkish), as well as parts for Cyrillic, Greek, Arabic, Hebrew, and other scripts. These adhere to the ISO 8-bit structure: The range 0x00-0x1F is reserved for C0 controls, 0x20 is SPACE, the range 0x21-0x7E is identical to ASCII, x7F is DELETE, the range 0x80-0x9F is reserved for C1 controls, and the range 0xA0-0xFF contains a 96-character G1 set that depends on the 8859 part.<P>

ASCII-based vendor character sets for non-East-Asian scripts: DOS code pages such as 437, Windows code pages such as 1252, Mac OS character sets, and so on. These support the ASCII graphic characters directly, but they typically do not follow the full 8-bit structure used for ISO standards; for example, they typically encode graphic characters in the C1 area. Windows 1252, for example, is ISO 8859-1 plus additional characters in the C1 area.<P>

National standards such as TIS (Thai Industrial Standard) 620-2533 and JIS (Japanese Industrial Standard) X0201. JIS X0201, for example, combines JIS Roman with a set of Katakana and punctuation characters in the range 0xA1-0xDF.<P>

EBCDIC character sets used on IBM mainframes and midrange machines. The layout is based on Hollerith card codes, and is quite different from ASCII. The basic Latin letters are in six discontiguous ranges a-i, j-r, s-z, A-I, J-R, S-Z, all with code points above 0x80; control characters are 0x00-0x3F and 0xFF. The original EBCDIC-US had a graphic character repertoire somewhat different from ASCII: it did not include square brackets or a circumflex accent, but did include cent sign, broken bar, not sign, and no-break space; it also had 95 undefined code points scattered about. Fourteen of the original EBCDIC-US code points could be changed for national variants (as with ISO 646). Newer versions of EBCDIC fill in the undefined code points with characters from ISO 8859-1 or other standards.<P>

Japan: The original Japanese 2-byte national standard was JIS C6226-1978. This was significantly revised as JIS X0208-1983, with a minor update in 1990. It includes punctuation and symbols (some specific to CJK or to Japanese), Hiragana, Katakana, and 6356 Kanji (Han), as well as basic letters for Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic (all in 2-byte form). JIS X0212 (1990) is an add-on set with additional Kanji (5801), additional Latin characters, and so forth. JIS C6226 provided a model for other East Asia national standards.<P>

China: GB 2312-1980 is the basic national standard, with 6763 Hanzi (Han), punctuation and symbols, Katakana, Hiragana, basic Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic, plus Bopomofo.<P>

Korea: KSC 5601-1987 is the most widely known of the Korean national standards. It includes 2350 composed Hangul syllables, 4620 distinct Hanja (Han), punctuation and symbols, Katakana, Hiragana, basic Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic; some of the Hanja are encoded multiple times, once for each pronunciation. This standard was updated in 1992; the basic standard was not significantly changed, but a new annex defined a complete &quot;Johab&quot; set of the 11,172 possible composed Hangul syllables.<P>

Taiwan: CNS 11643-1992 defines a set of 2-byte standards, something like the parts of ISO 8859. Each part is called a plane, and the standard defines 16 planes. Only 7 planes currently have character assignments; altogether they include 48,027 Hanzi and ~700 other characters.<P>

CCCII (Chinese Character Code for Information Interchange): The high-order value specifies the plane; planes are grouped into sets of 6, called layers. The first layer (53,016 code points) contains basic characters; most of the other layers are reserved for variant forms, which are assigned code points that correspond to the position of the equivalent basic character. The remaining layers contain Kana and Hangul (for Japanese and Korean).<P>
