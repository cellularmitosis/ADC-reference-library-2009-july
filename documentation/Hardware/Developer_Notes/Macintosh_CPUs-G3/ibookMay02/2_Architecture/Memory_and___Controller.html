Insome models, the expansion slot is occupied by a 128-MB SO-DIMMfor a total of 256 MB of system RAM. </p><p>The data bus to the RAM and DIMM is 64 bits wide, and thememory interface is synchronized to the 60x bus interface. See also  <a sector="mod" href="../4_Expansion/iRAM_Expansion.html" target="_top">"RAM Expansion"</a>. </p><br><a name = "TPXREF106"></a><h3><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Boot ROM</font></h3><p>The boot ROM includes the hardware-specific code and tablesneeded to start up the computer, to load an operating system, andto provide common hardware access services.</p><p>The boot ROM is connected to the card slot interface of thePangea IC. The boot ROM is a 1 M by 8 bit flash device and can beupdated in the field. </p><br><a name = "TPXREF107"></a><h3><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Ethernet Controller </font></h3><p>The Pangea IC includes an Ethernet media access controller(MAC) that implements the Link layer. As a separate channel connecteddirectly to the Pangea logic, it can operate at its full capacitywithout degrading the performance of other peripheral devices. The PangeaIC provides DB-DMA support for the Ethernet interface. </p><p>The controller is connected to a PHY interface IC that iscapable of operating in either 10-BaseT or 100-BaseTX mode. Theactual speed of the link is automatically negotiated by the PHYand the bridge or router to which it is connected. For informationabout the connector and the operation of the port, see  <a sector="mod" href="../3_Input-Output/iEthernet_Port_.html" target="_top">"Ethernet Port"</a>. </p><br><a name = "TPXREF108"></a><h3><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">FireWire Controller</font></h3><p>The Pangea IC includes an IEEE 1394 FireWire controller witha maximum data rate of 400 Mbits (50MBytes) per second. The PangeaIC provides DMA (direct memory access) support for the FireWireinterface. The FireWire controller complies with the Open Host ControllerInterface (OHCI) specification. </p><p>The controller IC implements the FireWire link layer. A physicallayer IC, called a PHY, implements the electrical signalling protocolof the FireWire interface. The PHY is the interface to the externalconnector. For information about the connector and the operation ofthe port, see  <a sector="mod" href="../3_Input-Output/iFireWire_Port.html" target="_top">"FireWire Port"</a>. </p><br><a name = "BCIIEBGI"></a><h3><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Graphics IC</font></h3><p>The graphics IC is an ATI RAGE Mobility 128. It provides videofor both the internal flat panel display and an external compositevideo monitor. The RAGE Mobility 128 also supports a VGA video outputport. </p><p>The RAGE Mobility 128 IC includes 8 MB of SDRAM and supportsa display size of 1024 by 768 pixels. The graphics IC also has ascaling mode that displays a 640-by-480 or 800-by-600 pixel imageon the full screen. </p><p>The RAGE Mobility 128 IC also has a 3D graphics engine forfaster rendering of 3D objects. </p><p>The display generated for the flat panel display is simultaneouslyavailable for an external monitor. See  <a sector="mod" href="../3_Input-Output/iComposite_Video_Output.html" target="_top">"Composite Video Output"</a> and  <a sector="mod" href="../3_Input-Output/iVGA_Video_Output.html" target="_top">"VGA Video Output"</a>. </p><p>Because the graphics IC uses the AGP bus, it can use partof main memory as additional graphics storage. The computer'svirtual memory system organizes main memory as randomly-distributed4 KB pages, so DMA transactions for more than 4 KB of data would haveto perform scatter-gather operations. To avoid this necessity forgraphics storage, the AGP logic in the Pangea IC uses a graphicsaddress remapping table (GART) to translate a linear address spacefor AGP transactions into physical addresses in main memory. </p><br><a name = "TPXREF109"></a><h3><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Ultra DMA IDE Bus</font></h3><p>The Pangea IC provides an Ultra DMA IDE (integrated driveelectronics) channel that is connected to the internal hard diskdrive and the CD or DVD drive. The Ultra DMA IDE interface, alsocalled Ultra-DMA/33 and ATA-4, is an improved version of the EIDE interface.The Pangea IC provides DB-DMA (descriptor-based direct memory access) supportfor the Ultra DMA interface.</p><p>The internal hard disk drive is connected as device 0 (master)in an ATA Device 0/1 configuration. The CD or DVD drive is connectedas device 1 (slave). Digital audio data from the CD or DVD driveis processed by the Sound Manager and then sent out through thePangea IC to the sound IC. </p><br><a name = "TPXREF110"></a><h3><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">USB Interface</font></h3><p>The Pangea IC implements two independent USB controllers (roothubs), each of which is connected to one of the ports on the sidepanel of the computer. The use of two independent controllers allowsboth USB ports to support high data rate devices at the same timewith no degradation of their performance. If a user connects a high-speed (12Mbps) device to one port and another high-speed device to the other,both devices can operate at their full data rates.</p><p>The external USB connectors support USB devices with datatransfer rates of 1.5 Mbps and 12 Mbps. For more information, see  <a sector="mod" href="../3_Input-Output/iUSB_Ports.html" target="_top">"USB Ports"</a>. </p><p>USB devices connected to the iBook computer are required tosupport USB-suspend mode as defined in the USB specification. Informationabout the operation of USB-suspend mode on Macintosh computers isincluded in the Mac OS USB DDK API Reference. To obtain that document,please see the references at  <a sector="mod" href="../A_References/iUSB_Interface.html" target="_top">"USB Interface"</a>. </p><p>The USB ports on the iBook computer comply with the UniversalSerial Bus Specification 1.1 Final Draft Revision. The USB controllerscomply with the Open Host Controller Interface (OHCI) specification. </p><br><a name = "TPXREF111"></a><h3><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Modem Support </font></h3><p>The internal modem is connected to an internal USB port. TheKeyLargo IC provides DB-DMA support for the modem interface. Themodem provides digital call progress signals to the Tumbler soundcircuitry. </p><p>The internal modem is a separate module that contains thedatapump IC and the interface to the telephone line (DAA). The controllerfunctions are performed by the main processor. See  <a sector="mod" href="../3_Input-Output/iInternal_Modem_.html" target="_top">"Internal Modem"</a></p><br><a name = "TPXREF112"></a><h3><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Sound Circuitry </font></h3><p>The iBook computer has new sound circuitry, called Tumbler,that is connected to the Pangea IC by a standard I2S bus. The PangeaIC provides DB-DMA (descriptor-based direct memory access) supportfor the I2S port. </p><p>The sound circuitry includes a signal processing IC that handlesthe equalization and volume control functions and a codec IC thatperforms A-to-D and D-to-A conversion. </p><p>All audio is handled digitally inside the computer. The Tumblercircuitry performs digital-to-analog conversion for the audio signalsto the internal speakers and the headphone jack. The Tumbler circuitryalso provides parametric equalization for the internal speakers. </p><p>Modem progress audio is connected as a digital input to thesound circuitry so that it can be mixed into the sound output stream.The modem progress audio is processed as play-through only, notas a digital sound source. </p><p>The iBook has no dedicated sound input jack. The sound systemsupports the built-in microphone and other sound input by way ofa USB microphone or other USB audio device. For information aboutsound system operation, see  <a sector="mod" href="../3_Input-Output/iSound_System.html" target="_top">"Sound System"</a>. </p><br><a name = "BCIBBDBH"></a><h3><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Power Control IC </font></h3><p>The power manager IC in the iBook computer is a MitsubishiM16C/62F microprocessor, also called the PMU99. It operates withits own RAM and ROM. The functions of the PMU99 include: </p><ul><li>controllingthe sleep and power on and off sequences</font></li><li>controlling power to the other ICs</font></li><li>monitoring the battery charge level </font></li><li>controlling battery charging</font></li><li>supporting the interface to the built-in keyboard and trackpad</font></li></ul><p>The iBook computer can operate from a 15-volt power outleton an airliner, but the voltage available is not high enough forcharging the battery. So that the computer can detect the connectionto the airliner power, the airliner power cable has a sense resistorof approximately 25K ohms connected between the power plug's shelland ground. </p><p>The PMU99 also provides the hardware interface to the keyboardand trackpad. Software in the PMU99 IC scans the keyboard and receivesdata from the trackpad, then sends the data to the system in packetslike those from the ADB. To the system, the keyboard and trackpadbehave as if they were ADB devices. </p><br><a name = "TPXREF113"></a><h3><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">AirPort Card Wireless LAN Module</font></h3><p>The AirPort Card wireless LAN module shares card slot interfaceto the Pangea IC with the boot ROM. </p><p>The AirPort Card contains a media access controller (MAC),a digital signal processor (DSP), and a radio-frequency (RF) section.The card has a connector for the cable to the antennas, which arebuilt into the computer's case. </p><p>The AirPort Card is based on the IEEE 802.11B standard. Thecard transmits and receives data at up to 11 Mbps and is compatiblewith older 802.11-standard systems that operate at 2 or 1 Mbps.For information about its operation, see  <a sector="mod" href="../3_Input-Output/iAirPort_Card.html" target="_top">"AirPort Card"</a>. </p><p></p><br><a href="Microprocessor_and_Cache_.html" target="content"><img src="../images/previous.gif" border="0"></a><a href="../3_Input-Output/index.html" target="_top"><img src="../images/next.gif" border="0"></a>&nbsp;<br><br><p><hr><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">&#169; 2002 Apple Computer, Inc.
