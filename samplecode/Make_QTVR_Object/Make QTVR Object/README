Notes on QTVRObjectMaker:If the application is in drop mode (by selecting Drop Mode in the File menu), any movies which are droppped onto QTVRObjectMaker will be automatically turned into object movies with the parameters specified in the Preferences.  These values can be changed in the Set Preferences... menu or by creating a single object movie using the Add Navigable Data menu item.If you are in drop mode and you drop an object movie onto QTVRObjectMaker, it will be ignored.  QTVRObjectMaker will not change its movie values.  If the app is not in drop mode, the movie will be loaded and played.  Note that if a panoramic movie is dropped on QTVRObjectMaker, an error message will result.  This will halt processing of the entire batch of dropped files until OK is pressed.Otherwise, this app behaves exactly the same as NavigableMoviePlayer.
