<P>                                                                                 
 The script window shows you the current component's script. All of the variables and methods shown in the <A HREF="ObjectBrowser.html">object browser</A> are declared in the script.                                       
<P>To open the script window, choose Tools-&gt;Script-&gt;Scripts or press the script button on the        
 component window.                                                                                 
<P>The script window changes its display as the main window changes. If the main window is           
 a component window, the script window shows you that component's script. If the main window is the application window and the application tab is selected, the script window shows        
 you application script. Similarly, if the session tab is selected, the script window shows you    
 the session script.                                                                               
<P>When you're editing a script, be careful that you are editing the correct script. Check the       
 window's titlebar to see which script you are editing.
