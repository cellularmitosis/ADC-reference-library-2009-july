    DragWindow is an INIT that replaces the old DragWindow routine in the Mac    with a new one that allows you to drag the window itself (you still get to    see the window contents) instead of dragging an ouline of a window.    Put the file DragWindoww INIT in your System Folder and restart, next time    you drag a window in any application it will really be the window and not just    its outline.    By Ricardo Batista, 06/15/90
