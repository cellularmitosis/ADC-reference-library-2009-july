You may need to have more than one instance of agiven application to support a large number of concurrent users.  <a href="#BBCJHEBG">Figure 4-1</a> illustratesa simple site, implemented with one computer. It serves two applications,with two instances for each application.</p><br><a name = "BBCJHEBG"></a><p><b><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">Figure4-1 Deployment on one computer, usingone adaptor</font></b></p> <img src = "../art/onemachine.gif" alt = "[image: ../art/onemachine.gif]"><p>Although the WebObjects installation provides several HTTPadaptors, only one is active by default (see  <a sector="mod" href="../Installation/iDefault_Ada_nstallation.html" target="_top">"Default Adaptor Installation"</a> fordetails). However, an application instance can communicate withan adaptor other than the active adaptor.</p><p> <a href="#BBCGGDDA">Figure 4-2</a> depicts an application site running on one computer,using two adaptors.</p><br><a name = "BBCGGDDA"></a><p><b><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">Figure4-2 Deployment on one computer using twoadaptors</font></b></p> <img src = "../art/onemachinetwoadaptors.gif" alt = "[image: ../art/onemachinetwoadaptors.gif]"><p>Most sites require multiple computers to ensure that an instanceof a particular application is always available. In this kind ofdeployment, usually one computer runs the HTTP server and the HTTPadaptor, while one or more additional computers serve as application hosts.  <a href="#BBCGJGGA">Figure 4-3</a> illustratesan application site using three computers, one running the HTTPserver and the adaptor, and the other two running application instances.</p><br><a name = "BBCGJGGA"></a><p><b><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">Figure4-3 Deployment using three computers usingone adaptor</font></b></p> <img src = "../art/multiplemachines.gif" alt = "[image: ../art/multiplemachines.gif]"><p>The HTTP adaptor needs to periodically determine your site'sstate&#151;which application instances are running. There are two waysin which the adaptor can obtain this information:</p><ul><li><b>Dynamically</b> Theadaptor determines your site's state by asking each applicationhost for its state. The adaptor can use a multicast request to findout which hosts are available or you can define a host list forit. Using this method, you avoid having to configure new hosts asyou add them to your site.</font></li><li><b>From a static file</b> An adaptor configurationfile contains host and application information about your site;it includes information about every application instance you wantto run. After the adaptor reads the file, it has all the informationit needs to communicate with the application instances you wantto run. Using this kind of configuration avoids multicast requestsand host polling. However, when you add new hosts, you'll haveto update the configuration file. For more information on the adaptor configurationfile, see  <a href="State_Discovery.html#BBCCHAFB" target = "content">"Using a Configuration File"</a>.</font></li></ul><p> You configure your site using Monitor, a Web-browser&#150;basedtool.</p><br>    <br><a href="HTTP_Adaptors.html" target="content"><img src="../images/previous.gif" border="0"></a><a href="Types_of_Adaptors.html" target="content"><img src="../images/next.gif" border="0"></a>&nbsp;<br><br><p><hr><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">&#169; 2002 Apple Computer, Inc.
