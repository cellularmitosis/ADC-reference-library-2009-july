It describes changes to existing featuresand new features that you might want to start using. The WebObjectstools include the Project Builder application, the WebObjects Builder application,and the Direct to Web framework.</p><br><a name = "TP503537683"></a><h2>Project Builder Changes</h2><p>Project Builder has received changes in this release in theareas of <code>NSProjectSearchPath</code> support,indentation, and the Build, Launch, and Find panels.</p><p>Project Builder now includes a Searchpath preferences panelto specify the project's <code>NSProjectSearchPath</code> userdefault. If your project uses framework projects that reside ina directory in the <code>NSProjectSearchPath</code>,you can access the source files for the frameworks through the Frameworkssuitcase. Using the Build Options panel in the Build panel, you canspecify whether to build the frameworks when you build the project.In the Find panel you can specify whether to search the projectand frameworks or just the project.</p><p>Project Builder's automatic indentation has been upgraded.You can control its behavior with the Indentation preferences panel.</p><p>Project Builder's Build, Launch (with debugger) and Findpanels now have an extra pane where you can edit code. You no longerneed to switch between the main Project Builder window and the Buildpanel when you are editing compile errors. Likewise, you can searchfor text within the project and edit it without leaving the Findpanel.</p><p>Project Builder is documented in <em>WebObjects Toolsand Techniques</em>.</p><br><a name = "CJECBHJE"></a><h2>WebObjects Builder Changes</h2><p>WebObjects Builder's user interface has received major changesfor 4.5, specifically in the main window toolbar, the user interfacefor binding keys, and the table editing user interface. A path view,an API editor, and component validation have been added. WebObjectsBuilder is documented in <em>WebObjects Tools and Techniques</em>.</p><br><a name = "TP503537684"></a><h3>Main Window Changes</h3><p>The editing modes from WebObjects 4.0.1 have been renamed.Graphical Editing Mode is now called the layout view. Source EditingMode is now called the source view. A new view called the previewview has been added.</p><br><a name = "TP503537685"></a><h4>Layout View Changes</h4><p>The toolbars have been reorganized. All tools are now availablein a single click. You don't have to choose a toolbar. The WOComponentContentdynamic element is now available from the toolbar. In addition,the toolbar also contains an alert icon, which opens a window displayingthe validation errors on the page and a puzzle piece icon, whichopens the API editor. The API editor is described below.</p><p>WebObjects Builder now optionally displays HTML tags withopening and closing tag icons, which makes the HTML structure ofthe page more transparent. You can choose which tags are markedthis way with the Layout preferences panel.</p><p>In the center of the window is a path view, which replacesthe path view in the inspector and provides extra functionality.The path view displays the elements in the path as HTML tags ratherthan icons.</p><p>The object browser has column headings. Each heading displaysthe class of the object selected in the previous column. This classalso contains the keys in the column.</p><p>Double clicking an element's icon no longer collapses theelement. Use the preview view instead (described below).</p><br><a name = "TP503537686"></a><h4>Preview View</h4><p>A new preview view, similar to the layout view, displays thepage so it matches what the user sees in the browser as closelyas possible. WebObjects Builder renders elements (for example, WORepetitions)in their collapsed form and hides comments and HTML tags.</p><br><a name = "TP503537687"></a><h4>Source View</h4><p>Syntax coloring is new for WebObjects 4.5. By default, WebObjectsBuilder displays unmatched tags in red, markers in purple, commentsin grey, and WebObjects in blue. You can change the colors usingthe preferences panel.</p><p>You can match a tag in the source view by triple-clickingon it. For example, if you want to select a <code>&lt;FONTFACE=...&gt;</code> tag, the closing <code>&lt;/FONT&gt;</code> tag,and everything in between, triple click on <code>&lt;FONT</code>, <code>&gt;</code>,or <code>&lt;/FONT&gt;</code>. Youcan also drag the mouse after you have triple-clicked, which expandsthe selection by whole containers.</p><br><a name = "TP503537688"></a><h3>Changes to the BindingProcess</h3><p>The process of binding is more flexible, streamlined, andintuitive in this version of WebObjects Builder.</p><br><a name = "TP503537689"></a><h4>Inspector Appearance</h4><p>The inspector now has a horizontal aspect, which is more convenientto tile with the main window than before.</p><br><a name = "TP503537690"></a><h4>Documentation</h4><p>Documentation for static dynamic elements is now availablefrom the inspector by clicking the book icon. The documentationappears in the WOInfoCenter.</p><br><a name = "TP503537691"></a><h4>Binding by Dragging</h4><p>Binding by dragging from a variable to an element is now different.Instead of opening the inspector when you release the mouse button,WebObjects Builder now opens a menu with the element's attributes.You can click one of these attributes or click "Connect to new binding..."which adds a new binding.</p><br><a name = "TP503537692"></a><h4>Binding With the Element'sContext Menu</h4><p>You can bind a variable to an element's attribute by selectingthe key in the object browser and Control-clicking (right-clickin Windows NT) an element in the upper pane of the main window.A menu appears containing a submenu with the element's attributes.Click one of the attributes to connect it to the selected key. Youcan also create a new binding by clicking "Connect to a new binding..."</p><br><a name = "TP503537693"></a><h4>Binding Validation</h4><p>WebObjects Builder checks for required bindings that are missingand mutually exclusive bindings that are specified. Invalid bindingsdisplay in red in the inspector. By clicking the alert icon in theinspector, you can access a description of the missing bindings.</p><br><a name = "TP503537694"></a><h4>Adding and DeletingBindings with the Inspector</h4><p>A pull-down list in the top right corner of the inspectorallows you add and delete bindings. You can also add a binding byselecting the inspector and pressing Enter. You can delete a bindingby selecting the binding and pressing the delete key.</p><br><a name = "TP503537695"></a><h4>Binding Aids in theInspector</h4><p>Creating bindings for date formats, number formats, booleans,image file names, framework names, page names, direct actions, anddirect action classes is now easier. When WebObjects Builder candetermine a set of possible values for an attribute, it displaysa combo box for the attribute that allows you to choose one of thesevalues. For example, boolean attributes have a combo box which allowsyou to choose YES or NO.</p><br><a name = "TP503537696"></a><h4>Binding Name Completion</h4><p>When you inspect an element, double-click in the binding column,and start typing a key, WebObjects completes the name for you basedon the keys in the object browser. For example, to bind to "application.allGuests.count,"you simply type "a.a.c" and the inspector fills in the rest.The object browser also selects the key as you type it.</p><br><a name = "TP503537697"></a><h3>Working with Keys</h3><p>The keys pull-down list at the bottom left corner of the mainwindow manipulates keys in the component's script file only. Itdoes not affect keys in the application or session files. You canadd keys to the application (or session) with the application'scontext menu by selecting <code>application</code> (or <code>session</code>)and Control-clicking (right-clicking in Windows NT) in the nextcolumn of the object browser.</p><p>You can now rename and delete keys in the component's scriptfile using the keys pull-down list. To delete or rename a applicationor session key, Control-click (right-click in Windows NT) on thekey and choose Delete <em>key</em> or Rename <em>key</em> fromthe pop-up menu.</p><br><a name = "TP503537698"></a><h3>Changes to KeyboardActions</h3><p>The tables below show the changes to the keys you need topress to perform certain WebObjects Builder functions.</p><br><table border = "1" cellpadding = "3"><caption><strong>Layout View Keyboard Actions</strong></caption><tr><td rowspan = "1" colspan = "1" valign = "top" scope="row"></td><td rowspan = "1" colspan = "1" valign = "top"><b>Pre-WebObjects 4.5</b></td><td rowspan = "1" colspan = "1" valign = "top"><b>WebObjects 4.5</b></td></tr><tr><td rowspan = "1" colspan = "1" valign = "top" scope="row">Insert Paragraph (<code>&lt;P&gt;</code>)</td><td rowspan = "1" colspan = "1" valign = "top">Shift-Enter</td><td rowspan = "1" colspan = "1" valign = "top">Enter</td></tr><tr><td rowspan = "1" colspan = "1" valign = "top" scope="row">Insert Line Break (<code>&lt;BR&gt;</code>)</td><td rowspan = "1" colspan = "1" valign = "top">Enter</td><td rowspan = "1" colspan = "1" valign = "top">Shift-Enter</td></tr><tr><td rowspan = "1" colspan = "1" valign = "top" scope="row">Delete Text</td><td rowspan = "1" colspan = "1" valign = "top">Backspace, Delete, or Del</td><td rowspan = "1" colspan = "1" valign = "top">unchanged</td></tr><tr><td rowspan = "1" colspan = "1" valign = "top" scope="row">Delete Structures</td><td rowspan = "1" colspan = "1" valign = "top">Backspace, Delete, or Del</td><td rowspan = "1" colspan = "1" valign = "top">Shift-Backspace, Shift-Delete, or Shift-Del</td></tr><tr><td rowspan = "1" colspan = "1" valign = "top" scope="row">Add New List Item</td><td rowspan = "1" colspan = "1" valign = "top">Shift-Enter</td><td rowspan = "1" colspan = "1" valign = "top">Enter</td></tr></table><br><br><a name = "TP503537699"></a><h3>Working with Tables</h3><p>Creating and editing tables is substantially changed and moreintuitive in this version of WebObjects Builder.</p><br><a name = "TP503537700"></a><h4>Creating Tables</h4><p>To create a table, click the table icon in the toolbar. Youcan set the dimensions, size, layout, and other parameters for yourtable in the panel that appears. Press OK to insert the table.</p><br><a name = "TP503537701"></a><h4>Making Selections</h4><p>In previous versions of WebObjects Builder, the inspectorhad a path view. In this version, the path view is in the main window.Thus, selecting the entire table or a single row is done differentlyin this version. If you select a table cell, you can inspect therow (by clicking &lt;TR&gt; in the path view) or the table itself(by clicking &lt;TABLE&gt; in the path view).</p><p>You can select multiple cells by</p><ul><li>clicking in a cell and dragging across the cells</li><li>selecting a cell and shift clicking in another cell</li><li>command (control in NT) clicking each cell.</li></ul><p>The first two selection methods ensure that the selected cellsform a contiguous region.</p><p>Note: selecting all of the cells in a row or table is notthe same as selecting the row or table!</p><br><a name = "TP503537702"></a><h4>Editing Tables</h4><p>The structure/content table editing modes have been eliminated.Click in a cell to edit its contents. The table data and table rowinspectors now have buttons to edit the table's structure.</p><br><a name = "TP503537703"></a><h3>Working with Fonts</h3><p>In HTML, the FACE attribute for the FONT tag specifies a commaseparated list of font names in order of preference. The browsersearches for an installed font with a corresponding name in thelist. WebObjects Builder provides a font panel which manipulatesthese lists. This font panel is available from the font pull-downlist in the toolbar.</p><p>To delete a font list, select it in the font panel and pressthe delete key.</p><br><a name = "TP503537704"></a><h3>Path View Menu</h3><p>Control-clicking (right-clicking on Windows NT) an elementin the path view brings up a menu from which you can</p><ul><li>inspect the element</li><li>make the element a static element (if it is a dynamic element)</li><li>make the element a dynamic element (if it is a static element)</li><li>delete the element and its contents</li><li>delete the element's contents only</li><li>delete the element without deleting its contents (unwrappingthe element)</li><li>isolate the selection (wrap the selected content in the parentelement separately from the unselected content.)</li><li>make many kinds of selections.</li></ul><br><a name = "TP503537705"></a><h3>Context Menus</h3><p>The path view menu is one example of context menus. Thesemenus appear when you control-click (right-click on Windows NT)on elements or keys in the WebObjects Builder window. The followingparts of the user interface have context menus:</p><ul><li>elements in the upper pane of the layout andpreview views</li><li>elements in the path view</li><li>keys in the object browser</li><li>the empty space in the columns of the object browser</li><li>the empty space in the upper pane of the layout and previewviews</li><li>the table views, including the Attribute/Binding table inthe inspector, and the Bindings and Messages tables in the API editor.</li></ul><br><a name = "TP503537706"></a><h3>API Editor</h3><p>A graphical API editor is now accessible by clicking the puzzlepiece icon on the toolbar. It allows you to define the attributesand binding rules for a reusable component. The editor has threepanels, one for creating bindings and setting attributes on them,one for creating validation rules, and one for associating an iconand documentation file with the component.</p><p>The Bindings tab allows you set up the attributes of yourreusable component. WebObjects Builder displays these attributesin the inspector in WebObjects Builder. You can also tell WebObjectsBuilder which attributes must be bound, which attributes must bebound to a key that can be set, and the kind of values each attributetakes (such as page names, MIME types, or frameworks).<p>The Validationtab allows you to set up validation rules for the component. Theserules specify which attributes must be bound together and whichcannot be bound together. The "required" and "will set"checkboxes on the first tab are really shortcuts for setting up validationrules; the generated rules appear on the Validation tab when youcheck those checkboxes for your attributes. You can also set upmore complex rules on the Validation tab. For example, you can specifythat a set of attributes all control the same basic property ofa component and only one of them may be bound at a time.</p><p>The Displaytab allows you to choose an image that WebObjects Builder uses todisplay the reusable component in a document. You can also specifyan HTML documentation file for the reusable component with the Displaytab. WebObjects Builder displays this file in the WOInfoCenter whenthe user clicks the book icon in the component's inspector.</p><br><a name = "TP503537707"></a><h3>Syntactic and SemanticConstraints</h3><p>WebObjects Builder optionally enforces constraints definedby the HTML 3.2 specification published by the World Wide Web Consortium(W3C). The W3C maintains the standards governing the World WideWeb. Their website is athttp://www.w3.org.</p><p>While mainstream browsers tolerate many HTML errors,WebObjects Builder's Layout view does not allow you to introducesemantic errors (although the Source view allows you to create andedit any HTML). If your document already has HTML errors, you can stilledit it with the Layout view depending on the settings in your Validationpreferences panel. This panel allows you to specify what WebObjectsBuilder does when it encounters semantic or syntactic errors whenit tries to display the document in the Layout view.</p><p>Semantic errorsoccur when an HTML tag cannot be a child of another tag. For example, accordingto the HTML 3.2 specification, &lt;B&gt; cannot have &lt;H1&gt;as a child because &lt;B&gt; is a text-level tag, while &lt;H1&gt;is a block-level tag. Close tags without corresponding open tagsand open tags without corresponding close tags are also semanticerrors.</p><p>Syntactic errors occur when your HTML is malformed, for example,&lt;//B&gt; or &lt;B.</p><p>Depending on the settings in the Validationpreferences panel, WebObjects Builder automatically repairs eacherror it encounters, ignores it, or asks you what to do with it. Notethat there are some errors for which WebObjects Builder cannot accommodatethe settings you have chosen. For example, a document with two &lt;BODY&gt;tags can neither be repaired nor ignored.</p><p>If you choose to repairerrors, WebObjects Builder adds missing close tags, and removes extraor malformed tags. When one tag is not allowed as a child of another,WebObjects Builder introduces an intermediate element between thetwo incompatible elements or adds a close tag for the parent elementdepending on the context. These repairs can be complicated and intrusive,so you should not routinely allow WebObjects Builder to repair allerrors.</p><p>If you choose to ignore errors, WebObjects Builder does notmodify your document. To see the errors in your document from theLayout view, bring up the validation panel.</p><p>If you choose to havethe Builder ask about errors, it stops at every error it encountersas it tries to display your document in the Layout view and asksyou whether you want to repair the error, ignore it, or stop anddisplay the document in the source view. Note that if you repairsome errors and then stop on one, the errors that you repaired revertto their original (incorrect) state; WebObjects Builder does notmodify the document unless every error is either repaired or ignored.</p><p>One common semantic violation seen in WebObjects HTML templatesis improperly nesting tags within a WOConditional. For example:</p><blockquote><pre>&lt;WEBOBJECT NAME=Conditional1&gt;    &lt;B&gt;&lt;/WEBOBJECT&gt;This text is conditionally displayed in boldface.&lt;WEBOBJECT NAME=Conditional1&gt;    &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/WEBOBJECT&gt;</pre></blockquote><br><p>The corresponding entry in the bindings file is:</p><blockquote><pre>Conditional1: WOConditional {    condition = myCondition;}</pre></blockquote><br><p>Not only is this a semantic violation, it is also bad codingpractice. It is much better to use a WOGenericContainer in suchcases:</p><blockquote><pre>&lt;WEBOBJECT NAME=Generic1&gt;    This text is conditionally displayed in boldface.&lt;/WEBOBJECT&gt;</pre></blockquote><br><p>The corresponding entry in the bindings file is:</p><blockquote><pre>Generic1 : WOGenericContainer {    elementName = "B";    omitTags = myNegatedCondition;}</pre></blockquote><br><p>Note that you have to negate the original condition.</p><br><a name = "TP503537708"></a><h3>How WebObjects BuilderHandles Bindings Files</h3><p>WebObjects Builder now respects bindings (<code>.wod</code>)files that have been edited by hand. Specifically, if you edit thebindings file of your component with a text editor, open the componentin WebObjects Builder, and save it, WebObjects Builder</p><ul><li>preserves the whitespace and comments aroundentries in the bindings file</li><li>retains the order of the entries (depending on the settingsin the <code>.wod</code> preferencespanel)</li><li>allows a single entry to be used multiple times in the HTMLtemplate file</li></ul><p>This behavior of WebObjects Builder eases the transition fromhand-editing components with a text editor to using WebObjects Builder.</p><br><a name = "BBHCDDDJ"></a><h2>Direct to Web Changes</h2><p>Direct to Web has received two major changes: exposed APIand support for creating your own visual style. There are many additionalchanges as well. This version of Direct to Web is not completelycompatible with the 4.0 release. You need to run conversion scriptson your project's source files, <code>Main.wod</code> file,and rule (<code>.d2wmodel</code>)files. See  <a href="#BEIDDFIA">"Converting Projects From Earlier Releases" </a>.</p><br><a name = "TP503537709"></a><h3>API and ComponentsExposed</h3><p>One of the major goals of the 4.5 release is to make moreof Direct to Web available to developers. The API and componentshave been reviewed and streamlined and are now ready for publicuse. In addition, two books have been added to the documentationabout Direct to Web.</p><p><em>Developing WebObjects Applications With Direct toWeb</em> discusses the Direct to Web architecture and howto customize your Direct to Web application.</p><p>The <em>Direct to Web Reference</em> covers theclasses and reusable components in the Direct to Web Framework.</p><p>You can access these documents from the WOInfoCenter.</p><br><a name = "TP503537710"></a><h3>Modifying the VisualStyle</h3><p>It is now possible to create your own Direct to Web-styledynamic template. When generating a 'task' page (for example, theList Page for <em>all</em> entities) Direct To Web generates apage that is not specific to a particular entity (unlike freezinga page). Instead, the page retains its dynamic capabilities andreacts to the entities it encounters at runtime. You can also accessand modify its template, binding, and Java source files. By creatinga set of these for all the common tasks (query, list, edit, etc.)you can create your own look.</p><p>Note that you can still freeze a Direct to Web page for aparticular task and entity as you could in previous releases.</p><br><a name = "TP503537711"></a><h3>Modifying the D2W Menu</h3><p>The Navigation tool of Direct to Web is now part of your projectwhen you create it. This allows you to tailor its look and functionality.</p><br><a name = "TP503537712"></a><h3>Neutral Look</h3><p>A new look, called the Neutral look, is now available whenyou create a Direct to Web project. It is ideal for adding yourown logo because it contains no Apple or WebObjects logos.</p><br><a name = "TP503537713"></a><h3>Custom Components</h3><p>It is now possible to embed regular WebObjects componentsin a Direct to Web page. Two components, D2WCustomComponent andD2WQueryCustomComponent, have been added for this purpose.</p><p>From the Web Assistant, you can configure Direct to Web touse your component for a particular task and property. See <em>DevelopingWebObjects Applications with Direct to Web</em> for more information.</p><br><a name = "TP503537714"></a><h3>Named Configurations</h3><p>Once you have configured a given page (for example, List pagefor Movies) you can save those settings under a name (for example,ListRentedMovies) and use this configuration from your code (eitherby API or as an embedded component). This lets you have several pagesfor the same task/entity pair which display different sets of properties.For example, the Rental Store example uses different List Pagesfor Movies depending whether you are a customer or a clerk, andwhether you are renting a movie or just browsing.</p><br><a name = "TP503537715"></a><h3>Tab Panel Page</h3><p>A tab panel inspect and edit page has been introduced in theWebObjects and Neutral looks, which lets you group property keysin different tabs. This page is not available in the Basic look.</p><br><a name = "TP503537716"></a><h3>Better Support forKey Paths in the Web Assistant</h3><p>The Web Assistant now sports a key-path browser which letsyou add a property based on a key path to any D2W page.</p><br><a name = "TP503537717"></a><h3>Web Assistant Supportfor EOProject Parser</h3><p>The Web Assistant now uses EOProject to parse your sourcecode (much like WebObjects builder does) and display custom keysavailable on your Enterprise Objects in its key-path browser.</p><br><a name = "TP503537718"></a><h3>Confirmation Page</h3><p>A new confirmation page has been introduced. The list pageuses it before deleting an object. It can be frozen like any otherD2W page.</p><br><a name = "TP503537719"></a><h3>Deployment Performance</h3><p>The caching mechanism for D2W dynamic components has beenrewritten resulting in a twofold to fivefold deployment performanceimprovement.</p><br><a name = "BEIDDFIA"></a><h3>Converting Projects FromEarlier Releases</h3><p>Since the D2W components are now public, the Java source files,the <code>Main.wod</code> file, andthe rule files have changed in this release. Two scripts are providedto ease the conversion process.</p><p>The first script, located in <code>$(NEXT_ROOT)/Developer/Java/Conversion/WebObjects/D2W4_5codechanges.tops</code>,modifies the code to conform to Direct to Web's API changes (see  <a href="#CEGDCICH">API Changes</a>). You needto execute it on</p><ul><li>all code generated by releases of Direct to Webearlier than 4.5</li><li>the project's <code>Main.wod</code> file</li></ul><p>A ReadMe file in the script's directory explains how toexecute the script.</p><p>The second script, located in <code>$(NEXT_ROOT)/Developer/Java/Conversion/WebObjects/D2W4_5modelchanges.tops</code>,modifies the rule files to use renamed property-level components.You need to execute it on all files in your project ending in <code>.d2wmodel</code>.See the ReadMe file in the script's directory to see how to executethe script.</p><p></p><br><a name = "CEGDCICH"></a><h3>API Changes</h3><p>The NextPageCallback interface has been renamed to NextPageDelegate.This change affects any code that uses this interface includingcode generated when you freeze a component with WebObjects 4.0.The following methods are changed.</p><br><table border = "1" cellpadding = "3"><caption><strong>ConfirmPageInterface</strong></caption><tr><td rowspan = "1" colspan = "1" valign = "top" scope="row"><b>Removed API</b></td><td rowspan = "1" colspan = "1" valign = "top"><b>Replacement API</b></td></tr><tr><td rowspan = "1" colspan = "1" valign = "top" scope="row">setConfirmCallback</td><td rowspan = "1" colspan = "1" valign = "top">setConfirmDelegate</td></tr><tr><td rowspan = "1" colspan = "1" valign = "top" scope="row">setCancelCallback</td><td rowspan = "1" colspan = "1" valign = "top">setCancelDelegate</td></tr></table><br><br><table border = "1" cellpadding = "3"><caption><strong>EditPageInterface, EditRelationshipPageInterface, InspecPageInteface, ListPageInterface, and QueryPageInterface</strong></caption><tr><td rowspan = "1" colspan = "1" valign = "top" scope="row"><b>Removed API</b></td><td rowspan = "1" colspan = "1" valign = "top"><b>Replacement API</b></td></tr><tr><td rowspan = "1" colspan = "1" valign = "top" scope="row">setNextPageCallback</td><td rowspan = "1" colspan = "1" valign = "top">setNextPageDelegate</td></tr></table><br><br><table border = "1" cellpadding = "3"><caption><strong>SelectPageInterface</strong></caption><tr><td rowspan = "1" colspan = "1" valign = "top" scope="row"><b>Removed API</b></td><td rowspan = "1" colspan = "1" valign = "top"><b>Replacement API</b></td></tr><tr><td rowspan = "1" colspan = "1" valign = "top" scope="row">nextPageCallback</td><td rowspan = "1" colspan = "1" valign = "top">nextPageDelegate</td></tr><tr><td rowspan = "1" colspan = "1" valign = "top" scope="row">setNextPageCallback</td><td rowspan = "1" colspan = "1" valign = "top">setNextPageDelegate</td></tr></table><br><p>References to the Live Assistant have been changed to WebAssistant.
