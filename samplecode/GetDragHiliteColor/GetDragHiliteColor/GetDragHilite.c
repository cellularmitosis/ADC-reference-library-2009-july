/*	File:		GetDragHilite.c	Contains:	This shows how to obtain the color that the Drag Manager uses to    			hilite regions when ShowDragHilite is called.  Check out GetDragHilite.c    			for the code.      			Please note this is only how it's done presently.  Since it is undocumented    			it can and will change in the future.	Written by: Nitin Ganatra		Copyright:	Copyright © 1994-1999 by Apple Computer, Inc., All Rights Reserved.					You may incorporate this Apple sample source code into your program(s) without				restriction.
