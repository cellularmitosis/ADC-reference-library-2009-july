To do so, you'll use a dynamicelement called a <em>repetition</em> (an instance ofthe WORepetition class). Repetitions are one of the most importantelements in WebObjects, since it is quite common for applicationsto display repeated data (often from databases) when the amount ofdata to be displayed isn't known until runtime. Typically, a repetitionis used to generate items in a list or a browser, multiple rowsin a table, or multiple tables. </font></p><p><font face="Times">A repetition can contain any other elements-either staticHTML or dynamic WebObjects elements. In the GuestList component,you'll create a repetition that contains a table row.</font></p><p><font face="Times">You'll bind the <code>allGuests</code> arrayto the WORepetition's <code>list </code>attribute.This tells WebObjects to generate the elements in the repetitiononce for each item in the array. Each time WebObjects iterates throughthe array, it sets the repetition's <code>item</code> attributeto the current array object. You bind <code>item</code> tothe variable <code>currentGuest</code> anduse <code>currentGuest</code>'sfields to bind the elements inside the repetition (such as WOStrings).At runtime, the table will consist of one row (displaying name,e-mail address, and comments) for each guest.</font></p><ol><p><li>In WebObjectsBuilder, make the Main component window active (double-click<code> Main.wo</code>).</li></p><p><li>Select the table at the bottom of the page by pressing outsideit and dragging across it.</li></p><p><li>Choose Edit &gt; Copy.</li></p><p><li>Make the GuestList component active.</li></p><p><li>Place the cursor at the bottom of the page and choose Edit&gt; Paste.<p>You have just copied the table from Main into GuestList.It has all the same properties, including the bindings. The WOStringsin the table are still bound to instance variables of <code>currentGuest</code>.Since <code>currentGuest </code>isa component variable defined in Main, it isn't accessible fromGuestList. Therefore, you need to declare it here. </p></li></p><p><li>From the pull-down list at the bottom of the window, chooseAdd Key. Enter currentGuest as the name of the variable and Guestas its type, and click Add.</li></p><p><li>Click in one of the cells in the second row. Click &lt;TR&gt;in the path view to select the entire row.<P><img src = "../Art/selecttr.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/selecttr.gif]"></li></p><p><li>Click <img src = "../Art/worepetition.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/worepetition.gif]"> inthe toolbar.<p>When you wrap a repetition around a table rowin this way, the WORepetition symbol <img src = "../Art/worepetition.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/worepetition.gif]"> doesn't appear in the table.Instead, the row appears in blue. For additional examples of usingrepetitions, see  <a sector="mod" href="../Movies/iCreating_a__Application.html" target="_top">"Creating a WebObjects Database Application"</a>.</p></li></p><p><li>In the object browser, select <code>application</code> inthe first column.</li></p><p><li>In the second column, make a connection from <code>allGuests</code> tothe &lt;WORepetition&gt; tag in the path view.</li></p><p><li>In the attribute menu that appears, click <code>list</code>.This binds <code>application.allGuests</code> tothe WORepetition's <code>list</code> attribute.</li></p><p><li>Bind <code>currentGuest</code> tothe repetition's <code>item</code> attribute.<p>Byusing the name <code>currentGuest </code>forthe <code>item</code> attribute, youare taking advantage of the fact that the strings in your tableare already bound to the fields of <code>currentGuest</code>.</p><p>Younow have finished implementing the repetition. When the table isgenerated, it will have one row for each item in the <code>allGuests</code> array. </p></li></p><p><li>Save the GuestList component.</li></p><p><li>Delete the table from the Main component, since you no longerneed it.</li></p><p><li>Test your application.<p><code>Note:</code> Inthis case, you don't have to rebuild or relaunch your applicationin order to test it. Building is required only when you have madechanges to Java code. If you modify a component only, the changestake effect even if the application is already running.</p></li></p><p><li>Try entering data for multiple guests and verifying that eachguest appears in the table.</li></p></ol>    <br><a href="Adding_a_Second_Component.html" target="_right"><img src="../Images/previous.gif" border="0" alt="Previous"></a><a href="Adding_the__ing_Touches.html" target="_right"><img src="../Images/next.gif" border="0" alt="Next"></a>&nbsp;<p><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="1">&#169; 2001 Apple Computer, Inc.</font></p><!-- start of footer --><!--#include virtual="/includes/framesetfooter" --><!-- end of footer --></body></html>
