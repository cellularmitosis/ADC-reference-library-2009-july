So how do they compare to WebObjects Java Client?</p><p><b>Client JDBC applications</b> use a fat-clientarchitecture. Custom code invokes JDBC on the client, which in turngoes through a driver to communicate with a JDBC proxy on the server.This proxy makes the necessary client-library calls on the server.</p><p>The shortcoming of this architecture are typical of all fat-clientarchitectures. Security is a problem because the bytecodes on theclient are easily decompiled, leaving both sensitive data and businessrules at risk. In addition, this architecture doesn't scale; itis expensive to move data over the channel to the client. Also,client JDBC applications access the datasource directly&#151;thereis server layer to validate data or control access to the datasource. </p><p><b>JDBC three-tier applications</b> (with CORBAas the transport) are a big improvement over client JDBC applications.In this architecture the client can be thin since all that is required onthe client side are the Java Foundation Classes, nonsensitive customcode (usually for managing the user interface), and CORBA stubsfor communicating with the server. Sensitive business logic anddatabase connection logic are stored on the server. In addition, theserver handles all data-intensive computations.</p><p>The JDBC three-tier architecture has its own weaknesses. First,it results in too much network traffic. Because this architectureuses proxy business objects on the client as handles to real objectson the server, each client request for an attribute is forwardedto the server, causing a separate round trip. Second, JDBC three-tierrequires developers to write much of the code themselves, from codefor database access and data packaging, to code for user-interfacesynchronization and change tracking. Finally JDBC three-tier doesnot provide much of the functionality associated with applicationservers, such as application monitoring and load balancing, nordoes it provide HTML integration.</p><p>The Java Client architecture, however, scales well since realdata objects live on the client and roundtrips are made to the serveronly for database commits and new data fetches. Also, Java Clientapplications are designed to leverage custom business logic whichlets you to control which business objects are sent to the clientand to validate data from the client before committing it to thedata store.</p><br>    <br><a href="Dynamic_Use__Generation.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/previous.gif" border="0"></a><a href="Development_s_and_Tools.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/next.gif" border="0"></a>&nbsp;<br><br><p><hr><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">&#169; 2002 Apple Computer, Inc.
