Thisallows you to easily locate a project's files in a central repository.It also lets you assign files to specific targets to facilitatethe building process.</font></p><br><a name = "BCIDJBGJ"></a><h4><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande">Groups</font></h4><p><font face="Times">A group is a collection of related files, similar to foldersor directories in a file system. They allow you to collect all ofyour project's components, resources, classes, frameworks, and evenother groups under general categories. However, you are not restrictedon the type of file you can put in a group.</font></p><p><font face="Times">When you create a Java Client application, Project Buildercreates a default hierarchy with seven major groups. You can modifythis organization by adding, removing, or deleting groups, and bymoving files between groups:</font></p><ul><p><li><b>Classes</b> storesthe general Java files (<code>.java</code>)that the project uses, such as Application.java, Session.java,and DirectAction.java. The Java files relatedto components, such as Main.java, are locatedin subgroups of the Web Components group.</li></p><p><li><b>Web Components</b> stores the dynamic elementsused in your project. In a Java Client application, it only hasa Main subgroup that contains the Main.wo componentand related files.</li></p><p><li><b>Resources</b> stores the model files (<code>.eomodeld</code>)used in the project.</li></p><p><li><b>Web Server Resources</b> contains imagefiles (GIF, JPEG) and others that your Web server uses to rendera Web page. For example, you can place a GIF file with your businesslogo in this group.</li></p><p><li><b>Interfaces</b> stores the interface files(<code>.nib</code>) needed by theclient application.</li></p><p><li><b>Frameworks</b> stores the framework files(<code>.framework</code>) used byyour project.</li></p><p><li><b>Documentation</b> is where documentationfiles are placed.</li></p></ul><p><font face="Times">In this scenario, you can think of StudioManager as the rootgroup, because it contains all other groups.</font></p><br><a name = "BCIBCIAH"></a><h4><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande">Targets</font></h4><p><font face="Times">When a Java Client application is built, two products arecreated: The client product and the server product. The client productis the client-side application, while the server product is theserver-side application. Targets come in two flavors: Build targetsand root targets:</font></p><ul><p><li><b>Buildtargets</b> are used to configure the settings for the correspondingproduct. When you define a build target, you tell Project Builderwhich files are part of the target, and how to build its correspondingproduct.</li></p><p><li><b>Root targets</b> are used to group twoor more build targets into a single unit; they contain no filesor build settings of their own. When an aggregate target is built,the build targets that it contains are built in turn.</li></p></ul><p><font face="Times">These are the targets of a Java Client application:</font></p><ul><p><li>The client-sidetarget called Web Server. It contains the files needed to buildthe client application and the settings used to produce it.</li></p><p><li>The server-side target, called Application Server. It containsthe files and build settings to be used to generate the server application.</li></p><p><li><em></em>The root target, named after the project,is used to group the Web Server and the Application Server targetsinto one unit.</li></p></ul><p><font face="Times">To switch between a project's targets, you use the targetpop-up menu.</font></p> <img src = "../Art/pbprojectwindowtargetmenu.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/pbprojectwindowtargetmenu.gif]"><br><a name = "TPXREF113"></a><h3><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande">ClientFiles</font></h3><p><font face="Times">The files associated with the Web Server target are the InterfaceBuilder archive (<code>.nib</code>)file and the interface controller (<code>.java</code>).The files are named after the project plus "InterfaceController"by default; you can choose a different name when the project is created.In the Interfaces group you will see <code>StudioManagerInterfaceController.nib</code> and <code>StudioManagerInterfaceController.java</code>.</font></p><br><a name = "TPXREF114"></a><h4><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande">TheNib File</font></h4><p><font face="Times">The nib file in a Java Client application is similar to anib file in a stand-alone WebObjects application. When you createa user interface, information is added to the Java Client nib fileso that it can be used to generate Swing interface elements. Thisinformation is encapsulated in a Java archive that is loaded ontothe client.</font></p><br><a name = "TPXREF115"></a><h4><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande">TheInterface Controller</font></h4><p><font face="Times">In a Java Client application, an interface controller-anEOInterfaceController object-mediates between the user interfaceand the model objects on the client. When you use Project Builderto create a Java Client project, it automatically generates codefor a custom EOInterfaceController subclass and makes an objectof this class the owner of the nib file.</font></p><p><font face="Times">In the Model-View-Controller design paradigm, the interfacecontroller plays the role of controller. It has four outlets:</font></p><ul><p><li>to its <code>component</code>,which is preset to the window in the nib file and functions as the "view"(it can be set to something else)</li></p><p><li>to the client's editing context (<code>editingContext</code>),which serves as the "model"</li></p><p><li>to the controller display group (<code>controllerDisplayGroup</code>),a kind of general-purpose display group that contains the interfacecontroller itself and nothing else; through it applications canspecify user-interface dependencies and can control the interface throughassociations</li></p><p><li>to the display group (<code>displayGroup</code>)in master-detail interfaces</li></p></ul><br><a name = "TPXREF116"></a><h3><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande">ServerFiles</font></h3><p><font face="Times">The server-side project files created by Project Builder aredistributed across several groups. Most notable of these is theMain component (<code>Main.wo</code>)in the Main subgroup located in the Web Components group. The <code>Main.html</code> filecontains this generated HTML code:</font></p><pre>&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;  &lt;TITLE&gt;Main&lt;/TITLE&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;&lt;BODY&gt;  &lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;WEBOBJECT NAME=Applet&gt;&lt;/WEBOBJECT&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;</pre><br><a name = "TPXREF117"></a><h4><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande">TheWOJavaClientApplet Component</font></h4><p><font face="Times">The <code>&lt;WEBOBJECT NAME=Applet&gt;</code> tagin the HTML code above represents a WOJavaClientApplet component.Java Client applications use this component to create an applet(of class com.webobjects.EOApplet) and topass this applet several parameters, some standard, such as sizeand codebase, and others specific to Java Client applications, such aschannel class and interface-controller class.</font></p><p><font face="Times">The <code>Main.wod</code> filecontains the following default bindings for the WOJavaClientApplet component:</font></p><pre>Applet: WOJavaClientApplet {    height = 512;    width = 512;    interfaceControllerClassName =  "studiomanagerinterfacecontroller.client.StudioManagerInterfaceController";    useJavaPlugin = YES;}</pre><p><font face="Times">Note that Project Builder automatically provides the bindingfor <code>interfaceControllerClassName</code> (see  <a href="#TPXREF115">"The Interface Controller"</a>,for details).</font></p><p><font face="Times">The WOJavaClientApplet bindings specific to the EODistributionlayer are shown in the following table.</font></p><br><table border = "1"><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande"><b><tr><td scope="row">Property</td><td>Value</td></tr></b></font><tr><td scope="row">useJavaPlugin</td><td>If YES, generates HTML that causes Internet Explorerand Netscape browsers to use Sun's Java Plug-in.</td></tr><tr><td scope="row">distributionContext</td><td>The EODistributionContext that the applet uses to handlerequests from the client.
