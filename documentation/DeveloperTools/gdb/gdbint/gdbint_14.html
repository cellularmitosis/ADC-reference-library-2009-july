Most of the work in making GDB compile on a new machine is in
specifying the configuration of the machine.  This is done in a
dizzying variety of header files and configuration scripts, which we
hope to make more sensible soon.  Let's say your new host is called an
<VAR>xyz</VAR> (e.g.,  <SAMP>`sun4'</SAMP>), and its full three-part configuration
name is <CODE><VAR>arch</VAR>-<VAR>xvend</VAR>-<VAR>xos</VAR></CODE> (e.g.,
<SAMP>`sparc-sun-sunos4'</SAMP>).  In particular:

<UL>
<LI>

In the top level directory, edit <TT>`config.sub'</TT> and add <VAR>arch</VAR>,
<VAR>xvend</VAR>, and <VAR>xos</VAR> to the lists of supported architectures,
vendors, and operating systems near the bottom of the file.  Also, add
<VAR>xyz</VAR> as an alias that maps to
<CODE><VAR>arch</VAR>-<VAR>xvend</VAR>-<VAR>xos</VAR></CODE>.  You can test your changes by
running


<PRE>
./config.sub <VAR>xyz</VAR>
</PRE>

and


<PRE>
./config.sub <CODE><VAR>arch</VAR>-<VAR>xvend</VAR>-<VAR>xos</VAR></CODE>
</PRE>

which should both respond with <CODE><VAR>arch</VAR>-<VAR>xvend</VAR>-<VAR>xos</VAR></CODE>
and no error messages.

You need to port BFD, if that hasn't been done already.  Porting BFD is
beyond the scope of this manual.

<LI>

To configure GDB itself, edit <TT>`gdb/configure.host'</TT> to recognize
your system and set <CODE>gdb_host</CODE> to <VAR>xyz</VAR>, and (unless your
desired target is already available) also edit <TT>`gdb/configure.tgt'</TT>,
setting <CODE>gdb_target</CODE> to something appropriate (for instance,
<VAR>xyz</VAR>).

<EM>Maintainer's note: Work in progress.  The file
<TT>`gdb/configure.host'</TT> originally needed to be modified when either a
new native target or a new host machine was being added to GDB.
Recent changes have removed this requirement.  The file now only needs
to be modified when adding a new native configuration.  This will likely
changed again in the future.</EM>

<LI>

Finally, you'll need to specify and define GDB's host-, native-, and
target-dependent <TT>`.h'</TT> and <TT>`.c'</TT> files used for your
configuration.
