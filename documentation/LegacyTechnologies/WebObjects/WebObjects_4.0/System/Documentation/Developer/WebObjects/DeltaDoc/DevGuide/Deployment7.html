As more users access your application, you may become more concerned about its performance. Here are some suggestions about how to improve an application's performance. <p>
</a><a name="6334">
<B>Note: </B> This section covers only programmatic ways to improve performance. Performance is affected by several factors, such as the load on your system, the amount of memory available, and whether the load is shared among multiple application instances. For information about other ways to improve performance, see the on-line document <a href="../ServingWebObjects/ServingWebObjectsTOC.html"><em>Serving WebObject</a>s</em>. In particular, you may want to check out the section "Testing Performance," which describes some tools you can use to do performance testing. <p>
