As it stands now, the manufacturers of the testing equipmentare already setting their machines to test at the levels set forth in thespecification.</p><P>For more information regarding this issue, contact your source for ESD testingequipment. Since that portion of the industry has already taken notice of andimplemented the specification, they'd be the best source for the kind ofinformation you're looking for.</p><h2>Macintosh Classic, LC, &amp; IIsi internal hard disk power specs</h2><P>Date Written:  5/31/91</p><P>Last reviewed:  8/1/9292</p><P>What is the maximum current available on the +5V and +12V hard disk power lineson the Macintosh IIsi, LC, and Classic?</p><P>Here are Apple's internal hard disk drive power specifications for theMacintosh Classic, Macintosh LC and Macintosh IIsi computers:</p><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=550><TR>	<td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><pre>                   +5V    +12V   Total Power                  -----  ------  -----------Startup           700mA  1000mA  (see explanation below)Accessing         700mA   300mA  &lt;= 5.5 Watts (see explanation below)Operating (Idle)  500mA   300mA  &lt;= 5.5 Watts (see explanation below)</pre>	</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><ul type="circle">	<li> The initial power consumption during startup must be less than 10 Watts RMS as measured during the first 2 seconds.

The Macintosh Portable drive needs to bea low-power drive. According to the "Macintosh Portable Developer Notes," powerrequirements are as follows:</p><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=550><TR>	<td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><pre>Voltage:         12 Vdc and 5 Vdc with +/-5% tolerance                 Voltage ripple to be &lt;=100 mv</pre>	</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><p>Current (Amps):  Currents drawn must be less than or equal to the values shownbelow.</p><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=550><TR>	<td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><pre>DC Current:                     5 Vdc                      12 Vdc                       Peak    Max(rms)  Typ(rms)   Peak   Max(rms)  Typ(rms)Startup (&lt;5 sec)       1.5      1.1       1.0       .8       .56       .53Seeking (&lt;100 ms)      1.5      1.1       1.0       .44      .31       .28Read/write             TBD      TBD        .45      .65      .46       .42Standby (spindle on)   TBD      TBD        .25      .15      .11       .10Autoshutdown        (spindle off)  TBD      TBD        .16      TBD      TBD       .06</pre>	</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><p>Note also that the Portable must have the battery installed; the adapter alonecan't spin a drive. Also the drive must be at SCSI ID 0 and the time-out valuehas to be sufficient to allow the drive to come up (you can look at the valuesand set them with GetTimeOut and SetTimeOut which are documented in <i>InsideMacintosh</i> Volume V, page 356). If this doesn't solve the problem, then it'spossible there may be a SCSI termination problem.</p><h2>Macintosh power supply limits</h2><P>Date Written:  11/28/90</p><P>Last reviewed:  8/1/9292</p><P>Table 6-24 on page 263 of the 2nd edition of the Macintosh Family HardwareGuide gives a limit of 18 amps @ 5 volts on the Macintosh power supply. Can weexceed the recommended 6 x 2 = 12 amp limit at +5V on our cards?</p><P>It's not a good idea to exceed this limit, unless you don't need the card towork in machines with internal hard drives or single-slot Macintosh systemssuch as the Macintosh IIsi. The remainder of the 18 amps not used by NuBus areused by the motherboard and the hard drive. If you do go with machines that donot have internal hard drives, then you will be able to use a little morepower, but you will still need to leave some power for the video card. Thisleaves you back at about a 12-amp limit. If you put your own power converter onyour card, you could convert the 12-volt power to 5 volts, but this is notgoing to gain a lot. In general, third parties who use too much power haveended up adding an external power source to their cards. In some cases therehave been cards that required replacing the entire Macintosh power supply.Adding power will also require a bigger fan--that is, these limits aren't justelectrical; they represent maximum thermal values as well. This is particularlyimportant in the Macintosh IIsi.</p><h2>Macintosh Classic and Macintosh LC power information</h2><P>Date Written:  11/1/90</p><P>Last reviewed:  8/1/9292</p><P>We need a cable to use our external card with the Macintosh Classic andMacintosh LC. The only available powered port seems to be the Apple Desktop Bus(ADB). How much power does the ADB on the Classic and LC supply?</p><P>You can approach your problem a couple of ways. We suggest that developers donot steal power from any of the CPU's ports but if you insist on doingotherwise, then consider the following:</p><P>Maximum ADB power available is low--only about 125 ma per device at +5. Youwould have to provide an in-and-out connector since our newest CPUs have onlyone ADB port on them. We suggest that only three devices be used on each ADBport, and your device would count as one of those devices. See Chapter 8, page295, of the Guide To Macintosh Family Hardware, Second Edition.</p><P>Power is available on the floppy drive port (+12, +5) and the maximum currentavailable is higher than ADB. Allowing for a floppy drive plugged into youradapter, you would still have 200 ma @ +5 with a 400K drive connected and 340ma @ +5 with an 800K drive connected. You must also provide a way for a floppyto be plugged into your adapter using a DB19 connector back to back on theClassic and you would have to run a cable out the back from the second floppyport on the inside of the LC. See Chapter 9, page 335, of the Guide ToMacintosh Family Hardware, Second Edition, for more information.</p><P>If you still decide to use the ADB, remember that your device must support thefollowing: ADB pass through and only about 100-125 ma @+5 current draw. Also,remember to add documentation to your product user's manual that your devicecounts as one of the three allowed devices per ADB connector.</p><h2>Macintosh LC power supply ripple and noise max</h2><P>Date Written:  8/13/92</p><P>Last reviewed:  9/15/9292</p><P>What is the Macintosh LC noise/ripple specification?</p><P>The following table specifies the maximum allowable ripple and noise on each ofthe power supply outputs, under all specified load and input voltageconditions, and assuming resistive loads bypassed only by 0.1 uF ceramic and 47uF electrolytic capacitors on each rail. These voltages are to be measureddifferentially at the output power connector with a Tektronix differentialprobe P6046 and 80 MHz oscilloscope, or equivalent.</p><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=550><TR>	<td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><pre>                             +5 V      +12 V      -5 V    Line frequency ripple   30 mVpp    35 mVpp    30 mVpp    Switching noise         50 mVpp    55 mVpp    50 mVpp</pre>	</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><P><A NAME=Downloads></A></P>          <H2>Downloadables</H2>          <TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH="100%">  <TR>   <td width=50 align=left>     <P align=center><img src="images/acrobatsmall.gif" width=22 height=23 align=middle alt="Acrobat gif"></P>   </TD>   <td align="left">     <P>Acrobat version of this Note (48K)</P>   </TD>   <td width=60 align=left>     <P><A HREF="pdf/hw_530.pdf">Download</A></P>   </TD>  </TR></table><BR><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><!-- end_content --><!-- begin_footer_information -->	<table width="680" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
