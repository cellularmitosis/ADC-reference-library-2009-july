Client Development</font></h2><!-- apple_doc: pageHeadingEnd -->

<p>There are two starting points in Java Client development represented
by two Project Builder project types: Direct to Java Client and
Java Client. <b>You should always start with the Direct to
Java Client project type.</b> The nondirect project type gives
you almost no advantages&#151;you write more code, the application
is less dynamic, and maintenance costs are much higher. And you
can use all the features of nondirect Java Client in Direct to Java Client
applications, so you don't lose anything by starting with the
Direct to Java Client project type. So unless you know that your
application will not gain anything from using the rule system and
dynamic user-interface generation, always choose the direct approach when
building a Java Client application.</p>
<p>Without customizations, the fundamental difference between
the two project types is that Direct to Java Client makes use of
the rule system and nondirect Java Client does not. In code-specific
terms, Direct to Java Client applications are instances of <code>com.webobjects.eoapplication.EODynamicApplication</code> whereas
nondirect Java Client applications are instances of <code>com.webobjects.eoapplication.EOApplication</code>.</p>
<p>You can think of the relationship this way: An uncustomized
nondirect Java Client application is a completely customized Direct
to Java Client application that doesn't use the rule system for
building user interfaces or managing the basic tasks of the client application
such as application startup. Whereas the user interface in uncustomized
Direct to Java Client applications is generated dynamically at runtime
and can include static, hand-built user interfaces, the user interface
in nondirect Java Client applications is always static and built
by hand.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most significant difference between the two starting
points is that Direct to Java Client provides a rapid development
environment that is useful both for prototyping applications and
for building full-featured, usable applications. When you start
with the nondirect approach, you get almost nothing for free&#151;you
have to build all the user interfaces for the application by hand.
This book highly recommends that you begin with the Direct to Java
Client project type and use elements of the nondirect project type
within it if necessary. </p>
<p>If you need the precise user-interface customization that
the nondirect approach allows, it's much easier to integrate a
custom interface file in a Direct to Java Client application than
to develop a completely custom Java Client application (though this
is possible and supported). That way, you get the best of both worlds:
the advantages of Direct to Java Client and the advantages of custom
interfaces built with the nondirect approach.</p>
<p>The primary advantage of Direct to Java Client is that it's
not necessary to write source code to generate or manage all of
an application's user interface. This allows you to focus on writing
business logic instead. The direct approach lets you manage user
interfaces without writing much source code and offers a number
of alternative mechanisms to customize user interfaces:</p>
<ul><li>Direct to
Java Client Assistant (tool)</font></li>
<li>custom rules (rule system)</font></li>
<li>freezing XML (custom interface)</font></li>
<li>freezing nib files (custom interface)</font></li>
<li>using custom controller classes (custom code)</font></li>
<li>using the controller factory programmatically</font></li></ul>
<p>This book covers all of these customization methods.</p>
<p>The user interfaces for the two staring points to Java Client
development each have a particular character. However, keep in mind
that it's possible to customize each type of interface to look
like the other.</p>
<p>Typically, user interfaces built in Interface Builder for
nondirect Java Client applications or for use as frozen interface
files in Direct to Java Client applications resemble  <a href="#TPXREF118">Figure 1-1</a>.</p>

1-1 A custom Java Client interface</font></b></p>
 <img src = "../Art/javaclientapp.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/javaclientapp.gif]">

<p>The dynamic user-interface generation provided in Direct to
Java Client applications yields interfaces that resemble  <a href="#TPXREF119">Figure 1-2</a>.
However, advanced Direct to Java Client applications are likely
to include other, nondynamically generated user interfaces such
as custom controller classes or frozen interface files built in
Interface Builder. </p>

<p> <a href="#BEIFBFHE">Figure 1-3</a> shows dynamically-generated user interfaces
that make use of custom controller classes, custom rules, and programmatic
invocations of the controller factory.</p>

<p>Direct to Java Client simplifies many parts of the development
process and facilitates the addition of features such as localization,
data access, and data model synchronization. The direct approach
to Java Client is a great way to start developing Java Client applications because
it allows you to rely on the rule system to dynamically generate
user interfaces. Dynamically generated user interfaces are more
flexible with regard to changes made in your data model than are
static interfaces and provide other advantages as shown in  <a href="#TPXREF124">Table 1-1</a>.</p>

</table><br>
<p>If you decide to start development with the nondirect Java
Client approach, you should keep in mind that your application will
be harder to bring forward and maintain than an application started
with the Direct to Java Client approach. The maintenance costs are higher
for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul><li>you write
more code</font></li>
<li>you have more frozen interface pieces</font></li>
<li>you need multiple versions of the same interface file for
each language and platform</font></li>
<li>it's harder to synchronize the user interface with changes
in data models</font></li></ul>
<p>So while you can write nondirect Java Client applications,
the Direct to Java Client approach helps you build applications
that are far easier to bring forward and maintain. You'll also
find that application development time is significantly reduced
with the direct approach. </p>
