Here are a few quick notes on building SprocketInvaders.First and foremost you'll need to process the sprite artwork.  Go into the 'Sprites' folder and drop the following files:    playbutton.sprt    Prevtrack.sprt    Skiptrack.sprt    Stop.sprtonto the app "SpriteOptimizer".  The above list of files are versions that can be edited with the included application "SpriteEditor."  After processing with SpriteOptimizer the new files are ready to be included in the SprocketInvaders project.  This is the basic process for adding custom art to the project.This CodeWarrior project file was created for CodeWarrior Pro 5.  You will need this version as well as the lastet Universal Interfaces from Apple distribution to build SprocketInvaders.
