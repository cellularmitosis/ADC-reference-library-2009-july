<P>If you have a large number of components, you might want to enter a comment in the Description field to help you identify the component. 
<P>When you create a component, you're creating a subdirectory named <I>Component</I><B>.wo</B> under the application directory. There are three parts to a component: an HTML template, a script, and bindings between the two. You use WebObjects Builder's <U><A HREF="ComponentWindow.html">component window</A></U> to create these three parts. "<U><A HREF="../../DevGuide/Intro/Components.html">Components</A></U>" in the introduction to the <I>WebObjects Developer's Guide</I> describes other things that can go into a component.
<P>In many cases, you'll want to use components that already exist. <U><A HREF="ReusableComponents.html">Reusing components</A></U> is one of the powerful features of WebObjects. If the component already exists, you can <U><A HREF="AddExistingComponent.html">add it to the application</A></U>. 
<P><B>Note: </B>The menu command File-&gt;New creates a new component that is not added to your application.
