	the parts of it that we require for AppleScript to function have not been
	set up yet.
	
	In this file is create and initialize a Cocoa object that serves as the root
	of the scripting object model.  In a Cocoa application, an NSApplication
	instance would automatically fill this role, but since we don't have one,
	we have to manually supply our own object.
	  
	The implementation for this file is done in Objective-C, but this file
	restricts itself to only using C language constructs because we include
	it in our main.c file.
