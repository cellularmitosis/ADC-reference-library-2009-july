	Change History (most recent first):

$Log: MoreWindows.h,v $
Revision 1.12  2003/03/28 16:15:42         
Removed a bunch of #pragma import/export directives.  IIRC PCG added them for reasons I don't fully understand.  He may have meant #pragma internal.  Regardless, there presence was causing lots of MIB symbols to be CFM exported, which is wrong.  MIB is not meant to ship as a shared library.

Revision 1.11  2002/11/09 00:15:38         
When using framework includes, explicitly include the frameworks we need.

Revision 1.10  2001/11/07 15:56:08         
Tidy up headers, add CVS logs, update copyright.
