The Black Rhinoceros (also known as a hook-lipped rhinocerous) is a large herbivore that lives in the rain forrests and plains of eastern Africa. Adults are 10-12 feet long and up to 5 feet high at the shoulder and weighingup to 2 tons. The horns are made of a fibrous keratin materal and does not contain a bone core like most other horned species.Females give birth to a single calf weighing 85 lbs after a 15-16 month gestation period at the end of the rainy season. The calf matures in 5 years and will have a 50 year life span in captivity.Rhinocerouses are herbavores and eat leavy plants as well as branches, shoots,thorny wood bushes, and fruit. Somewhat nocturnal, the Rhino has few naturalpredators although the young are preyed upon by hyenas.The animals are very aggressive, and solitary. There are very few of these animals left in the wild, and this species is listed as endangered.
