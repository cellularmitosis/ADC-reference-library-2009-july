Within that database, there are multiple<STRONG>areas</STRONG>, distinguished by name. An area is thefundamental unit of database modification. There are two types ofareas, named areas and temporary areas.</P><P>A <STRONG>named area</STRONG> holds some preferences. In thecurrent model, there is only one named area, "Default", which holdsthe preferences for all the networking components.</P><P>A <STRONG>temporary area</STRONG> is created when you startmodifying a named area. The temporary area allows you perform yourchanges without affecting the current network services. When you'vefinished your modifications, you <STRONG>commit</STRONG> the changes,ie you atomically overwrite the original area with the modifiedtemporary area. This also tears down the corresponding network stacksand brings them up with the new configuration.</P><P>Within each area there are a number of <STRONG>entities</STRONG>,distinguished by name. Entities also have a attributes of<STRONG>class</STRONG> and <STRONG>type</STRONG> (which are<CODE>OSType</CODE>s). There are currently three classes of entities:</P><UL>   <LI>A <STRONG>network connection entity</STRONG> holds information   about a single instance of a single network protocol. These   entities are further distinguished by type, which is the type of   network protocol.      <LI>A <STRONG>protocol globals entity</STRONG> holds information   global to all the connections for a particular protocol. Again the   type is used to distinguish the globals for each protocol.      <LI>A <STRONG>set entity</STRONG> provides a mechanism to group   the above. All set entities have the same type.</UL><P>Within each entity there are zero or more<STRONG>preferences</STRONG>, distinguished by a <STRONG>preferencetype</STRONG> (an <CODE>OSType</CODE>). A preference is thefundamental unit of data within the database. Each type of preferenceholds data whose format is defined by a C structure associated withthat preference type. In general, the preference type has the sameformat of the equivalent resource type used in the Open Transport 1.xpreferences files.</P><H2>Example</H2><P>Let’s say you have AppleTalk and TCP/IP installed, and eachprotocol has a configuration associated with "Home" and "Work". Thedatabase might look like:</P><UL>   <LI>Open Transport Preferences Database      <UL>      <LI>Default Area            <UL>         <LI>AppleTalk protocol globals entity                  <UL>            <LI>'opts' preference                        <LI>...         </UL>                  <LI>TCP/IP protocol globals entry                  <UL>            <LI>'opts' preference                        <LI>...         </UL>                  <LI>Home (AppleTalk) connection entity                  <UL>            <LI>'atpf' preference (general AppleTalk preferences)                        <LI>'port' preference (user visible name of this port)                        <LI>...         </UL>                  <LI>Work (AppleTalk) connection entity                  <UL>            <LI>same set of prefs as above, with different values         </UL>                  <LI>Home (TCP/IP) connection entity                  <UL>            <LI>'idns' preference (DNS configuration)                        <LI>'port' preference (user visible name of this port)                        <LI>...         </UL>                  <LI>Work (TCP/IP) connection entity                  <UL>            <LI>same set of prefs as above, with different values         </UL>                  <LI>Home set entity                  <UL>            <LI>AppleTalk protocol globals entity                        <LI>Home (AppleTalk) connection entity                        <LI>Home (TCP/IP) connection entity         </UL>                  <LI>Work set entity                  <UL>            <LI>AppleTalk protocol globals entity                        <LI>Work (AppleTalk) connection entity                        <LI>Work (TCP/IP) connection entity         </UL>      </UL>   </UL></UL><H2>Credits and Version History</H2><P>If you find any problems with this document, mail&lt;DTS@apple.com&gt; with "Attn: Quinn" as the first line of yourmail and I'll try to fix them up.</P><P>1.0d1 (Jul 1998) (named "OTConfigSDKBigPicture.html") shipped to alimit number of developers in a private seeding program.</P><P>1.0b1 (Sep 1998) was first distributed with the "OTTCPWillDial"sample.</P><P>Share and Enjoy.</P><P>Quinn "The Eskimo!"<BR>Apple Developer Technical Support<BR>Networking, Communications, Hardware</P><P>30 Sep 1998</P><P>&nbsp;</P></BODY></HTML>
