 <B>scroll bar</B>  A control with which the user can change the portion of a document displayed within a window. A scroll bar is a light gray rectangle with scroll arrows at each end. Windows can have a horizontal scroll bar, a vertical scroll bar, or both. A vertical scroll bar lies along the right side of a window. A horizontal scroll bar runs along the bottom of <BR>a window. Inside the scroll bar is a rectangle called the scroll box. The rest of the scroll bar <BR>is called the gray area. The user can move through a document by manipulating the parts <BR>of the scroll bar.  <P>
 <B>scroll box</B>  A box that slides up and down or back and forth across a scroll bar.

 <B>standard control definition functions</B>  Three control definition functions, stored as <CODE>'CDEF</CODE>' resources in the System file. The <CODE>'CDEF'</CODE> resource with resource ID 0 defines the look and behavior of buttons, checkboxes, and radio buttons; the <CODE>'CDEF'</CODE> resource with resource ID 1 defines the look and behavior of scroll bars; and the <CODE>'CDEF'</CODE> resource with resource ID 63 defines the look and behavior of pop-up menus.  <P>
 <B>standard state</B>  The size and location that <BR>an application deems the most convenient for <BR>a window.  <P>
 <B>Startup Items folder</B>A directory located in the System Folder for storing applications and desk accessories that the user wants started up every time the Finder starts up.  <P>
 <B>stationery pad</B>  A document that a user creates to serve as a template for other documents. The Finder tags a document as a stationery pad by setting the <CODE>isStationery</CODE> bit in the Finder <BR>flags field of the file's file information record. <BR>An application that is asked to open a stationery pad should copy the template's contents into a new document and open the document in an untitled window.  <P>
 <B>stop alert</B>  An alert box that informs the user of a problem or situation so serious that the user's desired action cannot be completed. Stop alerts typically have only a single button (OK), because all the user can do is acknowledge that the action cannot be completed. A stop alert is identified by an icon of an upraised hand in the upper-left corner of the alert box. See also <B>caution alert</B> and <B>note alert.</B>  <P>

 <B>system alert sound</B>  A sound resource that is stored in the System file and played whenever system software or an application uses the Sound Manager procedure <CODE>SysBeep</CODE>. With the Sound control panel, the user can select which sound <BR>to use.  <P>
 <B>System file</B>  A file, located in the System Folder, that contains the basic system software plus some system resources, such as sound and keyboard resources.The System file behaves like a folder in this regard: although it looks like a suitcase icon, <P>
 double-clicking it opens a window that reveals movable resource files (such as sounds, keyboard layouts, and script system resource collections) stored in the System file.  <P>
 <B>System Folder</B>  A directory containing the software that Macintosh computers use to start up. The System Folder includes a set of folders for storing related files, such as preferences files that an application might need when starting up.  <P>

 <B>Toolbox Event Manager</B>  See <B>Event Manager.</B>  <P>
 <B>Trash folder</B>  A directory at the root level of a volume for storing files that the user has moved to the Trash icon. After opening the Trash icon, the user sees the collection of all items that the user has moved to the Trash icon--that is, the union of appropriate Trash directories from <BR>all mounted volumes. A Macintosh computer <BR>set up to share files among users in a network environment maintains separate Trash subdirectories for remote users within its shared Trash directory. The Finder empties a Trash directory (or, in the case of a file server, a Trash subdirectory) only when the user of that directory chooses the Empty Trash command.  <P>
 <B>update event</B>  An event indicating that the contents of a window need updating.  <P>
 <B>update region</B>  A region maintained by the Window Manager that includes the parts of a window's content region that need updating. <BR>The Event Manager generates update events <BR>as necessary, based on the contents of the <BR>update region, telling your application to update a window.  <P>
 <B>user state</B>  The size and location that the user has established for a window.  <P>
 <B>variation code</B>  A number that selects among variations supported by a single window defintion function or control definition function. The variation code is stored in the low-order 4 bits of the window definition ID or control definition ID. See also <B>control definition function, control definition ID, window definition function,</B> and <B>window definition ID.</B>  <P>
 <B>virtual key code</B>  A value that represents the key pressed or released by the user; this value is always the same for a specific physical key on a keyboard. Compare <B>character code.</B>  <P>

 <B>window</B>  An area on the screen that displays information, including user documents as well <BR>as communications such as alert boxes and dialog boxes. The user can open or close a window; move it around on the desktop; and sometimes change its size, scroll through it, and edit its contents.  <P>
 <B>window color table</B>  The data structure in which the Window Manager stores the colors <BR>to be used for drawing a window's frame and <BR>for highlighting selected text.  <P>
 <B>window definition function</B>  A function that defines the general appearance and behavior of a window. The Window Manager calls the window definition function to draw the window's frame, determine what region of the window the cursor is in, draw the window's size box, draw the window's zoom box, move and resize the window, and calculate the window's structure and content regions.  <P>
 <B>window definition ID</B>   An integer that specifies the resource ID of a window definition function in the upper 12 bits and an optional variation code in the lower 4 bits. When creating a new window, your application supplies a window definition ID either as a field in the <CODE>'WIND'</CODE> resource or as a parameter to the <CODE>NewWindow</CODE> or <CODE>NewCWindow</CODE> function.  <P>
 <B>window list</B>  A list maintained by the Window Manager of all windows on the desktop. The frontmost window is first in the window list, and the remaining windows appear in the order in which they are layered on the desktop.  <P>
 <B>Window Manager port</B>  A graphics port that represents the desktop area on the main monitor--that is, a rounded-corner rectangle that occupies all of the main monitor except for the area occupied by the title bar.  <P>
