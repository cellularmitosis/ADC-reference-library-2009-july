# This is a script for directing QTVR movies.## ¥¥This script format is under development: any comments are welcome!¥¥## Tim Monroe# (monroe@apple.com)# QuickTime Engineering/Apple Computer, Inc.# 07 March 1997 et seqq.## By putting information into this file, you can direct the embedding# of sounds, pictures, movies, 3D objects, etc. in a QuickTime VR movie.## Here are some points to keep in mind:## ¥ Each command must occupy one line.# ¥ Any line beginning with '#' is a comment and is ignored.# ¥ Command parameters must be separated by any amount of white space.# ¥ All angles are specified in degrees.# ¥ Some commands (like AtClickHS) take a command line as a parameter;#	the parameter command line must have its white space replaced by '#'.#	For example: AtClickHS  1  50  0  SetBarState#2#0#	which toggles the controller bar state whenever hot spot 50 is clicked in node 1.#	Moreover, if the parameter command line itself takes a command as a#	parameter, its white space must be replaced by '%'. # ¥ [This space for rent.]# ¥ ## Here are the currently supported cast members:## OpenQTVRMovieFile		Open and use the specified QTVR movie file. # ReplaceMainMovie		Open the specified movie in place of the current one.# SetCurrentDirectory	Set the directory to be searched for content files.# SetBarState			Show or hide the controller bar.# SetButtonState		Show or hide a button in the controller bar.# SetResizeState		Enable or disable window resizing.# SetWindowSize			Set the current size of a movie window.# SetMaxWindowSize		Set the maximum size of a movie window.# ReplaceCursor			Replace one cursor by another.# SetHotSpotIDCursors	Replace the triad of cursors for a hot spot specified by its ID.# SetHotSpotTypeCursors	Replace the triad of cursors for all hot spots of a specified type.# GoToNodeID			Go to a node.# ShowDefaultView		Display the default view of the current node.# OpenResourceFile		Put the named resource file in the resource chain.# SetCorrection			Set the imaging correction mode.# SetQuality			Set the image quality.# SetSwingSpeed			Set the speed of swing transitions for the current node.# SetSwingDirection		Set the direction of swing transitions for the current node.# SetSwingState			Enable or disable swing transitions for the current node.# SetPanAngle			Set the pan angle.# SetTiltAngle			Set the tilt angle.# SetPanTiltZoom		Set the pan, tilt, and zoom angles (at the same time).# SetFieldOfView		Set the field of view.# SetViewCenter			Set the view center.
