From these three simple <em>modeling objects</em>, arbitrarily complex systems can be modeled. For instance, a company's customer base, a library of books, or a network of computers can all be depicted as E-R models. If the parts of a system can be identified, the system can be expressed as an <br>E-R model.<p></a><a name="396">Pure Entity-Relationship modeling is independent of native database architecture. Theoretically, an E-R model can be implemented as a relational database, an object-oriented database, a file system, or any other data storage system. In practice, E-R modeling fits most naturally with relational databases; in other words, with databases that store data in two-dimensional tables. The examples and illustrations in this chapter follow this lead by posing a hypothetical relational database server from which data is drawn. <p></a><P> <a href="ApA_ERMd.html"><IMG SRC="ArrowUp.gif">Table of Contents</a> <a href="ApA_ERMd2.html"><IMG SRC="ArrowRight.gif">Next Section</a><P></body></html>
