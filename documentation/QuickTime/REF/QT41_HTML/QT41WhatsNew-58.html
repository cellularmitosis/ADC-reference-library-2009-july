QuickTime opens an instance of the specified custom action handler, passes it the action to execute, and then closes the component. When used as an object that maintains state, the movie author needs to open an instance of the handler with a unique instance ID. In this case, QuickTime keeps the action handler component open until the movie is closed. When making calls to an action handler that has been opened, the unique instance ID is specified, allowing QuickTime to route the request to the correct component instance.</P><P CLASS="T1-Text1"><A NAME="pgfId-51942"></A>Note that there is currently no way to specify that the handler is a component that has already been opened by QuickTime, such as a media handler or codec that is in use. One special case has been included for developers authoring media handlers that support custom wired actions. If the component description of the custom action's target matches that of the target media handler, then the custom action is sent to the instance of the media handler that already in use. This means that the movie author does not need to (and should not) open an instance of the component.</P><P CLASS="T1-Text1"><A NAME="pgfId-51711"></A>When authoring a movie with a custom action, the type of component to use to execute it is specified, along with an instance ID. If the component is being used as a simple subroutine library, which does not need to keep track of any state, then the ID may be set to zero. If a particular instance of an open action-handling component is intended to be used, then the ID is used to refer to it. You may use the <TT>kActionOpenCustomHandler</TT> to open the component with a particular ID. This ID should be obtained by using the <TT>kOperandUniqueCustomHandlerID</TT> to ensure that your movie will work after edits are performed. After opening a custom action handler you may use <TT>kOperandCustomActionHandlerOpen</TT> to determine that the component was indeed found and opened successfully.</P><P CLASS="T1-Text1"><A NAME="pgfId-51722"></A>If the instance ID is set to zero and the component description matches that of the media handler that is the target of the action, then the media handler is used to execute the custom action. </P><hr>&#169; 2000 Apple Computer, Inc.<!-- QTnavbar start --><P><I>Inside Macintosh: QuickTime Reference</I><P>| <A HREF="QT41WhatsNew-57.html">Previous</A> | <A HREF="QT41WhatsNew-1.html">Chapter Contents</A> | <A HREF="QT41WhatsNew.html">Chapter Top</A> | <A HREF="QT41WhatsNew-59.html">Next</A> |</P><!-- QTnavbar end --></DIV><!-- start of footer --><!--#include virtual="/includes/framesetfooter" --><!-- end of footer --></BODY></HTML>
