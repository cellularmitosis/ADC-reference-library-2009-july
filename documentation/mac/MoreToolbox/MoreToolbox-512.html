For <CODE>'hdlg'</CODE> resources, however, the Help Manager allows you to specify alternate rectangles for transposing balloon tips. You can also specify alternate rectangles when you use the <CODE>HMShowBalloon</CODE> and <CODE>HMShowMenuBalloon</CODE> functions. Compare <B>hot rectangle.</B> See also <B>tip.</B><P>
