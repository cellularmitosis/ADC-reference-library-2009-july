When you create a new object in your application and save it to the database, you're adding a new row to a database table, and this row needs a primary key (that is, it needs to have a unique value for the primary key attribute you set in EOModeler). Enterprise Objects Framework handles generating this unique value for you.<P><LI><A NAME="pgfId=1006737"> </A>Formatting of money and dates<P><LI><A NAME="pgfId=1006738"> </A>Coordinating the user interface with your data<P><A NAME="pgfId=1006739"> </A>Enterprise Objects Framework keeps all parts of an application synchronized with the current view of the data.
