To do so, it usesa framework called the Enterprise Objects Framework. This chapterintroduces you to the Enterprise Objects Framework by showing youhow to create a simple database application. The steps you takein creating this application demonstrate the principles you'lluse in every other application you develop with the WebObjects and EnterpriseObjects frameworks.</font></p><p><font face="Times">The application you'll create in this tutorial is calledMovies. It makes use of a sample database, the Movies database,that contains information about movies. In this tutorial we'lluse the OpenBase Lite database that comes with WebObjects. If youwish to use another database, you need to set up the Movies databaseas described in the Post-Installation Instructions. Also, if youaren't familiar with Project Builder and WebObjects Builder, readthe first tutorials in this book,  <a sector="mod" href="../GuestBookPlus/iEnhancing_Y_Application.html" target="_top">"Enhancing Your Application"</a>,which introduce basic concepts and procedures you should know beforeyou go on.</font></p><p><font face="Times">In this tutorial, you will</font></p><ul><p><li>Use EOModeler'swizard to create basic model file.</li></p><p><li>Use the WebObjects Application Wizard to create a fully functionalMain component that reads and writes from the Movies database.</li></p><p><li>Create custom enterprise object classes.</li></p><p><li>Create and configure <em>display groups</em> forinteracting with a database in terms of objects.</li></p><p><li>Create bindings between display groups and a user interface.</li></p><p><li>Write code to manipulate display groups' selected objects.</li></p><p><li>Set up display groups in a master-detail configuration.</li></p><p><li>Use EOModeler to enhance a model file.</li></p></ul><p><font face="Times">Along the way, you'll learn basic Enterprise Objects Frameworkconcepts you can use to design your own database applications.</font></p><br><table border = "0" BGCOLOR="#E6E6E6"><tr><td scope="row"><p><b>Note: </b>Youcan also develop database applications using Direct to Web, a high-level frameworkbased on WebObjects. Direct to Web instantly generates a generic databaseapplication and allows you to modify its user interface, which makesit a useful starting point for simple projects without very specificuser interface requirements.
