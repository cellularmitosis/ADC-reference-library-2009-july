README - QTDataExQTDataEx is a sample application that illustrates the most basic ways of using QuickTime's movie importers and exporters (data exchange components). It shows how to import files that are not QuickTime movie files, how to export a movie into any format supported by QuickTime's movie exporters, and how to export a movie as a hinted movie file. It also illustrates how to use a custom movie progress function.Enjoy, QuickTime Team
