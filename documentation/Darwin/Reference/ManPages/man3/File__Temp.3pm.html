File::Temp(3pm)                       Perl Programmers Reference Guide                       File::Temp(3pm)



<b>NAME</b>
       File::Temp - return name and handle of a temporary file safely

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
         use File::Temp qw/ tempfile tempdir /;

         $fh = tempfile();
         ($fh, $filename) = tempfile();

         ($fh, $filename) = tempfile( $template, DIR =&gt; $dir);
         ($fh, $filename) = tempfile( $template, SUFFIX =&gt; '.dat');

         $dir = tempdir( CLEANUP =&gt; 1 );
         ($fh, $filename) = tempfile( DIR =&gt; $dir );

       Object interface:

         require File::Temp;
         use File::Temp ();

         $fh = new File::Temp($template);
         $fname = $fh-&gt;filename;

         $tmp = new File::Temp( UNLINK =&gt; 0, SUFFIX =&gt; '.dat' );
         print $tmp "Some data\n";
         print "Filename is $tmp\n";

       The following interfaces are provided for compatibility with existing APIs. They should not be used
       in new code.

       MkTemp family:

         use File::Temp qw/ :mktemp  /;

         ($fh, $file) = mkstemp( "tmpfileXXXXX" );
         ($fh, $file) = mkstemps( "tmpfileXXXXXX", $suffix);

         $tmpdir = mkdtemp( $template );

         $unopened_file = mktemp( $template );

       POSIX functions:

         use File::Temp qw/ :POSIX /;

         $file = tmpnam();
         $fh = tmpfile();

         ($fh, $file) = tmpnam();

       Compatibility functions:

         $unopened_file = File::Temp::tempnam( $dir, $pfx );

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       "File::Temp" can be used to create and open temporary files in a safe way.  There is both a function
       interface and an object-oriented interface.  The File::Temp constructor or the <u>tempfile()</u> function
       can be used to return the name and the open filehandle of a temporary file.  The <u>tempdir()</u> function
       can be used to create a temporary directory.

       The security aspect of temporary file creation is emphasized such that a filehandle and filename are
       returned together.  This helps guarantee that a race condition can not occur where the temporary file
       is created by another process between checking for the existence of the file and its opening.  Addi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tional&nbsp;Additional</font>
       tional security levels are provided to check, for example, that the sticky bit is set on world
       writable directories.  See "safe_level" for more information.

       For compatibility with popular C library functions, Perl implementations of the <u>mkstemp()</u> family of
       functions are provided. These are, <u>mkstemp()</u>, <u>mkstemps()</u>, <u>mkdtemp()</u> and <u>mktemp()</u>.

       Additionally, implementations of the standard POSIX <u>tmpnam()</u> and <u>tmpfile()</u> functions are provided if
       required.

       Implementations of <u>mktemp()</u>, <u>tmpnam()</u>, and <u>tempnam()</u> are provided, but should be used with caution
       since they return only a filename that was valid when function was called, so cannot guarantee that
       the file will not exist by the time the caller opens the filename.

<b>OBJECT-ORIENTED</b> <b>INTERFACE</b>
       This is the primary interface for interacting with "File::Temp". Using the OO interface a temporary
       file can be created when the object is constructed and the file can be removed when the object is no
       longer required.

       Note that there is no method to obtain the filehandle from the "File::Temp" object. The object itself
       acts as a filehandle. Also, the object is configured such that it stringifies to the name of the tem-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">porary&nbsp;temporary</font>
       porary file.

       <b>new</b> Create a temporary file object.

             my $tmp = new File::Temp();

           by default the object is constructed as if "tempfile" was called without options, but with the
           additional behaviour that the temporary file is removed by the object destructor if UNLINK is set
           to true (the default).

           Supported arguments are the same as for "tempfile": UNLINK (defaulting to true), DIR and SUFFIX.
           Additionally, the filename template is specified using the TEMPLATE option. The OPEN option is
           not supported (the file is always opened).

            $tmp = new File::Temp( TEMPLATE =&gt; 'tempXXXXX',
                                   DIR =&gt; 'mydir',
                                   SUFFIX =&gt; '.dat');

           Arguments are case insensitive.

       <b>filename</b>
           Return the name of the temporary file associated with this object.

             $filename = $tmp-&gt;filename;

           This method is called automatically when the object is used as a string.

       <b>unlink_on_destroy</b>
           Control whether the file is unlinked when the object goes out of scope.  The file is removed if
           this value is true and $KEEP_ALL is not.

            $fh-&gt;unlink_on_destroy( 1 );

           Default is for the file to be removed.

       <b>DESTROY</b>
           When the object goes out of scope, the destructor is called. This destructor will attempt to
           unlink the file (using "unlink1") if the constructor was called with UNLINK set to 1 (the default
           state if UNLINK is not specified).

           No error is given if the unlink fails.

           If the global variable $KEEP_ALL is true, the file will not be removed.

<b>FUNCTIONS</b>
       This section describes the recommended interface for generating temporary files and directories.

       <b>tempfile</b>
           This is the basic function to generate temporary files.  The behaviour of the file can be changed
           using various options:

             $fh = tempfile();
             ($fh, $filename) = tempfile();

           Create a temporary file in  the directory specified for temporary files, as specified by the
           <u>tmpdir()</u> function in File::Spec.

             ($fh, $filename) = tempfile($template);

           Create a temporary file in the current directory using the supplied template.  Trailing `X' char-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">acters&nbsp;characters</font>
           acters are replaced with random letters to generate the filename.  At least four `X' characters
           must be present at the end of the template.

             ($fh, $filename) = tempfile($template, SUFFIX =&gt; $suffix)

           Same as previously, except that a suffix is added to the template after the `X' translation.
           Useful for ensuring that a temporary filename has a particular extension when needed by other
           applications.  But see the WARNING at the end.

             ($fh, $filename) = tempfile($template, DIR =&gt; $dir);

           Translates the template as before except that a directory name is specified.

             ($fh, $filename) = tempfile($template, UNLINK =&gt; 1);

           Return the filename and filehandle as before except that the file is automatically removed when
           the program exits (dependent on $KEEP_ALL). Default is for the file to be removed if a file han-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dle&nbsp;handle</font>
           dle is requested and to be kept if the filename is requested. In a scalar context (where no file-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">name&nbsp;filename</font>
           name is returned) the file is always deleted either (depending on the operating system) on exit
           or when it is closed (unless $KEEP_ALL is true when the temp file is created).

           Use the object-oriented interface if fine-grained control of when a file is removed is required.

           If the template is not specified, a template is always automatically generated. This temporary
           file is placed in <u>tmpdir()</u> (File::Spec) unless a directory is specified explicitly with the DIR
           option.

             $fh = tempfile( $template, DIR =&gt; $dir );

           If called in scalar context, only the filehandle is returned and the file will automatically be
           deleted when closed on operating systems that support this (see the description of <u>tmpfile()</u>
           elsewhere in this document).  This is the preferred mode of operation, as if you only have a
           filehandle, you can never create a race condition by fumbling with the filename. On systems that
           can not unlink an open file or can not mark a file as temporary when it is opened (for example,
           Windows NT uses the "O_TEMPORARY" flag) the file is marked for deletion when the program ends
           (equivalent to setting UNLINK to 1). The "UNLINK" flag is ignored if present.

             (undef, $filename) = tempfile($template, OPEN =&gt; 0);

           This will return the filename based on the template but will not open this file.  Cannot be used
           in conjunction with UNLINK set to true. Default is to always open the file to protect from possi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ble&nbsp;possible</font>
           ble race conditions. A warning is issued if warnings are turned on. Consider using the <u>tmpnam()</u>
           and <u>mktemp()</u> functions described elsewhere in this document if opening the file is not required.

           Options can be combined as required.

       <b>tempdir</b>
           This is the recommended interface for creation of temporary directories.  The behaviour of the
           function depends on the arguments:

             $tempdir = tempdir();

           Create a directory in <u>tmpdir()</u> (see File::Spec).

             $tempdir = tempdir( $template );

           Create a directory from the supplied template. This template is similar to that described for
           <u>tempfile()</u>. `X' characters at the end of the template are replaced with random letters to con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">struct&nbsp;construct</font>
           struct the directory name. At least four `X' characters must be in the template.

             $tempdir = tempdir ( DIR =&gt; $dir );

           Specifies the directory to use for the temporary directory.  The temporary directory name is
           derived from an internal template.

             $tempdir = tempdir ( $template, DIR =&gt; $dir );

           Prepend the supplied directory name to the template. The template should not include parent
           directory specifications itself. Any parent directory specifications are removed from the tem-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">plate&nbsp;template</font>
           plate before prepending the supplied directory.

             $tempdir = tempdir ( $template, TMPDIR =&gt; 1 );

           Using the supplied template, create the temporary directory in a standard location for temporary
           files. Equivalent to doing

             $tempdir = tempdir ( $template, DIR =&gt; File::Spec-&gt;tmpdir);

           but shorter. Parent directory specifications are stripped from the template itself. The "TMPDIR"
           option is ignored if "DIR" is set explicitly.  Additionally, "TMPDIR" is implied if neither a
           template nor a directory are supplied.

             $tempdir = tempdir( $template, CLEANUP =&gt; 1);

           Create a temporary directory using the supplied template, but attempt to remove it (and all files
           inside it) when the program exits. Note that an attempt will be made to remove all files from the
           directory even if they were not created by this module (otherwise why ask to clean it up?). The
           directory removal is made with the <u>rmtree()</u> function from the File::Path module.  Of course, if
           the template is not specified, the temporary directory will be created in <u>tmpdir()</u> and will also
           be removed at program exit.

<b>MKTEMP</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b>
       The following functions are Perl implementations of the <u>mktemp()</u> family of temp file generation sys-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tem&nbsp;system</font>
       tem calls.

       <b>mkstemp</b>
           Given a template, returns a filehandle to the temporary file and the name of the file.

             ($fh, $name) = mkstemp( $template );

           In scalar context, just the filehandle is returned.

           The template may be any filename with some number of X's appended to it, for example
           <u>/tmp/temp.XXXX</u>. The trailing X's are replaced with unique alphanumeric combinations.

       <b>mkstemps</b>
           Similar to <u>mkstemp()</u>, except that an extra argument can be supplied with a suffix to be appended
           to the template.

             ($fh, $name) = mkstemps( $template, $suffix );

           For example a template of "testXXXXXX" and suffix of ".dat" would generate a file similar to
           <u>testhGji</u><b>_</b><u>w.dat</u>.

           Returns just the filehandle alone when called in scalar context.

       <b>mkdtemp</b>
           Create a directory from a template. The template must end in X's that are replaced by the rou-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tine.&nbsp;routine.</font>
           tine.

             $tmpdir_name = mkdtemp($template);

           Returns the name of the temporary directory created.  Returns undef on failure.

           Directory must be removed by the caller.

       <b>mktemp</b>
           Returns a valid temporary filename but does not guarantee that the file will not be opened by
           someone else.

             $unopened_file = mktemp($template);

           Template is the same as that required by <u>mkstemp()</u>.

<b>POSIX</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b>
       This section describes the re-implementation of the <u>tmpnam()</u> and <u>tmpfile()</u> functions described in
       POSIX using the <u>mkstemp()</u> from this module.

       Unlike the POSIX implementations, the directory used for the temporary file is not specified in a
       system include file ("P_tmpdir") but simply depends on the choice of <u>tmpdir()</u> returned by File::Spec.
       On some implementations this location can be set using the "TMPDIR" environment variable, which may
       not be secure.  If this is a problem, simply use <u>mkstemp()</u> and specify a template.

       <b>tmpnam</b>
           When called in scalar context, returns the full name (including path) of a temporary file (uses
           <u>mktemp()</u>). The only check is that the file does not already exist, but there is no guarantee that
           that condition will continue to apply.

             $file = tmpnam();

           When called in list context, a filehandle to the open file and a filename are returned. This is
           achieved by calling <u>mkstemp()</u> after constructing a suitable template.

             ($fh, $file) = tmpnam();

           If possible, this form should be used to prevent possible race conditions.

           See "tmpdir" in File::Spec for information on the choice of temporary directory for a particular
           operating system.

       <b>tmpfile</b>
           Returns the filehandle of a temporary file.

             $fh = tmpfile();

           The file is removed when the filehandle is closed or when the program exits. No access to the
           filename is provided.

           If the temporary file can not be created undef is returned.  Currently this command will probably
           not work when the temporary directory is on an NFS file system.

<b>ADDITIONAL</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b>
       These functions are provided for backwards compatibility with common tempfile generation C library
       functions.

       They are not exported and must be addressed using the full package name.

       <b>tempnam</b>
           Return the name of a temporary file in the specified directory using a prefix. The file is guar-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">anteed&nbsp;guaranteed</font>
           anteed not to exist at the time the function was called, but such guarantees are good for one
           clock tick only.  Always use the proper form of "sysopen" with "O_CREAT | O_EXCL" if you must
           open such a filename.

             $filename = File::Temp::tempnam( $dir, $prefix );

           Equivalent to running <u>mktemp()</u> with $dir/$prefixXXXXXXXX (using unix file convention as an exam-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ple)&nbsp;example)</font>
           ple)

           Because this function uses <u>mktemp()</u>, it can suffer from race conditions.

<b>UTILITY</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b>
       Useful functions for dealing with the filehandle and filename.

       <b>unlink0</b>
           Given an open filehandle and the associated filename, make a safe unlink. This is achieved by
           first checking that the filename and filehandle initially point to the same file and that the
           number of links to the file is 1 (all fields returned by <u>stat()</u> are compared).  Then the filename
           is unlinked and the filehandle checked once again to verify that the number of links on that file
           is now 0.  This is the closest you can come to making sure that the filename unlinked was the
           same as the file whose descriptor you hold.

             unlink0($fh, $path)
                or die "Error unlinking file $path safely";

           Returns false on error. The filehandle is not closed since on some occasions this is not
           required.

           On some platforms, for example Windows NT, it is not possible to unlink an open file (the file
           must be closed first). On those platforms, the actual unlinking is deferred until the program
           ends and good status is returned. A check is still performed to make sure that the filehandle and
           filename are pointing to the same thing (but not at the time the end block is executed since the
           deferred removal may not have access to the filehandle).

           Additionally, on Windows NT not all the fields returned by <u>stat()</u> can be compared. For example,
           the "dev" and "rdev" fields seem to be different.  Also, it seems that the size of the file
           returned by <u>stat()</u> does not always agree, with "stat(FH)" being more accurate than "stat(file-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">name)",&nbsp;"stat(filename)",</font>
           name)", presumably because of caching issues even when using autoflush (this is usually overcome
           by waiting a while after writing to the tempfile before attempting to "unlink0" it).

           Finally, on NFS file systems the link count of the file handle does not always go to zero immedi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ately&nbsp;immediately</font>
           ately after unlinking. Currently, this command is expected to fail on NFS disks.

           This function is disabled if the global variable $KEEP_ALL is true and an unlink on open file is
           supported. If the unlink is to be deferred to the END block, the file is still registered for
           removal.

       <b>cmpstat</b>
           Compare "stat" of filehandle with "stat" of provided filename.  This can be used to check that
           the filename and filehandle initially point to the same file and that the number of links to the
           file is 1 (all fields returned by <u>stat()</u> are compared).

             cmpstat($fh, $path)
                or die "Error comparing handle with file";

           Returns false if the stat information differs or if the link count is greater than 1.

           On certain platofms, eg Windows, not all the fields returned by <u>stat()</u> can be compared. For exam-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ple,&nbsp;example,</font>
           ple, the "dev" and "rdev" fields seem to be different in Windows.  Also, it seems that the size
           of the file returned by <u>stat()</u> does not always agree, with "stat(FH)" being more accurate than
           "stat(filename)", presumably because of caching issues even when using autoflush (this is usually
           overcome by waiting a while after writing to the tempfile before attempting to "unlink0" it).

           Not exported by default.

       <b>unlink1</b>
           Similar to "unlink0" except after file comparison using cmpstat, the filehandle is closed prior
           to attempting to unlink the file. This allows the file to be removed without using an END block,
           but does mean that the post-unlink comparison of the filehandle state provided by "unlink0" is
           not available.

             unlink1($fh, $path)
                or die "Error closing and unlinking file";

           Usually called from the object destructor when using the OO interface.

           Not exported by default.

           This function is disabled if the global variable $KEEP_ALL is true.

       <b>cleanup</b>
           Calling this function will cause any temp files or temp directories that are registered for
           removal to be removed. This happens automatically when the process exits but can be triggered
           manually if the caller is sure that none of the temp files are required. This method can be reg-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">istered&nbsp;registered</font>
           istered as an Apache callback.

           On OSes where temp files are automatically removed when the temp file is closed, calling this
           function will have no effect other than to remove temporary directories (which may include tempo-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rary&nbsp;temporary</font>
           rary files).

             File::Temp::cleanup();

           Not exported by default.

<b>PACKAGE</b> <b>VARIABLES</b>
       These functions control the global state of the package.

       <b>safe_level</b>
           Controls the lengths to which the module will go to check the safety of the temporary file or
           directory before proceeding.  Options are:

           STANDARD
                   Do the basic security measures to ensure the directory exists and is writable, that the
                   <u>umask()</u> is fixed before opening of the file, that temporary files are opened only if they
                   do not already exist, and that possible race conditions are avoided.  Finally the unlink0
                   function is used to remove files safely.

           MEDIUM  In addition to the STANDARD security, the output directory is checked to make sure that
                   it is owned either by root or the user running the program. If the directory is writable
                   by group or by other, it is then checked to make sure that the sticky bit is set.

                   Will not work on platforms that do not support the "-k" test for sticky bit.

           HIGH    In addition to the MEDIUM security checks, also check for the possibility of ``<u>chown()</u>
                   giveaway'' using the POSIX <u>sysconf()</u> function. If this is a possibility, each directory
                   in the path is checked in turn for safeness, recursively walking back to the root direc-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tory.&nbsp;directory.</font>
                   tory.

                   For platforms that do not support the POSIX "_PC_CHOWN_RESTRICTED" symbol (for example,
                   Windows NT) it is assumed that ``<u>chown()</u> giveaway'' is possible and the recursive test is
                   performed.

           The level can be changed as follows:

             File::Temp-&gt;safe_level( File::Temp::HIGH );

           The level constants are not exported by the module.

           Currently, you must be running at least perl v5.6.0 in order to run with MEDIUM or HIGH security.
           This is simply because the safety tests use functions from Fcntl that are not available in older
           versions of perl. The problem is that the version number for Fcntl is the same in perl 5.6.0 and
           in 5.005_03 even though they are different versions.

           On systems that do not support the HIGH or MEDIUM safety levels (for example Win NT or OS/2) any
           attempt to change the level will be ignored. The decision to ignore rather than raise an excep-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;exception</font>
           tion allows portable programs to be written with high security in mind for the systems that can
           support this without those programs failing on systems where the extra tests are irrelevant.

           If you really need to see whether the change has been accepted simply examine the return value of
           "safe_level".

             $newlevel = File::Temp-&gt;safe_level( File::Temp::HIGH );
             die "Could not change to high security"
                 if $newlevel != File::Temp::HIGH;

       TopSystemUID
           This is the highest UID on the current system that refers to a root UID. This is used to make
           sure that the temporary directory is owned by a system UID ("root", "bin", "sys" etc) rather than
           simply by root.

           This is required since on many unix systems "/tmp" is not owned by root.

           Default is to assume that any UID less than or equal to 10 is a root UID.

             File::Temp-&gt;top_system_uid(10);
             my $topid = File::Temp-&gt;top_system_uid;

           This value can be adjusted to reduce security checking if required.  The value is only relevant
           when "safe_level" is set to MEDIUM or higher.

       <b>$KEEP_ALL</b>
           Controls whether temporary files and directories should be retained regardless of any instruc-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tions&nbsp;instructions</font>
           tions in the program to remove them automatically.  This is useful for debugging but should not
           be used in production code.

             $File::Temp::KEEP_ALL = 1;

           Default is for files to be removed as requested by the caller.

           In some cases, files will only be retained if this variable is true when the file is created.
           This means that you can not create a temporary file, set this variable and expect the temp file
           to still be around when the program exits.

       <b>$DEBUG</b>
           Controls whether debugging messages should be enabled.

             $File::Temp::DEBUG = 1;

           Default is for debugging mode to be disabled.

<b>WARNING</b>
       For maximum security, endeavour always to avoid ever looking at, touching, or even imputing the exis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tence&nbsp;existence</font>
       tence of the filename.  You do not know that that filename is connected to the same file as the han-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dle&nbsp;handle</font>
       dle you have, and attempts to check this can only trigger more race conditions.  It's far more secure
       to use the filehandle alone and dispense with the filename altogether.

       If you need to pass the handle to something that expects a filename then, on a unix system, use
       ""/dev/fd/" . fileno($fh)" for arbitrary programs, or more generally ""+&lt;=&amp;" . fileno($fh)" for Perl
       programs.  You will have to clear the close-on-exec bit on that file descriptor before passing it to
       another process.

           use Fcntl qw/F_SETFD F_GETFD/;
           fcntl($tmpfh, F_SETFD, 0)
               or die "Can't clear close-on-exec flag on temp fh: $!\n";

       <b>Temporary</b> <b>files</b> <b>and</b> <b>NFS</b>

       Some problems are associated with using temporary files that reside on NFS file systems and it is
       recommended that a local filesystem is used whenever possible. Some of the security tests will most
       probably fail when the temp file is not local. Additionally, be aware that the performance of I/O
       operations over NFS will not be as good as for a local disk.

       <b>Forking</b>

       In some cases files created by File::Temp are removed from within an END block. Since END blocks are
       triggered when a child process exits (unless "POSIX::_exit()" is used by the child) File::Temp takes
       care to only remove those temp files created by a particular process ID. This means that a child will
       not attempt to remove temp files created by the parent process.

       <b>BINMODE</b>

       The file returned by File::Temp will have been opened in binary mode if such a mode is available. If
       that is not correct, use the <u>binmode()</u> function to change the mode of the filehandle.

<b>HISTORY</b>
       Originally began life in May 1999 as an XS interface to the system <u>mkstemp()</u> function. In March 2000,
       the OpenBSD <u>mkstemp()</u> code was translated to Perl for total control of the code's security checking,
       to ensure the presence of the function regardless of operating system and to help with portability.
       The module was shipped as a standard part of perl from v5.6.1.

       See IO::File and File::MkTemp, Apachae::TempFile for different implementations of temporary file han-
       dling.
