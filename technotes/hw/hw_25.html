Refer to Figure 1 for the correct location of the SIMMs andsize resistors.</p><a name="Section3"></a><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><h2>Macintosh SE</h2><p>The Macintosh SE configurations (the original motherboard as well as therevised motherboard with a memory jumper selector) are the same as theMacintosh Plus, except physical locations on the motherboard are different. Inaddition, memory configurations with only two SIMMs (for example, 512K and 2MB) use slots 3 and 4 on the revised SE motherboard instead of slots 1 and 2like the original motherboard and Macintosh Plus. Refer to Figures 2 and 3 forthe correct locations and settings.</p>	<a name="Section4"></a><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><h2>Macintosh Classic</h2><p>The Macintosh Classic has the following possible configurations (see Figure4):</p><p>    1 MB, using eight 128 Kbit DRAMs soldered to the motherboard</p>    <p>2 MB, using the memory expansion card and setting the jumper to "SIMM NOTINSTALLED"</p>   <p> 2.5 MB, using two 256 Kbit SIMMs on the memory expansion card and setting thejumper to "SIMM INSTALLED"</p>    <p>4 MB, using two 1 Mbit SIMMs on the memory expansion card and setting thejumper to "SIMM INSTALLED"</p><p>When adding SIMMs to the memory expansion card, use either two 256 Kbit or two1 Mbit parts rated at 120 ns or faster.</p><BR><P><img src="images/hw_25_002.gif" alt="Classic SIMMs 1" width=448 height=644></p><P><img src="images/hw_25_003.gif" alt="Classic SIMMs 2" width=448 height=644></p><P><img src="images/hw_25_004.gif" alt="Classic SIMMs 2" width=448 height=644></p><a name="Section5"></a><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><h2>Macintosh SE/30, II, IIx, and IIcx</h2><p>Since these machines use a 32-bit data bus with eight-bit SIMMs, you mustalways upgrade memory in four SIMM chunks. The eight SIMM connectors aredivided into two banks of four SIMM slots, Bank A and Bank B.</p><p>On the Macintosh SE/30, Bank A is located next to the ROM SIMM while Bank B isnext to the 68882 coprocessor. On the Macintosh II and IIx, Bank A is the bankclosest to the edge of the board, while on the Macintosh IIcx, Bank A is thebank closest to the disk drives and power supply. Refer to Figure 5 for theproper locations of Banks A and B on the SE/30, II, and IIx, and refer toFigure 6 for the proper locations on the IIcx.</p><p>Unlike the Macintosh Plus and the Macintosh SE, the Macintosh II and IIx haveno resistors to cut and no jumpers to set; you need only install the SIMMS inthe correct banks and you'll be up and running. You can implement the followingconfigurations:</p><p>    1 MB, using four 256 Kbit SIMMs in Bank A</p>    <p>2 MB, using eight 256 Kbit SIMMs in Banks A and B</p>    <p>4 MB, using four 1 Mbit SIMMs in Bank A</p>    <p>5 MB, using four 1 Mbit SIMMs in Bank A and four 256 Kbit SIMMs in Bank B</p>   <p> 8 MB, using eight 1 Mbit SIMMs in Banks A and B     &gt;8 MB: see the 32-bit addressing information below</p><p>Again, it is important to make sure the right size SIMMs are in the right Bank;when you are using a combination of SIMMs, the larger SIMMs (in terms of Mbits)must typically be in Bank A (see the exception below). When you are using onlyfour SIMMs, they must be in Bank A as well.</p><b>32-Bit Addressing With the Macintosh SE/30, II, IIx, and IIcx</b><p>The Macintosh SE/30, II, IIx, and IIcx ROMs are not capable of 32-bitaddressing. These models can overcome this limitation, however, by using theappropriate system software. A/UX is a 32-bit operating system, as is System 7when used in conjunction with MODE32 or when used on a Macintosh with 32-bitclean ROMs.</p><p>To have more than 8 MB of RAM in a Macintosh II or IIx, special 120 ns PALSIMMs are required. These SIMMs incorporate PAL logic chips that overcomeproblems caused by the refresh logic on the Macintosh II and IIx. In addition,a PMMU is required on the Macintosh II. Please refer to the end of this Note("4 MBit DRAMs in Revolt") for more information on this subject.</p><p>Due to an undocumented feature in the ROM firmware shipped with the originalMacintosh II, a Macintosh II with original ROMs is limited to using SIMMs nolarger than 1 MB in Bank A. Large SIMMs can only be put in Bank B (that is, 4and 16 MB SIMMs). Remember that if Bank B is to be used at all, Bank A must bepopulated first. As a result of this limitation, the largest memoryconfiguration on an unmodified Macintosh II  using 1 MB SIMMs in Bank A and 4MB SIMMs in Bank B is 20 MB. This problem is avoided if you've installed theSuperDrive upgrade kit, which includes a set of Macintosh IIx ROMs. TheMacintosh IIx ROMs can handle 4 MB SIMMs, and expect the presence of a SWIMchip in place of the old IWM.</p><p>The theoretical maximum memory that a Macintosh SE/30, IIx, IIcx (and II withIIx ROMs) can address is 128 MB using 16 MB SIMMs.</p><p>Please remember that the use of large SIMM sizes with the Macintosh hardwareline has not yet been tested thoroughly. It is mentioned here for yourconsideration and should be considered theoretical until we have been able tofurther test all of these possible configurations.</p><P><img src="images/hw_25_005.gif" alt="Macintosh SE/30 1" width=550 height=748></p><P><img src="images/hw_25_006.gif" alt="Macintosh SE/30 2" width=550 height=714></p><a name="Section6"></a><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><h2>Macintosh LC</h2><p>The Macintosh LC uses a 16-bit data bus with 8-bit SIMMs, so upgrades mustalways be performed two SIMMs at a time. The LC has two SIMM connectors thatare used as a single additional RAM bank (see Figure 4) in addition to the 2 MBalready soldered to the motherboard. The following memory configurations can beimplemented by installing SIMM pairs in this additional bank:</p><p>    2 MB, using four 1 Mbit x 4 DRAMs soldered to the motherboard</p>    <p>4 MB, using two 1 Mbit SIMMs in the SIMM connectors</p>    <p>6 MB, using two 2 Mbit SIMMs in the SIMM connectors</p>    <p>10 MB, using two 4 Mbit SIMMs in the SIMM connectors</p><p>The Macintosh LC requires 100 ns or faster SIMMs.</p><a name="Section7"></a><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><h2>Macintosh IIsi</h2><p>The Macintosh IIsi is similar to the SE/30, II, IIx, and IIcx in that it uses a32-bit data bus with 8-bit SIMMs; you must always upgrade memory in four SIMMchunks. The IIsi differs in that it only has one SIMM bank instead of two (seeFigure 4).</p><p>If future 16 Mbit DRAMs are compatible with the current refresh frequency, thenthe IIsi will support 16 Mbit SIMMs, enabling a RAM configuration of 65 MB (4 x16 MB + 1 MB). The IIsi requires 100 ns or faster SIMMs.</p><a name="Section8"></a><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><h2>Macintosh IIci</h2><p>The Macintosh IIci motherboard layout is somewhat different from the IIcx, butthe location of the RAM SIMMs is unchanged. Bank A is still the bank closest tothe disk drives. Refer to Figure 6 for the proper locations of Banks A and B onthe IIci.</p><p>The IIci has a much improved RAM interface and allows a great deal more freedomwhen installing SIMMs. Banks A and B are interchangeable, meaning that whenmixing two sizes of RAM, the larger SIMMs do not necessarily have to go in BankA. In fact, for best performance when using on-board video, Apple recommendsthat the smaller SIMMs be installed in Bank A. Note, however, that if on-boardvideo is used, then RAM <b>must</b> be present in Bank A.</p><p>The IIci <b>requires</b> that SIMMs be 80 ns  time or faster and the same speedwithin a row. You can implement the following memory configurations with 256Kand 1 MB SIMMs:</p>    <p>1 MB using four 256 Kbit SIMMs in Bank A or in Bank B</p>   <p> 2 MB using eight 256 Kbit SIMMs in Banks A and B</p>    <p>4 MB using four 1 Mbit SIMMs in Bank A or in Bank B</p>    <p>5 MB using four 256 Kbit SIMMs in Bank A and four 1 Mbit SIMMs in Bank B</p>    <p>5 MB using four 1 MBit SIMMs in Bank A and four 256 Kbit SIMMs in Bank A</p>    <p>8 MB using eight 1 Mbit SIMMs in Banks A and B</p><p>The 1 MB and 4 MB configurations using only Bank B are not compatible withon-board video, since Bank A must contain memory when using on-board video. Thefirst 5 MB configuration (with 256 Kbit SIMMs in Bank A) is recommended for 5MB configurations using on-board video.</p><b>Parity RAM</b><p>Some specially ordered versions of the Macintosh IIci are equipped with a PGCchip and support parity for RAM error detection. These machines require parityRAM. SIMMs for these machines are nine bits wide instead of eight, so there isgenerally an extra RAM IC on the SIMM. There is no difference in theinstallation of 256K x 9 or 1M x 9 SIMMs.</p><a name="Section9"></a><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><h2>Macintosh Portable</h2><p>Memory expansion on the Macintosh Portable is different from other members ofthe Macintosh family since the Portable uses memory expansion cards in place ofSIMMs. The base Portable is equipped with 1 MB of RAM on the motherboard andhas one RAM expansion card slot. Apple currently supplies a 1 MB memoryexpansion kit that takes the Portable to 2 MB total. Apple and third-partydevelopers may produce higher-capacity expansion boards (2 MB to 8 MB) in thefuture.</p><p>Since the Portable has only one RAM expansion slot, you may use only one memoryexpansion board at a time. This limit means that a 1 MB expansion board wouldhave to be completely replaced by a higher-capacity board when it becameavailable.</p><P>Total RAM for the Portable will always be 1 MB plus the size of your one RAMexpansion board (if installed). Refer to Figure 6 for the location of the RAMexpansion slot.</P><P><img src="images/hw_25_007.gif" alt="Macintosh Portable" width=416 height=644></p><a name="Section10"></a><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><h2>Macintosh IIfx</h2><p>The Macintosh IIfx motherboard layout has its SIMMs located in the same generalarea as the IIx, but they are oriented transversely. Bank A is the bank closestto the rear of the machine; bank B is closest to the main processor. Refer toFigure 7 for the proper memory bank locations.</p><p>The IIfx has a RAM SIMM interface similar to that of the IIcx, et al.:  whenyou are using a combination of SIMMs, the larger SIMMs (in terms of Mbits) mustbe in Bank A. When you are using only four SIMMs, they must be in Bank A aswell. The description in the <i>Guide to the Macintosh Family Hardware</i>,Second Edition inaccurately states the larger SIMMs can be placed in eitherbank.</p><p>The IIfx <b>requires</b> that SIMMs be 80 ns RAS-access time or faster and thesame speed within a row. You can implement the following memory configurationswith 1 and 4 MB SIMMs (256K address-depth SIMMs are not supported):</p><p>    4 MB using four 1 Mbit SIMMs in Bank A</p>    <p>8 MB using eight 1 Mbit SIMMs in Banks A and B</p>    <p>16 MB using four 4 Mbit SIMMs in Bank A</p>    <p>20 MB using four 4 Mbit SIMMs in Banks A and four 1 Mbit SIMMs in Bank B</p>    <p>32 MB using eight 4 Mbit SIMMs in Banks A and B</p><b>Parity RAM</b><p>Parity RAM requirements are as follows:  if using 1 MB or 4 MB SIMMs, the RAMspeed must be 60 ns. However, the parity circuit programmable array that goeson the motherboard as well as the parity PALs that go on the SIMMs areproprietary to Apple--their equations are not expected to be released todevelopers. Because of this proprietary design, Apple does not recommendthird-party development of parity products.</p><p>The IIfx has 64-pin SIMMs, which are different from previous Macintosh models.Developers can request mechanical drawings and electrical specifications of theIIfx RAM SIMM modules from DTS. Please send the request with a mailing addressand include the words "IIfx SIMM information request" in the title of theelectronic mail request or letter to facilitate handling.</p><BR><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=550><TR><td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><P><B>Warning:</B><BR>To avoid degradation of signal quality, it is critical toadhere to the strict timing parameters of the IIfx and to use a good layoutthat takes high-speed circuits into account.</P></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><BR><img src="images/hw_25_2_001.gif" alt="Macintosh IIfx" width=550 height=778><P>Click <A HREF = "hw_25_2.html">here</a> for part 2 of the Macintosh Memory Configurations Technote.</p><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><P><A NAME=Downloads></A></P>                  <H2>Downloadables</H2>                  <TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <td width=50 align=left>                  <P><img src="images/acrobatsmall.gif" width=22 height=23 align=middle alt="Acrobat gif"></P>               </TD>               <td align="left">                  <P>Acrobat version of this Note (2700K)</P>               </TD>               <td width=60 align=left>                  <P><A HREF="pdf/hw_25.pdf">Download</A></P>               </TD>            </TR></table><BR><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><!-- end_content --><!-- begin_footer_information -->	<table width="680" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
