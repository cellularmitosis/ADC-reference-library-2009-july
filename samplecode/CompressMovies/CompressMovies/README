README -CompressMovieCompressMovie is a simple dragp and drop QuickTime application for compression of files. Drag and drop movie files on top of the application, and then specify the compression values (this happens the first time, after this the compression values are used for other movies dropped on the application at the same time).Note that it's not useful to re-compress already compressed movies, as such compression will introduce more lossiness in the quality of the images. If possible always compress using the original, non-compressed data.
