README - QTControllerThis code snippet shows one way to display a pop-up menu when the user clicks on the custombutton in the movie controller bar (just like the QuickTime web browser plug-in does for itscustom button). The basic idea is very simple: just call PopUpMenuSelect when the user clicksthe custom button. Before we do that, however, we need to obtain a MenuHandle to the desiredpop-up menu. Here we use NewMenu and MacAppendMenu to create the menu on the fly; we do this mainly so that we don't need to drag a resource file around. A real application would justcall MacGetMenu to read the menu from its resource file.Enjoy, QuickTime Team
