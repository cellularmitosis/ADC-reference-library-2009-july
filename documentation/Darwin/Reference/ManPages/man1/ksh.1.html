<b>NAME</b>
       ksh, rksh, pfksh - KornShell, a standard/restricted command and programming language

<b>NOTE</b>
       Currently, <u>rksh</u> and <u>pfksh</u> are not available on Mac OS X / Darwin.

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       [ <b>+-abcefhikmnoprstuvxBCDP</b> ] [ <b>-R</b> file ] [ <b>+-o</b> option ] ... [ <b>-</b> ] [ arg ... ]
       <b>rksh</b> [ <b>+-abcefhikmnoprstuvxBCD</b> ] [ <b>-R</b> file ] [ <b>+-o</b> option ] ...  [ <b>-</b> ] [ arg ... ]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       <u>Ksh</u>  is  a  command  and  programming language that executes commands read from a terminal or a file.
       <u>Rksh</u> is a restricted version of the command interpreter <u>ksh</u>; it is used to set  up  login  names  and
       execution  environments  whose  capabilities  are  more  controlled than those of the standard shell.
       <u>Rpfksh</u> is a profile shell version of the command interpreter <u>ksh</u>; it is used to to  execute  commands
       with  the  attributes specified by the user's profiles (see <!-- a --><u>pfexec</u>(1)<!-- /a -->).  See <u>Invocation</u> below for the
       meaning of arguments to the shell.

   <b>Definitions.</b>
       A <u>metacharacter</u> is one of the following characters:

              <b>;</b>   <b>&amp;</b>   <b>(</b>   <b>)</b>   <b>|</b>   <b>&lt;</b>   <b>&gt;</b>   <b>new-line</b>   <b>space</b>   <b>tab</b>

       A <u>blank</u> is a <b>tab</b> or a <b>space</b>.  An <u>identifier</u> is a sequence of letters, digits, or underscores starting
       with  a  letter  or  underscore.  Identifiers are used as components of <u>variable</u> names.  A <u>vname</u> is a
       sequence of one or more identifiers separated by a <b>.</b> and optionally preceded by a <b>.</b>.  Vnames are used
       as function and variable names.  A <u>word</u> is a sequence of <u>characters</u> from the character set defined by
       the current locale, excluding non-quoted <u>metacharacters</u>.

       A <u>command</u> is a sequence of characters in the syntax of the shell language.  The shell reads each com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
       mand  and carries out the desired action either directly or by invoking separate utilities.  A built-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">in&nbsp;builtin</font>
       in command is a command that is carried out by the shell itself without creating a separate  process.
       Some  commands are built-in purely for convenience and are not documented here.  Built-ins that cause
       side effects in the shell environment and built-ins that are found before performing  a  path  search
       (see  <u>Execution</u>  below)  are documented here.  For historical reasons, some of these built-ins behave
       differently than other built-ins and are called <u>special</u> <u>built-ins</u>.

   <b>Commands.</b>
       A <u>simple-command</u> is a list of variable assignments (see <u>Variable</u> <u>Assignments</u> below) or a sequence  of
       <u>blank</u>  separated  words  which  may  be  preceded  by a list of variable assignments (see <u>Environment</u>
       below).  The first word specifies the name of the command to be executed.  Except as specified below,
       the  remaining  words  are passed as arguments to the invoked command.  The command name is passed as
       argument 0 (see <!-- a --><u>exec</u>(2)<!-- /a -->).  The <u>value</u> of a simple-command is its exit status; 0-255 if  it  terminates
       normally;  256+<u>signum</u>  if  it terminates abnormally (the name of the signal corresponding to the exit
       status can be obtained via the <b>-l</b> option of the <b>kill</b> built-in utility).

       A <u>pipeline</u> is a sequence of one or more <u>commands</u> separated by <b>|</b>.  The standard output of each command
       but  the  last  is  connected  by a <a href="../man2/pipe.2.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/2/pipe"><u>pipe</u>(2)</a> to the standard input of the next command.  Each command,
       except possibly the last, is run as a separate process; the shell waits for the last command to  ter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">minate.&nbsp;terminate.</font>
       minate.   The  exit  status  of a pipeline is the exit status of the last command unless the <b>pipefail</b>
       option is enabled.  Each pipeline can be preceded by the <u>reserved</u> <u>word</u> <b>!</b>  which causes the exit  sta-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tus&nbsp;status</font>
       tus of the pipeline to become 0 if the exit status of the last command is non-zero, and 1 if the exit
       status of the last command is 0.

       A <u>list</u> is a sequence of one or more pipelines separated by <b>;</b>, <b>&amp;</b>, <b>|&amp;</b>, <b>&amp;&amp;</b>, or <b>||</b>, and optionally termi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nated&nbsp;terminated</font>
       nated by <b>;</b>, <b>&amp;</b>, or <b>|&amp;</b>.  Of these five symbols, <b>;</b>, <b>&amp;</b>, and <b>|&amp;</b> have equal precedence, which is lower than
       that of <b>&amp;&amp;</b> and <b>||</b>.  The symbols <b>&amp;&amp;</b> and <b>||</b> also have equal precedence.  A semicolon (<b>;</b>) causes sequen-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tial&nbsp;sequential</font>
       tial  execution of the preceding pipeline; an ampersand (<b>&amp;</b>) causes asynchronous execution of the pre-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ceding&nbsp;preceding</font>
       ceding pipeline (i.e., the shell does <u>not</u> wait for that pipeline to finish).  The  symbol  <b>|&amp;</b>  causes
       asynchronous execution of the preceding pipeline with a two-way pipe established to the parent shell;
       the standard input and output of the spawned pipeline can be written to and read from by  the  parent
       shell  by  applying the redirection operators <b>&lt;&amp;</b> and <b>&gt;&amp;</b> with arg <b>p</b> to commands and by using <b>-p</b> option
       of the built-in commands <b>read</b> and <b>print</b> described later.  The symbol <b>&amp;&amp;</b> (<b>||</b>) causes the <u>list</u>  follow-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;following</font>
       ing  it  to  be executed only if the preceding pipeline returns a zero (non-zero) value.  One or more
       new-lines may appear in a <u>list</u> instead of a semicolon, to delimit a command.  The first <u>item</u>  of  the
       first  <u>pipeline</u> of a <u>list</u> that is a simple command not beginning with a redirection, and not occuring
       within a <b>while</b>, <b>until</b>, or <b>if</b> <u>list</u>, can be prededed by a semicolon.  This semicolon is ignored  unless
       the <b>showme</b> option is enabled as described with the <b>set</b> built-in below.

       A  <u>command</u>  is  either  a simple-command or one of the following.  Unless otherwise stated, the value
       returned by a command is that of the last simple-command executed in the command.

       <b>for</b> <u>vname</u> [ <b>in</b> <u>word</u> ... ] <b>;do</b> <u>list</u> <b>;done</b>
              Each time a <b>for</b> command is executed, <u>vname</u> is set to the next <u>word</u>  taken  from  the  <b>in</b>  <u>word</u>
              list.   If  <b>in</b>  <u>word</u>  ...  is omitted, then the <b>for</b> command executes the <b>do</b> <u>list</u> once for each
              positional parameter that is set starting from <b>1</b> (see <u>Parameter</u> <u>Expansion</u>  below).   Execution
              ends when there are no more words in the list.

       <b>for</b> <b>((</b> [<u>expr1</u>] <b>;</b> [<u>expr2</u>] <b>;</b> [<u>expr3</u>] <b>))</b> <b>;do</b> <u>list</u> <b>;done</b>
              The  arithmetic  expression  <u>expr1</u>  is evaluated first (see <u>Arithmetic</u> <u>evaluation</u> below).  The
              arithmetic expression <u>expr2</u> is repeatedly evaluated until it evaluates to zero and  when  non-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">zero,&nbsp;nonzero,</font>
              zero,  <u>list</u>  is  executed and the arithmetic expression <u>expr3</u> evaluated.  If any expression is
              omitted, then it behaves as if it evaluated to 1.

       <b>select</b> <u>vname</u> [ <b>in</b> <u>word</u> ... ] <b>;do</b> <u>list</u> <b>;done</b>
              A <b>select</b> command prints on standard error (file descriptor 2) the set of <u>word</u>s, each  preceded
              by  a  number.  If <b>in</b> <u>word</u> ...  is omitted, then the positional parameters starting from <b>1</b> are
              used instead (see <u>Parameter</u> <u>Expansion</u> below).  The <b>PS3</b> prompt is printed and a  line  is  read
              from the standard input.  If this line consists of the number of one of the listed <u>word</u>s, then
              the value of the variable <u>vname</u> is set to the <u>word</u> corresponding to this number.  If this line
              is  empty,  the selection list is printed again.  Otherwise the value of the variable <u>vname</u> is
              set to <u>null</u>.  The contents of the line read from standard  input  is  saved  in  the  variable
              <b>REPLY</b>.   The  <u>list</u> is executed for each selection until a <b>break</b> or <u>end-of-file</u> is encountered.
              If the <b>REPLY</b> variable is set to <u>null</u> by the execution of <u>list</u>,  then  the  selection  list  is
              printed before displaying the <b>PS3</b> prompt for the next selection.

       <b>case</b> <u>word</u> <b>in</b> [ [<b>(</b>]<u>pattern</u> [ | <u>pattern</u> ] ... <b>)</b> <u>list</u> <b>;;</b> ] ... <b>esac</b>
              A  <b>case</b>  command  executes  the <u>list</u> associated with the first <u>pattern</u> that matches <u>word</u>.  The
              form of the patterns is the same as that used for file-name generation (see <u>File</u> <u>Name</u>  <u>Genera</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;Generation</font>
              <u>tion</u>  below).   The <b>;;</b> operator causes execution of <b>case</b> to terminate.  If <b>;&amp;</b> is used in place
              of <b>;;</b> the next subsequent list, if any,  is executed.

       <b>if</b> <u>list</u> <b>;then</b> <u>list</u> [ <b>;elif</b> <u>list</u> <b>;then</b> <u>list</u> ] ... [ <b>;else</b> <u>list</u> ] <b>;fi</b>
              The <u>list</u> following <b>if</b> is executed and, if it returns a zero exit status,  the  <u>list</u>  following
              the  first <b>then</b> is executed.  Otherwise, the <u>list</u> following <b>elif</b> is executed and, if its value
              is zero, the <u>list</u> following the next <b>then</b> is executed.  Failing each successive <b>elif</b> <u>list</u>, the
              <b>else</b>  <u>list</u>  is  executed.   If the <b>if</b> <u>list</u> has non-zero exit status and there is no <b>else</b> <u>list</u>,
              then the <b>if</b> command returns a zero exit status.

       <b>while</b> <u>list</u> <b>;do</b> <u>list</u> <b>;done</b>
       <b>until</b> <u>list</u> <b>;do</b> <u>list</u> <b>;done</b>
              A <b>while</b> command repeatedly executes the <b>while</b> <u>list</u> and, if the exit status of the last command
              in  the  list is zero, executes the <b>do</b> <u>list</u>; otherwise the loop terminates.  If no commands in
              the <b>do</b> <u>list</u> are executed, then the <b>while</b> command returns a zero exit status; <b>until</b> may be used
              in place of <b>while</b> to negate the loop termination test.

       <b>((</b><u>expression</u><b>))</b>
              The <u>expression</u> is evaluated using the rules for arithmetic evaluation described below.  If the
              value of the arithmetic expression is non-zero, the exit status is 0, otherwise the exit  sta-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tus&nbsp;status</font>
              tus is 1.

       <b>(</b><u>list</u><b>)</b>
              Execute  <u>list</u>  in  a  separate  environment.   Note, that if two adjacent open parentheses are
              needed for nesting, a space must be inserted to avoid evaluation as an arithmetic  command  as
              described above.

       <b>{</b> <u>list</u><b>;}</b>
              <u>list</u>  is  simply  executed.  Note that unlike the metacharacters <b>(</b> and <b>)</b>, <b>{</b> and <b>}</b> are <u>reserved</u>
              <u>word</u>s and must occur at the beginning of a line or after a <b>;</b> in order to be recognized.

       <b>[[</b> <u>expression</u> <b>]]</b>
              Evaluates <u>expression</u> and returns a zero exit status when <u>expression</u> is true.  See  <u>Conditional</u>
              <u>Expressions</u> below, for a description of <u>expression</u>.

       <b>function</b> <u>varname</u> <b>{</b> <u>list</u> <b>;}</b>
       <u>varname</u> <b>()</b> <b>{</b> <u>list</u> <b>;}</b>
              Define  a  function which is referenced by <u>varname</u>.  A function whose <u>varname</u> contains a <b>.</b>  is
              called a discipline function and the portion of the <u>varname</u> preceding the last <b>.</b>   must  refer
              to an existing variable.  The body of the function is the <u>list</u> of commands between <b>{</b> and <b>}</b>.  A
              function defined with the <b>function</b> <u>varname</u> syntax can also be used as an  argument  to  the  <b>.</b>
              special  built-in  command to get the equivalent behavior as if the <u>varname</u><b>()</b> syntax were used
              to define it.  (See <u>Functions</u> below.)

       <b>time</b> [ <u>pipeline</u> ]
              If <u>pipeline</u> is omitted the user and system time for the current shell and completed child pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cesses&nbsp;processes</font>
              cesses  is printed on standard error.  Otherwise, <u>pipeline</u> is executed and the elapsed time as
              well as the user and system time are printed on standard error.  The <b>TIMEFORMAT</b>  variable  may
              be  set to a format string that specifies how the timing information should be displayed.  See
              <b>Shell</b> <b>Variables</b> below for a description of the <b>TIMEFORMAT</b> variable.

       The following reserved words are recognized as reserved only when they are the first word of  a  com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
       mand and are not quoted:

       <b>if</b> <b>then</b> <b>else</b> <b>elif</b> <b>fi</b> <b>case</b> <b>esac</b> <b>for</b> <b>while</b> <b>until</b> <b>do</b> <b>done</b> <b>{</b> <b>}</b> <b>function</b> <b>select</b> <b>time</b> <b>[[</b> <b>]]</b> <b>!</b>

   <b>Variable</b> <b>Assignments.</b>
       One  or  more  variable  assignments  can  start a simple command or can be arguments to the <b>typeset</b>,
       <b>export</b>, or <b>readonly</b> special built-in commands.  The syntax for an <u>assignment</u> is of the form:

       <u>varname</u><b>=</b><u>word</u>
       <u>varname</u><b>[</b><u>word</u><b>]</b>=<u>word</u>
              No space is permitted between <u>varname</u> and the <b>=</b> or between <b>=</b> and <u>word</u>.

       <u>varname</u><b>=(</b><u>assign</u><b>_</b><u>list</u><b>)</b>
              No space is permitted between <u>varname</u> and the <b>=</b>.  An <u>assign</u><b>_</b><u>list</u> can be one of the following:
                      <u>word</u> ...
                             Indexed array assignment.
                      <b>[</b><u>word</u><b>]=</b><u>word</u> ...
                             Associative array assignment.  If preceded by <b>typeset</b> <b>-a</b> this  will  create  an
                             indexed array instead.
                      <u>assignment</u> ...
                             Compound  variable  assignment.   This creates a compound variable <u>varname</u> with
                             sub-variables of the form <u>varname</u><b>.</b><u>name</u>, where  <u>name</u>  is  the  name  portion  of
                             <u>assignment</u>.   The  value  of  <u>varname</u> will contain all the assignment elements.
                             Additional assignments made to sub-variables of <u>varname</u> will also be  displayed
                             as part of the value of <u>varname</u>.  If no <u>assignment</u>s are specified, <u>varname</u> will
                             be a compound variable allowing subsequence child elements to be defined.
                      <b>typeset</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>assignment</u> ...
                             Nested variable assignment.  Multiple assignments can be specified by  separat-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;separating</font>
                             ing  each of them with a <b>;</b>.  The previous value is unset before the assignment.

       In addition, a <b>+=</b> can be used in place of the <b>=</b> to signify adding to or  appending  to  the  previous
       value.   When  <b>+=</b> is applied to an arithmetic type, <u>word</u> is evaluated as an arithmetic expression and
       added to the current value.  When applied to a string variable, the value defined by <u>word</u> is appended
       to  the  value.   For  compound  assignments,  the previous value is not unset and the new values are
       appended to the current ones provided that the types are compatible.

   <b>Comments.</b>
       A word beginning with <b>#</b> causes that word and all the following characters up  to  a  new-line  to  be
       ignored.
   <b>Aliasing.</b>
       The first word of each command is replaced by the text of an <b>alias</b> if an <b>alias</b> for this word has been
       defined.  An <b>alias</b> name consists of any number of characters excluding metacharacters, quoting  char-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">acters,&nbsp;characters,</font>
       acters,  file  expansion  characters, parameter expansion and command substitution characters, and <b>=</b>.
       The replacement string can contain any valid shell script including the metacharacters listed  above.
       The  first word of each command in the replaced text, other than any that are in the process of being
       replaced, will be tested for aliases.  If the last character of the alias value is a <u>blank</u>  then  the
       word  following  the alias will also be checked for alias substitution.  Aliases can be used to rede-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fine&nbsp;redefine</font>
       fine built-in commands but cannot be used to redefine the reserved words listed above.   Aliases  can
       be created and listed with the <b>alias</b> command and can be removed with the <b>unalias</b> command.
       <u>Aliasing</u> is performed when scripts are read, not while they are executed.  Therefore, for an alias to
       take effect, the <b>alias</b> definition command has to be executed before the command which references  the
       alias is read.
       The following aliases are compiled into the shell but can be unset or redefined:
                           <b>autoload='typeset</b> <b>-fu'</b>
                           <b>command='command</b>  <b>'</b>
                           <b>fc=hist</b>
                           <b>float='typeset</b> <b>-lE'</b>
                           <b>functions='typeset</b> <b>-f'</b>
                           <b>hash='alias</b> <b>-t</b> <b>--'</b>
                           <b>history='hist</b> <b>-l'</b>
                           <b>integer='typeset</b> <b>-li'</b>
                           <b>nameref='typeset</b> <b>-n'</b>
                           <b>nohup='nohup</b>  <b>'</b>
                           <b>r='hist</b> <b>-s'</b>
                           <b>redirect='command</b> <b>exec'</b>
                           <b>source='command</b> <b>.'</b>
                           <b>stop='kill</b> <b>-s</b> <b>STOP'</b>
                           <b>suspend='kill</b> <b>-s</b> <b>STOP</b> <b>$$'</b>
                           <b>times='{</b> <b>{</b> <b>time;}</b> <b>2&gt;&amp;1;}'</b>
                           <b>type='whence</b> <b>-v'</b>

   <b>Tilde</b> <b>Substitution.</b>
       After  alias  substitution is performed, each word is checked to see if it begins with an unquoted <b>~</b>.
       For tilde substitution, <u>word</u> also refers to the <u>word</u> portion of parameter  expansion  (see  <u>Parameter</u>
       <u>Expansion</u> below).  If it does, then the word up to a <b>/</b> is checked to see if it matches a user name in
       the password database (See <!-- a --><u>getpwname</u>(3)<!-- /a -->.)  If a match is found, the <b>~</b> and the matched login name  are
       replaced by the login directory of the matched user.  If no match is found, the original text is left
       unchanged.  A <b>~</b> by itself, or in front of a <b>/</b>, is replaced by <b>$HOME</b>.  A <b>~</b> followed by a  <b>+</b>  or  <b>-</b>  is
       replaced by the value of <b>$PWD</b> and <b>$OLDPWD</b> respectively.

       In  addition, when expanding a <u>variable</u> <u>assignment</u>, <u>tilde</u> substitution is attempted when the value of
       the assignment begins with a <b>~</b>, and when a <b>~</b> appears after a <b>:</b>.  The <b>:</b>  also  terminates  a  <b>~</b>  login
       name.

   <b>Command</b> <b>Substitution.</b>
       The  standard  output  from  a command enclosed in parentheses preceded by a dollar sign ( <b>$()</b> ) or a
       pair of grave accents (<b>``</b>) may be used as part or all of a word; trailing new-lines are removed.   In
       the second (obsolete) form, the string between the quotes is processed for special quoting characters
       before the command is executed (see <u>Quoting</u> below).  The command  substitution  <b>$(cat</b>  <b>file)</b>  can  be
       replaced  by  the equivalent but faster <b>$(&lt;file)</b>.  The command substitution <b>$(</b><u>n</u><b>&lt;#)</b> will expand to the
       current byte offset for file descriptor <u>n</u>.

   <b>Arithmetic</b> <b>Substitution.</b>
       An arithmetic expression enclosed in double parentheses preceded by  a  dollar  sign  (  <b>$(())</b>  )  is
       replaced by the value of the arithmetic expression within the double parentheses.

   <b>Process</b> <b>Substitution.</b>
       This  feature  is  only  available  on versions of the UNIX operating system that support the <b>/dev/fd</b>
       directory for naming open files.  Each command argument of the  form  <b>&lt;(</b><u>list</u><b>)</b>  or  <b>&gt;(</b><u>list</u><b>)</b>  will  run
       process <u>list</u> asynchronously connected to some file in <b>/dev/fd</b>.  The name of this file will become the
       argument to the command.  If the form with <b>&gt;</b> is selected then writing on this file will provide input
       for  <u>list</u>.   If  <b>&lt;</b>  is  used, then the file passed as an argument will contain the output of the <u>list</u>
       process.  For example,

              <b>paste</b> <b>&lt;(cut</b> <b>-f1</b> <u>file1</u><b>)</b> <b>&lt;(cut</b> <b>-f3</b> <u>file2</u><b>)</b> <b>|</b> <b>tee</b> <b>&gt;(</b><u>process1</u><b>)</b> <b>&gt;(</b><u>process2</u><b>)</b>

       <u>cuts</u> fields 1 and 3 from the files <u>file1</u> and <u>file2</u> respectively, <u>pastes</u>  the  results  together,  and
       sends  it  to  the  processes  <u>process1</u> and <u>process2</u>, as well as putting it onto the standard output.
       Note that the file, which is passed as an argument to the command, is a UNIX <a href="../man2/pipe.2.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/2/pipe"><u>pipe</u>(2)</a> so programs that
       expect to <a href="../man2/lseek.2.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/2/lseek"><u>lseek</u>(2)</a> on the file will not work.

   <b>Parameter</b> <b>Expansion.</b>
       A  <u>parameter</u>  is a <u>variable</u>, one or more digits, or any of the characters <b>*</b>, <b>@</b>, <b>#</b>, <b>?</b>, <b>-</b>, <b>$</b>, and <b>!</b>.  A
       <u>variable</u> is denoted by a <u>vname</u>.  To create a variable whose <u>vname</u> contains  a  <b>.</b>,  a  variable  whose
       <u>vname</u>  consists  of everything before the last <b>.</b> must already exist.  A <u>variable</u> has a <u>value</u> and zero
       or more <u>attributes</u>.  <u>Variables</u> can be assigned <u>values</u> and <u>attributes</u> by  using  the  <b>typeset</b>  special
       built-in command.  The attributes supported by the shell are described later with the <b>typeset</b> special
       built-in command.  Exported variables pass values and attributes to the environment.

       The shell supports both indexed and associative arrays.  An element of an array  variable  is  refer-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">enced&nbsp;referenced</font>
       enced  by  a <u>subscript</u>.  A <u>subscript</u> for an indexed array is denoted by an <u>arithmetic</u> <u>expression</u> (see
       <u>Arithmetic</u> <u>evaluation</u> below) between a <b>[</b> and a <b>]</b>.  To assign values to an indexed array, use  <b>set</b>  <b>-A</b>
       <u>vname</u>  <u>value</u> ... .  The value of all subscripts must be in the range of 0 through 1,048,575.  Indexed
       arrays need not be declared.  Any reference to a variable with a valid  subscript  is  legal  and  an
       array will be created if necessary.

       An  associative array is created with the <b>-A</b> option to <b>typeset.</b>  A <u>subscript</u> for an associative array
       is denoted by a string enclosed between <b>[</b> and <b>]</b>.

       Referencing any array without a subscript is equivalent to referencing the array with subscript 0.

       The <u>value</u> of a <u>variable</u> may be assigned by writing:

              <u>vname</u><b>=</b><u>value</u> [ <u>vname</u><b>=</b><u>value</u> ] ...

       or
              <u>vname</u><b>[</b><u>subscript</u><b>]=</b><u>value</u> [ <u>vname</u><b>[</b><u>subscript</u><b>]=</b><u>value</u> ] ...
       Note that no space is allowed before or after the <b>=</b>.
       A <u>nameref</u> is a variable that is a reference to another variable.  A nameref is created  with  the  <b>-n</b>
       attribute of <b>typeset</b>.  The value of the variable at the time of the <b>typeset</b> command becomes the vari-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able&nbsp;variable</font>
       able that will be referenced whenever the nameref variable is used.  The name  of  a  nameref  cannot
       contain  a  <b>.</b>.   When a variable or function name contains a <b>.</b>, and the portion of the name up to the
       first <b>.</b> matches the name of a nameref, the variable referred to is obtained by replacing the  nameref
       portion  with  the name of the variable referenced by the nameref.  If a nameref is used as the index
       of a <b>for</b> loop, a name reference is established for each item in the list.  A nameref provides a  con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">venient&nbsp;convenient</font>
       venient way to refer to the variable inside a function whose name is passed as an argument to a func-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion.&nbsp;function.</font>
       tion.  For example, if the name of a variable is passed as the first argument to a function, the com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
       mand
              <b>typeset</b> <b>-n</b> <b>var=$1</b>
       inside  the function causes references and assignments to <b>var</b> to be references and assignments to the
       variable whose name has been passed to the function.
       If either of the floating point attributes, <b>-E</b>, or <b>-F</b>, or the  integer  attribute,  <b>-i</b>,  is  set  for
       <u>vname</u>, then the <u>value</u> is subject to arithmetic evaluation as described below.
       Positional  parameters,  parameters  denoted by a number, may be assigned values with the <b>set</b> special
       built-in command.  Parameter <b>$0</b> is set from argument zero when the shell is invoked.
       The character <b>$</b> is used to introduce substitutable <u>parameters</u>.
       <b>${</b><u>parameter</u><b>}</b>
              The shell reads all the characters from <b>${</b> to the matching <b>}</b> as part of the same word even  if
              it  contains  braces  or  metacharacters.  The value, if any, of the parameter is substituted.
              The braces are required when <u>parameter</u> is followed by a letter, digit, or underscore  that  is
              not  to  be  interpreted as part of its name, when the variable name contains a <b>.</b>.  The braces
              are also required when a variable is subscripted unless it is part of an Arithmetic Expression
              or  a  Conditional  Expression.   If  <u>parameter</u>  is one or more digits then it is a positional
              parameter.  A positional parameter of more than one digit must  be  enclosed  in  braces.   If
              <u>parameter</u>  is  <b>*</b>  or  <b>@</b>, then all the positional parameters, starting with <b>$1</b>, are substituted
              (separated by a field separator character).  If an array <u>vname</u> with subscript <b>*</b> or <b>@</b> is  used,
              then  the  value  for each of the elements is substituted, separated by the first character of
              the value of <b>IFS</b>.
       <b>${#</b><u>parameter</u><b>}</b>
              If <u>parameter</u> is <b>*</b> or <b>@</b>, the number of positional parameters is  substituted.   Otherwise,  the
              length of the value of the <u>parameter</u> is substituted.
       <b>${#</b><u>vname</u><b>[*]}</b>
       <b>${#</b><u>vname</u><b>[@]}</b>
              The number of elements in the array <u>vname</u> is substituted.

       <b>${!</b><u>vname</u><b>}</b>
              Expands  to  the  name  of  the variable referred to by <u>vname</u>.  This will be <u>vname</u> except when
              <u>vname</u> is a name reference.

       <b>${!</b><u>vname</u><b>[</b><u>subscript</u><b>]}</b>
              Expands to name of the subscript unless <u>subscript</u> is <b>*</b> or <b>@</b>.  When <u>subscript</u> is <b>*</b>, the list of
              array  subscripts for <u>vname</u> is generated.  For a variable that is not an array, the value is 0
              if the variable is set.  Otherwise it is null.  When <u>subscript</u> is <b>@</b>,  same  as  above,  except
              that when used in double quotes, each array subscript yields a separate argument.

       <b>${!</b><u>prefix</u><b>*}</b>
              Expands to the names of the variables whose names begin with <u>prefix</u>.

       <b>${</b><u>parameter</u><b>:-</b><u>word</u><b>}</b>
              If <u>parameter</u> is set and is non-null then substitute its value; otherwise substitute <u>word</u>.

       <b>${</b><u>parameter</u><b>:=</b><u>word</u><b>}</b>
              If  <u>parameter</u>  is  not  set or is null then set it to <u>word</u>; the value of the parameter is then
              substituted.  Positional parameters may not be assigned to in this way.

       <b>${</b><u>parameter</u><b>:?</b><u>word</u><b>}</b>
              If <u>parameter</u> is set and is non-null then substitute its value; otherwise, print <u>word</u> and  exit
              from the shell (if not interactive).  If <u>word</u> is omitted then a standard message is printed.

       <b>${</b><u>parameter</u><b>:+</b><u>word</u><b>}</b>
              If <u>parameter</u> is set and is non-null then substitute <u>word</u>; otherwise substitute nothing.

       In  the  above,  <u>word</u> is not evaluated unless it is to be used as the substituted string, so that, in
       the following example, <b>pwd</b> is executed only if <b>d</b> is not set or is null:

              print ${d:-$(pwd)}

       If the colon ( <b>:</b> <b>)</b> is omitted from the above expressions, then the shell only checks whether  <u>parame</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ter&nbsp;parameter</font>
       <u>ter</u> is set or not.

       <b>${</b><u>parameter</u><b>:</b><u>offset</u><b>:</b><u>length</u><b>}</b>
       <b>${</b><u>parameter</u><b>:</b><u>offset</u><b>}</b>
              Expands  to  the portion of the value of <u>parameter</u> starting at the character (counting from <b>0</b>)
              determined by expanding <u>offset</u> as an arithmetic expression and consisting  of  the  number  of
              characters determined by the arithmetic expression defined by <u>length.</u>  In the second form, the
              remainder of the value is used.  If A negative <u>offset</u> counts backwards from the end of <u>parame</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ter.&nbsp;parameter.</font>
              <u>ter</u>.   Note  that one or more <u>blank</u>s is required in front of a minus sign to prevent the shell
              from interpreting the operator as <b>:-</b>.  If <u>parameter</u> is <b>*</b> or <b>@</b>, or is an array name indexed  by
              <b>*</b>  or  <b>@</b>, then <u>offset</u> and <u>length</u> refer to the array index and number of elements respectively.
              A negative <u>offset</u> is taken relative to one greater than  the  highest  subscript  for  indexed
              arrays.  The order for associate arrays is unspecified.
       <b>${</b><u>parameter</u><b>#</b><u>pattern</u><b>}</b>
       <b>${</b><u>parameter</u><b>##</b><u>pattern</u><b>}</b>
              If  the  shell <u>pattern</u> matches the beginning of the value of <u>parameter</u>, then the value of this
              expansion is the value of the <u>parameter</u> with the matched portion deleted; otherwise the  value
              of  this <u>parameter</u> is substituted.  In the first form the smallest matching pattern is deleted
              and in the second form the largest matching pattern is deleted.  When <u>parameter</u> is <b>@</b>, <b>*</b>, or an
              array  variable  with  subscript <b>@</b> or <b>*</b>, the substring operation is applied to each element in
              turn.

       <b>${</b><u>parameter</u><b>%</b><u>pattern</u><b>}</b>
       <b>${</b><u>parameter</u><b>%%</b><u>pattern</u><b>}</b>
              If the shell <u>pattern</u> matches the end of the value of <u>parameter</u>, then the value of this  expan-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion&nbsp;expansion</font>
              sion  is  the  value  of the <u>parameter</u> with the matched part deleted; otherwise substitute the
              value of <u>parameter</u>.  In the first form the smallest matching pattern is  deleted  and  in  the
              second  form  the  largest  matching  pattern is deleted.  When <u>parameter</u> is <b>@</b>, <b>*</b>, or an array
              variable with subscript <b>@</b> or <b>*</b>, the substring operation is applied to each element in turn.

       <b>${</b><u>parameter</u><b>/</b><u>pattern</u><b>/</b><u>string</u><b>}</b>
       <b>${</b><u>parameter</u><b>//</b><u>pattern</u><b>/</b><u>string</u><b>}</b>
       <b>${</b><u>parameter</u><b>/#</b><u>pattern</u><b>/</b><u>string</u><b>}</b>
       <b>${</b><u>parameter</u><b>/%</b><u>pattern</u><b>/</b><u>string</u><b>}</b>
              Expands <u>parameter</u> and replaces the longest match of  <u>pattern</u>  with  the  given  <u>string.</u>   Each
              occurrence  of <b>\</b><u>n</u> in <u>string</u> is replaced by the portion of <u>parameter</u> that matches the <u>n</u>-th sub-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pattern.&nbsp;subpattern.</font>
              pattern.  In the first form, only the first occurrence of <u>pattern</u> is replaced.  In the  second
              form,  each  match  for <u>pattern</u> is replaced by the given <u>string.</u>  The third form restricts the
              pattern match to the beginning of the string while the fourth form restricts the pattern match
              to the end of the string.  When <u>string</u> is null, the <u>pattern</u> will be deleted and the <b>/</b> in front
              of <u>string</u> may be omitted.  When <u>parameter</u> is <b>@</b>, <b>*</b>, or an array variable with subscript <b>@</b> or <b>*</b>,
              the  substitution operation is applied to each element in turn.  In this case, the <u>string</u> por-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;portion</font>
              tion of <u>word</u> will be re-evaluated for each element.

       The following parameters are automatically set by the shell:
              <b>#</b>      The number of positional parameters in decimal.
              <b>-</b>      Options supplied to the shell on invocation or by the <b>set</b> command.
              <b>?</b>      The decimal value returned by the last executed command.
              <b>$</b>      The process number of this shell.
              <b>_</b>      Initially, the value of <b>_</b> is an absolute pathname of the shell or script being executed
                     as  passed  in  the  <u>environment</u>.  Subsequently it is assigned the last argument of the
                     previous command.  This parameter is not set for commands which are asynchronous.  This
                     parameter  is  also  used  to hold the name of the matching <b>MAIL</b> file when checking for
                     mail.
              <b>!</b>      The process number of the last background command invoked or the most recent job put in
                     the background with the <b>bg</b> built-in command.
              <b>.sh.command</b>
                     When  processing  a <b>DEBUG</b> trap, this variable contains the current command line that is
                     about to run.
              <b>.sh.edchar</b>
                     This variable contains the value of the keyboard character (or sequence  of  characters
                     if  the  first  character is an ESC, ascii <b>033</b>) that has been entered when processing a
                     <b>KEYBD</b> trap (see <u>Key</u> <u>Bindings</u> below).  If the value is  changed  as  part  of  the  trap
                     action, then the new value replaces the key (or key sequence) that caused the trap.
              <b>.sh.edcol</b>
                     The character position of the cursor at the time of the most recent <b>KEYBD</b> trap.
              <b>.sh.edmode</b>
                     The  value is set to ESC when processing a <b>KEYBD</b> trap while in <b>vi</b> insert mode.  (See <u>Vi</u>
                     <u>Editing</u> <u>Mode</u>  below.)  Otherwise, <b>.sh.edmode</b> is null when processing a <b>KEYBD</b> trap.
              <b>.sh.edtext</b>
                     The characters in the input buffer at the time of the  most  recent  <b>KEYBD</b>  trap.   The
                     value is null when not processing a <b>KEYBD</b> trap.
              <b>.sh.file</b>
                     The pathname of the file than contains the current command.
              <b>.sh.fun</b>
                     The name of the current function that is being executed.
              <b>.sh.match</b>
                     An  indexed array which stores the most recent match and sub-pattern matches after con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ditional&nbsp;conditional</font>
                     ditional pattern matches that match and after variables expansions using the  operators
                     <b>#</b>,  <b>%</b>,  or <b>/</b>.  The <b>0</b>-th element stores the complete match and the <u>i</u>-th.  element stores
                     the <u>i</u>-th submatch.  The <b>.sh.match</b> variable becomes unset when  the  variable  that  has
                     expanded is assigned a new value.
              <b>.sh.name</b>
                     Set to the name of the variable at the time that a discipline function is invoked.
              <b>.sh.subscript</b>
                     Set  to  the  name  subscript of the variable at the time that a discipline function is
                     invoked.
              <b>.sh.subshell</b>
                     The current depth for subshells and command substitution.
              <b>.sh.value</b>
                     Set to the value of the variable at the time that the <b>set</b> or <b>append</b> discipline function
                     is invoked.
              <b>.sh.version</b>
                     Set to a value that identifies the version of this shell.
              <b>LINENO</b> The current line number within the script or function being executed.
              <b>OLDPWD</b> The previous working directory set by the <b>cd</b> command.
              <b>OPTARG</b> The value of the last option argument processed by the <b>getopts</b> built-in command.
              <b>OPTIND</b> The index of the last option argument processed by the <b>getopts</b> built-in command.
              <b>PPID</b>   The process number of the parent of the shell.
              <b>PWD</b>    The present working directory set by the <b>cd</b> command.
              <b>RANDOM</b> Each  time this variable is referenced, a random integer, uniformly distributed between
                     0 and 32767, is generated.  The sequence  of  random  numbers  can  be  initialized  by
                     assigning a numeric value to <b>RANDOM</b>.
              <b>REPLY</b>  This  variable  is set by the <b>select</b> statement and by the <b>read</b> built-in command when no
                     arguments are supplied.
              <b>SECONDS</b>
                     Each time this variable is referenced, the number of seconds since shell invocation  is
                     returned.  If this variable is assigned a value, then the value returned upon reference
                     will be the value that was assigned plus the number of seconds since the assignment.

       The following variables are used by the shell:
              <b>CDPATH</b> The search path for the <b>cd</b> command.
              <b>COLUMNS</b>
                     If this variable is set, the value is used to define the width of the edit  window  for
                     the shell edit modes and for printing <b>select</b> lists.
              <b>EDITOR</b> If  the  <b>VISUAL</b> variable is not set, the value of this variable will be checked for the
                     patterns as described with <b>VISUAL</b> below and the corresponding editing option (see  Spe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cial&nbsp;Special</font>
                     cial Command <b>set</b> below) will be turned on.
              <b>ENV</b>    If this variable is set, then parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic
                     substitution are performed on the value to generate the pathname  of  the  script  that
                     will  be executed when the shell is invoked (see <u>Invocation</u> below).  This file is typi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cally&nbsp;typically</font>
                     cally used for <b>alias</b> and <b>function</b> definitions.  The default value is <b>$HOME/.kshrc</b>.
              <b>FCEDIT</b> Obsolete name for the default editor name for the <b>hist</b> command.   <b>FCEDIT</b>  is  not  used
                     when <b>HISTEDIT</b> is set.
              <b>FIGNORE</b>
                     A  pattern that defines the set of filenames that will be ignored when performing file-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">name&nbsp;filename</font>
                     name matching.
              <b>FPATH</b>  The search path for function definitions.  The directories in this  path  are  searched
                     for  a  file  with the same name as the function or command when a function with the <b>-u</b>
                     attribute is referenced and when a command is not found.  If an  executable  file  with
                     the name of that command is found, then it is read and executed in the current environ-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment.&nbsp;environment.</font>
                     ment.  Unlike <b>PATH</b>, the current directory must be represented explictily by  <b>.</b>   rather
                     than by adjacent <b>:</b> characters or a beginning or ending <b>:</b>.
              <b>HISTCMD</b>
                     Number of the current command in the history file.
              <b>HISTEDIT</b>
                     Name for the default editor name for the <b>hist</b> command.
              <b>HISTFILE</b>
                     If  this  variable  is set when the shell is invoked, then the value is the pathname of
                     the file that will be used to store the command history (see <u>Command</u> <u>Re-entry</u> below).
              <b>HISTSIZE</b>
                     If this variable is set when the shell  is  invoked,  then  the  number  of  previously
                     entered  commands  that  are  accessible by this shell will be greater than or equal to
                     this number.  The default is 512.
              <b>HOME</b>   The default argument (home directory) for the <b>cd</b> command.
              <b>IFS</b>    Internal field separators, normally <b>space</b>, <b>tab</b>, and <b>new-line</b> that are used to  separate
                     the  results of command substitution or parameter expansion and to separate fields with
                     the built-in command <b>read</b>.  The first character of the <b>IFS</b> variable is used to separate
                     arguments  for the <b>"$*"</b> substitution (see <u>Quoting</u> below).  Each single occurrence of an
                     <b>IFS</b> character in the string to be split, that is not in the  <u>isspace</u>  character  class,
                     and  any  adjacent characters in <b>IFS</b> that are in the <u>isspace</u> character class, delimit a
                     field.  One or more characters in <b>IFS</b> that  belong  to  the  <u>isspace</u>  character  class,
                     delimit  a  field.   In  addition,  if the same <u>isspace</u> character appears consecutively
                     inside <b>IFS</b>, this character is treated as if it were not in the <u>isspace</u> class,  so  that
                     if  <b>IFS</b> consists of two <b>tab</b> characters, then two adjacent <b>tab</b> characters delimit a null
                     field.
              <b>LANG</b>   This variable determines the locale category for any category not specifically selected
                     with a variable starting with <b>LC_</b> or <b>LANG</b>.
              <b>LC_ALL</b> This variable overrides the value of the <b>LANG</b> variable and any other <b>LC_</b> variable.
              <b>LC_COLLATE</b>
                     This variable determines the locale category for character collation information.
              <b>LC_CTYPE</b>
                     This  variable  determines  the  locale  category for character handling functions.  It
                     determines the character classes for pattern matching (see <u>File</u> <u>Name</u> <u>Generation</u> below).
              <b>LC_NUMERIC</b>
                     This variable determines the locale category for the decimal point character.
              <b>LINES</b>  If  this variable is set, the value is used to determine the column length for printing
                     <b>select</b> lists.  Select lists will print vertically until about two-thirds of <b>LINES</b> lines
                     are filled.
              <b>MAIL</b>   If  this  variable  is  set to the name of a mail file <u>and</u> the <b>MAILPATH</b> variable is not
                     set, then the shell informs the user of arrival of mail in the specified file.
              <b>MAILCHECK</b>
                     This variable specifies how often (in seconds) the shell will check for changes in  the
                     modification time of any of the files specified by the <b>MAILPATH</b> or <b>MAIL</b> variables.  The
                     default value is 600 seconds.  When the time has elapsed the shell  will  check  before
                     issuing the next prompt.
              <b>MAILPATH</b>
                     A  colon  (  <b>:</b> ) separated list of file names.  If this variable is set, then the shell
                     informs the user of any modifications to the specified files that have occurred  within
                     the  last <b>MAILCHECK</b> seconds.  Each file name can be followed by a <b>?</b>  and a message that
                     will be printed.  The message will undergo parameter expansion,  command  substitution,
                     and  arithmetic  substitution with the variable <b>$_</b> defined as the name of the file that
                     has changed.  The default message is <u>you</u> <u>have</u> <u>mail</u> <u>in</u> <u>$</u><b>_</b><u>.</u>
              <b>PATH</b>   The search path for commands (see <u>Execution</u> below).  The user may not  change  <b>PATH</b>  if
                     executing under <b>rksh</b> (except in <b>.profile).</b>
              <b>PS1</b>    The  value  of this variable is expanded for parameter expansion, command substitution,
                     and arithmetic substitution to define the primary prompt string  which  by  default  is
                     ``<b>$</b>''.  The character <b>!</b>  in the primary prompt string is replaced by the <u>command</u> number
                     (see <u>Command</u> <u>Re-entry</u> below).  Two successive occurrences of <b>!</b>  will produce a single <b>!</b>
                     when the prompt string is printed.
              <b>PS2</b>    Secondary prompt string, by default ``<b>&gt;</b> ''.
              <b>PS3</b>    Selection prompt string used within a <b>select</b> loop, by default ``<b>#?</b> ''.
              <b>PS4</b>    The  value of this variable is expanded for parameter evaluation, command substitution,
                     and arithmetic substitution and precedes each line of an execution trace.  By  default,
                     <b>PS4</b>  is  ``<b>+</b> ''.  In addition when <b>PS4</b> is unset, the execution trace prompt is also ``<b>+</b>
                     ''.
              <b>SHELL</b>  The pathname of the <u>shell</u> is kept in the environment.  At invocation, if  the  basename
                     of  this  variable  is <b>rsh</b>, <b>rksh</b>, or <b>krsh</b>, then the shell becomes restricted.  If it is
                     <b>pfsh</b> or <b>pfksh</b>, then the shell becomes a profile shell (see <!-- a --><u>pfexec</u>(1)<!-- /a -->).
              <b>TIMEFORMAT</b>
                     The value of this parameter is used as a format string specifying how the timing infor-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mation&nbsp;information</font>
                     mation  for  pipelines prefixed with the <b>time</b> reserved word should be displayed.  The <b>%</b>
                     character introduces a format sequence that is expanded to a time value or other infor-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mation.&nbsp;information.</font>
                     mation.  The format sequences and their meanings are as follows.
                     <b>%%</b>        A literal <b>%</b>.
                     <b>%[</b><u>p</u><b>][l]R</b>  The elapsed time in seconds.
                     <b>%[</b><u>p</u><b>][l]U</b>  The number of CPU seconds spent in user mode.
                     <b>%[</b><u>p</u><b>][l]S</b>  The number of CPU seconds spent in system mode.
                     <b>%P</b>        The CPU percentage, computed as (U + S) / R.

                     The  braces  denote optional portions.  The optional <u>p</u> is a digit specifying the <u>preci</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion,&nbsp;precision,</font>
                     <u>sion</u>, the number of fractional digits after a decimal point.  A value of  0  causes  no
                     decimal  point  or fraction to be output.  At most three places after the decimal point
                     can be displayed; values of <u>p</u> greater than 3 are treated as 3.  If <u>p</u> is not  specified,
                     the value 3 is used.

                     The  optional  <b>l</b>  specifies a longer format, including hours if greater than zero, min-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">utes,&nbsp;minutes,</font>
                     utes, and seconds of the form <u>HH</u>h<u>MM</u>m<u>SS</u>.<u>FF</u>s.  The value of <u>p</u> determines whether  or  not
                     the fraction is included.

                     All  other  characters  are  output without change and a trailing newline is added.  If
                     unset, the default value, <b>$'\nreal\t%2lR\nuser\t%2lU\nsys%2lS'</b>, is used.  If the  value
                     is null, no timing information is displayed.

              <b>TMOUT</b>  If  set  to  a value greater than zero, <b>TMOUT</b> will be the default timeout value for the
                     <b>read</b> built-in command.  The <b>select</b> compound command terminates after <b>TMOUT</b> seconds when
                     input is from a terminal.  Otherwise, the shell will terminate if a line is not entered
                     within the prescribed number of seconds while reading from a terminal.  (Note that  the
                     shell can be compiled with a maximum bound for this value which cannot be exceeded.)

              <b>VISUAL</b> If  the  value of this variable matches the pattern <u>*[Vv][Ii]*</u>, then the <b>vi</b> option (see
                     Special Command <b>set</b> below) is turned on.  If the value matches the  pattern  <u>*gmacs*</u>  <u>,</u>
                     the <b>gmacs</b> option is turned on.  If the value matches the pattern <u>*macs*</u>, then the <b>emacs</b>
                     option will be turned on.  The value of <b>VISUAL</b> overrides the value of <b>EDITOR.</b>

       The shell gives default values to <b>PATH</b>, <b>PS1</b>, <b>PS2</b>, <b>PS3</b>, <b>PS4</b>, <b>MAILCHECK</b>, <b>FCEDIT</b>, <b>TMOUT</b> and  <b>IFS</b>,  while
       <b>HOME</b>,  <b>SHELL</b>,  <b>ENV</b>,  and <b>MAIL</b> are not set at all by the shell (although <b>HOME</b> <u>is</u> set by <a href="login.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/login"><u>login</u>(1)</a>).  On
       some systems <b>MAIL</b> and <b>SHELL</b> are also set by <a href="login.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/login"><u>login</u>(1)</a>.

   <b>Field</b> <b>Splitting.</b>
       After parameter expansion and command substitution, the results of substitutions are scanned for  the
       field  separator characters (those found in <b>IFS</b>) and split into distinct fields where such characters
       are found.  Explicit null fields (<b>""</b> or <b>''</b>) are retained.  Implicit null fields (those resulting from
       <u>parameters</u> that have no values or command substitutions with no output) are removed.

       If  the  <b>braceexpand</b> (<b>-B</b>) option is set then each of the fields resulting from <b>IFS</b> are checked to see
       if they contain one or more of the brace patterns <b>{*,*}</b>,  <b>{</b><u>l1</u><b>..</b><u>l2</u><b>}</b>  ,  <b>{</b><u>n1</u><b>..</b><u>n2</u><b>}</b>  ,  <b>{</b><u>n1</u><b>..</b><u>n2</u><b>%</b>  <u>fmt</u><b>}</b>  ,
       <b>{</b><u>n1</u><b>..</b><u>n2</u>  <b>..</b><u>n3</u><b>}</b>  ,  or  <b>{</b><u>n1</u><b>..</b><u>n2</u>  <b>..</b><u>n3</u><b>%</b><u>fmt</u><b>}</b>  ,  where <b>*</b> represents any character, <u>l1</u>,<u>l2</u> are letters and
       <u>n1</u>,<u>n2</u>,<u>n3</u> are signed numbers and <u>fmt</u> is a format specified as used by <b>printf</b>.  In  each  case,  fields
       are  created  by  prepending  the characters before the <b>{</b> and appending the characters after the <b>}</b> to
       each of the strings generated by the characters between the  <b>{</b>  and  <b>}</b>.   The  resulting  fields  are
       checked to see if they have any brace patterns.

       In the first form, a field is created for each string between <b>{</b> and <b>,</b>, between <b>,</b> and <b>,</b>, and between <b>,</b>
       and <b>}</b>.  The string represented by <b>*</b> can contain embedded matching <b>{</b> and <b>}</b>  without  quoting.   Other-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">wise,&nbsp;Otherwise,</font>
       wise, each <b>{</b> and <b>}</b> with <b>*</b> must be quoted.

       In the seconds form, <u>l1</u> and <u>l2</u> must both be either upper case or both be lower case characters in the
       C locale.  In this case a field is created for each character from <u>l1</u> thru <u>l2</u>.

       In the remaining forms, a field is created for each number starting at <u>n1</u>  and  continuing  until  it
       reaches  <u>n2</u>  incrementing  <u>n1</u>  by <u>n3</u>.  The cases where <u>n3</u> is not specified behave as if <u>n3</u> where <b>1</b> if
       <u>n1</u><b>&lt;=</b><u>n2</u> and <b>-1</b> otherwise.  If forms which specify <b>%</b><u>fmt</u> any format flags, widths and precisions can  be
       specified  and  <u>fmt</u> can end in any of the specifiers <b>cdiouxX</b>.  For example, <b>{a,z}{1..5..3%02d}{b..c}x</b>
       expands to the 8 fields, <b>a01bx</b>, <b>a01cx</b>, <b>a04bx</b>, <b>a04cx</b>, <b>z01bx</b>, <b>z01cx</b>, <b>z04bx</b> and <b>z4cx</b>.

   <b>File</b> <b>Name</b> <b>Generation.</b>
       Following splitting, each field is scanned for the characters <b>*</b>, <b>?</b>, <b>(</b>, and <b>[</b> unless the <b>-f</b> option has
       been  set.   If  one  of these characters appears, then the word is regarded as a <u>pattern</u>.  Each file
       name component that contains any pattern character is replaced with a lexicographically sorted set of
       names  that  matches the pattern from that directory.  If no file name is found that matches the pat-
       tern, then that component of the filename is left unchanged unless the pattern is prefixed with  <b>~(N)</b>
       in  which  case  it  is removed as described below.  If <b>FIGNORE</b> is set, then each file name component
       that matches the pattern defined by the value of <b>FIGNORE</b> is  ignored  when  generating  the  matching
       filenames.   The  names  <b>.</b>  and <b>..</b>  are also ignored.  If <b>FIGNORE</b> is not set, the character <b>.</b>  at the
       start of each file name component will be ignored unless the first character of  the  pattern  corre-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sponding&nbsp;corresponding</font>
       sponding to this component is the character <b>.</b>  itself.  Note, that for other uses of pattern matching
       the <b>/</b> and <b>.</b>  are not treated specially.

              <b>*</b>      Matches any string, including the null string.  When used for  filename  expansion,  if
                     the  <b>globstar</b> option is on, two adjacent <b>*</b>'s by itself will match all files and zero or
                     more directories and subdirectories.  If followed by a <b>/</b> than only directories and sub-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">directories&nbsp;subdirectories</font>
                     directories will match.
              <b>?</b>      Matches any single character.
              <b>[</b>...<b>]</b>  Matches  any  one  of  the  enclosed  characters.   A pair of characters separated by <b></b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">matches&nbsp;bymatches</font>
                     matches any character lexically between the pair, inclusive.  If  the  first  character
                     following the opening <b>[</b> is a <b>!</b>  then any character not enclosed is matched.  A <b>-</b> can be
                     included in the character set by putting it as the first or last character.
                     Within <b>[</b> and <b>]</b>, character classes can be specified  with  the  syntax  <b>[:</b><u>class</u><b>:]</b>  where
                     class  is  one of the following classes defined in the ANSI-C standard: (Note that <b>word</b>
                     is equivalent to <b>alnum</b> plus the character <b>_</b>).
              <b>alnum</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>blank</b> <b>cntrl</b> <b>digit</b> <b>graph</b> <b>lower</b> <b>print</b> <b>punct</b> <b>space</b> <b>upper</b> <b>word</b> <b>xdigit</b>
              Within <b>[</b> and <b>]</b>, an equivalence class can be specified with the syntax <b>[=</b><u>c</u><b>=]</b> which matches  all
              characters  with  the  same primary collation weight (as defined by the current locale) as the
              character <u>c</u>.
              Within <b>[</b> and <b>]</b>, <b>[.</b><u>symbol</u><b>.]</b>  matches the collating symbol <u>symbol</u>.
       A <u>pattern-list</u> is a list of one or more patterns separated from each other with a <b>&amp;</b> or <b>|</b>.  A <b>&amp;</b> signi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fies&nbsp;signifies</font>
       fies  that all patterns must be matched whereas <b>|</b> requires that only one pattern be matched.  Compos-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ite&nbsp;Composite</font>
       ite patterns can be formed with one or more of the following sub-patterns:
              <b>?(</b><u>pattern-list</u><b>)</b>
                     Optionally matches any one of the given patterns.
              <b>*(</b><u>pattern-list</u><b>)</b>
                     Matches zero or more occurrences of the given patterns.
              <b>+(</b><u>pattern-list</u><b>)</b>
                     Matches one or more occurrences of the given patterns.
              <b>{</b><u>n</u><b>}</b>(<u>pattern-list</u><b>)</b>
                     Matches <u>n</u> occurrences of the given patterns.
              <b>{</b><u>m</u><b>,</b><u>n</u><b>}</b>(<u>pattern-list</u><b>)</b>
                     Matches from <u>m</u> to <u>n</u> occurrences of the given patterns.  If <u>m</u>  is  omitted,  <b>0</b>  will  be
                     used.  If <u>n</u> is omitted at least <u>m</u> occurrences will be matched.
              <b>@(</b><u>pattern-list</u><b>)</b>
                     Matches exactly one of the given patterns.
              <b>!(</b><u>pattern-list</u><b>)</b>
                     Matches anything except one of the given patterns.
       By  default, each pattern, or sub-pattern will match the longest string possible consistent with gen-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">erating&nbsp;generating</font>
       erating the longest overall match.  If more than one match is possible, the one starting  closest  to
       the  beginning  of  the string will be chosen.   However, for each of the above compound patterns a <b></b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">can&nbsp;acan</font>
       can be inserted in front of the <b>(</b> to cause the shortest match to the  specified  <u>pattern-list</u>  to  be
       used.

       When  <u>pattern-list</u>  is  contained  within parenthesis, the backslash character <b>\</b> is treated specially
       even when inside a character class.   All ANSI-C character escapes are recognized and match the spec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ified&nbsp;specified</font>
       ified character.  In addition the following escape sequences are recognized:
              <b>\d</b>     Matches any character in the <b>digit</b> class.
              <b>\D</b>     Matches any character not in the <b>digit</b> class.
              <b>\s</b>     Matches any character in the <b>space</b> class.
              <b>\S</b>     Matches any character not in the <b>space</b> class.
              <b>\w</b>     Matches any character in the <b>word</b> class.
              <b>\W</b>     Matches any character not in the <b>word</b> class.

       A  pattern of the form <b>%(</b><u>pattern-pair</u>(s)<b>)</b> is a sub-pattern that can be used to match nested character
       expressions.  Each <u>pattern-pair</u> is a two character sequence which cannot contain <b>&amp;</b> or <b>|</b>.   The  first
       <u>pattern-pair</u>  specifies  the  starting and ending characters for the match.  Each subsequent <u>pattern</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pair&nbsp;patternpair</font>
       <u>pair</u> represents the beginning and ending characters of a nested group that will be skipped over  when
       counting starting and ending character matches.  The behavior is unspecified when the first character
       of a <u>pattern-pair</u> is alpha-numeric except for the following:
              <b>D</b>      Causes the ending character to terminate the search for this pattern without finding  a
                     match.
              <b>E</b>      Causes the ending character to be interpreted as an escape character.
              <b>L</b>      Causes  the ending character to be interpreted as a quote character causing all charac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ters&nbsp;characters</font>
                     ters to be ignored when looking for a match.
              <b>Q</b>      Causes the ending character to be interpreted as a quote character causing all  charac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ters&nbsp;characters</font>
                     ters other than any escape character to be ignored when looking for a match.
       Thus, <b>%({}Q"E\)</b>, matches characters starting at <b>{</b> until the matching <b>}</b> is found not counting any <b>{</b> or
       <b>}</b> that is inside a double quoted string or preceded by the escape character <b>\</b>.  Without the  <b>{}</b>  this
       pattern matches any C language string.

       Each  sub-pattern  in a composite pattern is numbered, starting at 1, by the location of the <b>(</b> within
       the pattern.  The sequence <b>\</b><u>n</u>, where <u>n</u> is a single digit and <b>\</b><u>n</u> comes after  the  <u>n</u>-th.  sub-pattern,
       matches the same string as the sub-pattern itself.

       Finally a pattern can contain sub-patterns of the form <b>~(</b><u>options</u><b>:</b><u>pattern-list</u><b>)</b>.  where either <u>options</u>
       or <b>:</b><u>pattern-list</u> can be omitted.  Unlike, the other compound patterns,  these  sub-patterns  are  not
       counted  in  the  numbered sub-patterns.  If <u>options</u> is present, it can consist of one or more of the
       following:
              <b>+</b>      Enable the following options.  This is the default.
              <b>-</b>      Disable the following options.
              <b>E</b>      The remainder of the pattern uses extended regular expression syntax like the  <a href="egrep.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/egrep"><u>egrep</u>(1)</a>
                     command.
              <b>F</b>      The remainder of the pattern uses <a href="fgrep.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/fgrep"><u>fgrep</u>(1)</a> expression syntax.
              <b>G</b>      The remainder of the pattern uses basic regular expression syntax like the <a href="grep.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/grep"><u>grep</u>(1)</a> com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand.&nbsp;command.</font>
                     mand.
              <b>K</b>      The remainder of the pattern uses shell pattern syntax.  This is the default.
              <b>N</b>      This is ignored.  However, when it is the first letter and is used with file name  gen-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">eration,&nbsp;generation,</font>
                     eration, and no matches occur, the file pattern expands to the empty string.
              <b>i</b>      Treat the match as case insensitive.
              <b>g</b>      File the longest match (greedy).  This is the default.
              <b>l</b>      Left anchor the pattern.  This is the default for <b>K</b> style patterns.
              <b>r</b>      Right anchor the pattern.  This is the default for <b>K</b> style patterns.
       If  both <u>options</u> and <b>:</b><u>pattern-list</u> are specified, then the options apply only to  <u>pattern-list</u>.  Oth-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">erwise,&nbsp;Otherwise,</font>
       erwise, these options remain in effect until they are disabled by a subsequent <b>~(</b><u>...</u><b>)</b> or at  the  end
       of the sub-pattern containing <b>~(</b><u>...</u><b>)</b>.

   <b>Quoting.</b>
       Each of the <u>metacharacters</u> listed earlier (see <u>Definitions</u> above) has a special meaning to the shell

       <b>i</b>      Treat the match as case insensitive.

       <b>g</b>      File the longest match (greedy).  This is the default.
       If  both <u>options</u> and <b>:</b><u>pattern-list</u> are specified, then the options apply only to  <u>pattern-list</u>.  Oth-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">erwise,&nbsp;Otherwise,</font>
       erwise, these options remain in effect until they are disabled by a subsequent <b>~(</b><u>...</u><b>)</b> or at  the  end
       of the sub-pattern containing <b>~(</b><u>...</u><b>)</b>.

   <b>Quoting.</b>
       Each  of the <u>metacharacters</u> listed earlier (see <u>Definitions</u> above) has a special meaning to the shell
       and causes termination of a word unless quoted.  A character may be <u>quoted</u> (i.e., made to  stand  for
       itself)  by preceding it with a <b>\</b>.  The pair <b>\new-line</b> is removed.  All characters enclosed between a
       pair of single quote marks (<b>''</b>) that is not preceded by a <b>$</b> are quoted.  A single quote cannot appear
       within the single quotes.  A single quoted string preceded by an unquoted <b>$</b> is processed as an ANSI-C
       string except for the following:
       <b>\0</b>     Causes the remainder of the string to be ignored.
       <b>\E</b>     Equivalent to the escape character (ascii <b>033</b>),
       <b>\e</b>     Equivalent to the escape character (ascii <b>033</b>),
       <b>\c</b><u>x</u>    Expands to the character control-<u>x</u>.
       <b>\C[.</b><u>name</u><b>.]</b>
              Expands to the collating element <u>name</u>.

       Inside double quote marks (<b>""</b>), parameter and command substitution occur and <b>\</b> quotes the  characters
       <b>\</b>, <b>`</b>, <b>"</b>, and <b>$</b>.  A <b>$</b> in front of a double quoted string will be ignored in the "C" or "POSIX" locale,
       and may cause the string to be replaced by a locale specific string otherwise.  The meaning of <b>$*</b> and
       <b>$@</b>  is identical when not quoted or when used as a variable assignment value or as a file name.  How-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ever,&nbsp;However,</font>
       ever, when used as a command argument, <b>"$*"</b> is equivalent to <b>"$1</b><u>d</u><b>$2</b><u>d</u>...<b>"</b>, where <u>d</u> is the first  char-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">acter&nbsp;character</font>
       acter  of  the  <b>IFS</b>  variable, whereas <b>"$@"</b> is equivalent to <b>"$1"</b> <b>"$2"</b> ....  Inside grave quote marks
       (<b>``</b>), <b>\</b> quotes the characters <b>\</b>, <b>`</b>, and <b>$</b>.  If the grave quotes occur within double  quotes,  then  <b>\</b>
       also quotes the character <b>"</b>.

       The  special  meaning  of  reserved  words  or aliases can be removed by quoting any character of the
       reserved word.  The recognition of function names or built-in command names listed  below  cannot  be
       altered by quoting them.

   <b>Arithmetic</b> <b>Evaluation.</b>
       The  shell performs arithmetic evaluation for arithmetic substitution, to evaluate an arithmetic com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand,&nbsp;command,</font>
       mand, to evaluate an indexed array subscript, and to evaluate  arguments  to  the  built-in  commands
       <b>shift</b>  and  <b>let</b>.   Evaluations are performed using double precision floating point arithmetic or long
       double precision floating point for systems that provide this data type.   Floating  point  constants
       follow  the  ANSI-C  programming  language  floating point conventions.  Integer constants follow the
       ANSI-C programming language integer constant conventions although only  single  byte  character  con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">stants&nbsp;constants</font>
       stants  are  recognized  and character casts are not recognized.  In addition constants can be of the
       form [<u>base</u><b>#</b>]<u>n</u> where <u>base</u> is a decimal number between two and sixty-four representing  the  arithmetic
       base  and  <u>n</u> is a number in that base.  The digits above 9 are represented by the lower case letters,
       the upper case letters, <b>@</b>, and <b>_</b> respectively.  For bases less than or equal to 36, upper  and  lower
       case characters can be used interchangeably.

       An  arithmetic  expression uses the same syntax, precedence, and associativity of expression as the C
       language.  All the C language operators that apply to floating point  quantities  can  be  used.   In
       addition,  the operator <b>**</b> can be used for exponentiation.  It has higher precedence than multiplica-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;multiplication</font>
       tion as is left associative.  In addition, when the value of an arithmetic variable or sub-expression
       can  be represented as a long integer, all C language integer arithmetic operations can be performed.
       Variables can be referenced by name within an  arithmetic  expression  without  using  the  parameter
       expansion syntax.  When a variable is referenced, its value is evaluated as an arithmetic expression.

       Any of the following math library functions that are in the C math library  can  be  used  within  an
       arithmetic expression:

       <b>abs</b>  <b>acos</b>  <b>acosh</b> <b>asin</b> <b>asinh</b> <b>atan</b> <b>atan2</b> <b>atanh</b> <b>cbrt</b> <b>copysign</b> <b>cos</b> <b>cosh</b> <b>erf</b> <b>erfc</b> <b>exp</b> <b>exp2</b> <b>expm1</b> <b>fabs</b> <b>fdim</b>
       <b>finite</b> <b>floor</b> <b>fma</b> <b>fmax</b> <b>fmod</b> <b>hypot</b> <b>ilogb</b> <b>int</b> <b>isinf</b> <b>isnan</b> <b>lgamma</b> <b>log</b> <b>log2</b> <b>logb</b> <b>nearbyint</b> <b>nextafter</b> <b>next</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">toward&nbsp;nexttoward</font>
       <b>toward</b> <b>pow</b> <b>remainder</b> <b>rint</b> <b>round</b> <b>sin</b> <b>sinh</b> <b>sqrt</b> <b>tan</b> <b>tanh</b> <b>tgamma</b> <b>trunc</b>

       An  internal  representation of a <u>variable</u> as a double precision floating point can be specified with
       the <b>-E</b> [<u>n</u>] or <b>-F</b> [<u>n</u>] option of the <b>typeset</b> special built-in command.  The <b>-E</b> option causes the expan-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion&nbsp;expansion</font>
       sion  of  the  value  to  be represented using scientific notation when it is expanded.  The optional
       option argument <u>n</u> defines the number of significant figures.  The <b>-F</b> option causes the  expansion  to
       be  represented  as  a  floating  decimal number when it is expanded.  The optional option argument <u>n</u>
       defines the number of places after the decimal point in this case.

       An internal integer representation of a <u>variable</u> can be specified with the <b>-i</b> [<u>n</u>] option of the <b>type</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">set&nbsp;typeset</font>
       <b>set</b> special built-in command.  The optional option argument <u>n</u> specifies an arithmetic base to be used
       when expanding the variable.  If you do not specify an arithmetic base, base 10 will be used.

       Arithmetic evaluation is performed on the value of each assignment to a variable with the <b>-E</b>, <b>-F</b>,  or
       <b>-i</b>  attribute.   Assigning  a floating point number to a variable whose type is an integer causes the
       fractional part to be truncated.


   <b>Prompting.</b>
       When used interactively, the shell prompts with the value of <b>PS1</b> after  expanding  it  for  parameter
       expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic substitution, before reading a command.  In addition,
       each single <b>!</b>  in the prompt is replaced by the command number.  A <b>!!</b>  is required to place <b>!</b>  in the
       prompt.   If  at any time a new-line is typed and further input is needed to complete a command, then
       the secondary prompt (i.e., the value of <b>PS2</b>) is issued.

   <b>Conditional</b> <b>Expressions.</b>
       A <u>conditional</u> <u>expression</u> is used with the <b>[[</b> compound command to test attributes of files and to com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pare&nbsp;compare</font>
       pare strings.  Field splitting and file name generation are not performed on the words between <b>[[</b> and
       <b>]]</b>.  Each expression can be constructed from one or more of the following  unary  or  binary  expres-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sions:&nbsp;expressions:</font>

       In  each  of the above expressions, if <u>file</u> is of the form <b>/dev/fd/</b><u>n</u>, where <u>n</u> is an integer, then the
       test is applied to the open file whose descriptor number is <u>n</u>.

       A compound expression can be constructed from these primitives by using any of the following,  listed
       in decreasing order of precedence.
       <b>(</b><u>expression</u><b>)</b>
              True, if <u>expression</u> is true.  Used to group expressions.

              True, if <u>expression1</u> and <u>expression2</u> are both true.
       <u>expression1</u> <b>||</b> <u>expression2</u>
              True, if either <u>expression1</u> or <u>expression2</u> is true.

   <b>Input/Output.</b>
       Before  a command is executed, its input and output may be redirected using a special notation inter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">preted&nbsp;interpreted</font>
       preted by the shell.  The following may appear anywhere in a simple-command or may precede or  follow
       a  <u>command</u>  and are <u>not</u> passed on to the invoked command.  Command substitution, parameter expansion,
       and arithmetic substitution occur before <u>word</u> or <u>digit</u> is used except as noted below.  File name gen-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">eration&nbsp;generation</font>
       eration  occurs only if the shell is interactive and the pattern matches a single file.  Field split-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ting&nbsp;splitting</font>
       ting is not performed.

       In  each  of  the  following  redirections,   if   <u>file</u>   is   of   the   form   <b>/dev/sctp/</b><u>host</u><b>/</b><u>port</u>,
       <b>/dev/tcp/</b><u>host</u><b>/</b><u>port</u>,  or  <b>/dev/udp/</b><u>host</u><b>/</b><u>port</u>,  where <u>host</u> is a hostname or host address, and <u>port</u> is a
       service given by name or an integer port number, then the redirection attempts to make a <b>tcp</b>, <b>sctp</b> or
       <b>udp</b> connection to the corresponding socket.

       No intervening space is allowed between the characters of redirection operators.

       <b>&lt;</b><u>word</u>         Use file <u>word</u> as standard input (file descriptor 0).

       <b>&gt;</b><u>word</u>         Use  file <u>word</u> as standard output (file descriptor 1).  If the file does not exist then
                     it is created.  If the file exists, and the <b>noclobber</b> option  is  on,  this  causes  an
                     error; otherwise, it is truncated to zero length.

       <b>&gt;|</b><u>word</u>        Sames as <b>&gt;</b>, except that it overrides the <b>noclobber</b> option.

       <b>&gt;&gt;</b><u>word</u>        Use  file  <u>word</u>  as standard output.  If the file exists, then output is appended to it
                     (by first seeking to the end-of-file); otherwise, the file is created.

       <b>&lt;&gt;</b><u>word</u>        Open file <u>word</u> for reading and writing as standard input.

       <b>&lt;&lt;</b>[<b>-</b>]<u>word</u>     The shell input is read up to a line that is the same as <u>word</u>  after  any  quoting  has
                     been  removed,  or to an end-of-file.  No parameter substitution, command substitution,
                     arithmetic substitution or file name generation is performed on  <u>word</u>.   The  resulting
                     document, called a <u>here-document</u>, becomes the standard input.  If any character of <u>word</u>
                     is quoted, then no interpretation is placed upon the characters of the document; other-
                     wise,  parameter  expansion,  command  substitution, and arithmetic substitution occur,
                     <b>\new-line</b> is ignored, and <b>\</b> must be used to quote the characters <b>\</b>,  <b>$</b>,  <b>`</b>.   If  <b>-</b>  is
                     appended to <b>&lt;&lt;</b>, then all leading tabs are stripped from <u>word</u> and from the document.  If
                     <b>#</b> is appended to <b>&lt;&lt;</b>, then leading spaces and tabs will be stripped off the  first  line
                     of the document and up to an equivalent indentation will be stripped from the remaining
                     lines and from <u>word</u>.  A tab stop is assumend to occur at every 8 columns for  the  pur-
                     poses of determining the indentation.

       <b>&lt;&lt;&lt;</b><u>word</u>       A  short  form of here document in which <u>word</u> becomes the contents of the here-document
                     after any parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic substitution occur.

       <b>&lt;&amp;</b><u>digit</u>       The  standard  input  is duplicated from file descriptor <u>digit</u> (see <a href="../man2/dup.2.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/2/dup"><u>dup</u>(2)</a>).  Similarly
                     for the standard output using <b>&gt;&amp;</b><u>digit</u>.

       <b>&lt;&amp;</b><u>digit</u><b>-</b>      The file descriptor given by <u>digit</u> is moved to standard input.  Similarly for the stan-
                     dard output using <b>&gt;&amp;</b><u>digit</u><b>-</b>.

       <b>&lt;&amp;-</b>           The standard input is closed.  Similarly for the standard output using <b>&gt;&amp;-</b>.

       <b>&lt;&amp;p</b>           The input from the co-process is moved to standard input.

       <b>&gt;&amp;p</b>           The output to the co-process is moved to standard output.

       <b>&lt;#((</b><u>expr</u><b>))</b>    Evaluate  arithmetic  expression  <u>expr</u>  and position file descriptor 0 to the resulting
                     value bytes from the start of the file.  The variables <b>CUR</b> and <b>EOF</b> evaluate to the cur-
                     rent offset and end-of-file offset respectively when evaluating <u>expr.</u>

       <b>&gt;#((</b><u>offset</u><b>))</b>  The same as <b>&lt;#</b> except applies to file descriptor 1.

       <b>&lt;#</b><u>pattern</u>     Seeks forward to the beginning of the next line containing <u>pattern</u>.

       <b>&lt;##</b><u>pattern</u>    The  same  as <b>&lt;#</b> except that the portion of the file that is skipped is copied to stan-
                     dard output.

       If one of the above is preceded by a digit, with no intervening space, then the file descriptor  num-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ber&nbsp;number</font>
       ber referred to is that specified by the digit (instead of the default 0 or 1).  If one of the above,
       other than <b>&gt;&amp;-</b> and the <b>&gt;#</b> and <b>&gt;#</b> forms, is preceded by <b>{</b><u>varname</u><b>}</b> with no intervening  space,  then  a
       file descriptor number &gt; 10 will be selected by the shell and stored in the variable <u>varname</u>.  If <b>&gt;&amp;</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">or&nbsp;&gt;&amp;or</font>
       or the any of the <b>&gt;#</b> and <b>&gt;#</b> forms is preceded by <b>{</b><u>varname</u><b>}</b> the value  of  <u>varname</u>  defines  the  file
       descriptor to close or position.  For example:

              <b>...</b> <b>2&gt;&amp;1</b>

       means file descriptor 2 is to be opened for writing as a duplicate of file descriptor 1 and

              <b>exec</b> <b>{n}&lt;file</b>

       means open file named <b>file</b> for reading and store the file descriptor number in variable <b>n</b>.

       The  order  in which redirections are specified is significant.  The shell evaluates each redirection
       in terms of the (<u>file</u> <u>descriptor</u>, <u>file</u>) association at the time of evaluation.  For example:

              <b>...</b> <b>1&gt;</b><u>fname</u> <b>2&gt;&amp;1</b>

       first associates file descriptor 1 with file <u>fname</u>.  It then associates file descriptor  2  with  the
       file  associated  with  file descriptor 1 (i.e.  <u>fname</u>).  If the order of redirections were reversed,
       file descriptor 2 would be associated with the terminal (assuming file descriptor  1  had  been)  and
       then file descriptor 1 would be associated with file <u>fname</u>.

       If  a command is followed by <b>&amp;</b> and job control is not active, then the default standard input for the
       command is the empty file <b>/dev/null</b>.  Otherwise, the environment for the execution of a command  con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tains&nbsp;contains</font>
       tains the file descriptors of the invoking shell as modified by input/output specifications.

   <b>Environment.</b>
       The  <u>environment</u> (see <a href="../man7/environ.7.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/7/environ"><u>environ</u>(7)</a>) is a list of name-value pairs that is passed to an executed program
       in the same way as a normal argument list.  The names must be <u>identifiers</u> and the values are  charac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ter&nbsp;character</font>
       ter  strings.   The  shell  interacts with the environment in several ways.  On invocation, the shell
       scans the environment and creates a variable for each name found, giving it the  corresponding  value
       and  attributes and marking it <u>export</u>.  Executed commands inherit the environment.  If the user modi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fies&nbsp;modifies</font>
       fies the values of these variables or creates new ones, using the <b>export</b> or <b>typeset</b> <b>-x</b> commands, they
       become part of the environment.  The environment seen by any executed command is thus composed of any
       name-value pairs originally inherited by the shell, whose values  may  be  modified  by  the  current
       shell, plus any additions which must be noted in <b>export</b> or <b>typeset</b> <b>-x</b> commands.

       The  environment for any <u>simple-command</u> or function may be augmented by prefixing it with one or more
       variable assignments.  A variable assignment argument is a word of the form <u>identifier=value</u>.  Thus:

              <b>TERM=450</b> <b>cmd</b> <b>args</b>                  and
              <b>(export</b> <b>TERM;</b> <b>TERM=450;</b> <b>cmd</b> <b>args)</b>

       are equivalent (as far as the above execution of <u>cmd</u> is concerned except for  special  built-in  com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mands&nbsp;commands</font>
       mands listed below - those that are preceded with a dagger).

       If  the  obsolete  <b>-k</b> option is set, <u>all</u> variable assignment arguments are placed in the environment,
       even if they occur after the command name.  The following first prints <b>a=b</b> <b>c</b> and then <b>c</b>:

              <b>echo</b> <b>a=b</b> <b>c</b>
              <b>set</b> <b>-k</b>
              <b>echo</b> <b>a=b</b> <b>c</b>
       This feature is intended for use with scripts written for early versions of the shell and its use  in
       new scripts is strongly discouraged.  It is likely to disappear someday.

   <b>Functions.</b>
       For  historical  reasons,  there are two ways to define functions, the <u>name</u><b>()</b> syntax and the <b>function</b>
       <u>name</u> syntax, described in the <u>Commands</u> section above.  Shell functions are read in and stored  inter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nally.&nbsp;internally.</font>
       nally.   Alias  names  are  resolved when the function is read.  Functions are executed like commands
       with the arguments passed as positional parameters.  (See <u>Execution</u> below.)

       Functions defined by the <b>function</b> <u>name</u> syntax and called by name execute in the same process  as  the
       caller and share all files and present working directory with the caller.  Traps caught by the caller
       are reset to their default action inside the function.  A  trap  condition  that  is  not  caught  or
       ignored  by  the  function  causes the function to terminate and the condition to be passed on to the
       caller.  A trap on <b>EXIT</b> set inside a function is executed in the environment of the caller after  the
       function  completes.   Ordinarily, variables are shared between the calling program and the function.
       However, the <b>typeset</b> special built-in command used within a function defines  local  variables  whose
       scope  includes the current function.  They can be passed to functions that they call in the variable
       assignment list the precedes the call or as arguments passed as name references.  Errors within func-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tions&nbsp;functions</font>
       tions return control to the caller.

       Functions defined with the <u>name</u><b>()</b> syntax and functions defined with the <b>function</b> <u>name</u> syntax that are
       invoked with the <b>.</b>  special built-in are executed in the caller's environment and share all variables
       and  traps  with  the caller.  Errors within these function executions cause the script that contains
       them to abort.

       The special built-in command <b>return</b> is used to return from function calls.

       Function names can be listed with the <b>-f</b> or <b>+f</b> option of the <b>typeset</b> special built-in  command.   The
       text  of functions, when available, will also be listed with <b>-f</b>.  Functions can be undefined with the
       <b>-f</b> option of the <b>unset</b> special built-in command.

       Ordinarily, functions are unset when the shell executes a shell script.  Functions that  need  to  be
       defined  across separate invocations of the shell should be placed in a directory and the <b>FPATH</b> vari-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able&nbsp;variable</font>
       able should contain the name of this directory.  They may also be specified in the <b>ENV</b> file.

   <b>Discipline</b> <b>Functions.</b>
       Each variable can have zero or more discipline functions associated with  it.   The  shell  initially
       understands  the discipline names <b>get</b>, <b>set</b>, <b>append</b>, and <b>unset</b> but on most systems others can be added
       at run time via the C programming interface extension provided by the <b>builtin</b> built-in  utility.   If
       the  <b>get</b>  discipline  is  defined for a variable, it is invoked whenever the given variable is refer-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">enced.&nbsp;referenced.</font>
       enced.  If the variable <b>.sh.value</b> is assigned a value inside the discipline function, the  referenced
       variable will evaluate to this value instead.  If the <b>set</b> discipline is defined for a variable, it is
       invoked whenever the given variable is assigned a value.  If the <b>append</b> discipline is defined  for  a
       variable,  it  is invoked whenever a value is appended to the given variable.  The variable <b>.sh.value</b>
       is given the value of the variable before invoking the discipline, and the variable will be  assigned
       the  value of <b>.sh.value</b> after the discipline completes.  If <b>.sh.value</b> is unset inside the discipline,
       then that value is unchanged.  If the <b>unset</b> discipline is defined for a variable, it is invoked when-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ever&nbsp;whenever</font>
       ever  the given variable is unset.  The variable will not be unset unless it is unset explicitly from
       within this discipline function.

       The variable <b>.sh.name</b> contains the name of the variable for which the discipline function is  called,
       <b>.sh.subscript</b>  is  the subscript of the variable, and <b>.sh.value</b> will contain the value being assigned
       inside the <b>.set</b> discipline function.  For the <b>set</b> discipline,  changing  <b>.sh.value</b>  will  change  the
       value that gets assigned.

   <b>Jobs.</b>
       If  the  <b>monitor</b>  option  of the <b>set</b> command is turned on, an interactive shell associates a <u>job</u> with
       each pipeline.  It keeps a table of current jobs, printed by the <b>jobs</b> command, and assigns them small
       integer  numbers.   When  a job is started asynchronously with <b>&amp;</b>, the shell prints a line which looks
       like:

            [1] 1234

       indicating that the job which was started asynchronously was job number 1  and  had  one  (top-level)
       process, whose process id was 1234.

       This  paragraph and the next require features that are not in all versions of UNIX and may not apply.
       If you are running a job and wish to do something else you may hit the key <b>^Z</b> (control-Z) which sends
       a  STOP  signal  to  the  current  job.   The shell will then normally indicate that the job has been
       `Stopped', and print another prompt.  You can then manipulate the state of this job,  putting  it  in
       the background with the <b>bg</b> command, or run some other commands and then eventually bring the job back
       into the foreground with the foreground command <b>fg</b>.  A <b>^Z</b> takes effect immediately  and  is  like  an
       interrupt in that pending output and unread input are discarded when it is typed.

       A  job  being run in the background will stop if it tries to read from the terminal.  Background jobs
       are normally allowed to produce output, but this can be disabled by giving the command  <b>stty</b>  <b>tostop</b>.
       If  you set this tty option, then background jobs will stop when they try to produce output like they
       do when they try to read input.

       There are several ways to refer to jobs in the shell.  A job can be referred to by the process id  of
       any process of the job or by one of the following:
       <b>%</b><u>number</u>
              The job with the given number.
       <b>%</b><u>string</u>
              Any job whose command line begins with <u>string</u>.
       <b>%?</b><u>string</u>
              Any job whose command line contains <u>string</u>.
       <b>%%</b>     Current job.
       <b>%+</b>     Equivalent to <b>%%</b>.
       <b>%-</b>     Previous job.

       The  shell  learns  immediately whenever a process changes state.  It normally informs you whenever a
       job becomes blocked so that no further progress is possible, but only just before it prints a prompt.
       This  is  done so that it does not otherwise disturb your work.  The <b>notify</b> option of the <b>set</b> command
       causes the shell to print these job change messages as soon as they occur.

       When the <b>monitor</b> option is on, each background job that completes triggers any trap set for <b>CHLD</b>.

       When you try to leave the shell while jobs are running or stopped, you will be warned that `You  have
       stopped(running)  jobs.'   You may use the <b>jobs</b> command to see what they are.  If you immediately try
       to exit again, the shell will not warn you a second time, and the stopped jobs  will  be  terminated.
       When  a  login  shell receives a HUP signal, it sends a HUP signal to each job that has not been dis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">owned&nbsp;disowned</font>
       owned with the <b>disown</b> built-in command described below.

   <b>Signals.</b>
       The INT and QUIT signals for an invoked command are ignored if the command is followed by <b>&amp;</b>  and  the
       <b>monitor</b>  option  is  not  active.  Otherwise, signals have the values inherited by the shell from its
       parent (but see also the <b>trap</b> built-in command below).

   <b>Execution.</b>
       Each time a command is read, the above substitutions are carried out.  If the  command  name  matches
       one  of  the <u>Special</u> <u>Built-in</u> <u>Commands</u> listed below, it is executed within the current shell process.
       Next, the command name is checked to see if it matches a user defined  function.   If  it  does,  the
       positional  parameters are saved and then reset to the arguments of the <u>function</u> call.  A function is
       also executed in the current shell process.  When the <u>function</u> completes  or  issues  a  <b>return</b>,  the
       positional parameter list is restored.  For functions defined with the <b>function</b> <u>name</u> syntax, any trap
       set on <b>EXIT</b> within the function is executed.  The exit value of a <u>function</u> is the value of  the  last
       command  executed.   If  a command name is not a <u>special</u> <u>built-in</u> <u>command</u> or a user defined <u>function</u>,
       but it is one of the built-in commands listed below, it is executed in the current shell process.

       The shell variable <b>PATH</b> defines the search path for the directory containing the  command.   Alterna-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tive&nbsp;Alternative</font>
       tive  directory  names  are separated by a colon (<b>:</b>).  The default path is <b>/bin:/usr/bin:</b> (specifying
       <b>/bin</b>, <b>/usr/bin</b>, and the current directory in that order).  The current directory can be specified  by
       two  or more adjacent colons, or by a colon at the beginning or end of the path list.  If the command
       name contains a <b>/</b>, then the search path is not used.   Otherwise,  each  directory  in  the  path  is
       searched  for  an  executable  file  of the given name that is not a directory.  If found, and if the
       shell determines that there is a built-in version of a command corresponding  to  a  given  pathname,
       this  built-in  is invoked in the current process.  If found, and this directory is also contained in
       the value of the <b>FPATH</b> variable, then this file is loaded into the current shell environment as if it
       were  the  argument  to the <b>.</b> command except that only preset aliases are expanded, and a function of
       the given name is executed as described above.  If not found, and the file <b>.paths</b> is found,  and  the
       this  file  contains  a  line of the form <b>FPATH=</b><u>path</u> where <u>path</u> names an existing directory, and this
       directory contains a file of the given name, then this file is loaded into the current shell environ-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment&nbsp;environment</font>
       ment as if it were the argument to the <b>.</b> special built-in command and a function of the given name is
       executed.  Otherwise, if found, a process is created and an attempt is made to  execute  the  command
       via <!-- a --><u>exec</u>(2)<!-- /a -->.

       When  an executable is found, the directory where it is found in is searched for a file named <b>.paths</b>.
       If this file is found and it contains a line of the form <b>BUILTIN_LIB=</b><u>value</u> , then the  library  named
       by  <u>value</u>  will  be searched for as if it were an option argument to <b>builtin</b> <b>-f</b>, and if it contains a
       built-in of the specified name this will be executed instead of a command by this  name.   Otherwise,
       if this file is found and it contains a line of the form <u>name</u><b>=</b><u>value</u> in the first or second line, then
       the environment variable <u>name</u> is modified by prepending the  directory  specified  by  <u>value</u>  to  the
       directory list.  If <u>value</u> is not an absolute directory, then it specifies a directory relative to the
       directory that the executable was found.  If the environment variable <u>name</u> does not already exist  it
       will be added to the environment list for the specified command.

       If  the  file  has execute permission but is not an <b>a.out</b> file, it is assumed to be a file containing
       shell commands.  A separate shell is spawned to read it.  All non-exported variables are  removed  in
       this  case.   If  the shell command file doesn't have read permission, or if the <u>setuid</u> and/or <u>setgid</u>
       bits are set on the file, then the shell executes an agent whose job it is to set up the  permissions
       and  execute the shell with the shell command file passed down as an open file.  A parenthesized com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
       mand is executed in a sub-shell without removing non-exported variables.

   <b>Command</b> <b>Re-entry.</b>
       The text of the last <b>HISTSIZE</b> (default 512) commands entered from a terminal device  is  saved  in  a
       <u>history</u>  file.  The file <b>$HOME/.sh_history</b> is used if the <b>HISTFILE</b> variable is not set or if the file
       it names is not writable.  A shell can access the commands of all <u>interactive</u> shells  which  use  the
       same  named <b>HISTFILE</b>.  The built-in command <b>hist</b> is used to list or edit a portion of this file.  The
       portion of the file to be edited or listed can be selected by number or by giving the first character
       or characters of the command.  A single command or range of commands can be specified.  If you do not
       specify an editor program as an argument to <b>hist</b> then the value of the variable <b>HISTEDIT</b> is used.  If
       <b>HISTEDIT</b>  is  unset, the obsolete variable <b>FCEDIT</b> is used.  If <b>FCEDIT</b> is not defined, then <b>/bin/ed</b> is
       used.  The edited <!-- a -->command(s)<!-- /a --> is printed and re-executed upon leaving the editor unless you quit with-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">out&nbsp;without</font>
       out writing.  The <b>-s</b> option (and in obsolete versions, the editor name <b>-</b>) is used to skip the editing
       phase and to re-execute the command.  In this case a substitution parameter of the form  <u>old</u><b>=</b><u>new</u>  can
       be  used  to  modify  the  command  before execution.  For example, with the preset alias <b>r</b>, which is
       aliased to <b>'hist</b> <b>-s'</b>, typing `<b>r</b> <b>bad=good</b> <b>c</b>' will re-execute the most recent command which starts with
       the letter <b>c</b>, replacing the first occurrence of the string <b>bad</b> with the string <b>good</b>.

   <b>In-line</b> <b>Editing</b> <b>Options.</b>
       Normally,  each  command  line  entered from a terminal device is simply typed followed by a <b>new-line</b>
       (`RETURN' or `LINE FEED').  If either the <b>emacs</b>, <b>gmacs</b>, or <b>vi</b> option is active, the user can edit the
       command  line.   To be in either of these edit modes <b>set</b> the corresponding option.  An editing option
       is automatically selected each time the <b>VISUAL</b> or <b>EDITOR</b> variable  is  assigned  a  value  ending  in
       either of these option names.

       The editing features require that the user's terminal accept `RETURN' as carriage return without line
       feed and that a space (` ') must overwrite the current character on the screen.

       Unless the <b>multiline</b> option is on, the editing modes implement a concept where the  user  is  looking
       through  a  window  at  the current line.  The window width is the value of <b>COLUMNS</b> if it is defined,
       otherwise 80.  If the window width is too small to display the prompt and leave at least 8 columns to
       enter  input,  the  prompt  is  truncated from the left.  If the line is longer than the window width
       minus two, a mark is displayed at the end of the window to notify the user.  As the cursor moves  and
       reaches  the  window boundaries the window will be centered about the cursor.  The mark is a <b>&gt;</b> (&lt;<b>,</b> <b>*</b>)
       if the line extends on the right (left, both) <!-- a -->side(s)<!-- /a --> of the window.

       The search commands in each edit mode provide access to the history file.  Only strings are  matched,
       not  patterns, although a leading <b>^</b> in the string restricts the match to begin at the first character
       in the line.

       Each of the edit modes has an operation to list the files or commands that match a partially  entered
       word.   When  applied to the first word on the line, or the first word after a <b>;</b>, <b>|</b>, <b>&amp;</b>, or <b>(</b>, and the
       word does not begin with <b>~</b> or contain a <b>/</b>, the list of aliases, functions,  and  executable  commands
       defined  by the <b>PATH</b> variable that could match the partial word is displayed.  Otherwise, the list of
       files that match the given word is displayed.  If the partially entered word  does  not  contain  any
       file  expansion characters, a <b>*</b> is appended before generating these lists.  After displaying the gen-
       erated list, the input line is redrawn.  These operations are called command name  listing  and  file
       name  listing, respectively.  There are additional operations, referred to as command name completion
       and file name completion, which compute the list of matching commands or files, but instead of print-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;printing</font>
       ing  the  list, replace the current word with a complete or partial match.  For file name completion,
       if the match is unique, a <b>/</b> is appended if the file is a directory and a space  is  appended  if  the
       file  is  not  a directory.  Otherwise, the longest common prefix for all the matching files replaces
       the word.  For command name completion, only the portion of the file names after the last <b>/</b> are  used
       to  find  the  longest  command  prefix.  If only a single name matches this prefix, then the word is
       replaced with the command name followed by a space.  When using a <u>tab</u> for completion  that  does  not
       yield a unique match, a subsequent <u>tab</u> will provide a numbered list of matching alternatives.  A spe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cific&nbsp;specific</font>
       cific selection can be made by entering the selection number followed by a <u>tab</u>.

   <b>Key</b> <b>Bindings.</b>
       The <b>KEYBD</b> trap can be used to intercept keys as they are typed and change  the  characters  that  are
       actually  seen  by  the shell.  This trap is executed after each character (or sequence of characters
       when the first character is ESC) is entered while reading from a terminal.  The  variable  <b>.sh.edchar</b>
       contains  the  character  or  character  sequence  which  generated  the trap.  Changing the value of
       <b>.sh.edchar</b> in the trap action causes the shell to behave as if the new value were  entered  from  the
       keyboard rather than the original value.

       The variable <b>.sh.edcol</b> is set to the input column number of the cursor at the time of the input.  The
       variable <b>.sh.edmode</b> is set to ESC when in <b>vi</b> insert mode (see  below)  and  is  null  otherwise.   By
       prepending  <b>${.sh.editmode}</b>  to  a  value assigned to <b>.sh.edchar</b> it will cause the shell to change to
       control mode if it is not already in this mode.

       This trap is not invoked for characters entered as arguments to editing directives, or while  reading
       input for a character search.

   <b>Emacs</b> <b>Editing</b> <b>Mode.</b>
       This mode is entered by enabling either the <b>emacs</b> or <b>gmacs</b> option.  The only difference between these
       two modes is the way they handle <b>^T</b>.  To edit, the user moves the cursor to the point needing correc-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;correction</font>
       tion and then inserts or deletes characters or words as needed.  All the editing commands are control
       characters or escape sequences.  The notation for control characters is caret  (<b>^</b>)  followed  by  the
       character.   For  example, <b>^F</b> is the notation for control <b>F</b>.  This is entered by depressing `f' while
       holding down the `CTRL' (control) key.  The `SHIFT' key is <u>not</u> depressed.  (The  notation  <b>^?</b>   indi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cates&nbsp;indicates</font>
       cates the DEL (delete) key.)

       The  notation  for escape sequences is <b>M-</b> followed by a character.  For example, <b>M-f</b> (pronounced Meta
       f) is entered by depressing ESC (ascii <b>033</b>) followed by `f'.  (<b>M-F</b> would be the notation for ESC fol-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lowed&nbsp;followed</font>
       lowed by `SHIFT' (capital) `F'.)

       All  edit  commands  operate  from  any  place  on the line (not just at the beginning).  Neither the
       `RETURN' nor the `LINE FEED' key is entered after edit commands except when noted.

       <b>^F</b>        Move cursor forward (right) one character.
       <b>M-[C</b>      Move cursor forward (right) one character.
       <b>M-f</b>       Move cursor forward one word.  (The <b>emacs</b> editor's idea of a word is a string of characters
                 consisting of only letters, digits and underscores.)
       <b>^B</b>        Move cursor backward (left) one character.
       <b>M-[D</b>      Move cursor backward (left) one character.
       <b>M-b</b>       Move cursor backward one word.
       <b>^A</b>        Move cursor to start of line.
       <b>M-[H</b>      Move cursor to start of line.
       <b>^E</b>        Move cursor to end of line.
       <b>M-[Y</b>      Move cursor to end of line.
       <b>^]</b><u>char</u>    Move cursor forward to character <u>char</u> on current line.
       <b>M-^]</b><u>char</u>  Move cursor backward to character <u>char</u> on current line.
       <b>^X^X</b>      Interchange the cursor and mark.
       <u>erase</u>     (User  defined erase character as defined by the <a href="stty.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/stty"><u>stty</u>(1)</a> command, usually <b>^H</b> or <b>#</b>.)  Delete
                 previous character.
       <u>lnext</u>     (User defined literal next character as defined by the  <a href="stty.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/stty"><u>stty</u>(1)</a>  command.   or  <b>^V</b>  if  not
                 defined.)  Removes the next character's editing features (if any).
       <b>^D</b>        Delete current character.
       <b>M-d</b>       Delete current word.
       <b>M-^H</b>      (Meta-backspace) Delete previous word.
       <b>M-h</b>       Delete previous word.
       <b>M-^?</b>      (Meta-DEL) Delete previous word (if your interrupt character is <b>^?</b>  (DEL, the default) then
                 this command will not work).
       <b>^T</b>        Transpose current character with previous character and advance the cursor in  <u>emacs</u>  mode.
                 Transpose two previous characters in <u>gmacs</u> mode.

       <b>M-l</b>       Change the current word to lower case.
       <b>^K</b>        Delete  from the cursor to the end of the line.  If preceded by a numerical parameter whose
                 value is less than the current cursor position, then delete from given position up  to  the
                 cursor.   If preceded by a numerical parameter whose value is greater than the current cur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sor&nbsp;cursor</font>
                 sor position, then delete from cursor up to given cursor position.
       <b>^W</b>        Kill from the cursor to the mark.
       <b>M-p</b>       Push the region from the cursor to the mark on the stack.
       <u>kill</u>      (User defined kill character as defined by the stty command, usually <b>^G</b> or  <b>@</b>.)   Kill  the
                 entire current line.  If two <u>kill</u> characters are entered in succession, all kill characters
                 from then on cause a line feed (useful when using paper terminals).
       <b>^Y</b>        Restore last item removed from line. (Yank item back to the line.)
       <b>^L</b>        Line feed and print current line.

       <b>^M</b>        (Return) Execute the current line.
       <u>eof</u>       End-of-file character, normally <b>^D</b>, is processed as an End-of-file only if the current line
                 is null.
       <b>^P</b>        Fetch  previous  command.   Each  time  <b>^P</b>  is entered the previous command back in time is
                 accessed.  Moves back one line when not on the first line of a multi-line command.
       <b>M-[A</b>      Equivalent to <b>^P.</b>

       <b>M-&gt;</b>       Fetch the most recent (youngest) history line.
       <b>^N</b>        Fetch next command line.  Each time <b>^N</b> is entered the next command line forward in time  is
                 accessed.
       <b>M-[B</b>      Equivalent to <b>^N.</b>
       <b>^R</b><u>string</u>  Reverse  search  history  for a previous command line containing <u>string</u>.  If a parameter of
                 zero is given, the search is forward.  <u>String</u> is terminated by a  `RETURN'  or  `NEW LINE'.
                 If  string is preceded by a <b>^</b>, the matched line must begin with <u>string</u>.  If <u>string</u> is omit-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ted,&nbsp;omitted,</font>
                 ted, then the next command line containing the most recent <u>string</u>  is  accessed.   In  this
                 case a parameter of zero reverses the direction of the search.
       <b>^O</b>        Operate  -  Execute  the current line and fetch the next line relative to current line from
                 the history file.
       <b>M-</b><u>digits</u>  (Escape) Define numeric parameter, the digits are taken as a parameter to the next command.
                 The  commands  that  accept a parameter are <b>^F</b>, <b>^B</b>, <u>erase</u>, <b>^C</b>, <b>^D</b>, <b>^K</b>, <b>^R</b>, <b>^P</b>, <b>^N</b>, <b>^]</b>, <b>M-.</b>,
                 <b>M-^]</b>, <b>M-_</b>, <b>M-=</b>, <b>M-b</b>, <b>M-c</b>, <b>M-d</b>, <b>M-f</b>, <b>M-h</b>, <b>M-l</b> and <b>M-^H</b>.
       <b>M-</b><u>letter</u>  Soft-key - Your alias list is searched for an alias by the name <b>_</b><u>letter</u> and if an alias  of
                 this  name  is defined, its value will be inserted on the input queue.  The <u>letter</u> must not
                 be one of the above meta-functions.
       <b>M-[</b><u>letter</u> Soft-key - Your alias list is searched for an alias by the name <b>__</b><u>letter</u> and if an alias of
                 this  name  is  defined, its value will be inserted on the input queue.  The can be used to
                 program functions keys on many terminals.
       <b>M-.</b>       The last word of the previous command is inserted on the line.  If preceded  by  a  numeric
                 parameter, the value of this parameter determines which word to insert rather than the last
                 word.
       <b>M-_</b>       Same as <b>M-.</b>.
       <b>M-*</b>       Attempt file name generation on the current word.  An asterisk  is  appended  if  the  word
                 doesn't match any file or contain any special pattern characters.
       <b>M-ESC</b>     Command or file name completion as described above.
       <b>^I</b> <u>tab</u>    Attempts  command  or  file  name  completion  as described above.  If a partial completion
                 occurs, repeating this will behave as if <b>M-=</b> were entered.  If no match is found or entered
                 after <u>space</u>, a <u>tab</u> is inserted.
       <b>M-=</b>       If  not preceded by a numeric parameter, it generates the list of matching commands or file
                 names as described above.  Otherwise, the word under the cursor is  replaced  by  the  item
                 corresponding  to  the value of the numeric parameter from the most recently generated com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
                 mand or file list.  If the cursor is not on a word, it is inserted instead.
       <b>^U</b>        Multiply parameter of next command by 4.
       <b>\</b>         Escape next character.  Editing characters, the user's erase, kill and interrupt  (normally
                 <b>^?</b>)   characters may be entered in a command line or in a search string if preceded by a <b>\</b>.
                 The <b>\</b> removes the next character's editing features (if any).
       <b>M-^V</b>      Display version of the shell.
       <b>M-#</b>       If the line does not begin with a <b>#</b>, a <b>#</b> is inserted at the beginning of the line and after
                 each  new-line,  and the line is entered.  This causes a comment to be inserted in the his-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tory&nbsp;history</font>
                 tory file.  If the line begins with a <b>#</b>, the <b>#</b> is deleted and one <b>#</b> after each new-line  is
                 also deleted.

   <b>Vi</b> <b>Editing</b> <b>Mode.</b>
       There are two typing modes.  Initially, when you enter a command you are in the <u>input</u> mode.  To edit,
       the user enters <u>control</u> mode by typing ESC (<b>033</b>) and moves the cursor to the point needing correction
       and  then inserts or deletes characters or words as needed.  Most control commands accept an optional
       repeat <u>count</u> prior to the command.

       When in <b>vi</b> mode on most systems, canonical processing is initially enabled and the  command  will  be
       echoed again if the speed is 1200 baud or greater and it contains any control characters or less than
       one second has elapsed since the prompt was printed.  The ESC character terminates canonical process-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;processing</font>
       ing  for the remainder of the command and the user can then modify the command line.  This scheme has
       the advantages of canonical processing with the type-ahead echoing of raw mode.

       If the option <b>viraw</b> is also set, the terminal will always have canonical processing  disabled.   This
       mode  is  implicit  for  systems that do not support two alternate end of line delimiters, and may be
       helpful for certain terminals.

        <b>Input</b> <b>Edit</b> <b>Commands</b>
              By default the editor is in input mode.
              <u>erase</u>     (User defined erase character as defined by the stty  command,  usually  <b>^H</b>  or  <b>#</b>.)
                        Delete previous character.
              <b>^W</b>        Delete  the  previous blank separated word.  On some systems the <b>viraw</b> option may be
                        required for this to work.
              <u>eof</u>       As the first character of  the  line  causes  the  shell  to  terminate  unless  the
                        <b>ignoreeof</b> option is set.  Otherwise this character is ignored.
              <u>lnext</u>     (User  defined  literal  next  character  as  defined  by  the  <a href="stty.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/stty"><u>stty</u>(1)</a> or <b>^V</b> if not
                        defined.)  Removes the next character's editing features (if any).  On some  systems
                        the <b>viraw</b> option may be required for this to work.
              <b>\</b>         Escape the next <u>erase</u> or <u>kill</u> character.
              <b>^I</b> <u>tab</u>    Attempts  command  or  file  name completion as described above and returns to input
                        mode.  If a partial completion occurs, repeating this  will  behave  as  if  <b>=</b>  were
                        entered  from  control  mode.  If no match is found or entered after <u>space</u>, a <u>tab</u> is
                        inserted.

              <b>U</b>         Undo all the text modifying commands performed on the line.
              [<u>count</u>]<b>v</b>  Returns the command <b>hist</b> <b>-e</b> <b>${VISUAL:-${EDITOR:-vi}}</b> <u>count</u> in the input buffer.   If
                        <u>count</u> is omitted, then the current line is used.

              <b>^J</b>        (New line) Execute the current line, regardless of mode.
              <b>^M</b>        (Return) Execute the current line, regardless of mode.
              <b>#</b>         If  the  first character of the command is a <b>#</b>, then this command deletes this <b>#</b> and
                        each <b>#</b> that follows a newline.  Otherwise, sends the line after  inserting  a  <b>#</b>  in
                        front  of  each  line  in  the  command.   Useful for causing the current line to be
                        inserted in the history as a comment and uncommenting previously commented  commands
                        in the history file.
              [<u>count</u>]<b>=</b>  If  <u>count</u> is not specified, it generates the list of matching commands or file names
                        as described above.  Otherwise, the word under the the cursor  is  replaced  by  the
                        <u>count</u>  item from the most recently generated command or file list.  If the cursor is
                        not on a word, it is inserted instead.
              <b>@</b><u>letter</u>   Your alias list is searched for an alias by the name <b>_</b><u>letter</u> and if an alias of this
                        name is defined, its value will be inserted on the input queue for processing.
              <b>^V</b>        Display version of the shell.

   <b>Built-in</b> <b>Commands.</b>
       The following simple-commands are executed in the shell process.  Input/Output redirection is permit-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ted.&nbsp;permitted.</font>
       ted.  Unless otherwise indicated, the output is written on file descriptor 1  and  the  exit  status,
       when  there  is  no  syntax  error, is zero.  Except for <b>:</b>, <b>true</b>, <b>false</b>, <b>echo</b>, <b>newgrp</b>, and <b>login</b>, all
       built-in commands accept <b>--</b> to indicate end of options.  They also interpret the option  <b>--man</b>  as  a
       request  to  display  the man page onto standard error and <b>-?</b>  as a help request which prints a <u>usage</u>
       message on standard error.  Commands that are preceded by one or two  symbols are  special  built-in
       commands and are treated specially in the following ways:
       1.     Variable assignment lists preceding the command remain in effect when the command completes.
       2.     I/O redirections are processed after variable assignments.
       3.     Errors cause a script that contains them to abort.
       4.     They are not valid function names.
       5.     Words  following  a command preceded by  that are in the format of a variable assignment are
              expanded with the same rules as a variable assignment.  This means that tilde substitution  is
              performed after the <b>=</b> sign and field splitting and file name generation are not performed.

        <b>:</b> [ <u>arg</u> ... ]
              The command only expands parameters.

        <b>.</b> <u>name</u> <b>[</b> <u>arg</u> <b>...</b> <b>]</b>
              If  <u>name</u>  is  a  function defined with the <b>function</b> <u>name</u> reserved word syntax, the function is
              executed in the current environment (as if it had been defined with the <u>name</u><b>()</b> syntax.)   Oth-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">erwise&nbsp;Otherwise</font>
              erwise  if  <u>name</u>  refers to a file, the file is read in its entirety and the commands are exe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cuted&nbsp;executed</font>
              cuted in the current shell environment.  The search path specified by <b>PATH</b> is used to find the
              directory  containing  the  file.   If any arguments <u>arg</u> are given, they become the positional
              parameters while processing the <b>.</b>  command and the original positional parameters are restored
              upon  completion.   Otherwise the positional parameters are unchanged.  The exit status is the
              exit status of the last command executed.

        <b>alias</b> [ <b>-ptx</b> ]  [ <u>name</u>[ <b>=</b><u>value</u>  ] ] ...
              <b>alias</b> with no arguments prints the list of aliases in the form <u>name=value</u> on standard  output.
              The  <b>-p</b>  option  causes the word <b>alias</b> to be inserted before each one.  When one or more argu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ments&nbsp;arguments</font>
              ments are given, an <u>alias</u> is defined for each <u>name</u> whose <u>value</u> is given.  A trailing space  in
              <u>value</u>  causes  the  next word to be checked for alias substitution.  The obsolete <b>-t</b> option is
              used to set and list tracked aliases.  The value of a tracked alias is the full pathname  cor-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">responding&nbsp;corresponding</font>
              responding to the given <u>name</u>.  The value becomes undefined when the value of <b>PATH</b> is reset but
              the alias remains tracked.  Without the <b>-t</b> option, for each <u>name</u>  in  the  argument  list  for
              which  no  <u>value</u> is given, the name and value of the alias is printed.  The obsolete <b>-x</b> option
              has no effect.  The exit status is non-zero if a <u>name</u> is given, but no value, and no alias has
              been defined for the <u>name</u>.

       <b>bg</b> [ <u>job</u>... ]
              This  command  is  only on systems that support job control.  Puts each specified <u>job</u> into the
              background.  The current job is put in the background if <u>job</u> is not specified.  See <u>Jobs</u> for a
              description of the format of <u>job</u>.

        <b>break</b> [ <u>n</u> ]
              Exit  from  the  enclosing <b>for</b>, <b>while</b>, <b>until</b>, or <b>select</b> loop, if any.  If <u>n</u> is specified, then
              break <u>n</u> levels.

       <b>builtin</b> [ <b>-ds</b> ] [ <b>-f</b> <u>file</u> ] [ <u>name</u> ... ]
              If <u>name</u> is not specified, and no <b>-f</b> option is specified, the built-ins are printed on standard
              output.  The <b>-s</b> option prints only the special built-ins.  Otherwise, each <u>name</u> represents the
              pathname whose basename is the name of the built-in.  The entry point function name is  deter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mined&nbsp;determined</font>
              mined by prepending <b>b_</b> to the built-in name.  The ISO C/C++ prototype is <b>b_</b><u>mycommand</u><b>(int</b> <u>argc</u>,
              <b>char</b> <b>*</b><u>argv</u><b>[]</b>, <b>void</b> <b>*</b><u>context</u><b>)</b> for the builtin command <u>mycommand</u> where <u>argv</u> is array an of  <u>argc</u>
              elements  and  context  is  an  optional  pointer  to  a  <b>Shell_t</b>  structure  as  described in
              <b>&lt;ast/shell.h&gt;</b>.
              Special built-ins cannot be bound to a pathname or deleted.  The <b>-d</b> option deletes each of the
              given  built-ins.   On  systems  that  support  dynamic  loading, the <b>-f</b> option names a shared
              library containing the code for built-ins.  The shared library  prefix  and/or  suffix,  which
              depend  on the system, can be omitted.  Once a library is loaded, its symbols become available
              for subsequent invocations of <b>builtin</b>.  Multiple libraries  can  be  specified  with  separate
              invocations of the <b>builtin</b> command.  Libraries are searched in the reverse order in which they
              are specified.  When a library is loaded, it looks for a function in the library whose name is
              <b>lib_init()</b> and invokes this function with an argument of <b>0</b>.

       <b>cd</b> [ <b>-LP</b> ] [ <u>arg</u> ]
       <b>cd</b> [ <b>-LP</b> ] <u>old</u> <u>new</u>
              This  command  can be in either of two forms.  In the first form it changes the current direc-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tory&nbsp;directory</font>
              tory to <u>arg</u>.  If <u>arg</u> is <b>-</b> the directory is changed to the previous directory.  The shell vari-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able&nbsp;variable</font>
              able  <b>HOME</b>  is  the default <u>arg</u>.  The variable <b>PWD</b> is set to the current directory.  The shell
              variable <b>CDPATH</b> defines the search path for the directory containing <u>arg</u>.  Alternative  direc-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tory&nbsp;directory</font>
              tory  names  are separated by a colon (<b>:</b>).  The default path is <b>&lt;null&gt;</b> (specifying the current
              directory).  Note that the current directory is specified by  a  null  path  name,  which  can
              appear  immediately  after the equal sign or between the colon delimiters anywhere else in the
              path list.  If <u>arg</u> begins with a <b>/</b> then the search path is not used.  Otherwise,  each  direc-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tory&nbsp;directory</font>
              tory in the path is searched for <u>arg</u>.
              The  second  form of <b>cd</b> substitutes the string <u>new</u> for the string <u>old</u> in the current directory
              name, <b>PWD</b>, and tries to change to this new directory.
              By default, symbolic link names are treated literally when finding the directory  name.   This
              is  equivalent  to  the  <b>-L</b>  option.   The <b>-P</b> option causes symbolic links to be resolved when
              determining the directory.  The last instance of <b>-L</b> or <b>-P</b> on the command line determines which
              method is used.
              The <b>cd</b> command may not be executed by <b>rksh.</b>  <b>rksh93.</b>

       <b>command</b> [ <b>-pvxV</b> ] <u>name</u> [ <u>arg</u> ... ]
              Without  the  <b>-v</b> or <b>-V</b> options, <b>command</b> executes <u>name</u> with the arguments given by <u>arg</u>.  The <b>-p</b>
              option causes a default path to be searched rather than the one defined by the value of  <b>PATH</b>.
              Functions  will  not be searched for when finding <u>name</u>.  In addition, if <u>name</u> refers to a spe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cial&nbsp;special</font>
              cial built-in, none of the special properties associated with the leading daggers will be hon-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ored.&nbsp;honored.</font>
              ored.   (For example, the predefined alias <b>redirect='command</b> <b>exec'</b> prevents a script from ter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">minating&nbsp;terminating</font>
              minating when an invalid redirection is given.)  With the  <b>-x</b>  option,  if  command  execution
              would  result  in  a failure because there are too many arguments, errno <b>E2BIG</b>, the shell will
              invoke command <u>name</u> multiple times with a subset of the arguments on each  invocation.   Argu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ments&nbsp;Arguments</font>
              ments that occur prior to the first word that expands to multiple arguments and after the last
              word that expands to multiple arguments will be passed on each invocation.   The  exit  status
              will  be the maximum invocation exit status.  With the <b>-v</b> option, <b>command</b> is equivalent to the
              built-in <b>whence</b> command described below.  The <b>-V</b> option causes <b>command</b> to act like <b>whence</b>  <b>-v</b>.

        <b>continue</b> [ <u>n</u> ]
              Resume  the next iteration of the enclosing <b>for</b>, <b>while</b>, <b>until</b>, or <b>select</b> loop.  If <u>n</u> is speci-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fied,&nbsp;specified,</font>
              fied, then resume at the <u>n</u>-th enclosing loop.

       <b>disown</b> [ <u>job</u>... ]
              Causes the shell not to send a HUP signal to each given <u>job</u>, or all  active  jobs  if  <u>job</u>  is
              omitted, when a login shell terminates.

       <b>echo</b> [ <u>arg</u> ... ]
              When  the  first <u>arg</u> does not begin with a -, and none of the arguments contain a \, then <b>echo</b>
              prints each of its arguments separated by a space and terminated by  a  new-line.   Otherwise,
              the  behavior  of <b>echo</b> is system dependent and <b>print</b> or <b>printf</b> described below should be used.
              See <a href="echo.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/echo"><u>echo</u>(1)</a> for usage and description.

        <b>eval</b> [ <u>arg</u> ... ]
              The arguments are read as input to the shell and the resulting <!-- a -->command(s)<!-- /a --> executed.

        <b>exec</b> [ <b>-c</b> ] [ <b>-a</b> <u>name</u> ] [ <u>arg</u> ... ]
              If <u>arg</u> is given, the command specified by the arguments is executed in  place  of  this  shell
              without  creating  a  new  process.  The <b>-c</b> option causes the environment to be cleared before
              applying variable assignments associated with the <b>exec</b> invocation.  The <b>-a</b> option causes  <u>name</u>
              rather  than the first <u>arg</u>, to become <b>argv[0]</b> for the new process.  Input/output arguments may
              appear and affect the current process.  If <u>arg</u> is not given, the effect of this command is  to
              modify file descriptors as prescribed by the input/output redirection list.  In this case, any
              file descriptor numbers greater than 2 that are opened with this  mechanism  are  closed  when
              invoking another program.

        <b>exit</b> [ <u>n</u> ]
              Causes  the  shell  to  exit with the exit status specified by <u>n</u>.  The value will be the least
              significant 8 bits of the specified status.  If <u>n</u> is omitted, then the exit status is that  of
              the  last  command  executed.   An  end-of-file will also cause the shell to exit except for a
              shell which has the <b>ignoreeof</b> option (see <b>set</b> below) turned on.

        <b>export</b> [ <b>-p</b> ] [ <u>name</u>[<b>=</b><u>value</u>] ] ...
              If <u>name</u> is not given, the names and values of each variable  with  the  export  attribute  are
              printed  with  the  values  quoted in a manner that allows them to be re-input.  The <b>-p</b> option
              causes the word <b>export</b> to be inserted before each one.  Otherwise, the given <u>name</u>s are  marked
              for automatic export to the <u>environment</u> of subsequently-executed commands.

       <b>false</b>  Does nothing, and exits 1. Used with <b>until</b> for infinite loops.

       <b>fg</b> [ <u>job</u>... ]
              This  command  is  only on systems that support job control.  Each <u>job</u> specified is brought to
              the foreground and waited for in the specified order.  Otherwise, the current job  is  brought
              into the foreground.  See <u>Jobs</u> for a description of the format of <u>job</u>.

       <b>getconf</b> [ <u>name</u> [ <u>pathname</u> ] ]
              Prints  the  current  value  of  the configuration parameter given by <u>name</u>.  The configuration
              parameters are defined by the IEEE POSIX 1003.1 and IEEE POSIX 1003.2 standards.   (See  <a href="../man2/pathconf.2.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/2/pathconf"><u>path</u></a>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">conf(2)&nbsp;pathconf(2)</font>
              <a href="../man2/pathconf.2.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/2/pathconf"><u>conf</u>(2)</a> and <!-- a --><u>sysconf</u>(2)<!-- /a -->.)  The <u>pathname</u> argument is required for parameters whose value depends
              on the location in the file system.  If no arguments are given, <b>getconf</b> prints the  names  and
              values of the current configuration parameters.  The pathname <b>/</b> is used for each of the param-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">eters&nbsp;parameters</font>
              eters that requires <u>pathname</u>.

       <b>getopts</b> [  <b>-a</b> <u>name</u> ] <u>optstring</u> <u>vname</u> [ <u>arg</u> ... ]
              Checks <u>arg</u> for legal options.  If <u>arg</u> is omitted, the  positional  parameters  are  used.   An
              option  argument  begins with a <b>+</b> or a <b>-</b>.  An option not beginning with <b>+</b> or <b>-</b> or the argument
              <b>--</b> ends the options.  Options beginning with <b>+</b> are only recognized when <u>optstring</u> begins  with
              a <b>+</b>.  <u>optstring</u> contains the letters that <b>getopts</b> recognizes.  If a letter is followed by a <b>:</b>,
              that option is expected to have an argument.  The options can be separated from  the  argument
              by  blanks.  The option <b>-?</b>  causes <b>getopts</b> to generate a usage message on standard error.  The
              <b>-a</b> argument can be used to specify the name to use for the usage message,  which  defaults  to

              <b>getopts</b>  places the next option letter it finds inside variable <u>vname</u> each time it is invoked.
              The option letter will be prepended with a <b>+</b> when <u>arg</u> begins with a <b>+</b>.  The index of the  next
              <u>arg</u> is stored in <b>OPTIND</b>.  The option argument, if any, gets stored in <b>OPTARG</b>.
              A  leading  <b>:</b>  in <u>optstring</u> causes <b>getopts</b> to store the letter of an invalid option in <b>OPTARG</b>,
              and to set <u>vname</u> to <b>?</b>  for an unknown option and to <b>:</b> when a required option argument is miss-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing.&nbsp;missing.</font>
              ing.   Otherwise, <b>getopts</b> prints an error message.  The exit status is non-zero when there are
              no more options.
              There is no way to specify any of the options <b>:</b>, <b>+</b>, <b>-</b>, <b>?</b>, <b>[</b>, and <b>]</b>.  The option <b>#</b> can only  be
              specified as the first option.

       <b>hist</b> [ <b>-e</b> <u>ename</u>  ] [ <b>-nlr</b> ] [ <u>first</u> [ <u>last</u> ] ]
       <b>hist</b> <b>-s</b>  [ <u>old</u><b>=</b><u>new</u> ] [ <u>command</u> ]
              In  the  first form, a range of commands from <u>first</u> to <u>last</u> is selected from the last <b>HISTSIZE</b>
              commands that were typed at the terminal.  The arguments <u>first</u> and <u>last</u> may be specified as  a
              number  or  as a string.  A string is used to locate the most recent command starting with the
              given string.  A negative number is used as an offset to the current command number.   If  the
              <b>-l</b> option is selected, the commands are listed on standard output.  Otherwise, the editor pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">gram&nbsp;program</font>
              gram <u>ename</u> is invoked on a file containing these keyboard commands.  If <u>ename</u> is not supplied,
              then the value of the variable <b>HISTEDIT</b> is used.  If <b>HISTEDIT</b> is not set, then <b>FCEDIT</b> (default
              <b>/bin/ed</b>) is used as the editor.  When editing is complete, the edited <!-- a -->command(s)<!-- /a -->  is  executed
              if  the  changes have been saved.  If <u>last</u> is not specified, then it will be set to <u>first</u>.  If
              <u>first</u> is not specified, the default is the previous command for editing and -16  for  listing.
              The  option <b>-r</b> reverses the order of the commands and the option <b>-n</b> suppresses command numbers
              when listing.  In the second form,  <u>command</u>  is  interpreted  as  <u>first</u>  described  above  and
              defaults  to  the last command executed.  The resulting command is executed after the optional
              substitution <u>old</u><b>=</b><u>new</u> is performed.

       <b>jobs</b> [ <b>-lnp</b> ] [ <u>job</u> ... ]
              Lists information about each given job; or all active jobs if <u>job</u> is omitted.  The  <b>-l</b>  option
              lists  process  ids  in  addition to the normal information.  The <b>-n</b> option only displays jobs
              that have stopped or exited since last notified.  The <b>-p</b> option causes only the process  group
              to be listed.  See <u>Jobs</u> for a description of the format of <u>job</u>.

       <b>kill</b> [ <b>-s</b> <u>signame</u> ] <u>job</u> ...
       <b>kill</b> [ <b>-n</b> <u>signum</u> ] <u>job</u> ...

              cesses.  Signals are either given by number with the <b>-n</b> option or by name with the  <b>-s</b>  option
              (as  given  in  <b>&lt;signal.h&gt;</b>,  stripped  of the prefix ``SIG'' with the exception that SIGCLD is
              named CHLD).  For backward compatibility, the <b>n</b> and <b>s</b> can be omitted and the  number  or  name
              placed immediately after the <b>-</b>.  If the signal being sent is TERM (terminate) or HUP (hangup),
              then the job or process will be sent a CONT (continue) signal if it is stopped.  The  argument
              <u>job</u>  can  be  the process id of a process that is not a member of one of the active jobs.  See
              <u>Jobs</u> for a description of the format of <u>job</u>.  In the third form, <b>kill</b> <b>-l</b>, if <u>sig</u> is not speci-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fied,&nbsp;specified,</font>
              fied,  the signal names are listed.  Otherwise, for each <u>sig</u> that is a name, the corresponding
              signal number is listed.  For each <u>sig</u> that is a number, the signal name corresponding to  the
              least significant 8 bits of <u>sig</u> is listed.

       <b>let</b> <u>arg</u> ...
              Each  <u>arg</u>  is  a  separate  <u>arithmetic</u>  <u>expression</u> to be evaluated.  See <u>Arithmetic</u> <u>Evaluation</u>
              above, for a description of arithmetic expression evaluation.
              The exit status is 0 if the value of the last expression is non-zero, and 1 otherwise.

       <b>print</b> [ <b>-Renprs</b> ] [ <b>-u</b> <u>unit</u>] [ <b>-f</b> <u>format</u> ] [ <u>arg</u> ... ]
              With no options or with option <b>-</b> or <b>--</b>, each <u>arg</u> is printed on standard output.  The <b>-f</b> option
              causes  the  arguments  to  be  printed  as described by <b>printf</b>.  In this case, any <b>e</b>, <b>n</b>, <b>r</b>, <b>R</b>
              options are ignored.  Otherwise, unless the <b>-R</b> or <b>-r</b>, are specified, the following escape con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ventions&nbsp;conventions</font>
              ventions will be applied:
              <b>\a</b>     The alert character (ascii <b>07</b>).
              <b>\b</b>     The backspace character (ascii <b>010</b>).
              <b>\c</b>     Causes <b>print</b> to end without processing more arguments and not adding a new-line.
              <b>\f</b>     The formfeed character (ascii <b>014</b>).
              <b>\n</b>     The new-line character (ascii <b>012</b>).
              <b>\r</b>     The carriage return character (ascii <b>015</b>).
              <b>\t</b>     The tab character (ascii <b>011</b>).
              <b>\v</b>     The vertical tab character (ascii <b>013</b>).
              <b>\E</b>     The escape character (ascii <b>033</b>).
              <b>\\</b>     The backslash character \.
              <b>\0</b><u>x</u>    The character defined by the 1, 2, or 3-digit octal string given by <u>x</u>.

              The  <b>-R</b>  option  will print all subsequent arguments and options other than <b>-n</b>.  The <b>-e</b> causes
              the above escape conventions to be applied This is the  default  behavior.   It  reverses  the
              effect  of  an  earlier <b>-r</b>.  The <b>-p</b> option causes the arguments to be written onto the pipe of
              the process spawned with <b>|&amp;</b> instead of standard output.  The <b>-s</b> option causes the arguments to
              be  written  onto  the  history file instead of standard output.  The <b>-u</b> option can be used to
              specify a one digit file descriptor unit number <u>unit</u> on which the output will be placed.   The
              default is 1.  If the option <b>-n</b> is used, no <b>new-line</b> is added to the output.

       <b>printf</b> <u>format</u> [ <u>arg</u> ... ]
              The  arguments  <u>arg</u>  are  printed  on standard output in accordance with the ANSI-C formatting
              rules associated with the format string <u>format</u>.  If the number of arguments exceeds the number
              of format specifications, the <b>format</b> string is reused to format remaining arguments.  The fol-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lowing&nbsp;following</font>
              lowing extensions can also be used: A <b>%b</b> format can be used instead  of  <b>%s</b>  to  cause  escape
              sequences  in  the corresponding <u>arg</u> to be expanded as described in <b>print.</b>  A <b>%B</b> option causes
              each of the arguments to be treated as variable names and the binary value of variable will be
              printed.   This  is  most useful for variables whose attribute is <b>-b</b>.  A <b>%H</b> format can be used
              instead of <b>%s</b> to cause characters in <u>arg</u> that are special in HTML and XML to be output  to  be
              output  as their entity name.  A <b>%P</b> format can be used instead of <b>%s</b> to cause <u>arg</u> to be inter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">preted&nbsp;interpreted</font>
              preted as an extended regular expression and be printed as a shell pattern.  A <b>%R</b>  format  can
              be  used  instead  of  <b>%s</b>  to cause <u>arg</u> interpreted as a shell pattern and to be printed as an
              extended regular expression.  A <b>%q</b> format can be used instead of <b>%s</b>  to  cause  the  resulting
              string  to  be  quoted in a manner than can be reinput to the shell.  A <b>%(</b><u>date-format</u><b>)T</b> format
              can be use to treat an argument as a date/time string and to format the date/time according to
              the  <u>date-format</u>  as  defined  for  the <a href="date.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/date"><b>date</b>(1)</a> command.  A <b>%Z</b> format will output a byte whose
              value is 0.  The precision field of the <b>%d</b> format can be followed by a <b>.</b>  and the output base.
              In this case, the <b>#</b> flag character caues <u>base</u><b>#</b> to be prepended.  The <b>#</b> flag when used with the
              <b>d</b> specifier without an output base, causes the output to be displayed in thousands units  with
              one  of the suffixes <b>k</b> <b>M</b> <b>G</b> <b>T</b> <b>P</b> <b>E</b> to indicate the unit.  The <b>#</b> flag when used with the <b>i</b> speci-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fier&nbsp;specifier</font>
              fier causes the output to be displayed in 1024 with one of the suffixes <b>Ki</b> <b>Mi</b> <b>Gi</b> <b>Ti</b> <b>Pi</b>  <b>Ei</b>  to
              indicate  the unit.  The <b>=</b> flag has been added to center the output within the specified field
              width.

       <b>pwd</b> [ <b>-LP</b> ]
              Outputs the value of the current working directory.  The <b>-L</b> option is the default;  it  prints
              the  logical name of the current directory.  If the <b>-P</b> option is given, all symbolic links are
              resolved from the name.  The last instance of <b>-L</b> or <b>-P</b> on the command  line  determines  which
              method is used.

       <b>read</b>  [ <b>-Aprs</b> ] [ <b>-d</b> <u>delim</u>] [ <b>-n</b> <u>n</u>] [ [ <b>-N</b> <u>n</u>] [ [ <b>-t</b> <u>timeout</u>] [ <b>-u</b> <u>unit</u>] [ <u>vname</u><b>?</b><u>prompt</u> ] [ <u>vname</u> ...
       ]
              The shell input mechanism.  One line is read and is broken up into fields using the characters
              in <b>IFS</b> as separators.  The escape character, <b>\</b>, is used to remove any special meaning for  the
              next  character  and  for line continuation.  The <b>-d</b> option causes the read to continue to the
              first character of <u>delim</u> rather than new-line.  The <b>-n</b> option causes at most <u>n</u> bytes  to  read
              rather  a  full line but will return when reading from a slow device as soon as any characters
              have been read.  The <b>-N</b> option causes exactly <u>n</u> to be read  unless  an  end-of-file  has  been
              encountered  or the read times out because of the <b>-t</b> option.  In raw mode, <b>-r,</b> the <b>\</b> character
              is not treated specially.  The first field is assigned to the first <u>vname</u>, the second field to
              the  second  <u>vname</u>, etc., with leftover fields assigned to the last <u>vname</u>.  When <u>vname</u> has the
              binary attribute and <b>-n</b> or <b>-N</b> is specified, the bytes that are read are stored  directly  into
              the  variable.   If  the  <b>-v</b> is specified, then the value of the first <u>vname</u> will be used as a
              default value when reading from a terminal device.  The <b>-A</b> option causes the variable <u>vname</u> to
              be  unset and each field that is read to be stored in successive elements of the indexed array
              <u>vname.</u>  The <b>-p</b> option causes the input line to be taken from  the  input  pipe  of  a  process
              spawned by the shell using <b>|&amp;</b>.  If the <b>-s</b> option is present, the input will be saved as a com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
              mand in the history file.  The option <b>-u</b> can be used to specify a one  digit  file  descriptor
              unit <u>unit</u> to read from.  The file descriptor can be opened with the <b>exec</b> special built-in com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand.&nbsp;command.</font>
              mand.  The default value of unit <u>n</u> is 0.  The option <b>-t</b> is used to specify a timeout  in  sec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">onds&nbsp;seconds</font>
              onds  when  reading  from  a terminal or pipe.  If <u>vname</u> is omitted, then <b>REPLY</b> is used as the
              default <u>vname</u>.  An end-of-file with the <b>-p</b> option causes cleanup  for  this  process  so  that
              another  can  be  spawned.   If the first argument contains a <b>?</b>, the remainder of this word is
              used as a <u>prompt</u> on standard error when the shell is interactive.  The exit status is 0 unless
              an end-of-file is encountered or <b>read</b> has timed out.

        <b>readonly</b> [ <b>-p</b> ] [ <u>vname</u>[<b>=</b><u>value</u>] ] ...
              If  <u>vname</u>  is  not given, the names and values of each variable with the readonly attribute is
              printed with the values quoted in a manner that allows them to be re-inputted.  The <b>-p</b>  option
              causes  the  word  <b>readonly</b>  to  be inserted before each one.  Otherwise, the given <u>vname</u>s are
              marked readonly and these names cannot be changed by subsequent assignment.

        <b>return</b> [ <u>n</u> ]
              Causes a shell <u>function</u> or <b>.</b>  script to return to the invoking script  with  the  exit  status
              specified by <u>n</u>.  The value will be the least significant 8 bits of the specified status.  If <u>n</u>
              is omitted, then the return status is that of the last command executed.  If <b>return</b> is invoked
              while not in a <u>function</u> or a <b>.</b>  script, then it behaves the same as <b>exit</b>.

        <b>set</b> [ <b>+-CGabefhkmnoprstuvx</b> ] [ <b>+-o</b> [ <u>option</u> ] ] ... [ <b>+-A</b> <u>vname</u> ]  [ <u>arg</u> ... ]
              The options for this command have meaning as follows:
              <b>-A</b>      Array  assignment.   Unset  the variable <u>vname</u> and assign values sequentially from the
                      <u>arg</u> list.  If <b>+A</b> is used, the variable <u>vname</u> is not unset first.
              <b>-B</b>      Enable brace pattern field generation.  This is the default behavior.
              <b>-C</b>      Prevents redirection <b>&gt;</b> from truncating existing files.  Files  that  are  created  are
                      opened with the O_EXCL mode.  Requires <b>&gt;|</b> to truncate a file when turned on.
              <b>-G</b>      Causes  the  pattern <b>**</b> by itself to match files and zero or more directories and sub-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">directories&nbsp;subdirectories</font>
                      directories when used for file name generation.  If followed by a <b>/</b>  only  directories
                      and sub-directories are matched.
              <b>-a</b>      All subsequent variables that are defined are automatically exported.
              <b>-b</b>      Prints  job  completion messages as soon as a background job changes state rather than
                      waiting for the next prompt.
              <b>-e</b>      If a command has a non-zero exit status, execute the <b>ERR</b> trap, if set, and exit.  This
                      mode is disabled while reading profiles.
              <b>-f</b>      Disables file name generation.
              <b>-h</b>      Each command becomes a tracked alias when first encountered.
              <b>-k</b>      (Obsolete). All variable assignment arguments are placed in the environment for a com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand,&nbsp;command,</font>
                      mand, not just those that precede the command name.
              <b>-m</b>      Background jobs will run in a separate process group and a line will print  upon  com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pletion.&nbsp;completion.</font>
                      pletion.   The exit status of background jobs is reported in a completion message.  On
                      systems with job control, this option  is  turned  on  automatically  for  interactive
                      shells.
              <b>-n</b>      Read  commands and check them for syntax errors, but do not execute them.  Ignored for
                      interactive shells.
              <b>-o</b>      The following argument can be one of the following option names:

                      If no option name is supplied, then the current option settings are printed.
              <b>-p</b>      Disables  processing  of  the  <b>$HOME/.profile</b> file and uses the file <b>/etc/suid_profile</b>
                      instead of the <b>ENV</b> file.  This mode is on whenever the  effective  uid  (gid)  is  not
                      equal  to the real uid (gid).  Turning this off causes the effective uid and gid to be
                      set to the real uid and gid.
              <b>-r</b>      Enables the restricted shell.  This option cannot be unset once set.
              <b>-s</b>      Sort the positional parameters lexicographically.
              <b>-t</b>      (Obsolete).  Exit after reading and executing one command.

                      If no arguments follow this option then the positional parameters are unset.

              As  an  obsolete  feature, if the first <u>arg</u> is <b>-</b> then the <b>-x</b> and <b>-v</b> options are turned off and
              the next <u>arg</u> is treated as the first argument.  Using <b>+</b> rather than <b>-</b> causes these options  to
              be  turned off.  These options can also be used upon invocation of the shell.  The current set
              of options may be found in <b>$-</b>.  Unless <b>-A</b> is specified, the remaining arguments are positional
              parameters  and  are  assigned,  in  order, to <b>$1</b> <b>$2</b> ....  If no arguments are given, then the
              names and values of all variables are printed on the standard output.

        <b>trap</b> [ <b>-p</b> ] [ <u>action</u> ] [ <u>sig</u> ] ...
              The  <b>-p</b>  option causes the trap action associated with each trap as specified by the arguments
              to be printed with appropriate quoting.  Otherwise, <u>action</u> will be processed as if it were  an
              argument  to <b>eval</b> when the shell receives <!-- a -->signal(s)<!-- /a --> <u>sig</u>.  Each <u>sig</u> can be given as a number or
              as the name of the signal.  Trap commands are executed in order of signal number.  Any attempt
              to  set  a trap on a signal that was ignored on entry to the current shell is ineffective.  If
              <u>action</u> is omitted and the first <u>sig</u> is a number, or if <u>action</u> is <b>-</b>, then the <!-- a -->trap(s)<!-- /a --> for  each
              <u>sig</u>  are  reset  to  their  original values.  If <u>action</u> is the null string then this signal is
              ignored by the shell and by the commands it invokes.  If <u>sig</u> is <b>ERR</b> then <u>action</u> will  be  exe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cuted&nbsp;executed</font>
              cuted whenever a command has a non-zero exit status.  If <u>sig</u> is <b>DEBUG</b> then <u>action</u> will be exe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cuted&nbsp;executed</font>
              cuted before each command.  The variable <b>.sh.command</b> will contain the contents of the  current
              command  line  when <u>action</u> is running.  If <u>sig</u> is <b>0</b> or <b>EXIT</b> and the <b>trap</b> statement is executed
              inside the body of a function defined with the <b>function</b> <u>name</u> syntax, then the  command  <u>action</u>
              is  executed  after  the  function  completes.  If <u>sig</u> is <b>0</b> or <b>EXIT</b> for a <b>trap</b> set outside any
              function then the command <u>action</u> is executed on exit from the shell.  If <u>sig</u>  is  <b>KEYBD</b>,  then
              <u>action</u>  will  be  executed whenever a key is read while in <b>emacs</b>, <b>gmacs</b>, or <b>vi</b> mode.  The <b>trap</b>
              command with no arguments prints a list of commands associated with each signal number.

       <b>true</b>   Does nothing, and exits 0. Used with <b>while</b> for infinite loops.

        <b>typeset</b> [ <b>+-AHflabnprtux</b> ] [ <b>+-EFLRZi[</b><u>n</u><b>]</b> <b>]</b>  <b>[</b> <u>vname</u><b>[=</b><u>value</u> <b>]</b>  <b>]</b> <b>...</b>
              Sets attributes and values for shell variables and functions.  When invoked inside a  function
              defined  with  the  <b>function</b> <u>name</u> syntax, a new instance of the variable <u>vname</u> is created, and
              the variable's value and type are restored when the function completes.  The following list of
              attributes may be specified:
              <b>-A</b>     Declares  <u>vname</u>  to be an associative array.  Subscripts are strings rather than arith-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">metic&nbsp;arithmetic</font>
                     metic expressions.
              <b>-a</b>     Declares <u>vname</u> to be an indexed array.  This is optional  unless  except  for  compound
                     variable assignments.
              <b>-E</b>     Declares  <u>vname</u>  to  be a double precision floating point number.  If <u>n</u> is non-zero, it
                     defines the number of significant figures that are used when expanding  <u>vname</u>.   Other-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">wise,&nbsp;Otherwise,</font>
                     wise, ten significant figures will be used.
              <b>-F</b>     Declares  <u>vname</u>  to  be a double precision floating point number.  If <u>n</u> is non-zero, it
                     defines the number of places after the decimal  point  that  are  used  when  expanding
                     <u>vname</u>.  Otherwise ten places after the decimal point will be used.
              <b>-H</b>     This option provides UNIX to host-name file mapping on non-UNIX machines.
              <b>-L</b>     Left  justify  and  remove leading blanks from <u>value</u>.  If <u>n</u> is non-zero, it defines the
                     width of the field, otherwise it is determined by the  width  of  the  value  of  first
                     assignment.  When the variable is assigned to, it is filled on the right with blanks or
                     truncated, if necessary, to fit into the field.  The <b>-R</b> option is turned off.
              <b>-R</b>     Right justify and fill with leading blanks.  If <u>n</u> is non-zero, it defines the width  of
                     the  field,  otherwise  it is determined by the width of the value of first assignment.
                     The field is left filled with blanks or truncated from the end if the variable is reas-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">signed.&nbsp;reassigned.</font>
                     signed.  The <b>-L</b> option is turned off.
              <b>-Z</b>     Right  justify  and fill with leading zeros if the first non-blank character is a digit
                     and the <b>-L</b> option has not been set.  Remove leading zeros if the <b>-L</b> option is also set.
                     If  <u>n</u> is non-zero, it defines the width of the field, otherwise it is determined by the
                     width of the value of first assignment.
              <b>-f</b>     The names refer to function names rather than variable names.  No  assignments  can  be
                     made and the only other valid options are <b>-t</b>, <b>-u</b> and <b>-x</b>.  The <b>-t</b> option turns on execu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;execution</font>
                     tion tracing for this function.  The <b>-u</b> option causes this function to be marked  unde-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fined.&nbsp;undefined.</font>
                     fined.   The  <b>FPATH</b>  variable will be searched to find the function definition when the
                     function is referenced.  If no options other than <b>-f</b> is specified,  then  the  function
                     definition  will be displayed on standard output.  If <b>+f</b> is specified, then a line con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">taining&nbsp;containing</font>
                     taining the function name followed by a shell comment containing the  line  number  and
                     path name of the file where this function was defined, if any, is displayed.
              <b>-b</b>     The  variable  can  hold  any number of bytes of data.  The data can be text or binary.
                     The value is represented by the base64 encoding of the data.  If <b>-Z</b> is also  specified,
                     the  size  in bytes of the data in the buffer will be determined by the size associated
                     with the <b>-Z</b>.  If the base64 string assigned results in more data, it will be truncated.
                     Otherwise,  it will be filled with bytes whose value is zero.  The <b>printf</b> format <b>%B</b> can
                     be used to output the actual data in this buffer instead of the base64 encoding of  the
                     data.
              <b>-i</b>     Declares  <u>vname</u>  to  be  represented  internally as integer.  The right hand side of an
                     assignment is evaluated as an arithmetic expression when assigning to an integer.  If <u>n</u>
                     is  non-zero,  it defines the output arithmetic base, otherwise the output base will be
                     ten.
              <b>-l</b>     All upper-case characters are converted to lower-case.  The upper-case option,  <b>-u</b>,  is
                     turned off.
              <b>-n</b>     Declares  <u>vname</u> to be a reference to the variable whose name is defined by the value of
                     variable <u>vname</u>.  This is usually used to reference a variable inside a  function  whose
                     name has been passed as an argument.
              <b>-r</b>     The  given  <u>vname</u>s  are marked readonly and these names cannot be changed by subsequent
                     assignment.
              <b>-t</b>     Tags the variables.  Tags are user definable and have no special meaning to the  shell.
              <b>-u</b>     All  lower-case  characters are converted to upper-case.  The lower-case option, <b>-l</b>, is
                     turned off.
              <b>-x</b>     The given <u>vname</u>s are marked for automatic export to the  <u>environment</u>  of  subsequently-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">executed&nbsp;subsequentlyexecuted</font>
                     executed commands.  Variables whose names contain a <b>.</b>  cannot be exported.

              The <b>-i</b> attribute cannot be specified along with <b>-R</b>, <b>-L</b>, <b>-Z</b>, or <b>-f</b>.

              Using <b>+</b> rather than <b>-</b> causes these options to be turned off.  If no <u>vname</u> arguments are given,
              a list of <u>vnames</u> (and optionally the <u>values</u>) of the <u>variables</u> is  printed.   (Using  <b>+</b>  rather
              than  <b>-</b>  keeps  the  values from being printed.)  The <b>-p</b> option causes <b>typeset</b> followed by the
              option letters to be printed before each name rather than the names of the  options.   If  any
              option  other  than  <b>-p</b> is given, only those variables which have all of the given options are
              printed.  Otherwise, the <u>vname</u>s and <u>attributes</u> of  all  <u>variables</u>  that  have  attributes  are
              printed.

       <b>ulimit</b> [ <b>-HSacdfmnpstv</b> ] [ <u>limit</u> ]
              Set  or  display a resource limit.  The available resource limits are listed below.  Many sys-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tems&nbsp;systems</font>
              tems do not support one or more of these limits.  The limit for a specified  resource  is  set
              when  <u>limit</u> is specified.  The value of <u>limit</u> can be a number in the unit specified below with
              each resource, or the value <b>unlimited</b>.  The <b>-H</b> and <b>-S</b> options specify whether the  hard  limit
              or  the soft limit for the given resource is set.  A hard limit cannot be increased once it is
              set.  A soft limit can be increased up to the value of the hard limit.  If neither the <b>H</b> nor <b>S</b>
              options  is  specified, the limit applies to both.  The current resource limit is printed when
              <u>limit</u> is omitted.  In this case, the soft limit is printed unless <b>H</b> is specified.   When  more
              than one resource is specified, then the limit name and unit is printed before the value.
              <b>-a</b>     Lists all of the current resource limits.
              <b>-c</b>     The number of 512-byte blocks on the size of core dumps.
              <b>-d</b>     The number of K-bytes on the size of the data area.
              <b>-f</b>     The number of 512-byte blocks on files that can be written by the current process or by
                     child processes (files of any size may be read).
              <b>-m</b>     The number of K-bytes on the size of physical memory.
              <b>-n</b>     The number of file descriptors plus 1.
              <b>-p</b>     The number of 512-byte blocks for pipe buffering.
              <b>-s</b>     The number of K-bytes on the size of the stack area.
              <b>-t</b>     The number of CPU seconds to be used by each process.
              <b>-v</b>     The number of K-bytes for virtual memory.

              If no option is given, <b>-f</b> is assumed.

       <b>umask</b> [ <b>-S</b> ] [ <u>mask</u> ]
              The user file-creation mask is set to <u>mask</u> (see <a href="../man2/umask.2.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/2/umask"><u>umask</u>(2)</a>).  <u>mask</u> can either be an octal number
              or  a  symbolic  value  as described in <a href="chmod.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/chmod"><u>chmod</u>(1)</a>.  If a symbolic value is given, the new umask
              value is the complement of the result of applying <u>mask</u> to the complement of the previous umask
              value.   If  <u>mask</u>  is omitted, the current value of the mask is printed.  The <b>-S</b> option causes
              the mode to be printed as a symbolic value.  Otherwise, the mask is printed in octal.

        <b>unalias</b> [ <b>-a</b> ] <u>name</u> ...
              The aliases given by the list of <u>name</u>s are removed from the alias list.  The <b>-a</b> option  causes
              all the aliases to be unset.

       <b>unset</b> [ <b>-fnv</b> ] <u>vname</u> ...
              The  variables  given  by the list of <u>vname</u>s are unassigned, i.e., their values and attributes
              are erased.  Readonly variables cannot be unset.  If the <b>-f</b> option  is  set,  then  the  names
              refer  to  <u>function</u>  names.   If the <b>-v</b> option is set, then the names refer to <u>variable</u> names.
              The <b>-f</b> option overrides <b>-v</b>.  If <b>-n</b> is set and <u>name</u> is a name  reference,  then  <u>name</u>  will  be
              unset  rather  than the variable that it references.  The default is equivalent to <b>-v</b>.  Unset-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ting&nbsp;Unsetting</font>
              ting <b>LINENO</b>, <b>MAILCHECK</b>, <b>OPTARG</b>, <b>OPTIND</b>, <b>RANDOM</b>, <b>SECONDS</b>, <b>TMOUT</b>, and <b>_</b>  removes  their  special
              meaning even if they are subsequently assigned to.

       <b>wait</b> [ <u>job</u> ... ]
              Wait  for  the specified <u>job</u> and report its termination status.  If <u>job</u> is not given, then all
              currently active child processes are waited for.  The exit status from this command is that of
              the  last  process  waited  for  if  <u>job</u>  is  specified; otherwise it is zero.  See <u>Jobs</u> for a
              description of the format of <u>job</u>.

       <b>whence</b> [ <b>-afpv</b> ] <u>name</u> ...
              For each <u>name</u>, indicate how it would be interpreted if used as a command name.
              The <b>-v</b> option produces a more verbose report.  The <b>-f</b> options skips the search for  functions.
              The  <b>-p</b> option does a path search for <u>name</u> even if name is an alias, a function, or a reserved
              word.  The <b>-p</b> option turns off the <b>-v</b> option.  The <b>-a</b> option is similar to the <b>-v</b>  option  but
              causes all interpretations of the given name to be reported.

   <b>Invocation.</b>
       If  the  shell  is  invoked  by <!-- a --><u>exec</u>(2)<!-- /a -->, and the first character of argument zero (<b>$0</b>) is <b>-</b>, then the
       shell is assumed to be a <u>login</u> shell and commands are read from <b>/etc/profile</b>  and  then  from  either
       <b>.profile</b>  in  the  current directory or <b>$HOME/.profile</b>, if either file exists.  Next, for interactive
       shells, commands are read from the file named by performing parameter  expansion,  command  substitu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion,&nbsp;substitution,</font>
       tion,  and  arithmetic  substitution on the value of the environment variable <b>ENV</b> if the file exists.
       If the <b>-s</b> option is not present and <u>arg</u> and a file by the name of <u>arg</u> exits, then it reads  and  exe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cutes&nbsp;executes</font>
       cutes  this  script.  Otherwise, if the first <u>arg</u> does not contain a <b>/</b>, a path search is performed on
       the first <u>arg</u> to determine the name of the script to execute.  The script <u>arg</u> must have execute  per-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mission&nbsp;permission</font>
       mission  and any <u>setuid</u> and <u>setgid</u> settings will be ignored.  If the script is not found on the path,
       <u>arg</u> is processed as if it named a built-in command or function.  Commands are then read as  described
       below; the following options are interpreted by the shell when it is invoked:

       <b>-c</b>        If  the  <b>-c</b>  option  is  present, then commands are read from the first <u>arg</u>.  Any remaining
                 arguments become positional parameters starting at <b>0</b>.
       <b>-s</b>        If the <b>-s</b> option is present or if no arguments remain, then  commands  are  read  from  the
                 standard  input.  Shell output, except for the output of the <u>Special</u> <u>Commands</u> listed above,
                 is written to file descriptor 2.
       <b>-i</b>        If the <b>-i</b> option is present or if the shell input and output are attached to a terminal (as
                 told  by  <!-- a --><u>tcgetattr</u>(2)<!-- /a -->),  then this shell is <u>interactive</u>.  In this case TERM is ignored (so
                 that <b>kill</b> <b>0</b> does not kill an interactive shell) and INTR is caught  and  ignored  (so  that
                 <b>wait</b> is interruptible).  In all cases, QUIT is ignored by the shell.
       <b>-r</b>        If the <b>-r</b> option is present, the shell is a restricted shell.
       <b>-D</b>        A  list  of  all double quoted strings that are preceded by a <b>$</b> will be printed on standard
                 output and the shell will exit.  This set of strings will be subject to  language  transla-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;translation</font>
                 tion when the locale is not C or POSIX.  No commands will be executed.

       <b>-P</b>        If <b>-P</b> or <b>-o</b> <b>profile</b> is present, the shell is a profile shell (see <!-- a --><u>pfexec</u>(1)<!-- /a -->).

       <b>-R</b> <u>filename</u>
                 The <b>-R</b> <u>filename</u> option is used to generate a cross reference database that can be used by a
                 separate utility to find definitions and references for variables and commands.

       The remaining options and arguments are described under the <b>set</b> command above.  An optional <b>-</b> as  the
       first argument is ignored.

   <b>Rksh</b> <b>Only.</b>
       <u>Rksh</u>  is used to set up login names and execution environments whose capabilities are more controlled
       than those of the standard shell.  The actions of <b>rksh</b> are identical to those of <b>ksh</b>, except that the
       following are disallowed:
              Unsetting the restricted option.
              changing directory (see <a href="cd.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/cd"><u>cd</u>(1)</a>),
              setting or unsetting the value or attributes of <b>SHELL</b>, <b>ENV</b>, <b>FPATH</b>, or <b>PATH,</b>
              specifying path or command names containing <b>/</b>,
              redirecting output (<b>&gt;</b>, <b>&gt;|</b>, <b>&lt;&gt;</b>, and <b>&gt;&gt;</b>).
              adding or deleting built-in commands.
              using <b>command</b> <b>-p</b> to invoke a command.

       The restrictions above are enforced after <b>.profile</b> and the <b>ENV</b> files are interpreted.

       When  a  command  to  be  executed  is found to be a shell procedure, <b>rksh</b> invokes <u>ksh</u> to execute it.
       Thus, it is possible to provide to the end-user shell procedures that have access to the  full  power
       of  the  standard shell, while imposing a limited menu of commands; this scheme assumes that the end-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">user&nbsp;enduser</font>
       user does not have write and execute permissions in the same directory.

       The net effect of these rules is that the writer of the  <b>.profile</b>  has  complete  control  over  user
       actions,  by  performing  guaranteed  setup  actions and leaving the user in an appropriate directory
       (probably <u>not</u> the login directory).

       The system administrator often sets up a directory of commands (e.g., <b>/usr/rbin</b>) that can  be  safely
       invoked by <b>rksh</b>.

<b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b>
       Errors  detected  by the shell, such as syntax errors, cause the shell to return a non-zero exit sta-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tus.&nbsp;status.</font>
       tus.  If the shell is being used non-interactively, then execution of the  shell  file  is  abandoned
       unless  the  error  occurs inside a subshell in which case the subshell is abandoned.  Otherwise, the
       shell returns the exit status of the last command executed (see also the <b>exit</b>  command  above).   Run
       time errors detected by the shell are reported by printing the command or function name and the error
       condition.  If the line number that the error occurred on is greater than one, then the  line  number
       is also printed in square brackets (<b>[]</b>) after the command or function name.

<b>FILES</b>
       /etc/profile The system wide initialization file, executed for login shells.
       $HOME/<b>.</b>profile
              The personal initialization file, executed for login shells after /etc/profile.
       $HOME/<b>.</b>.kshrc
              Default personal initialization file, executed for interactive shells when <b>ENV</b> is not set.
       /etc/suid_profile
              Alternative  initialization  file,  executed when instead of personal initialization file when
              the real and effective user or group id do not match.
       /dev/null
              NULL device

<b>CAVEATS</b>
       If a command is executed, and then a command with the same name is installed in a  directory  in  the
       search  path  before  the  directory where the original command was found, the shell will continue to
       <u>exec</u> the original command.  Use the <b>-t</b> option of the <b>alias</b> command to correct this situation.

       Some very old shell scripts contain a <b>^</b> as a synonym for the pipe character <b>|</b>.

       Using the <b>hist</b> built-in command within a compound command will cause the whole command  to  disappear
       from the history file.

       The  built-in command <b>.</b> <u>file</u> reads the whole file before any commands are executed.  Therefore, <b>alias</b>
       and <b>unalias</b> commands in the file will not apply to any commands defined in the file.

       Traps are not processed while a job is waiting for a foreground process.  Thus, a trap on <b>CHLD</b>  won't
       be executed until the foreground job terminates.

       It  is a good idea to leave a space after the comma operator in arithmetic expressions to prevent the
       comma from being interpreted as the decimal point character in certain locales.
