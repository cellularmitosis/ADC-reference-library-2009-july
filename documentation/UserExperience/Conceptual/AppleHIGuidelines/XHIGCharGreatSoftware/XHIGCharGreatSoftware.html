<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-TPXREF110" title="High Performance"></a><h2>High Performance</h2><p>Performance<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_26"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_27"></a> is the perceived measure of how fast or efficient your software is and it is critical to the success of all software. If your software seems slow, users may be less inclined to buy it. Even software that uses the most optimal algorithms may seem slow if it spends more time processing data than responding to the user. </p><p>Developers who have experience programming on other platforms (including Mac OS 9) should take the time to learn about the factors that influence performance<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_28"></a> on Mac OS X. Understanding these factors can help you make better choices in your design and implementation. For an overview of performance factors and links to information on how to identify problems, see <em><a href="../../../../Performance/Conceptual/PerformanceOverview/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001410" target="_top">Performance Overview</a></em>. </p><p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_29"></a>Here are some performance-related guidelines to keep in mind:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Use metrics<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_30"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_31"></a> to identify performance problems. Never try to tune the performance of your software based on assumptions. Use the Apple-provided tools, such as Shark, to gather data about where your software is performing poorly. Use that data to isolate problems and fix them. You might also want to create your own tools to gather metrics that are specific to your software.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Avoid waiting until the end of your development cycle to do performance<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_32"></a> tuning. Include specific goals in your product requirements. Gather baseline metrics early and continue gathering metrics during development to measure progress against those goals. If you see performance degrading, take immediate corrective actions to fix the problem.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Choose modern APIs over legacy APIs. Modern interfaces are built for Mac OS X and take advantage of the latest technology and design information to deliver the best possible performance.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Choose appropriate technologies for the task at hand. For example, Cocoa distributed objects may be easier to use, but if your program needs maximum performance over the network, CFNetwork or BSD sockets may be a better choice. See <em><a href="../../../../Networking/Conceptual/CFNetwork/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001132" target="_top">CFNetwork Programming Guide</a></em>for more information.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Use threads to improve the responsiveness of your code. Taking advantage of the parallelism offered by threads can offer significant performance advantages, especially on multiprocessor systems. Technical Note TN2028, “<span class="content_text"><a href="../../../../../technotes/tn/tn2028.html" target="_top">Threading Architectures</a></span>” includes an excellent overview of threading architectures. See <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGMOSXEnvironment/XHIGMOSXEnvironment.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002721-BAJBJEJI">“Threads”</a></span> for more information.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Avoid polling<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_33"></a> the system for information. Polling wastes a significant amount of CPU time and is unnecessary with most modern APIs. Most modern APIs provide asynchronous callback mechanisms to notify you when conditions change or requested data is available. Use these mechanisms instead.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Eliminate any unnecessary I/O operations<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_34"></a>. Accessing a hard drive or optical drive is one of the slowest operations you can perform on any computer. Minimizing these operations can improve performance tremendously. See <em><a href="../../../../Performance/Conceptual/FileSystem/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000161i" target="_top">File-System Performance Guidelines</a></em> for more information.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Optimize your memory<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_35"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_36"></a> usage to take advantage of the Mac OS X virtual memory system. Understanding how virtual memory works in Mac OS X can help you make more efficient use of memory. See <em><a href="../../../../Performance/Conceptual/ManagingMemory/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000160i" target="_top">Memory Usage Performance Guidelines</a></em> for information about the Mac OS X virtual memory system.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Avoid loading resources until they are actually needed by your software. Loading resources early wastes memory and can trigger paging before the resource is ever used. Wait until you need the resource and then cache it as appropriate. </p></li><li class="li"><p>Use the Mach-O executable format<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_37"></a>. Mach-O is the native executable format of Mac OS X and is used by all system frameworks. Using the legacy Code Fragment Manager<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_38"></a> (CFM) executable format requires additional bridging<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_39"></a> code between your code and system libraries. This bridging incurs a small performance penalty that can add up over time. <a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_40"></a></p></li></ul><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-TPXREF105" title="Ease of Use"></a><h2>Ease of Use</h2><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_41"></a><p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_42"></a>An easy-to-use<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_43"></a> program offers a compelling, intuitive experience for the user. It offers elegant solutions to complex problems and has a well thought out interface that uses familiar paradigms. It is easy to install and configure because it makes intelligent choices for the user, but it also gives the user the option to override those choices when needed. It presents the user with tools that are relevant in the current context, eliminating or disabling irrelevant tools. It also warns the user against performing dangerous actions and provides ways to undo those actions if taken.</p><p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_44"></a>Here are some guidelines to keep in mind when designing for ease of use:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>In your user interface, use metaphors<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_45"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_46"></a> that represent concrete, familiar ideas. Make your metaphors obvious so that users can more easily apply a set of expectations to the computer environment. For example, Mac OS X uses the metaphor of file folders for storing documents. For more information, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGHIDesign/XHIGHIDesign.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-BABFCAJF">“Metaphors.”</a></span></p></li><li class="li"><p>Focus on solutions, not features. Avoid adding features solely for competitive reasons. Make sure every feature offers real benefit to your users. See <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGDesignProcess/XHIGDesignProcess.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002718-BCICFCHI">“Making Design Decisions”</a></span> for additional information.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Make sure your packaging<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_47"></a> clearly indicates the system requirements and contains everything the user needs to get started immediately. See <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGInstallationsUpdates/XHIGInstallationsUpdates.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002722-CHDBJHEA">“Packaging”</a></span> for more information.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Establish intelligent default settings<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_48"></a> for your program. Avoid requiring a lengthy configuration<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_49"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_50"></a> process. Consider providing a setup assistant if you need information from the user (see <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGInstallationsUpdates/XHIGInstallationsUpdates.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002722-TPXREF23">“Setup Assistants”</a></span> for more information). Provide your users with appropriate initial settings and give them the option to change those settings using preferences<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_51"></a> or options panels. </p></li><li class="li"><p>Try not to overwhelm users by presenting too much information at once. Use progressive disclosure<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_52"></a> to reveal information as it is needed and give users the option to hide information they don’t consider useful. See <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGHIDesign/XHIGHIDesign.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-CJBHHAJE">“Managing Complexity in Your Software”</a></span> for additional information.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Bundle your application. Application bundles<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_53"></a> are the preferred mechanism for software distribution. They simplify installation and are easy to move around in the Finder. See <em><a href="../../../../CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFBundles/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000123i" target="_top">Bundle Programming Guide</a></em> for guidelines on how to support bundles.</p></li><li class="li"><p>If you are a hardware developer, support published standards<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_54"></a> for plug-and-play hardware. Mac OS X supports many published hardware standards for USB and FireWire devices such as mice, keyboards, and hard drives. If you follow these standards, new devices should “just work” when plugged into the computer and not require custom device drivers. See <em><a href="../../../../DeviceDrivers/Conceptual/IOKitFundamentals/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP0000011" target="_top">I/O Kit Fundamentals</a></em> for information on built-in driver support.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Avoid the assumption<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_55"></a> that a single user is logged in and that the current user has access to the console. Fast user switching means that multiple instances of your application could be running simultaneously. Your application should be ready to handle this situation appropriately. See <em><a href="../../../../MacOSX/Conceptual/BPMultipleUsers/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000180i" target="_top">Multiple User Environments</a></em> for information on how to operate safely when fast user switching is enabled.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Provide useful error messages<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_56"></a> to users when something does go wrong. An error message should clearly convey what happened, why it happened, and the options for proceeding. Offer a workaround if one is available and do whatever you can to prevent the user from losing any data. See <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGWindows/XHIGWindows.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-TP10">“Alerts”</a></span> for more information on how to provide useful error messages.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Use display names<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_57"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_58"></a> in your user interface in place of raw pathnames<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_59"></a> and filenames<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_60"></a>. Display names take into account the user’s established language preferences and filename extension preferences. See <em><a href="../../../../MacOSX/Conceptual/BPFileSystem/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000185i" target="_top">File System Overview</a></em> for more information on display names and guidelines on how to support them.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Let users explore the features of your application without causing irreversible damage to their data. Support features such as Undo and Redo. You might also want to support a Revert feature for files.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Internationalize your software. Provide localized versions whenever possible. Users feel more comfortable using a program that is in their native language. See <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGMOSXEnvironment/XHIGMOSXEnvironment.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002721-BBCCDHBE">“Internationalization”</a></span> for additional information.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Make your application accessible<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_61"></a> to people with disabilities. Assistive applications<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_62"></a> interact with your application and allow people with disabilities to use it. Although much support for accessibility is provided automatically by the system, there are things you can do to improve that support. See <span class="content_text"><a href="../../../../../referencelibrary/GettingStarted/GS_Accessibility/index.html" target="_top">Getting Started With Accessibility</a></span> for an overview of available information.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Provide appropriate documentation<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_63"></a> for your software. Apple Help is an HTML-based help system that lets you integrate documentation into your application. See <em><a href="../../../../Carbon/Conceptual/ProvidingUserAssitAppleHelp/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000903" target="_top">Apple Help Programming Guide</a></em> for information on how to incorporate Apple Help into your applications.<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_64"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_65"></a></p></li></ul><p>For high-level information on designing an easy-to-use interface, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGHIDesign/XHIGHIDesign.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-TPXREF130">“Human Interface Design Principles.”</a></span> </p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-TPXREF115" title="Attractive Appearance"></a><h2>Attractive Appearance</h2><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_66"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_67"></a><p>One feature that draws users to the Macintosh platform, and to Mac OS X in particular, is the stylish design and attractive appearance of the hardware and software. Although creating attractive hardware and system software is Apple’s job, you should take advantage of the strengths of Mac OS X to give your own software an attractive appearance. </p><p>The Finder and other applications that come with Mac OS X use high-resolution, high-quality graphics and icons that include 32-bit color and transparency. Make sure that your applications also use high-quality graphics both for the sake of appearance and to better convey relevant information to users. For example, the system uses pulsing buttons to identify the most likely choice and transparency effects to add a dimensional quality to windows.</p><p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_68"></a>Here are some guidelines to keep in mind as you design the appearance of your software:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Follow the guidelines in Part III of this document when designing your user interface. The guidelines offer advice on how to lay out content and design the visual appearance of your software. </p></li><li class="li"><p>From packaging to user interface polish, make sure your software looks professionally designed. </p><ul class="nested"><li class="nested li"><p>Use high-quality graphics<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_69"></a> and icons<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_70"></a>. If needed, contract with a professional graphic design firm to create these for you.</p></li><li class="nested li"><p>Adopt standard Mac OS X user-interface<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_71"></a> elements, such as controls, menus, and dialogs. Do not implement your own custom controls or dialogs to replace those provided by the system. </p></li><li class="nested li"><p>Refer to the guidelines in this document if you absolutely need a control that is not provided by the system and read <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGHIDesign/XHIGHIDesign.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-CJBBHGCD">“Extending the Interface”</a></span> before you decide to create a new element or change the behavior of an existing element.</p></li></ul></li><li class="li"><p>Use 32-bit color<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_72"></a>. Mac OS X is optimized to provide the best performance for 32-bit color. You don’t have to limit yourself to an 8-bit color palette for visual elements. Support for 8-bit graphics is minimal and available mostly to support legacy applications. </p></li><li class="li"><p>Use Interface Builder to design your user interface<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_73"></a>. Even if you do not use the resulting nib files, you can use the metrics provided by Interface Builder to lay out your views and controls precisely in your code. See <em><a href="../../../../DeveloperTools/Conceptual/IBTips/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000179i" target="_top">Interface Builder</a></em> for an introduction to this application’s features.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Render your text and graphics using modern APIs<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_74"></a> such as Quartz, Cocoa, ATSUI, and OpenGL. Avoid using legacy drawing APIs such as QuickDraw.<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_75"></a></p></li></ul><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-TPXREF102" title="Reliability"></a><h2>Reliability</h2><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_76"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_77"></a><p>A reliable program is one that earns the user’s trust. Such a program presents information to the user in an expected and desired way. A reliable program maintains the integrity of the user’s data and does everything possible to prevent data loss or corruption. It also has a certain amount of maturity to it and can handle complex situations without crashing. </p><p>Reliability is important in all areas of software design, but especially in areas where a program may be running for an extended period of time. For example, scientific programs often perform calculations on large data sets and can take a long time to complete. If such a program were to crash during a long calculation, the scientist could lose days or weeks worth of work. </p><p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_78"></a>Here are some guidelines to keep in mind as you design your software for reliability:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Make sure your user interface<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_79"></a> behaves in a predictable way. The same set of actions should generate the same results each time. See <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGHIDesign/XHIGHIDesign.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-TPXREF103">“Consistency”</a></span> for additional information.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Provide predictable output from your documents. For printing, make sure that the content the user sees on the screen is what gets printed.

If your program imports or exports files associated with other applications, make sure you fully support the file format. If your application cannot import all data from a given file format, warn the user that data loss may occur and offer the option to work on a copy of the original file.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Test your software under a wide variety of conditions and verify that it responds appropriately. Simulate the network going down or a mounted volume disappearing and ensure that your software adapts appropriately. </p></li><li class="li"><p>Make sure your packaging clearly indicates the system requirements for your software. Don’t assume your software runs on lower-end hardware until you test it on that hardware. Similarly, indicate which versions of Mac OS X you support.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Anticipate errors<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_80"></a> and handle them gracefully. If a function returns a result code, check it to see if there was a problem and respond appropriately. You can also use exception handlers to catch errors; however, use them sparingly. Exception handlers increase the memory footprint of your application, which can degrade performance.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Validate<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_81"></a> user input to ensure that it is what you expect. Formatter objects help ensure that users enter numbers and dates correctly.

If a network connection goes down, an adaptable program lets the user continue to work offline. Similarly, if certain resources are locked or become unavailable, an adaptable program finds other ways to meet the user’s request. </p><p>One of the strengths of Mac OS X is its ability to adapt to configuration changes quickly and easily. For example, if the user changes a computer’s network configuration from System Preferences, the changes are automatically picked up by applications such as Safari and Mail, which use CFNetwork to handle network configuration changes automatically.</p><p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_88"></a>Here are some guidelines to keep in mind as you design your software to be adaptable:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Build forgiveness and intelligence into your interface. Make sure your software can handle cases in which a file-system volume or the network disappears. Offer the user an option for saving files to a different volume or reconnecting to the network later. </p></li><li class="li"><p>Avoid making assumptions about available hardware and access to that hardware. Hardware configurations can vary greatly based on the computer, country, and user. For example, not every Macintosh is equipped with Velocity Engine on the processor. Similarly, not all keyboards have the same set of keys. Hardware can also be added or removed at runtime. Use the I/O Kit interfaces to detect<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_89"></a> available device configurations. See <em><a href="../../../../DeviceDrivers/Conceptual/AccessingHardware/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000376" target="_top">Accessing Hardware From Applications</a></em> for more information.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Avoid making assumptions based on the current user’s locale. Be prepared to handle different date, time, and number formats. Also, don’t assume that the address format of the current user is the only address format in use. For example, the user may store contacts with foreign addresses in Address Book. </p></li><li class="li"><p>Avoid making assumptions about your execution environment. If your program is running in a NetBoot environment, your access to the system resources may be limited or read-only. For example, in a typical NetBoot environment, only the user’s home directory is writable. </p></li><li class="li"><p>Be sensitive to changes in screen availability and resolution. Mac OS X supports hot-plugging<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_90"></a> of monitors and notifies applications of the changes through Quartz Services. Your software should respond appropriately by adjusting window locations and dimensions as described in <span class="content_text"><a href="../XHIGWindows/XHIGWindows.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-TPXREF55">“Window Behavior.”</a></span></p></li><li class="li"><p>Use modern system APIs. Apple works to ensure that its modern system APIs properly handle configuration changes. Although some legacy APIs may also support configuration changes, that support may change in future releases.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Avoid writing custom device drivers<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_91"></a>. The I/O Kit contains working drivers to support many standard protocols and device types. Relying on these drivers means your hardware should automatically work with each new version of Mac OS X.<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_92"></a></p></li></ul><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-TPXREF117" title="Interoperability"></a><h2>Interoperability</h2><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_93"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_94"></a><p>Interoperability refers to a program’s ability to communicate across environments. This communication can occur at either the user or the program level and can involve processes on the current computer or on remote computers. At the program level, an interoperable program supports ways to move data back and forth between itself and other programs. It might therefore support the pasteboard and be able to read file formats from other programs on either the same or a different platform. It also makes sure that the data it creates can be read by other programs on the system.</p><p>Users see interoperability in features such as the pasteboard (the Clipboard in the user interface), drag and drop, AppleScript, Bonjour, and services in the Services menu. All these features provide ways for the user to get data into or out of an application. </p><p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_95"></a>Here are some guidelines to keep in mind as you design your software for interoperability:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Avoid custom file formats<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_96"></a> whenever possible to ensure that users can easily exchange documents with users of other programs. If you must use custom file formats, provide import and export capabilities to allow users to exchange data with other applications.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Use the same file format on all supported platforms. Make sure documents created by your application on one platform can be read by your application on other platforms. </p></li><li class="li"><p>Support filename extensions<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_97"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_98"></a> to ensure that users on other platforms can recognize and open your files. See <em><a href="../../../../MacOSX/Conceptual/BPFileSystem/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000185i" target="_top">File System Overview</a></em> for more information on the importance of filename extensions. </p></li><li class="li"><p>Use standard protocols<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_99"></a> for data interchange whenever possible. XML is a preferred format for exchanging data among applications and platforms because it is cross-platform and widely supported. Mac OS X also supports numerous network protocols, as listed in <em><a href="../../../../MacOSX/Conceptual/OSX_Technology_Overview/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001067" target="_top">Mac OS X Technology Overview</a></em>.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Save configuration data using the Mac OS X preferences system implementations offered by Cocoa and Core Foundation. These implementations store configuration data in plain-text files, which gives the user the opportunity to modify the data either directly or with a script.<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_100"></a></p></li><li class="li"><p>Design your AppleScript object model carefully to allow for flexibility and future expansion. Good AppleScript integration requires some thought as to how users or other programs might interact with your data. It also requires careful integration with your program’s data structures.

A program that supports mobility doesn’t waste battery power by polling the system or accessing peripherals unnecessarily, nor does it break when the user moves from place to place, changes monitor configurations, puts the computer to sleep, or wakes the computer up. </p><p>To support mobility, programs need to be able to adjust to different system configurations, including network configuration changes. Many hardware devices can be plugged in and unplugged while the computer is still running. Mobility-aware programs should respond to these changes gracefully. They should also be sensitive to issues such as power usage. Constantly accessing a hard drive or optical drive can drain the battery of a laptop quickly. Be considerate of mobile users by helping them use their computer longer on a single battery charge.</p><p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_103"></a>Here are some guidelines to keep in mind as you design your software to support mobility:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Avoid polling<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_104"></a> for events. Polling the system needlessly wastes CPU time, which in turn wastes battery power on portable systems. Most modern APIs have ways of notifying your program when something interesting happens. Register to receive these notifications and respond to them as appropriate; otherwise (if your program has nothing to do), it should be completely idle.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Try not to require that the user insert the program CD<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_105"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_106"></a> when using your software. Give the user an option to install everything on a local hard drive.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Minimize access to files<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_107"></a> on the hard drive or on an optical drive. In addition to improving performance, you can reduce battery consumption by letting the drives spin down more frequently. </p></li><li class="li"><p>Use modern networking<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_108"></a> interfaces to adapt to network configuration changes. Mobile users may change locations or wireless access points at any time. Use CFNetwork and other modern interfaces to handle these configuration changes for you.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Be forgiving when accessing the file system, in case network volumes go offline. If a network volume disappears, notify the user and provide an option to save files to a different volume. </p></li><li class="li"><p>Be sensitive to screen resolution<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_109"></a> changes and the plugging in and unplugging of monitors. Mobile users may need to plug in a projector or other device that requires a different resolution, so do not assume a fixed screen size in your software. If a monitor disappears, adjust the position of any windows that were on that monitor so that they remain visible.<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002720-DontLinkElementID_110"></a></p></li></ul>
