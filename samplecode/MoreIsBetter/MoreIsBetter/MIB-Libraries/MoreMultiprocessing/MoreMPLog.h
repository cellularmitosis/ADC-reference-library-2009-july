/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// Overview
// --------
// This module implements a very low-level logging mechanism that is safe 
// to call from /all/ contexts, including MP tasks and interrupts.  It was 
// originally written to help develop OTMP (another part of MoreIsBetter) but 
// it is generally useful.
//
// The core design is stolen directly from "InterruptSafeDebug", another 
// MoreIsBetterModule.  The main change is that this module logs into 
// memory rather than directly to the screen.  I should unify these two 
// modules eventually, but at the moment I'm concentrating on shipping 
// OTMP.
//
// The log data goes into a log buffer pointed to by gMPLogBuffer.
// After a crash you can find this buffer in MacsBug and then look 
// through the buffer for a '•' character to find the last item logged.
// When you start up the module it defines a MacsBug macro, MPLog, to do 
// this for you.
//
// For InterfaceLib-based code you can call this library when paging is 
// unsafe, as long as your guarantee that the library's code and global 
// data is held.  This is typically the case for device driver code.  
// For Carbon code, paging must be safe when you call this module. 
// Paging is always safe on Mac OS X, and is typically safe in application-
// level code on traditional Mac OS.  See Technote 1094 "Virtual Memory 
// Application Compatibility" for a list of situations when paging is 
// unsafe on traditional Mac OS.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Core Logging Routines

extern pascal OSStatus InitMPLog(ByteCount logBufferSize);
	// Initialises the MP-safe log to contain a log of logBufferSize 
	// bytes.  The buffer is allocated in the current zone using NewPtrClear.
	// logBufferSize must be a power of 2.

extern pascal void TermMPLog(void);
	// Shuts down the MP-safe log.  Do not call this routine while 
	// there are MP threads running that are logging data.
	
extern pascal void MPLogText(const UInt8 *text, ByteCount len);
	// Log's the text described by text and len to the buffer.

extern pascal OSStatus MPLogWriteToFile(const FSSpec *fss);
	// Writes the MP log to the file pointed to by fss, 
	// overwriting any data that was there previously.  This 
	// routine is not coordinated with the logging, so if 
	// there is ongoing logging happening while the write is 
	// in progress you will get weird results.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Log Points

// The followed routines let you easily define log points throughout 
// your code.  They are conditionalised with the MORE_DEBUG macro so 
// the log points go away when you compile a non-debug version.  They 
// are runtime conditionalised by a mask, so you can selectively enable 
// logging from a particular part of your code at runtime.  The "module"
// parameter to each MPLog routine is a bit number in this mask.  If the 
// bit is set, the log entry is created.
//
// IMPORTANT: The default value for the log mask is 0, so you'll have to 
// set it yourself if you expect to see anything in the log.
//
// Log points are identified by a tag, ie an OSType that you can easily 
// recognise.  I use an OSType rather than a string because it's fast 
// and simple.  This module encourages you to use tags of the form '>Foo'
// for routine entry points and '<Foo' for routine exit points.  MPLogTagReturn 
// takes an entry point tag and returns the equivalent return tag.
//
// Log points can take up to four parameters.  These parameters are 
// written to the log as hex.

#define MPLogTagReturn(tag) ( ((tag) & 0x00FFFFFF) | ('<' << 24) )

#if MORE_DEBUG

	extern pascal void   MPLogSetMask(UInt32 logMask);
		// Sets the log mask.  Only log points whose bit is set in this 
		// mask will actually appear in the log.
		
	extern pascal UInt32 MPLogGetMask(void);
		// Returns the mask last set with MPLogSetMask.
	
	extern pascal void MPLog(UInt32 module, OSType tag);
	extern pascal void MPLog1(UInt32 module, OSType tag, const void *p1);
	extern pascal void MPLog2(UInt32 module, OSType tag, const void *p1, const void *p2);
	extern pascal void MPLog3(UInt32 module, OSType tag, const void *p1, const void *p2, const void *p3);
	extern pascal void MPLog4(UInt32 module, OSType tag, const void *p1, const void *p2, const void *p3, const void *p4);
		// If the bit whose number is "module" is set in the log mask, 
		// create a log entry recording "tag" and "pX".
		// Safe to call from all execution environments.
		// You must initialise the log buffer, using InitMPLog, 
		// before calling this routine.

// Utility printf Routines

extern void MPLogPrintf(const char *format, ...);
	// Like printf, but result goes to the MP log.
	// Safe to call from all execution environments.
	// You must initialise the log buffer, using InitMPLog, 
	// before calling this routine.
	// 
	// The fully expanded string must be 256 characters or less.

#if 0

// This routine is fatally broken and I'm not entirely sure 
// why.  Something about the MPRemoteCall is causing the MP 
// task to wedge.  I believe this is a bug in Mac OS 9.1 
// [2607064] because it works just fine on Mac OS 9.0.4 and 
// pre-release versions of Mac OS 9.2.  Until I figure this 
// out I'm just not going use this routine.

extern void MPLogPrintfSlow(const char *format, ...);
	// MP-safe version of printf.  Result goes to console.
	// The routine is slow because it does an MPRemoteCall to 
	// do the printing, which means the MP task waits until 
	// the application is scheduled and can run the called 
	// routine before it unblocks.
	//
	// You cannot call this routine from an interrupt. You can only
	// call it from system task code or from an MP task.
	//
	// You don't need to call InitMPLog before calling this routine.
	//
	// Doesn't strictly belong in this module, but it was a convenient 
	// place to put it.
