***** COMPRESSED SOURCE VIDEO DIGITIZERS FOR MACINTOSH OS X *****

  BACKGROUND - THE VIDEO CAPTURE PROCESS

The process of making movies involves several components. The sequence grabber component (component type 'barg')
plays an especially critical role. It's responsible for coordinating the activities of the lower-level components
to achieve different results -- like displaying video in a window, grabbing a single picture, or grabbing a movie.
By protecting application developers from having to deal with the low-level management of the video digitizer, the
sequence grabber makes it much easier to incorporate video input capabilities in applications. Note that the sequence
grabber also handles audio input devices and synchronization of picture and sound.

Data flow in the video digitizing pipeline begins with a video source for example, a video camera, VCR, direct broadcast
feed and so on. The video digitizing hardware is responsible for converting the video source to digital form and can
optionally perform resizing, color conversion, or clipping. In the absence of hardware support for these operations,
the sequence grabber will sometimes provide them.

The video digitizer's ('vdig') primary purpose in life is to provide QuickTime with a consistent software interface used
to interact with the video digitizer hardware. The data supplied by the 'vdig' component can either be displayed on screen
or be processed further through the use of the sequence grabber component.

From a video digitizing perspective, displaying live video in a window is called play through(*), and capturing video to a movie
is called capturing or grabbing. The sequence grabber calls these operations previewing and recording respectively. When a movie
is requested, an image compressor may process the data further, and the result is stored either in system memory or to disk.

(*)It is very important to note that for a compress-only video digitizer, playthough support at the 'vdig' level is ignored. Hardware
on MacOS X cannot go directly to the screen, so video digitizer functions supporting playthough are not required. Playthough
is handled by QuickTime and is mentioned in the above description for completeness.

  THE SEQUENCE GRABBER
  
The sequence grabber makes life easier for application programmers by handling all the messy details of controlling video digitizers,
sound input devices, and compressors. The sequence grabber plays such an important role in a video digitizing application that a brief
introduction is in order. The HackTV Carbon sample is a good introduction to the Sequence Grabber set of APIs.

  PREVIEWING
  
Previewing video with the sequence grabber is the equivalent of setting up the 'vdig' in play-through mode to display live video on the
computer screen. Remember that the sequence grabber performs the live video play through and devices should not do hardware play
through or attempt to directly draw to the screen on MacOS X.

In general the steps are, establish a connection to the sequence grabber component in the usual way, with OpenADefaultComponent.
Initialize the sequence grabber, set up the graphics environment, and allocate a new channel for video preview (using the seqGrabPreview flag).
If for example you want the displayed video to be one-quarter size, you would call SGGetSrcVideoBounds to see what size the source video
is. This function calls VDGetDigitizerRect, which returns the source video size equal to the digitizer rectangle. You would Scale the
height and width accordingly, and then send the new size to the sequence grabber via the SGSetChannelBounds routine.

Finally, call SGStartPreview, which turns on the video digitizer by calling the digitizer function VDSetCompressionOnOff, and previewing
begins.

Make sure to always call SGSetGWorld to establish the graphics port for the sequence grabber component. This is required even if you do
not plan to work with a video channel.

  RECORDING

Recording is very similar to previewing and is almost as simple.

There are several small differences between recording and previewing. For example you can set up the sequence grabber to record and to play
through while recording (using the seqGrabRecord | seqGrabPlayDuringRecord flags). We need to specify a file for the movie to be written
to, indicating that the movie be grabbed directly to disk. For a short movie, we could grab to memory if we wanted. By default,
the recording time is limited by the system resources available -- in this case, disk space.

The SGStartRecord call initiates the grab to disk. SGIdle is called repetitively to provide processing time to the sequence grabber.
You should call SGIdle as often as possible while recording. When the user clicks the mouse button, or when the disk is full, recording
will stop, and we call SGStop to complete the recording process.

That's all there is to simple recording. If you want to do more sophisticated tasks with the sequence grabber, such as replacing the
standard sequence grabber disk- or compression-bottleneck routines with your own, or using a DataProc for faster captures consult the
QuickTime Sequence Grabber documentation and Sample Code.

***********************************
*** SOME VIDEO DIGITIZER BASICS ***

We'll discuss a few QuickTime 'vdig' topics that seem to give developers the most trouble when they first undertake the task of
writing a video digitizer component. In practice, how you write a video digitizer component depends heavily on your particular
digitizer hardware implementation. For the sake of illustration, however, we'll simulate some hardware features with software
that provides the required functionality.

  IDENTIFYING DIGITIZER TYPES AND CAPABILITIES

No two video digitizers are alike. To make sure your 'vdig' component works smoothly with
QuickTime, it's critical to identify the capabilities your hardware provides.

This sample demonstrates hardware not attached to a FrameBuffer (a FireWire device for example):
  - Set digiOutDoesCompress, this implies the use of the Compressed Source APIs such as VDCompressDone(), VDReleaseCompressBuffer(),
    VDCompressOneFrameAsync() and so on.
    Note: Be sure to tell the truth when reporting the number of queued frames (queuedFrameCount number).
    The Ptr value in VDCompressDone()- can be any memory address to read from.
  - Set digiOutDoesCompressOnly when above flag is set.
  - Set digiOutDoesNotNeedCopyOfCompressData - When the Sequence Grabber is recording, QuickTime can manage capture buffers for you
    automatically. Sometimes, you don't want QuickTime buffer management - setting this flag informs QuickTime that you specifically
    DO NOT want this behavior, therefore the Sequence Grabber will not buffer any of your compressed data. In other words you don't
    want the Sequence Grabber copying your data to system memory before writing it to disk. This allows for DMA directly over the
    PCI bus avoiding a trip though system memory before the sample data hits the disk.

The 'vdig' component interface attempts to be very flexible in allowing you to indicate what your hardware
can do. A 'vdig' specifies its type and capabilities in the DigitizerInfo structure, shown below. Two
calls -- VDGetDigitzerInfo and VDGetCurrentFlags give a client (normally the sequence grabber)
access to information contained in this structure.

  struct DigitizerInfo {
     short       vdigType;
     long        inputCapabilityFlags;
     long        outputCapabilityFlags;
     long        inputCurrentFlags;
     long        outputCurrentFlags;
     short       slot;
     GDHandle    gdh;
     GDHandle    maskgdh;
     short       minDestHeight;
     short       minDestWidth;
     short       maxDestHeight;
     short       maxDestWidth;
     short       blendLevels;
     long        reserved;
 };
 
In the vdigType field, you specify the type of digitizer you are. Compressed Source Digitizers are basic
rectangular digitizing devices - vdTypeBasic.

In the capability flags fields, you indicate to clients all capabilities a particular digitizer instance provides. 
The current flags fields use the same attribute bit fields as the capability flags, but they indicate the
currently available capabilities, not the total possible capabilities. By nature, some capabilities are
mutually exclusive. For instance, if you support NTSC and PAL input formats, at any given time you're actively
doing only one of them. The bit corresponding to the active standard is the one that would be set in the current flags,
while both would be set in the capability flags.

A full description of the flags can be found later in this sample before the SoftVDigXGetDigitizerInfo function, and
at the following URL:
  http://developer.apple.com/documentation/QuickTime/INMAC/QTC/imVideoDigComp.10.htm

Clients of your digitizer will be much happier if you truthfully state what you can and can't do. The sequence grabber,
in particular, will function much better.

  THE EXAMPLE - SoftVDigX by Kext-O-Tron
  
As an example we'll describe the &quot;hardware&quot; used in this sample:

A fictional digitizer company &quot;Kext-O-Tron&quot;, announces a video digitizer with the following
capabilities:

The fictional hardware has one video input and can support only the NTSC video standard.
The fictional hardware supports compression and provides '2vuy' pixel data. (the same 30 frames over and over)
The fictional hardware only supports capture at 320x240 and does not support clipping, resizing or zooming.
The fictional hardware will be relying on the sequence grabber to do resizing, color conversion, and on-screen
placement operations.

The interesting fields and their values are:

vdigType = vdTypeBasic;
inputCapabilityFlags = digiInDoesNTSC | digiInDoesColor | digiInDoesComponent;

outputCapabilityFlags = digiOutDoes32         |
            digiOutDoesCompress    |
            digiOutDoesCompressOnly  |
            digiOutDoesNotNeedCopyOfCompressData;

  GETTING VIDEO COORDINATE SYSTEMS STRAIGHT

http://developer.apple.com/documentation/QuickTime/INMAC/QTC/imVideoDigComp.4.htm

The coordinate system for video digitizers can seem confusing, but it's actually quite straightforward.
The critical point to keep in mind is that when referencing the video source, you're working in a coordinate
system that's specific to your digitizing hardware. All cropping rectangles are relative to this coordinate system.

Four rectangles define the video source. The MaxSrcRect defines the maximum source area that the digitizer is
capable of grabbing. Typically this area includes all or portions of the vertical and horizontal blanking areas.
Note that you don't have to define the top left point of MaxSrcRect as 0,0; this is an entirely arbitrary reference
point that 'vdig' developers can define as they choose. The other three rectangles are defined in relation to MaxSrcRect.

The ActiveSrcRect is the region of the maximum source rectangle that contains the actual video image.
The first pixel of active video is the top left corner, and the last pixel is the bottom right.

The DigitizerRect describes the area of the MaxSrcRect to be captured -- the image that the user will
actually see, although it hasn't been scaled yet. The default DigitizerRect is the same as the ActiveSrcRect.

It's not uncommon for part of the blanking signal to be displayed in the ActiveSrcRect. This is because different
source devices -- like VCRs, and broadcast signals -- send out slightly different analog signals. To align the image,
a 'vdig' client can nudge the DigitizerRect a few pixels in the appropriate direction using VDSetDigitizerRect.

To describe a cropped image, the DigitizerRect is usually defined as a portion of the ActiveSrcRect.

The last rectangle, VBlankRect, defines the area of vertical blanking. This region can contain vertical
interval time code (VITC), closed captioning, and teletext.

Remember, all rectangle coordinates are relative to MaxSrcRect.

MaxSrcRect, ActiveSrcRect, and VBlankRect are hardware dependent. The only control that a client has is in the
definition of DigitizerRect.

Note that in the SoftVDigXSetDigitizerRect function, the requested DigitizerRect must fully intersect the MaxSrcRect.

One more very important point to understand about video coordinate systems is that scaling and
translation can be specified either as a matrix or as a destination rectangle. Your digitizer may support
both transformation methods. If the matrix is NULL, use the destination rectangle; otherwise, ignore it
and use the matrix. The 'vdig' must offset the top left of the DigitizerRect to 0,0 before applying the
matrix, or the video won't be positioned correctly. This isn't necessary when using the destination
rectangle. By the way, the sequence grabber uses the destination rectangle, and not the matrix, to
specify scaling and translation, although this may change at any time.
Note: If you claim you only record at one size, this is not your problem. QuickTime will take care of
resizing the video as required.

  DIGITIZATION CONTROL

Video digitizers should time-stamp the video frames they produce and implement the VDSetTimeBase routine.
VDSetTimeBase allows clients to specify the time coordinate system the video digitizer should use when time-stamping
video frames.

A second routine called VDSetFrameRate, allows applications to tell a digitizer the precise frame rate to
use for capture. Digitizers used to capture video at only one frame rate -- as fast as possible.
However, the advent of full-frame-rate digitizing hardware and compressed-source devices has made
it increasingly important for clients to manage the tradeoff between frame rate, image size, and
compression quality. The rate in VDSetFrameRate is expressed as a fixed-point value, typically
between 0 and 29.97 (see &quot;Frame Rates and Motion Quality&quot; for a discussion of frame rate values).

Additionally VDGetDataRate retrieves information describing the performance capabilities of a video digitizer. It is
extremely useful because it gives clients a way to determine the performance capabilities of your video digitizer. It is
called before recording has started and allows you to report milliseconds per frame, frames per second and bytes per second.
You can safely return 0 for milliSecPerFrame, bytesPerSecond however MUST BE ACCURATE. For framesPerSecond you should return
the frame rate you can &quot;really&quot; do, but you can also return 0 if you can't control the frame rate. You MUST return
bytesPerSecond, this is not an option!

  COMPRESSED-SOURCE DEVICES

Compressed-source video digitizers gives users access to full-size, full-frame-rate digital video.

Eight functions are needed for servicing compressed-source video digitizers.

VDGetCompressionTypes simply returns a handle to the list of compressors that your video digitizer implements.
Each element of the list contains the component ID, type, name, format, and capabilities of a compressor.

VDSetCompression specifies which of all the possible compressors a digitizer should use. The parameters for
VDSetCompression specify the spatial quality, temporal quality, depth, and other characteristics of the compression.

VDCompressOneFrameAsync starts the digitizing process for compressed-source devices. A compressed-source digitizer
handles all the management of data buffers itself, without external assistance from the caller.

VDCompressDone allows a caller to determine when a frame has been completed.

The VDReleaseCompressBuffer tells a compressed-source device to free the buffer returned by the VDCompressDone call.

The VDResetCompressSequence call instructs a digitizer to insert a key frame into a frame-differenced image sequence as soon
as possible after it receives this call.

The VDGetImageDescription routine prompts the digitizer to return an image description structure corresponding to the current settings.
This structure is the same structure that's used to describe image data in movie files.

The VDSetCompressionOnOff routine starts and stops the digitizer. To give the digitizer adequate time to prepare itself for the
requested operation, clients must call this routine before calling VDSetCompression or VDCompressOneFrameAsync.

Typically, compressed-source devices are able to act as hardware decompressors and have a corresponding QuickTime image decompressor
component that clients can use to play back the compressed images. However, if your hardware produces compressed data that can't be
read by any of the standard QuickTime image decompressor components, you need to provide an appropriate software-only decompressor
component. This way, users who don't have your hardware will still be able to play movies produced with your compressor.

  FRAME RATES AND MOTION QUALITY

The term frame rate is frequently tossed about in discussions of the pros and cons of video digitizers.
Frame rate is the rate at which frames appear during video playback.

It's commonly held that the frame rate corresponding to full-motion video is 30 frames per second
(fps). However, 30 fps is not the only interesting frame rate or even the only &quot;true&quot; full-motion
frame rate.

Most video digitizing hardware have a fixed frame rate:

29.97 fps is the usual frame rate for NTSC video and broadcast production.
25 fps is the usual frame rate for PAL and SECAM video and broadcast production.
24 fps is the usual frame rate for film production.

But QuickTime does not limit frame rate to only the above values. It could be anything. A Video Digitizer will be told
what frame rate QuickTime wants to record at. If the Video Digitizer cannot achive this frame rate, QuickTime will try
it's best to do it. However, results may vary and implementing rate control on the hardware side will result in better
accuracy.

See QuickTime Image Rates and Video in Ice Floe 19 for the the full description of the issues related to TimeScale and
sample durations:

  http://developer.apple.com/quicktime/icefloe/dispatch019.html

NTSC and digital 525 video have exactly 30/1.001 frames per second. A media TimeScale of 30000 and media
sample durations of 1001, along with a movie TimeScale of 30000, provide 19.9 hours of time in 32 bits.
The 30/1.001 rate of NTSC and digital 525 is sometimes approximated to (or mistaken to be) 29.97, which does
not equal 30/1.001. The average rate of drop-frame timecode (e.g., LTC and VITC used in the video industry) over
24 hours is exactly 29.97, but the use of drop-frame timecode does not modify the video signal rate. Some existing
movies have a media TimeScale of 2997, media sample durations of 100, and a movie TimeScale of 2997. This provides
8.2 days of time before 32-bit overflow, however after 4.6 hours, this representation deviates from the actual video
timing by half a frame time. For tracks with a 2997 timescale which are longer than 4.6 hours, a frame-accurate
representation of the video timing is only possible if the frames are allowed to have differing durations.

Most applications today only deal with material shorter than 4.6 hours. These applications should be able to read video
movies with either 2997 or 30000 TimeScales. They may write either, but the 30000 TimeScale is preferred since it has a
sufficient overflow time and precisely models the video signal.

Final Cut Pro uses 2997/100 and 2500/100. It will report that is has detected a dropped frame if the returned
frame durations do not match what was expected.

In addition to frame rate, there are two other terms you should know about. If the &quot;frame rate&quot; measures the
speed at which the movie is played back for the viewer, the &quot;capture rate&quot; is the rate at which the
'vdig' hardware is capable of capturing frames. The &quot;effective capture rate&quot; is the number of
frames per second that end up in a QuickTime movie. Many factors can make the effective
capture rate less than the intrinsic rate the hardware can support.

/* Controlling Analog Video

Some video digitizer components may provide functions that allow applications to control the characteristics of the input analog video signal.
The VDGetVideoDefaults function returns the suggested default values for the analog video parameters that can be affected by these functions.
A number of functions affect gamma correction. The VDSetInputGammaRecord and VDGetInputGammaRecord functions work with gamma structures.
You can use the VDSetInputGammaValue and VDGetInputGammaValue functions to allow your application to set particular gamma values.
The VDSetBlackLevelValue, VDGetBlackLevelValue , VDSetWhiteLevelValue, and VDGetWhiteLevelValue functions allow applications to work with black
levels and white levels in the source video. Black level  refers to the degree of blackness in an image. This is a common setting on a video digitizer.
The highest setting produces an all-black image; on the other hand, the lowest setting yields little, if any, black even with black objects in the scene.
Black level is a significant setting because it can be adjusted so that there is little or no noise in an image. White level  refers to the degree
of whiteness in an image. It is also a common video digitizer setting. The VDSetContrast, VDGetContrast, VDSetSharpness, and VDGetSharpness functions
allow applications to work with contrast and sharpness values in the source video. The VDGetBrightness and VDSetBrightness functions allow applications
to work with the image brightness setting. The VDSetHue, VDGetHue, VDSetSaturation, and VDGetSaturation functions allow applications to work with hue
and saturation settings in the source video. */

        where 0 represents the maximum black value and 65,535 represents the minimum black value.
  whiteLevel - A pointer to an integer that is to receive the default white level value. White level values range from 0 to 65,535,
        where 0 represents the minimum white value and 65,535 represents the maximum white value.
  brightness - A pointer to an integer that is to receive the default brightness value. Brightness values range from 0 to 65,535,
        where 0 is the darkest possible setting and 65,535 is the lightest possible setting.
  hue - A pointer to an integer that is to receive the default hue value. Hue is similar to the tint control on a television, and
      it is specified in degrees with complementary colors set 180 degrees apart (red is 0 degrees, green is +120 degrees, and blue
      is -120 degrees). Video digitizer components support hue values that range from 0 (-180 degrees shift in hue) to 65,535
      (+179 degrees shift in hue), where 32,767 represents a 0 degree shift in hue.
  saturation - A pointer to an integer that is to receive the default saturation value. The saturation value controls color intensity.
         For example, at high saturation levels, red appears to be red; at low saturation, red appears as pink. Valid saturation
         values range from 0 to 65,535, where 0 is the minimum saturation value and 65,535 specifies maximum saturation.
  contrast - A pointer to an integer that is to receive the default contrast value. The contrast value ranges from 0 to 65,535, where 0
         represents no change to the basic image and larger values increase the contrast of the video image (they increase the slope of the transform).
  sharpness - A pointer to an integer that is to receive the default sharpness value. The sharpness value ranges from 0 to 65,535, where 0
        represents no sharpness filtering and 65,535 represents full sharpness filtering. Higher values result in a visual impression of
        increased picture sharpness.

            component is deriving its time signal from the input video. When reporting its input capabilities, the digitizer
            component sets this flag to 1 to indicate that it can derive its timing from the input video.

              component can clip to a region defined by a key color.
  digiOutDoesAsyncGrabs - Indicates that the video digitizer component can operate asynchronously. If this flag is set to 1, your digitizer implements
              VDSetupBuffers and VDGrabOneFrameAsync.
  digiOutDoesUnreadableScreenBits - Indicates that the video digitizer may place pixels on the screen that cannot be used when compressing images.
                    In other words, image data can't be read directly from the screen as source material for the compression phase.
  digiOutDoesCompress - Indicates that the video digitizer component supports compressed source devices. These devices provide compressed data directly, without
              having to use the Image Compression Manager.
  digiOutDoesCompressOnly - Indicates that the video digitizer component only provides compressed image data; the component cannot provide displayable data.
                This flag only applies to digitizers that support compressed source devices.
  digiOutDoesPlayThruDuringCompress - Indicates that the video digitizer component can draw images on the screen at the same time that it is delivering
                    compressed image data. This flag only applies to digitizers that support compressed source devices.
  digiOutDoesCompressPartiallyVisible - Indicates that the video digitizer component doesn't need all bits visible on screen to do hardware compress.
  digiOutDoesNotNeedCopyOfCompressData - Indicates that the video digitizer component doesn't need any bufferization when providing compressed data.
                       (Mostly used if VDCompressDone returns a buffer address not in host memory)

inputCurrentFlags Constants - these are valid only during active operating conditions:
  digiInSignalLock - Indicates that the video digitizer component is locked onto the input signal. If this flag is set to 1, the digitizer component detects
             either vertical or horizontal signal lock. This bit = horiz lock || vertical lock.

  This section discusses the video digitizer component functions that allow applications to select
an input video source. Some of these functions provide information about the available video inputs.
Applications can use the VDGetNumberOfInputs function to determine the number of video inputs supported
by the digitizer component. The VDGetInputFormat  function allows applications to find out the video format
(composite, s-video, or component) employed by a specified input. You can use the VDSetInput function in
your application to specify the input to be used by the digitizer component. The VDGetInput function returns
the currently selected input. The VDSetInputStandard  function allows you to specify the video signaling standard
to be used by the video digitizer component. */

that register once and support multiple devices. The User Interface is clearer if these are presented as devices rather than inputs,
and this allows a VDIG to present itself this way without a huge restructuring. vdDeviceFlagHideDevice is for the kind of VDIG that
registers itself, and then can register a further VDIG for each device. If no hardware is available, returning this flag will omit it
from the list. As this call is being made, it is also a good time to check for hardware and register further VDIG components if needed,
allowing for lazy initialization when the application needs to find a VDIG rather than on every launch or replug.

/* Compressed Source Support

Some video digitizer components may provide functions that allow applications to work with digitizing
devices that can provide compressed image data directly. Such devices allow applications to retrieve
compressed image data without using the Image Compression Manager. However, in order to display images
from the compressed data stream, there must be an appropriate decompressor component available to decompress
the image data. Video digitizers that can support compressed source devices set the digiOutDoesCompress  flag to
1 in their capability flags (see &quot;Capability Flags,&quot;  for more information about these flags). Applications can
use the VDGetCompressionTypes  function to determine the image-compression capabilities of a video digitizer.
The VDSetCompression  function allows applications to set some parameters that govern image compression.
Applications control digitization by calling the VDCompressOneFrameAsync function, which instructs the video
digitizer to create one frame of compressed image data. The VDCompressDone function returns that frame. When an
application is done with a frame, it calls the VDReleaseCompressBuffer function to free the buffer. An application
can force the digitizer to place a key frame into the sequence by calling the VDResetCompressSequence function.
Applications can turn compression on and off by calling VDSetCompressionOnOff. Applications can obtain the
digitizer's image description structure by calling the VDGetImageDescription  function. Applications can set
the digitizer's time base by calling the VDSetTimeBase function. All of the digitizing functions described in
this section support only asynchronous digitization. That is, the video digitizer works independently to digitize
each frame. Applications are free to perform other work while the digitizer works on each frame. The video digitizer
component manages its own buffer pool for use with these functions. */

// VDSetCompression
//     Specifies certain compression parameters.
/*
  compressType - A compressor type. This value corresponds to the component subtype of the compressor component; see &quot;Codec Identifiers&quot; (IV-2831).
  depth - The depth at which the image is likely to be viewed. Compressors may use this as an indication of the color or grayscale resolution
          of the image. Values of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 32 indicate the number of bits per pixel for color images. Values of 33, 34, 36,
      and 40 correspond to 1-bit, 2-bit, 4-bit, and 8-bit grayscale images.
  bounds - A pointer to a Rect structure that defines the desired boundaries of the compressed image.
  spatialQuality - A constant (see below) that indicates the desired image quality for each frame in the sequence.
  temporalQuality - A constant (see below) that indicates the desired temporal quality for the sequence as a whole.
  keyFrameRate - The maximum number of frames to allow between key frames. This value defines the minimum rate at which key frames are to
                 appear in the compressed sequence; however, the video digitizer may insert key frames more often than an application specifies.
           If the application requests no temporal compression (that is, the application set the temporalQuality parameter to 0), the video
           digitizer ignores this parameter.

spatialQuality and temporalQuality Constants:
  codecMinQuality - The minimum valid value for a CodecQ field.
  codecLowQuality - Low-quality image reproduction. This value should correspond to the lowest image quality that still results in acceptable display characteristics.
  codecNormalQuality - Image reproduction of normal quality.
  codecHighQuality - High-quality image reproduction. This value should correspond to the highest image quality that can be achieved with reasonable performance.
  codecMaxQuality - The maximum standard value for a CodecQ field.
  codecLosslessQuality - Lossless compression or decompression. This special value is valid only for components that can support lossless compression or decompression.

milliSecPerFrame, indicates the number of milliseconds of overhead involved in digitizing a
single frame. Overhead is defined as the average delay between the time the digitizer requests a
frame from its associated hardware and the time the device actually delivers the frame. The
second value, framesPerSecond, is the maximum rate at which the digitizer can capture video
frames in its current configuration. This value is not affected by the VDSetFrameRate call.
The last value, bytesPerSecond, indicates the data rate at which a compressed-source digitizer
can produce compressed-image data. This value varies depending on parameters for spatial and motion
quality, image size, and depth. In other words, unlike milliSecPerFrame and framesPerSecond, bytesPerSecond
isn't a static value.

  milliSecPerFrame - A pointer to a long integer. The video digitizer returns a value that indicates the number of milliseconds of synchronous
             overhead involved in digitizing a single frame. This value includes the average delay incurred between the time when the
             digitizer requests a frame from its associated device, and the time at which the device delivers the frame.
  framesPerSecond - A pointer to a fixed value. The video digitizer supplies the maximum rate at which it can capture video. Note that this
            value may differ from the rate that the application set with VDSetFrameRate (III-2182).
  bytesPerSecond - A pointer to a long integer. Video digitizers that can return compressed image data return a value that indicates the

  temporalQuality - A pointer to a field containing the desired sequence temporal quality (see below). The compressor sets this field to
