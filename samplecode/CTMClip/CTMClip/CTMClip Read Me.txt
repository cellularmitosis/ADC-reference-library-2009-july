What is CTMClip?

The CTMClip sample shows how to manipulate the Core Graphics (Quartz 2D) Current Transform Matrix (CTM) for image drawing.  It also shows how to use the ClipCGContextToRegion API to make CG's clip path match the clip region from a QuickDraw port.

See the companion sample CTMDemo for the same demo without the clipping.
