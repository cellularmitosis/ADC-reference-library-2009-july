My application links withX.25_Interface_Library.o, IPCGlue.o, and FSDES.o. Should I be using the latestIPCGlue.o that is on the Developer CD, or should I use the one that came withthe X.25 Developers Kit? Also what about A/ROSE itself? Can I safely replacethe existing one in my Extensions folder with the latest one from the CD? If Ido should I relink the app with the corresponding IPCGlue.o? What about theMacX25 Admin? Will it be happy with the latest copy of A/ROSE in the Extensionsfolder? My code resources also link with IPCGlue.o. I assume I should link thecode resources and app with the same IPCGlue.o, right?</p><p>Changes to A/ROSE are typically made to A/ROSE itself. In general, you shouldfollow the guideline that you describe - link with the library file for theversion of A/ROSE you plan to ship with. Interestingly, the A/ROSE IPCGlue.ofile shipped with MacX25 1.0.1 is still fine for linking with. You should alsorelink your application with the (MacX25 1.1) X.25_Interface_Library.o as thereare a number of memory management bugs fixed between 1.0.1 and 1.1, some ofwhich caused system crashes.</p><p>Over the past several years, new releases of A/ROSE have been made to fix bugsand to support new hardware. If you plan to be compatible with new CPUs, youmight want to supply the latest release of A/ROSE.</p><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><h2>Locking X.25 segments</h2><p>Date Written:  6/2692</p><p>Last reviewed:  6/14/93</p><p>Are there any of the X.25 segments from X25_Interface_Library.o that need to belocked or should be specified as resident in my application's <code>'res!'</code> resource?In, particular I am wondering about the segment X25_VBL.</p><p>The X25_VBL segment contains code that is executed at interrupt time, and therules for dealing with interrupt driver code should be followed - that is, theVBL code and VBL task record should be locked down.</p><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><h2>Segmenting data for X25_Write</h2><p>Date Written:  6/2692</p><p>Last reviewed:  6/14/93</p><p>When writing data with the X25_Write routine, I seem to need to break up thedata to write according to the current packet size and then make separate callsfor each data chunk/packet. I had hoped the <code>X25_Write</code> would have figured thatout by itself. Am I missing something? What about when using <code>X25_Read</code>? Should Ibe reassembling packets with the <code>M_Bit</code> set, into big chunks of data?</p><p>No, At present, the <code>X25_Write</code> routine does not do anything very useful in thedomain of segmentation and reassembly of X.25 data. The routine only handlesthe segmentation and assembly of <i>one</i> packet's worth of data.Unfortunately, the same comment applies to the X25_Read routine.</p><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><h2>Depending on A/ROSE to correctly queue a message</h2><p>Date Written:  6/2692</p><p>Last reviewed:  6/14/93</p><p>Is it possible to intercept an A/ROSE message from the X.25 server that wasdestined for the X.25_Interface_Library? The server and the client are runningon the same machine, and I connect to the server with X25_Server_Connect(gTcb,connect_via_best).</p><p>A/ROSE is dependable for delivering messages to your task, that are sent to<i>your</i> task, and not to other tasks. To date, there have not been anyproblems reported on this subject.</p><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><h2>Translating 8-bit Macintosh text to 7-bit ASCII</h2><p>Date Written:   12/20/90</p><p>Last reviewed: 6/24/93</p><p>Is there an Apple-recommended method for converting 8-bit Apple text charactersto that which can be sent over 7-bit media while observing X.400 rules, andonly submit 7-bit text into the x.400 IA5Text body parts?</p><p>MacPAD used to support only 7-bit file transfers, but it's now possible totranslate from 8 bit characters to 7 bit.</p><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><h2>Where to find X.400 &amp; X.500 references</h2><p>Date Written:  1/23/91</p><p>Last reviewed:  6/14/93</p><p>Where can I find documentation on the X.400 and X.500 electronic-mailstandard?</p><p>There are a few interesting articles about X.400 in the Technical InformationLibrary on AppleLink. One of them mentions that Apple has a forthcoming X.400solution that is an X.400-compliant MTA (Message Transfer Agent) that runs onany modular Macintosh under System 7. It includes the seven layers of the OSImodel. It works either over X.25 (on top of the MacX25 product) or over 802.3.(This is the most used link in the U.S.) It lets Macintosh users gain access topublic X.400 networks or to connect to their private X.400 backbone.</p><p>For standards and specifications on X.400 and X.500, check with your locallibrary for an IEEE periodical index. IEEE documents this type of stuff fairlyregularly.</p><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><h2>Feasibility of MacX25 AppleTalk internet routers</h2><p>Date Written:   3/26/91</p><p>Last reviewed: 6/24/93</p><p>What's the feasibility of internet routers for AppleTalk networks overMacX25?</p><p>Internet routers for AppleTalk networks over MacX25 are not only feasible,they're available. Apple's internet router 3.0, with the X.25 internet routerextension, provides this function.</p><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><h2>Providing general "listeners" on MacX25 servers</h2><p>Date Written:  3/26/91</p><p>Last reviewed:  6/14/93</p><p>Is it feasible to develop general "listeners" on the MacX25 servers? This wouldallow users to connect to MacX25 servers and request specific services to beprovided. Other non-Macintosh systems could also communicate with suchlisteners.</p><p>MacX25 does indeed provide a listener agent. Please refer to the MacX25 productdocumentation. If, however, you want to develop your own listener, one could beprovided via access to A/ROSE.</p><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><h2>How to increase Macintosh X.25 user list size</h2><p>Date Written:  7/25/91</p><p>Last reviewed:  6/14/93</p><p>How do we go beyond the Macintosh X.25 user list entry limit of 256?</p><p>The size of the X.25 user list can be modified by modifying the <code>'Maxu'</code> resourcein the X.25 Admin program using ResEdit. If you're using the latest revision ofResEdit version 2.1, a template for the <code>'Maxu'</code> resource exists to assist withthis modification. The other recommended change is to increase the programpartition size of X.25 Admin by 32 bytes for each additional user to ensurethat there is enough memory to hold all of the names. Note that this changedoes not increase the number of simultaneous connections.</p><P><A NAME=Downloads></A></P>                  <P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><h2>Downloadables</H2>                  <TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <td width=50 align=left>                  <P ALIGN=center><img src="images/acrobatsmall.gif" width=22 height=23 align=middle alt="Acrobat gif"></P>               </TD>               <td align="left">                  <P>Acrobat version of this Note (48K)</P>               </TD>               <td width=60 align=left>                  <P><A HREF="pdf/nw_585.pdf">Download</A></P>               </TD>            </TR>                     </TABLE>         <BR>         <P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><!-- end_content --><!-- begin_footer_information -->	<table width="680" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
