/*	File:		TEXTtotypeIntlCoercion.c	Contains:	When the AppleEvent Registry and Inside Mac volume VI were first released,				the documented type for error strings and other stuff was typeChar ('TEXT').				Well, as we went along designing things like AppleScript, we realized				that typeChar was not suitable for a lot of developers and countries.  				Multi-byte scripts couldn't use typeChar and maintain all the information				they needed to, and other Bad Things were implied by typeChar.				So, the Winter '92 AE Registry introduced a new type, typeIntlText, defined as				(quoting from the AERegistry)...				A typeIntlText descriptor record contains identifiers for the language and script 				system of text followed by the text itself.				Description	The dataHandle field of a typeIntlText descriptor record contains the 				following:					a 2-byte script code that identifies the script system of the text					a 2-byte language code that identifies the language of the text					the characters in the text (a series of either 1- or 2-byte characters					; the script system determines whether the characters are 1 or 2 bytes in length)					That's great and wonderful, but heck, a lot of you (and Me) had already 				written code that supplied typeChar for errors and other things that should now be				typeIntlText (note for you programmers: Don't worry, code really is coming soon).				What's a Coder to Do?				You can fix your stuff so you supply typeIntlText, but what about all the				other stuff out there that's giving you back typeChar when you want typeIntlText????				A Coercion Routine!				And here it is.  This coercion routine coerces from typeChar to typeIntlText.				Put this in your code, then when someone sends you typeChar when you've asked for				typeIntlText, this coercion routine will give you what you asked for seamlessly,				you won't even know the coercion happened.	Written by: C.K.
