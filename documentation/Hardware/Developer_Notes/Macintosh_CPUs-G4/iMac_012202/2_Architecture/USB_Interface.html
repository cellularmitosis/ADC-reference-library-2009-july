The internalmodem and the external USB port nearest the mini-VGA connector areconnected to one controller; the other two USB ports are connectedto the other controller. </p><p>Each USB controller provides a 12 Mbps data transfer ratethat is shared between the two devices connected to it. The two USBports that are connected to separate controllers can support highdata rate devices at the same time with no degradation of theirperformance. Thus, if a user connects a high-speed (12 Mbps) deviceto USB port 1 and another high-speed device to the port 2, bothdevices can operate at their full data rates. </p><p>All three external USB connectors support USB devices withdata transfer rates of 1.5 Mbps or 12 Mbps. For more informationabout the connectors, see  <a sector="mod" href="../3_Input-Output/iUSB_Ports.html" target="_top">"USB Ports"</a>. </p><p>USB devices connected to the iMac are required to supportUSB-suspend mode as defined in the USB specification. Informationabout the operation of USB-suspend mode on Macintosh computers isincluded in the Mac OS USB DDK API Reference. To obtain that document,please see the references at  <a sector="mod" href="../A_References/iUSB_Interface2.html" target="_top">"USB Interface"</a>. </p><p>The USB ports on the iMac comply with the Universal SerialBus Specification 1.1 Final Draft Revision. The USB controllerscomply with the Open Host Controller Interface (OHCI) specification. </p><br>    <br><a href="Video_Display_Subsystem_.html" target="content"><img src="../images/previous.gif" border="0"></a><a href="Ultra_ATA_Interface_.html" target="content"><img src="../images/next.gif" border="0"></a>&nbsp;<br><br><p><hr><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">&#169; 2002 Apple Computer, Inc.
