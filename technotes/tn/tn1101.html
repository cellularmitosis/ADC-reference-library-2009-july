The basic          technique is to encapsulate the QuickDraw GX image in a compressed data format using the          object flattening functions from QuickDraw GX. Once the compressed image data is created,          it may be passed to the QuickDraw GX codec and drawn using the QuickTime image compression          functions or embedded within a QuickDraw picture and drawn using the DrawPicture function.          In either case, the compressed data is passed to the the low-level QuickDraw drawing          routines through the StdPix bottleneck routine. StdPix decompresses the data using the          QuickDraw GX codec and passes the decompressed data to the bitsProc bottleneck routine          when rendering the image.</P>                  <P>LaserWriter drivers starting with version 8.3 recognize compressed data that may          be drawn using QuickTime, like QuickDraw GX flattened objects. For Mac OS 8.0, the          LaserWriter driver has been modified to render the QuickDraw GX data at the device          resolution of the printer. When despooling, the printer driver changes the resolution          of the offscreen drawing port and uses the QuicDraw GX codec to rasterize the compressed data.          The QuickDraw printer drivers from Apple render the compressed data during spooling and use          the resolution of the active graphics port. Application developers may wish to use the device          resolution commands of the <CODE>PrGeneral</CODE> routine to improve the quality of their printed images          as described in "Meet PrGeneral, the Trap That Makes the Most of the Printing Manager,"          in <a href="http://developer.apple.com/dev/techsupport/develop/issue03toc.shtml"><I>develop</I> 3</A>.</P>                  <H3>General Changes For All Applications</H3>                  <P>The sample code for this Technote includes updated versions of three QuickDraw GX          user libraries, <CODE>CodecLibrary</CODE>, <CODE>PrintingLibrary</CODE>, and <CODE>StorageLibrary</CODE>,          that may be used to          simplify the conversion of your software. The TwoFace sample application supports the          basic job, format, dialog, and spooling functions of the QuickDraw GX Printing Manager.          It uses an abstraction layer provided by the <CODE>PrintingLibrary</CODE> to handle printing through          the QuickDraw GX and classic QuickDraw printing architectures, depending on which environment          is available when the application is launched. All the changes described in this section are          handled automatically by the user libraries if you simply convert any references to the          QuickDraw GX Printing Manager, including the gxJob and gxFormat data types, to the equivalent          functions and data types of the <CODE>PrintingLibrary</CODE>.</P>                  <OL TYPE="1" START="1">    <LI>Check the correct gestalt selector.

Unfortunately,          under the new GX model , GX extensions are no longer available. Some of the functionality that          developers have used GX extensions for can be rolled into classic applications or drivers, but          that will have to be determined by the developer on a case-by-case basis.</p>          <BR>            <BR><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P>         <A NAME="Section5"></A>                  <h2>GX Printer Driver Changes</H2>                  <p>Under the new GX model, GX printer drivers will no longer be supported.

In addition, QuickDraw GX data printed to the Apple         Color LaserWriter may be printed at less than full printer resolution. These problems will be         addressed in future versions of printer drivers from Apple and other vendors. </li>    <LI>With ATM 4.0.2, some PDF documents that use ATM substitution fonts may not print correctly using the         LaserWriter 8 driver. This problem will be fixed in a future version of LaserWriter 8 which will be         available in late summer 1997.</li>    <LI>ATM 3.8.3 and 4.0 do not currently recognize that QuickDraw GX is installed when the GXGraphics      extension is in your user's system. This causes problems with Type-1 enabled fonts. This problem has been      fixed with the 4.0.2 release of ATM by Adobe Systems. Check with Adobe for a newer version of ATM Deluxe.</li>    <LI>Some older QuickDraw pictures with embedded QuickDraw GX data may print with random noise in the         background of the picture. This problem will be fixed in a future version of QuickTime.</li>    <LI>Some QuickDraw GX data may print incorrectly in low memory conditions. You may notice that parts of         the image repeat rather than the entire image printing correctly. This problem is in the QuickDraw GX         QuickTime Codec and will be fixed in a future version of QuickTime.</li></UL>                   <BR><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P>              <A NAME="Section9"></A>                  <h2>Where to Get GXGraphics 1.1.6 and How to License it</H2>         <P>The GXGraphics 1.1.6 extension:</P><UL TYPE=DISC>    <LI>GXGraphics 1.1.6 is only available as part of the MacOS 8.0 package.
