<b>NAME</b>
       DBD::DBM - a DBI driver for DBM &amp; MLDBM files

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
        use DBI;
        $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:DBM:');                # defaults to SDBM_File
        $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('DBI:DBM(RaiseError=1):');  # defaults to SDBM_File
        $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:DBM:type=GDBM_File');  # defaults to GDBM_File
        $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:DBM:mldbm=Storable');  # MLDBM with SDBM_File
                                                        # and Storable

       or

        $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:DBM:', undef, undef);
        $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:DBM:', undef, undef, { dbm_type =&gt; 'ODBM_File' });

       and other variations on <u>connect()</u> as shown in the DBI docs and with the dbm_ attributes shown below

       ... and then use standard DBI prepare, execute, fetch, placeholders, etc., see "QUICK START" for an
       example

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       DBD::DBM is a database management sytem that can work right out of the box.  If you have a standard
       installation of Perl and a standard installation of DBI, you can begin creating, accessing, and
       modifying database tables without any further installation.  You can also add some other modules to
       it for more robust capabilities if you wish.

       The module uses a DBM file storage layer.  DBM file storage is common on many platforms and files can
       be created with it in many languges.  That means that, in addition to creating files with DBI/SQL,
       you can also use DBI/SQL to access and modify files created by other DBM modules and programs.  You
       can also use those programs to access files created with DBD::DBM.

       DBM files are stored in binary format optimized for quick retrieval when using a key field.  That
       optimization can be used advantageously to make DBD::DBM SQL operations that use key fields very
       fast.  There are several different "flavors" of DBM - different storage formats supported by
       different sorts of perl modules such as SDBM_File and MLDBM.  This module supports all of the flavors
       that perl supports and, when used with MLDBM, supports tables with any number of columns and
       insertion of Perl objects into tables.

       DBD::DBM has been tested with the following DBM types: SDBM_File, NDBM_File, ODBM_File, GDBM_File,
       DB_File, BerekeleyDB.  Each type was tested both with and without MLDBM.

<b>QUICK</b> <b>START</b>
       DBD::DBM operates like all other DBD drivers - it's basic syntax and operation is specified by DBI.
       If you're not familiar with DBI, you should start by reading DBI and the documents it points to and
       then come back and read this file.  If you are familiar with DBI, you already know most of what you
       need to know to operate this module.  Just jump in and create a test script something like the one
       shown below.

       You should be aware that there are several options for the SQL engine underlying DBD::DBM, see
       "Supported SQL syntax".  There are also many options for DBM support, see especially the section on
       "Adding multi-column support with MLDBM".

       But here's a sample to get you started.

        use DBI;
        my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:DBM:');
        $dbh-&gt;{RaiseError} = 1;
        for my $sql( split /;\n+/,"
            CREATE TABLE user ( user_name TEXT, phone TEXT );
            INSERT INTO user VALUES ('Fred Bloggs','233-7777');
            INSERT INTO user VALUES ('Sanjay Patel','777-3333');
            INSERT INTO user VALUES ('Junk','xxx-xxxx');
            DELETE FROM user WHERE user_name = 'Junk';
            UPDATE user SET phone = '999-4444' WHERE user_name = 'Sanjay Patel';
            SELECT * FROM user
        "){
            my $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare($sql);
            $sth-&gt;execute;
            $sth-&gt;dump_results if $sth-&gt;{NUM_OF_FIELDS};
        }
        $dbh-&gt;disconnect;

<b>USAGE</b>
       <b>Specifiying</b> <b>Files</b> <b>and</b> <b>Directories</b>

       DBD::DBM will automatically supply an appropriate file extension for the type of DBM you are using.
       For example, if you use SDBM_File, a table called "fruit" will be stored in two files called
       "fruit.pag" and "fruit.dir".  You should <u>never</u> specify the file extensions in your SQL statements.

       However, I am not aware (and therefore DBD::DBM is not aware) of all possible extensions for various
       DBM types.  If your DBM type uses an extension other than .pag and .dir, you should set the <u>dbm</u><b>_</b><u>ext</u>
       attribute to the extension. <b>And</b> you should write me with the name of the implementation and extension
       so I can add it to DBD::DBM!  Thanks in advance for that :-).

           $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:DBM:ext=.db');  # .db extension is used
           $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:DBM:ext=');     # no extension is used

       or

           $dbh-&gt;{dbm_ext}='.db';                      # global setting
           $dbh-&gt;{dbm_tables}-&gt;{'qux'}-&gt;{ext}='.db';   # setting for table 'qux'

       By default files are assumed to be in the current working directory.  To have the module look in a
       different directory, specify the <u>f</u><b>_</b><u>dir</u> attribute in either the connect string or by setting the
       database handle attribute.

       For example, this will look for the file /foo/bar/fruit (or /foo/bar/fruit.pag for DBM types that use
       that extension)

          my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:DBM:f_dir=/foo/bar');
          my $ary = $dbh-&gt;selectall_arrayref(q{ SELECT * FROM fruit });

       And this will too:

          my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:DBM:');
          $dbh-&gt;{f_dir} = '/foo/bar';
          my $ary = $dbh-&gt;selectall_arrayref(q{ SELECT x FROM fruit });

       You can also use delimited identifiers to specify paths directly in SQL statements.  This looks in
       the same place as the two examples above but without setting <u>f</u><b>_</b><u>dir</u>:

          my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:DBM:');
          my $ary = $dbh-&gt;selectall_arrayref(q{
              SELECT x FROM "/foo/bar/fruit"
          });

       If you have SQL::Statement installed, you can use table aliases:

          my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:DBM:');
          my $ary = $dbh-&gt;selectall_arrayref(q{
              SELECT f.x FROM "/foo/bar/fruit" AS f
          });

       See the "GOTCHAS AND WARNINGS" for using DROP on tables.

       <b>Table</b> <b>locking</b> <b>and</b> <u>flock()</u>

       Table locking is accomplished using a lockfile which has the same name as the table's file but with
       the file extension '.lck' (or a lockfile extension that you suppy, see belwo).  This file is created
       along with the table during a CREATE and removed during a DROP.  Every time the table itself is
       opened, the lockfile is <u>flocked()</u>.  For SELECT, this is an shared lock.  For all other operations, it
       is an exclusive lock.

       Since the locking depends on <u>flock()</u>, it only works on operating systems that support <u>flock()</u>.  In
       cases where <u>flock()</u> is not implemented, DBD::DBM will not complain, it will simply behave as if the
       <u>flock()</u> had occurred although no actual locking will happen.  Read the documentation for <u>flock()</u> if
       you need to understand this.

       Even on those systems that do support <u>flock()</u>, the locking is only advisory - as is allways the case
       with <u>flock()</u>.  This means that if some other program tries to access the table while DBD::DBM has the
       table locked, that other program will *succeed* at opening the table.  DBD::DBM's locking only
       applies to DBD::DBM.  An exception to this would be the situation in which you use a lockfile with
       the other program that has the same name as the lockfile used in DBD::DBM and that program also uses
       <u>flock()</u> on that lockfile.  In that case, DBD::DBM and your other program will respect each other's
       locks.

       If you wish to use a lockfile extension other than '.lck', simply specify the dbm_lockfile attribute:

         $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:DBM:lockfile=.foo');
         $dbh-&gt;{dbm_lockfile} = '.foo';
         $dbh-&gt;{dbm_tables}-&gt;{qux}-&gt;{lockfile} = '.foo';

       If you wish to disable locking, set the dbm_lockfile equal to 0.

         $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:DBM:lockfile=0');
         $dbh-&gt;{dbm_lockfile} = 0;
         $dbh-&gt;{dbm_tables}-&gt;{qux}-&gt;{lockfile} = 0;

       <b>Specifying</b> <b>the</b> <b>DBM</b> <b>type</b>

       Each "flavor" of DBM stores its files in a different format and has different capabilities and
       different limitations.  See AnyDBM_File for a comparison of DBM types.

       By default, DBD::DBM uses the SDBM_File type of storage since SDBM_File comes with Perl itself.  But
       if you have other types of DBM storage available, you can use any of them with DBD::DBM also.

       You can specify the DBM type using the "dbm_type" attribute which can be set in the connection string
       or with the $dbh-&gt;{dbm_type} attribute for global settings or with the
       $dbh-&gt;{dbm_tables}-&gt;{$table_name}-&gt;{type} attribute for per-table settings in cases where a single
       script is accessing more than one kind of DBM file.

       In the connection string, just set type=TYPENAME where TYPENAME is any DBM type such as GDBM_File,
       DB_File, etc.  Do <u>not</u> use MLDBM as your dbm_type, that is set differently, see below.

        my $dbh=DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:DBM:');               # uses the default SDBM_File
        my $dbh=DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:DBM:type=GDBM_File'); # uses the GDBM_File

       You can also use $dbh-&gt;{dbm_type} to set global DBM type:

        $dbh-&gt;{dbm_type} = 'GDBM_File';  # set the global DBM type
        print $dbh-&gt;{dbm_type};          # display the global DBM type

       If you are going to have several tables in your script that come from different DBM types, you can
       use the $dbh-&gt;{dbm_tables} hash to store different settings for the various tables.  You can even use
       this to perform joins on files that have completely different storage mechanisms.

        my $dbh-&gt;('dbi:DBM:type=GDBM_File');
        #
        # sets global default of GDBM_File

        my $dbh-&gt;{dbm_tables}-&gt;{foo}-&gt;{type} = 'DB_File';
        #
        # over-rides the global setting, but only for the table called "foo"

        print $dbh-&gt;{dbm_tables}-&gt;{foo}-&gt;{type};
        #
        # prints the dbm_type for the table "foo"

       <b>Adding</b> <b>multi-column</b> <b>support</b> <b>with</b> <b>MLDBM</b>

       Most of the DBM types only support two columns.  However a CPAN module called MLDBM overcomes this
       limitation by allowing more than two columns.  It does this by serializing the data - basically it
       puts a reference to an array into the second column.  It can also put almost any kind of Perl object
       or even Perl coderefs into columns.

       If you want more than two columns, you must install MLDBM.  It's available for many platforms and is
       easy to install.

       MLDBM can use three different modules to serialize the column - Data::Dumper, Storable, and
       FreezeThaw.  Data::Dumper is the default, Storable is the fastest.  MLDBM can also make use of user-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">defined&nbsp;userdefined</font>
       defined serialization methods.  All of this is available to you through DBD::DBM with just one
       attribute setting.

       To use MLDBM with DBD::DBM, you need to set the dbm_mldbm attribute to the name of the serialization
       module.

       Some examples:

        $dbh=DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:DBM:mldbm=Storable');  # use MLDBM with Storable
        $dbh=DBI-&gt;connect(
           'dbi:DBM:mldbm=MySerializer'           # use MLDBM with a user defined module
        );
        $dbh-&gt;{dbm_mldbm} = 'MySerializer';       # same as above
        print $dbh-&gt;{dbm_mldbm}                   # show the MLDBM serializer
        $dbh-&gt;{dbm_tables}-&gt;{foo}-&gt;{mldbm}='Data::Dumper';   # set Data::Dumper for table "foo"
        print $dbh-&gt;{dbm_tables}-&gt;{foo}-&gt;{mldbm}; # show serializer for table "foo"

       MLDBM works on top of other DBM modules so you can also set a DBM type along with setting dbm_mldbm.
       The examples above would default to using SDBM_File with MLDBM.  If you wanted GDBM_File instead,
       here's how:

        $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:DBM:type=GDBM_File;mldbm=Storable');
        #
        # uses GDBM_File with MLDBM and Storable

       SDBM_File, the default file type is quite limited, so if you are going to use MLDBM, you should
       probably use a different type, see AnyDBM_File.

       See below for some "GOTCHAS AND WARNINGS" about MLDBM.

       <b>Support</b> <b>for</b> <b>Berkeley</b> <b>DB</b>

       The Berkeley DB storage type is supported through two different Perl modules - DB_File (which
       supports only features in old versions of Berkeley DB) and BerkeleyDB (which supports all versions).
       DBD::DBM supports specifying either "DB_File" or "BerkeleyDB" as a <u>dbm</u><b>_</b><u>type</u>, with or without MLDBM
       support.

       The "BerkeleyDB" dbm_type is experimental and its interface is likely to chagne.  It currently
       defaults to BerkeleyDB::Hash and does not currently support ::Btree or ::Recno.

       With BerkeleyDB, you can specify initialization flags by setting them in your script like this:

        my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:DBM:type=BerkeleyDB;mldbm=Storable');
        use BerkeleyDB;
        my $env = new BerkeleyDB::Env -Home =&gt; $dir;  # and/or other Env flags
        $dbh-&gt;{dbm_berkeley_flags} = {
             'DB_CREATE'  =&gt; DB_CREATE  # pass in constants
           , 'DB_RDONLY'  =&gt; DB_RDONLY  # pass in constants
           , '-Cachesize' =&gt; 1000       # set a ::Hash flag
           , '-Env'       =&gt; $env       # pass in an environment
        };

       Do <u>not</u> set the -Flags or -Filename flags, those are determined by the SQL (e.g. -Flags =&gt; DB_RDONLY
       is set automatically when you issue a SELECT statement).

       Time has not permitted me to provide support in this release of DBD::DBM for further Berkeley DB
       features such as transactions, concurrency, locking, etc.  I will be working on these in the future
       and would value suggestions, patches, etc.

       See DB_File and BerkeleyDB for further details.

       <b>Supported</b> <b>SQL</b> <b>syntax</b>

       DBD::DBM uses a subset of SQL.  The robustness of that subset depends on what other modules you have
       installed. Both options support basic SQL operations including CREATE TABLE, DROP TABLE, INSERT,
       DELETE, UPDATE, and SELECT.

       <b>Option</b> <b>#1:</b> By default, this module inherits its SQL support from DBI::SQL::Nano that comes with DBI.
       Nano is, as its name implies, a *very* small SQL engine.  Although limited in scope, it is faster
       than option #2 for some operations.  See DBI::SQL::Nano for a description of the SQL it supports and
       comparisons of it with option #2.

       <b>Option</b> <b>#2:</b> If you install the pure Perl CPAN module SQL::Statement, DBD::DBM will use it instead of
       Nano.  This adds support for table aliases, for functions, for joins, and much more.  If you're going
       to use DBD::DBM for anything other than very simple tables and queries, you should install
       SQL::Statement.  You don't have to change DBD::DBM or your scripts in any way, simply installing
       SQL::Statement will give you the more robust SQL capabilities without breaking scripts written for
       DBI::SQL::Nano.  See SQL::Statement for a description of the SQL it supports.

       To find out which SQL module is working in a given script, you can use the <u>dbm</u><b>_</b><u>versions()</u> method or,
       if you don't need the full output and version numbers, just do this:

        print $dbh-&gt;{sql_handler};

       That will print out either "SQL::Statement" or "DBI::SQL::Nano".

       <b>Optimizing</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>key</b> <b>fields</b>

       Most "flavors" of DBM have only two physical columns (but can contain multiple logical columns as
       explained below).  They work similarly to a Perl hash with the first column serving as the key.  Like
       a Perl hash, DBM files permit you to do quick lookups by specifying the key and thus avoid looping
       through all records.  Also like a Perl hash, the keys must be unique.  It is impossible to create two
       records with the same key.  To put this all more simply and in SQL terms, the key column functions as
       the PRIMARY KEY.

       In DBD::DBM, you can take advantage of the speed of keyed lookups by using a WHERE clause with a
       single equal comparison on the key field.  For example, the following SQL statements are optimized
       for keyed lookup:

        CREATE TABLE user ( user_name TEXT, phone TEXT);
        INSERT INTO user VALUES ('Fred Bloggs','233-7777');
        # ... many more inserts
        SELECT phone FROM user WHERE user_name='Fred Bloggs';

       The "user_name" column is the key column since it is the first column. The SELECT statement uses the
       key column in a single equal comparision - "user_name='Fred Bloggs' - so the search will find it very
       quickly without having to loop through however many names were inserted into the table.

       In contrast, thes searches on the same table are not optimized:

        1. SELECT phone FROM user WHERE user_name &lt; 'Fred';
        2. SELECT user_name FROM user WHERE phone = '233-7777';

       In #1, the operation uses a less-than (&lt;) comparison rather than an equals comparison, so it will not
       be optimized for key searching.  In #2, the key field "user_name" is not specified in the WHERE
       clause, and therefore the search will need to loop through all rows to find the desired result.

       <b>Specifying</b> <b>Column</b> <b>Names</b>

       DBM files don't have a standard way to store column names.   DBD::DBM gets around this issue with a
       DBD::DBM specific way of storing the column names.  <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>only</b> <b>with</b> <b>DBD::DBM</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b>
       <b>using</b> <b>files</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> <b>or</b> <b>accessed</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>DBM</b> <b>programs,</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>ignore</b> <b>this</b> <b>section.</b>

       DBD::DBM stores column names as a row in the file with the key <b>_</b><u>metadata</u> <u>\0</u>.  So this code

        my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:DBM:');
        $dbh-&gt;do("CREATE TABLE baz (foo <!-- a -->CHAR(10)<!-- /a -->, bar INTEGER)");
        $dbh-&gt;do("INSERT INTO baz (foo,bar) VALUES ('zippy',1)");

       Will create a file that has a structure something like this:

         _metadata \0 | foo,bar
         zippy        | 1

       The next time you access this table with DBD::DBM, it will treat the _metadata row as a header rather
       than as data and will pull the column names from there.  However, if you access the file with
       something other than DBD::DBM, the row will be treated as a regular data row.

       If you do not want the column names stored as a data row in the table you can set the
       <u>dbm</u><b>_</b><u>store</u><b>_</b><u>metadata</u> attribute to 0.

        my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:DBM:store_metadata=0');

       or

        $dbh-&gt;{dbm_store_metadata} = 0;

       or, for per-table setting

        $dbh-&gt;{dbm_tables}-&gt;{qux}-&gt;{store_metadata} = 0;

       By default, DBD::DBM assumes that you have two columns named "k" and "v" (short for "key" and
       "value").  So if you have <u>dbm</u><b>_</b><u>store</u><b>_</b><u>metadata</u> set to 1 and you want to use alternate column names, you
       need to specify the column names like this:

        my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:DBM:store_metadata=0;cols=foo,bar');

       or

        $dbh-&gt;{dbm_store_metadata} = 0;
        $dbh-&gt;{dbm_cols}           = 'foo,bar';

       To set the column names on per-table basis, do this:

        $dbh-&gt;{dbm_tables}-&gt;{qux}-&gt;{store_metadata} = 0;
        $dbh-&gt;{dbm_tables}-&gt;{qux}-&gt;{cols}           = 'foo,bar';
        #
        # sets the column names only for table "qux"

       If you have a file that was created by another DBM program or created with <u>dbm</u><b>_</b><u>store</u><b>_</b><u>metadata</u> set to
       zero and you want to convert it to using DBD::DBM's column name storage, just use one of the methods
       above to name the columns but *without* specifying <u>dbm</u><b>_</b><u>store</u><b>_</b><u>metadata</u> as zero.  You only have to do
       that once - thereafter you can get by without setting either <u>dbm</u><b>_</b><u>store</u><b>_</b><u>metadata</u> or setting <u>dbm</u><b>_</b><u>cols</u>
       because the names will be stored in the file.

       <b>Statement</b> <b>handle</b> <b>($sth)</b> <b>attributes</b> <b>and</b> <b>methods</b>

       Most statement handle attributes such as NAME, NUM_OF_FIELDS, etc. are available only after an
       execute.  The same is true of $sth-&gt;rows which is available after the execute but does <u>not</u> require a
       fetch.

       <b>The</b> <b>$dbh</b>-&gt;<u>dbm</u><b>_</b><u>versions()</u> <u>method</u>

       The private method <u>dbm</u><b>_</b><u>versions()</u> presents a summary of what other modules are being used at any
       given time.  DBD::DBM can work with or without many other modules - it can use either SQL::Statement
       or DBI::SQL::Nano as its SQL engine, it can be run with DBI or DBI::PurePerl, it can use many kinds
       of DBM modules, and many kinds of serializers when run with MLDBM.  The <u>dbm</u><b>_</b><u>versions()</u> method reports
       on all of that and more.

         print $dbh-&gt;dbm_versions;               # displays global settings
         print $dbh-&gt;dbm_versions($table_name);  # displays per table settings

       An important thing to note about this method is that when called with no arguments, it displays the
       *global* settings.  If you over-ride these by setting per-table attributes, these will <u>not</u> be shown
       unless you specifiy a table name as an argument to the method call.

       <b>Storing</b> <b>Objects</b>

       If you are using MLDBM, you can use DBD::DBM to take advantage of its serializing abilities to
       serialize any Perl object that MLDBM can handle.  To store objects in columns, you should (but don't
       absolutely need to) declare it as a column of type BLOB (the type is *currently* ignored by the SQL
       engine, but heh, it's good form).

       You *must* use placeholders to insert or refer to the data.

<b>GOTCHAS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>WARNINGS</b>
       Using the SQL DROP command will remove any file that has the name specified in the command with
       either '.pag' or '.dir' or your {dbm_ext} appended to it.  So this be dangerous if you aren't sure
       what file it refers to:

        $dbh-&gt;do(qq{DROP TABLE "/path/to/any/file"});

       Each DBM type has limitations.  SDBM_File, for example, can only store values of less than 1,000
       characters.  *You* as the script author must ensure that you don't exceed those bounds.  If you try
       to insert a value that is bigger than the DBM can store, the results will be unpredictable.  See the
       documentation for whatever DBM you are using for details.

       Different DBM implementations return records in different orders.  That means that you can <u>not</u> depend
       on the order of records unless you use an ORDER BY statement.  DBI::SQL::Nano does not currently
       support ORDER BY (though it may soon) so if you need ordering, you'll have to install SQL::Statement.

       DBM data files are platform-specific.  To move them from one platform to another, you'll need to do
       something along the lines of dumping your data to CSV on platform #1 and then dumping from CSV to DBM
       on platform #2.  DBD::AnyData and DBD::CSV can help with that.  There may also be DBM conversion
       tools for your platforms which would probably be quickest.

       When using MLDBM, there is a very powerful serializer - it will allow you to store Perl code or
       objects in database columns.  When these get de-serialized, they may be evaled - in other words MLDBM
       (or actually Data::Dumper when used by MLDBM) may take the values and try to execute them in Perl.
       Obviously, this can present dangers, so if you don't know what's in a file, be careful before you
       access it with MLDBM turned on!

       See the entire section on "Table locking and <u>flock()</u>" for gotchas and warnings about the use of
       <u>flock()</u>.

<b>GETTING</b> <b>HELP,</b> <b>MAKING</b> <b>SUGGESTIONS,</b> <b>AND</b> <b>REPORTING</b> <b>BUGS</b>
       If you need help installing or using DBD::DBM, please write to the DBI users mailing list at
       dbi-users@perl.org or to the comp.lang.perl.modules newsgroup on usenet.  I'm afraid I can't always
       answer these kinds of questions quickly and there are many on the mailing list or in the newsgroup
       who can.

       If you have suggestions, ideas for improvements, or bugs to report, please write me directly at the
       email shown below.

       When reporting bugs, please send the output of $dbh-&gt;dbm_versions($table) for a table that exhibits
       the bug and, if possible, as small a sample as you can make of the code that produces the bug.  And
       of course, patches are welcome too :-).
