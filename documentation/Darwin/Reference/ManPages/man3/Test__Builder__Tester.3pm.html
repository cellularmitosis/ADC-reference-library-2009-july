Test::Builder::Tester(3pm)            Perl Programmers Reference Guide            Test::Builder::Tester(3pm)



<b>NAME</b>
       Test::Builder::Tester - test testsuites that have been built with Test::Builder

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
           use Test::Builder::Tester tests =&gt; 1;
           use Test::More;

           test_out("not ok 1 - foo");
           test_fail(+1);
           fail("foo");
           test_test("fail works");

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       A module that helps you test testing modules that are built with <b>Test::Builder</b>.

       The testing system is designed to be used by performing a three step process for each test you wish
       to test.  This process starts with using "test_out" and "test_err" in advance to declare what the
       testsuite you are testing will output with <b>Test::Builder</b> to stdout and stderr.

       You then can run the <!-- a -->test(s)<!-- /a --> from your test suite that call <b>Test::Builder</b>.  At this point the output
       of <b>Test::Builder</b> is safely captured by <b>Test::Builder::Tester</b> rather than being interpreted as real
       test output.

       The final stage is to call "test_test" that will simply compare what you predeclared to what
       <b>Test::Builder</b> actually outputted, and report the results back with a "ok" or "not ok" (with debug-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ging)&nbsp;debugging)</font>
       ging) to the normal output.

       <b>Methods</b>

       These are the six methods that are exported as default.

       test_out
       test_err
           Procedures for predeclaring the output that your test suite is expected to produce until
           "test_test" is called.  These procedures automatically assume that each line terminates with
           "\n".  So

              test_out("ok 1","ok 2");

           is the same as

              test_out("ok 1\nok 2");

           which is even the same as

              test_out("ok 1");
              test_out("ok 2");

           Once "test_out" or "test_err" (or "test_fail" or "test_diag") have been called once all further
           output from <b>Test::Builder</b> will be captured by <b>Test::Builder::Tester</b>.  This means that your will
           not be able perform further tests to the normal output in the normal way until you call
           "test_test" (well, unless you manually meddle with the output filehandles)

       test_fail
           Because the standard failure message that <b>Test::Builder</b> produces whenever a test fails will be a
           common occurrence in your test error output, and because has changed between Test::Builder ver-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sions,&nbsp;versions,</font>
           sions, rather than forcing you to call "test_err" with the string all the time like so

               test_err("# Failed test ($0 at line ".line_num(+1).")");

           "test_fail" exists as a convenience method that can be called instead.  It takes one argument,
           the offset from the current line that the line that causes the fail is on.

               test_fail(+1);

           This means that the example in the synopsis could be rewritten more simply as:

              test_out("not ok 1 - foo");
              test_fail(+1);
              fail("foo");
              test_test("fail works");

       test_diag
           As most of the remaining expected output to the error stream will be created by Test::Builder's
           "diag" function, <b>Test::Builder::Tester</b> provides a convience function "test_diag" that you can use
           instead of "test_err".

           The "test_diag" function prepends comment hashes and spacing to the start and newlines to the end
           of the expected output passed to it and adds it to the list of expected error output.  So,
           instead of writing

              test_err("# Couldn't open file");

           you can write

              test_diag("Couldn't open file");

           Remember that <b>Test::Builder</b>'s diag function will not add newlines to the end of output and
           test_diag will. So to check

              Test::Builder-&gt;new-&gt;diag("foo\n","bar\n");

           You would do

             test_diag("foo","bar")

           without the newlines.

       test_test
           Actually performs the output check testing the tests, comparing the data (with "eq") that we have
           captured from <b>Test::Builder</b> against that that was declared with "test_out" and "test_err".

           This takes name/value pairs that effect how the test is run.

           title (synonym 'name', 'label')
               The name of the test that will be displayed after the "ok" or "not ok".

           skip_out
               Setting this to a true value will cause the test to ignore if the output sent by the test to
               the output stream does not match that declared with "test_out".

           skip_err
               Setting this to a true value will cause the test to ignore if the output sent by the test to
               the error stream does not match that declared with "test_err".

           As a convience, if only one argument is passed then this argument is assumed to be the name of
           the test (as in the above examples.)

           Once "test_test" has been run test output will be redirected back to the original filehandles
           that <b>Test::Builder</b> was connected to (probably STDOUT and STDERR,) meaning any further tests you
           run will function normally and cause success/errors for <b>Test::Harness</b>.

       line_num
           A utility function that returns the line number that the function was called on.  You can pass it
           an offset which will be added to the result.  This is very useful for working out the correct
           text of diagnostic methods that contain line numbers.

           Essentially this is the same as the "__LINE__" macro, but the "line_num(+3)" idiom is arguably
           nicer.

       In addition to the six exported functions there there exists one function that can only be accessed
       with a fully qualified function call.

       color
           When "test_test" is called and the output that your tests generate does not match that which you
           declared, "test_test" will print out debug information showing the two conflicting versions.  As
           this output itself is debug information it can be confusing which part of the output is from
           "test_test" and which was the original output from your original tests.  Also, it may be hard to
           spot things like extraneous whitespace at the end of lines that may cause your test to fail even
           though the output looks similar.

           To assist you, if you have the <b>Term::ANSIColor</b> module installed (which you should do by default
           from perl 5.005 onwards), "test_test" can colour the background of the debug information to dis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ambiguate&nbsp;disambiguate</font>
           ambiguate the different types of output. The debug output will have it's background coloured
           green and red.  The green part represents the text which is the same between the executed and
           actual output, the red shows which part differs.

           The "color" function determines if colouring should occur or not.  Passing it a true or false
           value will enable or disable colouring respectively, and the function called with no argument
           will return the current setting.

           To enable colouring from the command line, you can use the <b>Text::Builder::Tester::Color</b> module
           like so:

              perl -Mlib=Text::Builder::Tester::Color test.t

           Or by including the <b>Test::Builder::Tester::Color</b> module directly in the PERL5LIB.

<b>BUGS</b>
       Calls <b>Test::Builder</b>'s "no_ending" method turning off the ending tests.  This is needed as otherwise
       it will trip out because we've run more tests than we strictly should have and it'll register any
       failures we had that we were testing for as real failures.

       The color function doesn't work unless <b>Term::ANSIColor</b> is installed and is compatible with your ter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">minal.&nbsp;terminal.</font>
       minal.
