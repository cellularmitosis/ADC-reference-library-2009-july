<b>NAME</b>
     <b>ftp</b> -- Internet file transfer program

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
     <b>ftp</b> [<b>-46AadefginpRtvV</b>] [<b>-N</b> <u>netrc</u>] [<b>-o</b> <u>output</u>] [<b>-P</b> <u>port</u>] [<b>-q</b> <u>quittime</u>] [<b>-r</b> <u>retry</u>] [<b>-T</b> <u>dir</u>,<u>max</u>[,<u>inc</u>]]
         [[<u>user</u>@]<u>host</u> [<u>port</u>]] [[<u>user</u>@]<u>host</u>:[<u>path</u>][/]] [file:///<u>path</u>]
         [<a href="ftp://[user[:password]@]host[:port]/path[/][;type=X]]">ftp://[<u>user</u>[:<u>password</u>]@]<u>host</u>[:<u>port</u>]/<u>path</u>[/][;type=<u>X</u>]]</a> [<a href="http://[user[:password]@]host[:port]/path]">http://[<u>user</u>[:<u>password</u>]@]<u>host</u>[:<u>port</u>]/<u>path</u>]</a>
         [<u>...</u>]
     <b>ftp</b> <b>-u</b> <u>URL</u> <u>file</u> [<u>...</u>]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
     <b>ftp</b> is the user interface to the Internet standard File Transfer Protocol.  The program allows a user
     to transfer files to and from a remote network site.

     The last five arguments will fetch a file using the FTP or HTTP protocols, or by direct copying, into
     the current directory.  This is ideal for scripts.  Refer to <u>AUTO-FETCHING</u> <u>FILES</u> below for more infor-
     mation.

     Options may be specified at the command line, or to the command interpreter.

     <b>-4</b>       Forces <b>ftp</b> to only use IPv4 addresses.

     <b>-6</b>       Forces <b>ftp</b> to only use IPv6 addresses.

     <b>-A</b>       Force active mode ftp.  By default, <b>ftp</b> will try to use passive mode ftp and fall back to
              active mode if passive is not supported by the server.  This option causes <b>ftp</b> to always use
              an active connection.  It is only useful for connecting to very old servers that do not imple-
              ment passive mode properly.

     <b>-a</b>       Causes <b>ftp</b> to bypass normal login procedure, and use an anonymous login instead.

     <b>-d</b>       Enables debugging.

     <b>-e</b>       Disables command line editing.  This is useful for Emacs ange-ftp mode.

     <b>-f</b>       Forces a cache reload for transfers that go through the FTP or HTTP proxies.

     <b>-g</b>       Disables file name globbing.

     <b>-i</b>       Turns off interactive prompting during multiple file transfers.

     <b>-n</b>       Restrains <b>ftp</b> from attempting ``auto-login'' upon initial connection for non auto-fetch trans-
              fers.  If auto-login is enabled, <b>ftp</b> will check the <u>.netrc</u> (see below) file in the user's home
              directory for an entry describing an account on the remote machine.  If no entry exists, <b>ftp</b>
              will prompt for the remote machine login name (default is the user identity on the local
              machine), and, if necessary, prompt for a password and an account with which to login.  To
              override the auto-login for auto-fetch transfers, specify the username (and optionally, pass-
              word) as appropriate.

     <b>-N</b> <u>netrc</u>
              Use <u>netrc</u> instead of <u>~/.netrc</u>.  Refer to <u>THE</u> <u>.netrc</u> <u>FILE</u> for more information.

     <b>-o</b> <u>output</u>
              When auto-fetching files, save the contents in <u>output</u>.  <u>output</u> is parsed according to the <u>FILE</u>
              <u>NAMING</u> <u>CONVENTIONS</u> below.  If <u>output</u> is not `-' or doesn't start with `|', then only the first
              file specified will be retrieved into <u>output</u>; all other files will be retrieved into the base-
              name of their remote name.

     <b>-p</b>       Enable passive mode operation for use behind connection filtering firewalls.  This option has
              been deprecated as <b>ftp</b> now tries to use passive mode by default, falling back to active mode
              if the server does not support passive connections.

     <b>-P</b> <u>port</u>  Sets the port number to <u>port</u>.

     <b>-r</b> <u>wait</u>  Retry the connection attempt if it failed, pausing for <u>wait</u> seconds.

     <b>-q</b> <u>quittime</u>
              Quit if the connection has stalled for <u>quittime</u> seconds.

     <b>-R</b>       Restart all non-proxied auto-fetches.

     <b>-t</b>       Enables packet tracing.

     <b>-T</b> <u>direction</u>,<u>maximum</u>[,<u>increment</u>]
              Set the maximum transfer rate for <u>direction</u> to <u>maximum</u> bytes/second, and if specified, the
              increment to <u>increment</u> bytes/second.  Refer to <b>rate</b> for more information.

     <b>-u</b> <u>URL</u> <u>file</u> [...]
              Upload files on the command line to <u>URL</u> where <u>URL</u> is one of the ftp URL types as supported by
              auto-fetch (with an optional target filename for single file uploads), and <u>file</u> is one or more
              local files to be uploaded.

     <b>-v</b>       Enable <b>verbose</b> and <b>progress</b>.  This is the default if output is to a terminal (and in the case
              of <b>progress</b>, <b>ftp</b> is the foreground process).  Forces <b>ftp</b> to show all responses from the remote
              server, as well as report on data transfer statistics.

     <b>-V</b>       Disable <b>verbose</b> and <b>progress</b>, overriding the default of enabled when output is to a terminal.

     The client host with which <b>ftp</b> is to communicate may be specified on the command line.  If this is
     done, <b>ftp</b> will immediately attempt to establish a connection to an FTP server on that host; otherwise,
     <b>ftp</b> will enter its command interpreter and await instructions from the user.  When <b>ftp</b> is awaiting com-
     mands from the user the prompt `ftp&gt;' is provided to the user.  The following commands are recognized
     by <b>ftp</b>:

     <b>!</b> [<u>command</u> [<u>args</u>]]
                 Invoke an interactive shell on the local machine.  If there are arguments, the first is
                 taken to be a command to execute directly, with the rest of the arguments as its arguments.

     <b>$</b> <u>macro-name</u> [<u>args</u>]
                 Execute the macro <u>macro-name</u> that was defined with the <b>macdef</b> command.  Arguments are
                 passed to the macro unglobbed.

     <b>account</b> [<u>passwd</u>]
                 Supply a supplemental password required by a remote system for access to resources once a
                 login has been successfully completed.  If no argument is included, the user will be
                 prompted for an account password in a non-echoing input mode.

     <b>append</b> <u>local-file</u> [<u>remote-file</u>]
                 Append a local file to a file on the remote machine.  If <u>remote-file</u> is left unspecified,
                 the local file name is used in naming the remote file after being altered by any <b>ntrans</b> or
                 <b>nmap</b> setting.  File transfer uses the current settings for <b>type</b>, <b>format</b>, <b>mode</b>, and
                 <b>structure</b>.

     <b>ascii</b>       Set the file transfer <b>type</b> to network ASCII.  This is the default type.

     <b>bell</b>        Arrange that a bell be sounded after each file transfer command is completed.

     <b>binary</b>      Set the file transfer <b>type</b> to support binary image transfer.

     <b>bye</b>         Terminate the FTP session with the remote server and exit <b>ftp</b>.  An end of file will also
                 terminate the session and exit.

     <b>case</b>        Toggle remote computer file name case mapping during <b>get</b>, <b>mget</b> and <b>mput</b> commands.  When
                 <b>case</b> is on (default is off), remote computer file names with all letters in upper case are
                 written in the local directory with the letters mapped to lower case.

     <b>cd</b> <u>remote-directory</u>
                 Change the working directory on the remote machine to <u>remote-directory</u>.

     <b>cdup</b>        Change the remote machine working directory to the parent of the current remote machine
                 working directory.

     <b>chmod</b> <u>mode</u> <u>remote-file</u>
                 Change the permission modes of the file <u>remote-file</u> on the remote system to <u>mode</u>.

     <b>close</b>       Terminate the FTP session with the remote server, and return to the command interpreter.
                 Any defined macros are erased.

     <b>cr</b>          Toggle carriage return stripping during ascii type file retrieval.  Records are denoted by
                 a carriage return/linefeed sequence during ascii type file transfer.  When <b>cr</b> is on (the
                 default), carriage returns are stripped from this sequence to conform with the UNIX single
                 linefeed record delimiter.  Records on non-UNIX remote systems may contain single line-
                 feeds; when an ascii type transfer is made, these linefeeds may be distinguished from a
                 record delimiter only when <b>cr</b> is off.

     <b>debug</b> [<u>debug-value</u>]
                 Toggle debugging mode.  If an optional <u>debug-value</u> is specified it is used to set the
                 debugging level.  When debugging is on, <b>ftp</b> prints each command sent to the remote machine,
                 preceded by the string `--&gt;'

     <b>delete</b> <u>remote-file</u>
                 Delete the file <u>remote-file</u> on the remote machine.

     <b>dir</b> [<u>remote-path</u> [<u>local-file</u>]]
                 Print a listing of the contents of a directory on the remote machine.  The listing includes
                 any system-dependent information that the server chooses to include; for example, most UNIX
                 systems will produce output from the command `ls -l'.  If <u>remote-path</u> is left unspecified,
                 the current working directory is used.  If interactive prompting is on, <b>ftp</b> will prompt the
                 user to verify that the last argument is indeed the target local file for receiving <b>dir</b>
                 output.  If no local file is specified, or if <u>local-file</u> is `<b>-</b>', the output is sent to the
                 terminal.

     <b>disconnect</b>  A synonym for <b>close</b>.

     <b>edit</b>        Toggle command line editing, and context sensitive command and file completion.  This is
                 automatically enabled if input is from a terminal, and disabled otherwise.

     <b>epsv4</b>       Toggle the use of the extended EPSV and EPRT commands on IPv4 connections; first try EPSV /
                 EPRT, and then PASV / PORT.  This is enabled by default.  If an extended command fails then
                 this option will be temporarily disabled for the duration of the current connection, or
                 until <b>epsv4</b> is executed again.

     <b>exit</b>        A synonym for <b>bye</b>.

     <b>features</b>    Display what features the remote server supports (using the FEAT command).

     <b>fget</b> <u>localfile</u>
                 Retrieve the files listed in <u>localfile</u>, which has one line per filename.

     <b>form</b> <u>format</u>
                 Set the file transfer <b>form</b> to <u>format</u>.  The default (and only supported) format is
                 ``non-print''.

     <b>ftp</b> <u>host</u> [<u>port</u>]
                 A synonym for <b>open</b>.

     <b>gate</b> [<u>host</u> [<u>port</u>]]
                 Toggle gate-ftp mode, which used to connect through the TIS FWTK and Gauntlet ftp proxies.
                 This will not be permitted if the gate-ftp server hasn't been set (either explicitly by the
                 user, or from the FTPSERVER environment variable).  If <u>host</u> is given, then gate-ftp mode
                 will be enabled, and the gate-ftp server will be set to <u>host</u>.  If <u>port</u> is also given, that
                 will be used as the port to connect to on the gate-ftp server.

     <b>get</b> <u>remote-file</u> [<u>local-file</u>]
                 Retrieve the <u>remote-file</u> and store it on the local machine.  If the local file name is not
                 specified, it is given the same name it has on the remote machine, subject to alteration by
                 the current <b>case</b>, <b>ntrans</b>, and <b>nmap</b> settings.  The current settings for <b>type</b>, <b>form</b>, <b>mode</b>,
                 and <b>structure</b> are used while transferring the file.

     <b>glob</b>        Toggle filename expansion for <b>mdelete</b>, <b>mget</b>, <b>mput</b>, and <b>mreget</b>.  If globbing is turned off
                 with <b>glob</b>, the file name arguments are taken literally and not expanded.  Globbing for <b>mput</b>
                 is done as in <a href="csh.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/csh">csh(1)</a>.  For <b>mdelete</b>, <b>mget</b>, and <b>mreget</b>, each remote file name is expanded
                 separately on the remote machine and the lists are not merged.  Expansion of a directory
                 name is likely to be different from expansion of the name of an ordinary file: the exact
                 result depends on the foreign operating system and ftp server, and can be previewed by
                 doing `mls remote-files -' Note: <b>mget</b>, <b>mput</b> and <b>mreget</b> are not meant to transfer entire
                 directory subtrees of files.  That can be done by transferring a <a href="tar.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/tar">tar(1)</a> archive of the sub-
                 tree (in binary mode).

     <b>hash</b> [<u>size</u>]
                 Toggle hash-sign (``#'') printing for each data block transferred.  The size of a data
                 block defaults to 1024 bytes.  This can be changed by specifying <u>size</u> in bytes.  Enabling
                 <b>hash</b> disables <b>progress</b>.

     <b>help</b> [<u>command</u>]
                 Print an informative message about the meaning of <u>command</u>.  If no argument is given, <b>ftp</b>
                 prints a list of the known commands.

     <b>idle</b> [<u>seconds</u>]
                 Set the inactivity timer on the remote server to <u>seconds</u> seconds.  If <u>seconds</u> is omitted,
                 the current inactivity timer is printed.

     <b>image</b>       A synonym for <b>binary</b>.

     <b>lcd</b> [<u>directory</u>]
                 Change the working directory on the local machine.  If no <u>directory</u> is specified, the
                 user's home directory is used.

     <b>less</b> <u>file</u>   A synonym for <b>page</b>.

     <b>lpage</b> <u>local-file</u>
                 Display <u>local-file</u> with the program specified by the <b>set</b> <b>pager</b> option.

     <b>lpwd</b>        Print the working directory on the local machine.

     <b>ls</b> [<u>remote-path</u> [<u>local-file</u>]]
                 A synonym for <b>dir</b>.

     <b>macdef</b> <u>macro-name</u>
                 Define a macro.  Subsequent lines are stored as the macro <u>macro-name</u>; a null line (consecu-
                 tive newline characters in a file or carriage returns from the terminal) terminates macro
                 input mode.  There is a limit of 16 macros and 4096 total characters in all defined macros.
                 Macros remain defined until a <b>close</b> command is executed.  The macro processor interprets
                 `$' and `\' as special characters.  A `$' followed by a number (or numbers) is replaced by
                 the corresponding argument on the macro invocation command line.  A `$' followed by an `i'
                 signals that macro processor that the executing macro is to be looped.  On the first pass
                 `$i' is replaced by the first argument on the macro invocation command line, on the second
                 pass it is replaced by the second argument, and so on.  A `\' followed by any character is
                 replaced by that character.  Use the `\' to prevent special treatment of the `$'.

     <b>mdelete</b> [<u>remote-files</u>]
                 Delete the <u>remote-files</u> on the remote machine.

     <b>mdir</b> <u>remote-files</u> <u>local-file</u>
                 Like <b>dir</b>, except multiple remote files may be specified.  If interactive prompting is on,
                 <b>ftp</b> will prompt the user to verify that the last argument is indeed the target local file
                 for receiving <b>mdir</b> output.

     <b>mget</b> <u>remote-files</u>
                 Expand the <u>remote-files</u> on the remote machine and do a <b>get</b> for each file name thus pro-
                 duced.  See <b>glob</b> for details on the filename expansion.  Resulting file names will then be
                 processed according to <b>case</b>, <b>ntrans</b>, and <b>nmap</b> settings.  Files are transferred into the
                 local working directory, which can be changed with `lcd directory'; new local directories
                 can be created with `! mkdir directory'.

     <b>mkdir</b> <u>directory-name</u>
                 Make a directory on the remote machine.

     <b>mls</b> <u>remote-files</u> <u>local-file</u>
                 Like <b>ls</b>, except multiple remote files may be specified, and the <u>local-file</u> must be speci-
                 fied.  If interactive prompting is on, <b>ftp</b> will prompt the user to verify that the last
                 argument is indeed the target local file for receiving <b>mls</b> output.

     <b>mlsd</b> [<u>remote-path</u>]
                 Display the contents of <u>remote-path</u> (which should default to the current directory if not
                 given) in a machine-parsable form, using MLSD.  The format of display can be changed with
                 `remopts mlst ...'.

     <b>mlst</b> [<u>remote-path</u>]
                 Display the details about <u>remote-path</u> (which should default to the current directory if not
                 given) in a machine-parsable form, using MLST.  The format of display can be changed with
                 `remopts mlst ...'.

     <b>mode</b> <u>mode-name</u>
                 Set the file transfer <b>mode</b> to <u>mode-name</u>.  The default (and only supported) mode is
                 ``stream''.

     <b>modtime</b> <u>remote-file</u>
                 Show the last modification time of the file on the remote machine.

     <b>more</b> <u>file</u>   A synonym for <b>page</b>.

     <b>mput</b> <u>local-files</u>
                 Expand wild cards in the list of local files given as arguments and do a <b>put</b> for each file
                 in the resulting list.  See <b>glob</b> for details of filename expansion.  Resulting file names
                 will then be processed according to <b>ntrans</b> and <b>nmap</b> settings.

     <b>mreget</b> <u>remote-files</u>
                 As per <b>mget</b>, but performs a <b>reget</b> instead of <b>get</b>.

     <b>msend</b> <u>local-files</u>
                 A synonym for <b>mput</b>.

     <b>newer</b> <u>remote-file</u> [<u>local-file</u>]
                 Get the file only if the modification time of the remote file is more recent that the file
                 on the current system.  If the file does not exist on the current system, the remote file
                 is considered <b>newer</b>.  Otherwise, this command is identical to <u>get</u>.

     <b>nlist</b> [<u>remote-path</u> [<u>local-file</u>]]
                 A synonym for <b>ls</b>.

     <b>nmap</b> [<u>inpattern</u> <u>outpattern</u>]
                 Set or unset the filename mapping mechanism.  If no arguments are specified, the filename
                 mapping mechanism is unset.  If arguments are specified, remote filenames are mapped during
                 <b>mput</b> commands and <b>put</b> commands issued without a specified remote target filename.  If argu-
                 ments are specified, local filenames are mapped during <b>mget</b> commands and <b>get</b> commands
                 issued without a specified local target filename.  This command is useful when connecting
                 to a non-UNIX remote computer with different file naming conventions or practices.  The
                 mapping follows the pattern set by <u>inpattern</u> and <u>outpattern</u>.  [<u>Inpattern</u>] is a template for
                 incoming filenames (which may have already been processed according to the <b>ntrans</b> and <b>case</b>
                 settings).  Variable templating is accomplished by including the sequences `$1', `$2', ...,
                 `$9' in <u>inpattern</u>.  Use `\' to prevent this special treatment of the `$' character.  All
                 other characters are treated literally, and are used to determine the <b>nmap</b> [<u>inpattern</u>]
                 variable values.  For example, given <u>inpattern</u> $1.$2 and the remote file name
                 "mydata.data", $1 would have the value "mydata", and $2 would have the value "data".  The
                 <u>outpattern</u> determines the resulting mapped filename.  The sequences `$1', `$2', ...., `$9'
                 are replaced by any value resulting from the <u>inpattern</u> template.  The sequence `$0' is
                 replace by the original filename.  Additionally, the sequence `[<u>seq1</u>, <u>seq2</u>]' is replaced by
                 [<u>seq1</u>] if <u>seq1</u> is not a null string; otherwise it is replaced by <u>seq2</u>.  For example, the
                 command

                       nmap $1.$2.$3 [$1,$2].[$2,file]

                 would yield the output filename "myfile.data" for input filenames "myfile.data" and
                 "myfile.data.old", "myfile.file" for the input filename "myfile", and "myfile.myfile" for
                 the input filename ".myfile".  Spaces may be included in <u>outpattern</u>, as in the example:
                 `nmap $1 sed "s/  *$//" &gt; $1' .  Use the `\' character to prevent special treatment of the
                 `$','[',']', and `,' characters.

     <b>ntrans</b> [<u>inchars</u> [<u>outchars</u>]]
                 Set or unset the filename character translation mechanism.  If no arguments are specified,
                 the filename character translation mechanism is unset.  If arguments are specified, charac-
                 ters in remote filenames are translated during <b>mput</b> commands and <b>put</b> commands issued with-
                 out a specified remote target filename.  If arguments are specified, characters in local
                 filenames are translated during <b>mget</b> commands and <b>get</b> commands issued without a specified
                 local target filename.  This command is useful when connecting to a non-UNIX remote com-
                 puter with different file naming conventions or practices.  Characters in a filename match-
                 ing a character in <u>inchars</u> are replaced with the corresponding character in <u>outchars</u>.  If
                 the character's position in <u>inchars</u> is longer than the length of <u>outchars</u>, the character is
                 deleted from the file name.

     <b>open</b> <u>host</u> [<u>port</u>]
                 Establish a connection to the specified <u>host</u> FTP server.  An optional port number may be
                 supplied, in which case, <b>ftp</b> will attempt to contact an FTP server at that port.  If the
                 <b>set</b> <b>auto-login</b> option is on (default), <b>ftp</b> will also attempt to automatically log the user
                 in to the FTP server (see below).

     <b>page</b> <u>file</u>   Retrieve <b>file</b> and display with the program specified by the <b>set</b> <b>pager</b> option.

     <b>passive</b> [<b>auto</b>]
                 Toggle passive mode (if no arguments are given).  If <b>auto</b> is given, act as if FTPMODE is
                 set to `auto'.  If passive mode is turned on (default), <b>ftp</b> will send a PASV command for
                 all data connections instead of a PORT command.  The PASV command requests that the remote
                 server open a port for the data connection and return the address of that port.  The remote
                 server listens on that port and the client connects to it.  When using the more traditional
                 PORT command, the client listens on a port and sends that address to the remote server, who
                 connects back to it.  Passive mode is useful when using <b>ftp</b> through a gateway router or
                 host that controls the directionality of traffic.  (Note that though FTP servers are
                 required to support the PASV command by RFC 1123, some do not.)

     <b>pdir</b> [<u>remote-path</u>]
                 Perform <b>dir</b> [<u>remote-path</u>], and display the result with the program specified by the <b>set</b>
                 <b>pager</b> option.

     <b>pls</b> [<u>remote-path</u>]
                 Perform <b>ls</b> [<u>remote-path</u>], and display the result with the program specified by the <b>set</b>
                 <b>pager</b> option.

     <b>pmlsd</b> [<u>remote-path</u>]
                 Perform <b>mlsd</b> [<u>remote-path</u>], and display the result with the program specified by the <b>set</b>
                 <b>pager</b> option.

     <b>preserve</b>    Toggle preservation of modification times on retrieved files.

     <b>progress</b>    Toggle display of transfer progress bar.  The progress bar will be disabled for a transfer
                 that has <u>local-file</u> as `<b>-</b>' or a command that starts with `|'.  Refer to <u>FILE</u> <u>NAMING</u>
                 <u>CONVENTIONS</u> for more information.  Enabling <b>progress</b> disables <b>hash</b>.

     <b>prompt</b>      Toggle interactive prompting.  Interactive prompting occurs during multiple file transfers
                 to allow the user to selectively retrieve or store files.  If prompting is turned off
                 (default is on), any <b>mget</b> or <b>mput</b> will transfer all files, and any <b>mdelete</b> will delete all
                 files.

                 When prompting is on, the following commands are available at a prompt:

                       <b>a</b>   Answer `yes' to the current file, and automatically answer `yes' to any remaining
                           files for the current command.

                       <b>n</b>   Answer `no', and do not transfer the file.

                       <b>p</b>   Answer `yes' to the current file, and turn off prompt mode (as is ``prompt off''
                           had been given).

                       <b>q</b>   Terminate the current operation.

                       <b>y</b>   Answer `yes', and transfer the file.

                       <b>?</b>   Display a help message.

                 Any other response will answer `yes' to the current file.

     <b>proxy</b> <u>ftp-command</u>
                 Execute an ftp command on a secondary control connection.  This command allows simultaneous
                 connection to two remote FTP servers for transferring files between the two servers.  The
                 first <b>proxy</b> command should be an <b>open</b>, to establish the secondary control connection.
                 Enter the command "proxy ?" to see other FTP commands executable on the secondary connec-
                 tion.  The following commands behave differently when prefaced by <b>proxy</b>: <b>open</b> will not
                 define new macros during the auto-login process, <b>close</b> will not erase existing macro defi-
                 nitions, <b>get</b> and <b>mget</b> transfer files from the host on the primary control connection to the
                 host on the secondary control connection, and <b>put</b>, <b>mput</b>, and <b>append</b> transfer files from the
                 host on the secondary control connection to the host on the primary control connection.
                 Third party file transfers depend upon support of the FTP protocol PASV command by the
                 server on the secondary control connection.

     <b>put</b> <u>local-file</u> [<u>remote-file</u>]
                 Store a local file on the remote machine.  If <u>remote-file</u> is left unspecified, the local
                 file name is used after processing according to any <b>ntrans</b> or <b>nmap</b> settings in naming the
                 remote file.  File transfer uses the current settings for <b>type</b>, <b>format</b>, <b>mode</b>, and
                 <b>structure</b>.

     <b>pwd</b>         Print the name of the current working directory on the remote machine.

     <b>quit</b>        A synonym for <b>bye</b>.

     <b>quote</b> <u>arg1</u> <u>arg2</u> <u>...</u>
                 The arguments specified are sent, verbatim, to the remote FTP server.

     <b>rate</b> <u>direction</u> [<u>maximum</u> [<u>increment</u>]]
                 Throttle the maximum transfer rate to <u>maximum</u> bytes/second.  If <u>maximum</u> is 0, disable the
                 throttle.

                 <u>direction</u> may be one of:
                       <b>all</b>  Both directions.
                       <b>get</b>  Incoming transfers.
                       <b>put</b>  Outgoing transfers.

                 <u>maximum</u> can be modified on the fly by <u>increment</u> bytes (default: 1024) each time a given
                 signal is received:

                       SIGUSR1  Increment <u>maximum</u> by <u>increment</u> bytes.

                       SIGUSR2  Decrement <u>maximum</u> by <u>increment</u> bytes.  The result must be a positive number.

                 If <u>maximum</u> is not supplied, the current throttle rates are displayed.

                 Note: <b>rate</b> is not yet implemented for ascii mode transfers.

     <b>rcvbuf</b> <u>size</u>
                 Set the size of the socket receive buffer to <u>size</u>.

     <b>recv</b> <u>remote-file</u> [<u>local-file</u>]
                 A synonym for <b>get</b>.

     <b>reget</b> <u>remote-file</u> [<u>local-file</u>]
                 <b>reget</b> acts like <b>get</b>, except that if <u>local-file</u> exists and is smaller than <u>remote-file</u>,
                 <u>local-file</u> is presumed to be a partially transferred copy of <u>remote-file</u> and the transfer
                 is continued from the apparent point of failure.  This command is useful when transferring
                 very large files over networks that are prone to dropping connections.

     <b>remopts</b> <u>command</u> [<u>command-options</u>]
                 Set options on the remote FTP server for <u>command</u> to <u>command-options</u> (whose absence is han-
                 dled on a command-specific basis).  Remote FTP commands known to support options include:
                 `MLST' (used for MLSD and MLST).

     <b>rename</b> [<u>from</u> [<u>to</u>]]
                 Rename the file <u>from</u> on the remote machine, to the file <u>to</u>.

     <b>reset</b>       Clear reply queue.  This command re-synchronizes command/reply sequencing with the remote
                 FTP server.  Resynchronization may be necessary following a violation of the FTP protocol
                 by the remote server.

     <b>restart</b> <u>marker</u>
                 Restart the immediately following <b>get</b> or <b>put</b> at the indicated <u>marker</u>.  On UNIX systems,
                 marker is usually a byte offset into the file.

     <b>rhelp</b> [<u>command-name</u>]
                 Request help from the remote FTP server.  If a <u>command-name</u> is specified it is supplied to
                 the server as well.

     <b>rmdir</b> <u>directory-name</u>
                 Delete a directory on the remote machine.

     <b>rstatus</b> [<u>remote-file</u>]
                 With no arguments, show status of remote machine.  If <u>remote-file</u> is specified, show status
                 of <u>remote-file</u> on remote machine.

     <b>runique</b>     Toggle storing of files on the local system with unique filenames.  If a file already
                 exists with a name equal to the target local filename for a <b>get</b> or <b>mget</b> command, a ".1" is
                 appended to the name.  If the resulting name matches another existing file, a ".2" is
                 appended to the original name.  If this process continues up to ".99", an error message is
                 printed, and the transfer does not take place.  The generated unique filename will be
                 reported.  Note that <b>runique</b> will not affect local files generated from a shell command
                 (see below).  The default value is off.

     <b>send</b> <u>local-file</u> [<u>remote-file</u>]
                 A synonym for <b>put</b>.

     <b>sendport</b>    Toggle the use of PORT commands.  By default, <b>ftp</b> will attempt to use a PORT command when
                 establishing a connection for each data transfer.  The use of PORT commands can prevent
                 delays when performing multiple file transfers.  If the PORT command fails, <b>ftp</b> will use
                 the default data port.  When the use of PORT commands is disabled, no attempt will be made
                 to use PORT commands for each data transfer.  This is useful for certain FTP implementa-
                 tions which do ignore PORT commands but, incorrectly, indicate they've been accepted.

     <b>set</b> [<u>option</u> <u>value</u>]
                 Set <u>option</u> to <u>value</u>.  If <u>option</u> and <u>value</u> are not given, display all of the options and
                 their values.  The currently supported options are:

                       <b>anonpass</b>    Defaults to $FTPANONPASS

                       <b>ftp_proxy</b>   Defaults to $ftp_proxy.

                       <b>http_proxy</b>  Defaults to $http_proxy.

                       <b>no_proxy</b>    Defaults to $no_proxy.

                       <b>pager</b>       Defaults to $PAGER.

                       <b>prompt</b>      Defaults to $FTPPROMPT.

                       <b>rprompt</b>     Defaults to $FTPRPROMPT.

     <b>site</b> <u>arg1</u> <u>arg2</u> <u>...</u>
                 The arguments specified are sent, verbatim, to the remote FTP server as a SITE command.

     <b>size</b> <u>remote-file</u>
                 Return size of <u>remote-file</u> on remote machine.

     <b>sndbuf</b> <u>size</u>
                 Set the size of the socket send buffer to <u>size</u>.

     <b>status</b>      Show the current status of <b>ftp</b>.

     <b>struct</b> <u>struct-name</u>
                 Set the file transfer <u>structure</u> to <u>struct-name</u>.  The default (and only supported) structure
                 is ``file''.

     <b>sunique</b>     Toggle storing of files on remote machine under unique file names.  The remote FTP server
                 must support FTP protocol STOU command for successful completion.  The remote server will
                 report unique name.  Default value is off.

     <b>system</b>      Show the type of operating system running on the remote machine.

     <b>tenex</b>       Set the file transfer type to that needed to talk to TENEX machines.

     <b>throttle</b>    A synonym for <b>rate</b>.

     <b>trace</b>       Toggle packet tracing.

     <b>type</b> [<u>type-name</u>]
                 Set the file transfer <b>type</b> to <u>type-name</u>.  If no type is specified, the current type is
                 printed.  The default type is network ASCII.

     <b>umask</b> [<u>newmask</u>]
                 Set the default umask on the remote server to <u>newmask</u>.  If <u>newmask</u> is omitted, the current
                 umask is printed.

     <b>unset</b> <u>option</u>
                 Unset <u>option</u>.  Refer to <b>set</b> for more information.

     <b>usage</b> <u>command</u>
                 Print the usage message for <u>command</u>.

     <b>user</b> <u>user-name</u> [<u>password</u> [<u>account</u>]]
                 Identify yourself to the remote FTP server.  If the <u>password</u> is not specified and the
                 server requires it, <b>ftp</b> will prompt the user for it (after disabling local echo).  If an
                 <u>account</u> field is not specified, and the FTP server requires it, the user will be prompted
                 for it.  If an <u>account</u> field is specified, an account command will be relayed to the remote
                 server after the login sequence is completed if the remote server did not require it for
                 logging in.  Unless <b>ftp</b> is invoked with ``auto-login'' disabled, this process is done auto-
                 matically on initial connection to the FTP server.

     <b>verbose</b>     Toggle verbose mode.  In verbose mode, all responses from the FTP server are displayed to
                 the user.  In addition, if verbose is on, when a file transfer completes, statistics
                 regarding the efficiency of the transfer are reported.  By default, verbose is on.

     <b>xferbuf</b> <u>size</u>
                 Set the size of the socket send and receive buffers to <u>size</u>.

     <b>?</b> [<u>command</u>]
                 A synonym for <b>help</b>.

     Command arguments which have embedded spaces may be quoted with quote `"' marks.

     Commands which toggle settings can take an explicit <b>on</b> or <b>off</b> argument to force the setting appropri-
     ately.

     Commands which take a byte count as an argument (e.g., <b>hash</b>, <b>rate</b>, and <b>xferbuf</b>) support an optional
     suffix on the argument which changes the interpretation of the argument.  Supported suffixes are:
           b    Causes no modification.  (Optional)
           k    Kilo; multiply the argument by 1024
           m    Mega; multiply the argument by 1048576
           g    Giga; multiply the argument by 1073741824

     If <b>ftp</b> receives a SIGINFO (see the ``status'' argument of <a href="stty.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/stty">stty(1)</a>) or SIGQUIT signal whilst a transfer
     is in progress, the current transfer rate statistics will be written to the standard error output, in
     the same format as the standard completion message.

<b>AUTO-FETCHING</b> <b>FILES</b>
     In addition to standard commands, this version of <b>ftp</b> supports an auto-fetch feature.  To enable auto-
     fetch, simply pass the list of hostnames/files on the command line.

     The following formats are valid syntax for an auto-fetch element:

     [<u>user</u>@]<u>host</u>:[<u>path</u>][/]
           ``Classic'' FTP format.

           If <u>path</u> contains a glob character and globbing is enabled, (see <b>glob</b>), then the equivalent of
           `mget path' is performed.

           If the directory component of <u>path</u> contains no globbing characters, it is stored locally with the
           name basename (see <a href="basename.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/basename">basename(1)</a>) of <b>path</b>, in the current directory.  Otherwise, the full remote
           name is used as the local name, relative to the local root directory.

     <a href="ftp://[user[:password]@]host[:port]/path[/][;type=X]">ftp://[<u>user</u>[:<u>password</u>]@]<u>host</u>[:<u>port</u>]/<u>path</u>[/][;type=<u>X</u>]</a>
           An FTP URL, retrieved using the FTP protocol if <b>set</b> <b>ftp_proxy</b> isn't defined.  Otherwise, transfer
           the URL using HTTP via the proxy defined in <b>set</b> <b>ftp_proxy</b>.  If <b>set</b> <b>ftp_proxy</b> isn't defined and
           <u>user</u> is given, login as <u>user</u>.  In this case, use <u>password</u> if supplied, otherwise prompt the user
           for one.

           If a suffix of `;type=A' or `;type=I' is supplied, then the transfer type will take place as
           ascii or binary (respectively).  The default transfer type is binary.

           In order to be compliant with RFC 1738, <b>ftp</b> interprets the <u>path</u> part of an ``<a href="ftp://">ftp://</a>'' auto-fetch
           URL as follows:

           <b></b><b><u>oo</u></b>   The `/' immediately after the <u>host</u>[:<u>port</u>] is interpreted as a separator before the <u>path</u>, and
               not as part of the <u>path</u> itself.

           <b></b><b><u>oo</u></b>   The <u>path</u> is interpreted as a `/'-separated list of name components.  For all but the last
               such component, <b>ftp</b> performs the equivalent of a <b>cd</b> command.  For the last path component,
               <b>ftp</b> performs the equivalent of a <b>get</b> command.

           <b></b><b><u>oo</u></b>   Empty name components, which result from `//' within the <u>path</u>, or from an extra `/' at the
               beginning of the <u>path</u>, will cause the equivalent of a <b>cd</b> command without a directory name.
               This is unlikely to be useful.

           <b></b><b><u>oo</u></b>   Any `%<u>XX</u>' codes (per RFC 1738) within the path components are decoded, with <u>XX</u> representing a
               character code in hexadecimal.  This decoding takes place after the <u>path</u> has been split into
               components, but before each component is used in the equivalent of a <b>cd</b> or <b>get</b> command.  Some
               often-used codes are `%2F' (which represents `/') and `%7E' (which represents `~').

           The above interpretation has the following consequences:

           <b></b><b><u>oo</u></b>   The path is interpreted relative to the default login directory of the specified user or of
               the `anonymous' user.  If the <u>/</u> directory is required, use a leading path of ``%2F''.  If a
               user's home directory is required (and the remote server supports the syntax), use a leading
               path of ``%7Euser/''.  For example, to retrieve <u>/etc/motd</u> from `localhost' as the user
               `myname' with the password `mypass', use ``<a href="ftp://myname:mypass@localhost/%2fetc/motd">ftp://myname:mypass@localhost/%2fetc/motd</a>''

           <b></b><b><u>oo</u></b>   The exact <b>cd</b> and <b>get</b> commands can be controlled by careful choice of where to use `/' and
               where to use `%2F' (or `%2f').  For example, the following URLs correspond to the equivalents
               of the indicated commands:

               <a href="ftp://host/dir1/dir2/file">ftp://host/dir1/dir2/file</a>         ``cd dir1'', ``cd dir2'', ``get file''.

               <a href="ftp://host/%2Fdir1/dir2/file">ftp://host/%2Fdir1/dir2/file</a>      ``cd /dir1'', ``cd dir2'', ``get file''.

               <a href="ftp://host/dir1%2Fdir2/file">ftp://host/dir1%2Fdir2/file</a>       ``cd dir1/dir2'', ``get file''.

               <a href="ftp://host/%2Fdir1%2Fdir2/file">ftp://host/%2Fdir1%2Fdir2/file</a>    ``cd /dir1/dir2'', ``get file''.

               <a href="ftp://host/dir1%2Fdir2%2Ffile">ftp://host/dir1%2Fdir2%2Ffile</a>     ``get dir1/dir2/file''.

               <a href="ftp://host/%2Fdir1%2Fdir2%2Ffile">ftp://host/%2Fdir1%2Fdir2%2Ffile</a>  ``get /dir1/dir2/file''.

           <b></b><b><u>oo</u></b>   You must have appropriate access permission for each of the intermediate directories that is
               used in the equivalent of a <b>cd</b> command.

     <a href="http://[user[:password]@]host[:port]/path">http://[<u>user</u>[:<u>password</u>]@]<u>host</u>[:<u>port</u>]/<u>path</u></a>
           An HTTP URL, retrieved using the HTTP protocol.  If <b>set</b> <b>http_proxy</b> is defined, it is used as a
           URL to an HTTP proxy server.  If HTTP authorization is required to retrieve <u>path</u>, and `user' (and
           optionally `password') is in the URL, use them for the first attempt to authenticate.

     file:///<u>path</u>
           A local URL, copied from <u>/path</u> on the local host.

     Unless noted otherwise above, and <b>-o</b> <u>output</u> is not given, the file is stored in the current directory
     as the <a href="basename.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/basename">basename(1)</a> of <u>path</u>.  Note that if a HTTP redirect is received, the fetch is retried using the
     new target URL supplied by the server, with a corresponding new <u>path</u>.  Using an explicit <b>-o</b> <u>output</u> is
     recommended, to avoid writing to unexpected file names.

     If a classic format or an FTP URL format has a trailing `/' or an empty <u>path</u> component, then <b>ftp</b> will
     connect to the site and <b>cd</b> to the directory given as the path, and leave the user in interactive mode
     ready for further input.  This will not work if <b>set</b> <b>ftp_proxy</b> is being used.

     Direct HTTP transfers use HTTP 1.1.  Proxied FTP and HTTP transfers use HTTP 1.0.

     If <b>-R</b> is given, all auto-fetches that don't go via the FTP or HTTP proxies will be restarted.  For FTP,
     this is implemented by using <b>reget</b> instead of <b>get</b>.  For HTTP, this is implemented by using the `Range:
     bytes=' HTTP/1.1 directive.

     If WWW or proxy WWW authentication is required, you will be prompted to enter a username and password
     to authenticate with.

     When specifying IPv6 numeric addresses in a URL, you need to surround the address in square brackets.
     E.g.: ``<a href="ftp://[::1]:21/">ftp://[::1]:21/</a>''.  This is because colons are used in IPv6 numeric address as well as being
     the separator for the port number.

<b>ABORTING</b> <b>A</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>TRANSFER</b>
     To abort a file transfer, use the terminal interrupt key (usually Ctrl-C).  Sending transfers will be
     immediately halted.  Receiving transfers will be halted by sending an FTP protocol ABOR command to the
     remote server, and discarding any further data received.  The speed at which this is accomplished
     depends upon the remote server's support for ABOR processing.  If the remote server does not support
     the ABOR command, the prompt will not appear until the remote server has completed sending the
     requested file.

     If the terminal interrupt key sequence is used whilst <b>ftp</b> is awaiting a reply from the remote server
     for the ABOR processing, then the connection will be closed.  This is different from the traditional
     behaviour (which ignores the terminal interrupt during this phase), but is considered more useful.

<b>FILE</b> <b>NAMING</b> <b>CONVENTIONS</b>
     Files specified as arguments to <b>ftp</b> commands are processed according to the following rules.

     1.   If the file name `<b>-</b>' is specified, the <u>stdin</u> (for reading) or <u>stdout</u> (for writing) is used.

     2.   If the first character of the file name is `|', the remainder of the argument is interpreted as a
          shell command.  <b>ftp</b> then forks a shell, using <a href="../man3/popen.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/popen">popen(3)</a> with the argument supplied, and reads
          (writes) from the stdout (stdin).  If the shell command includes spaces, the argument must be
          quoted; e.g.  ``"| ls -lt"''.  A particularly useful example of this mechanism is: ``dir ""
          |more''.

     3.   Failing the above checks, if ``globbing'' is enabled, local file names are expanded according to
          the rules used in the <a href="csh.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/csh">csh(1)</a>; c.f. the <b>glob</b> command.  If the <b>ftp</b> command expects a single local
          file (e.g.  <b>put</b>), only the first filename generated by the "globbing" operation is used.

     4.   For <b>mget</b> commands and <b>get</b> commands with unspecified local file names, the local filename is the
          remote filename, which may be altered by a <b>case</b>, <b>ntrans</b>, or <b>nmap</b> setting.  The resulting filename
          may then be altered if <b>runique</b> is on.

     5.   For <b>mput</b> commands and <b>put</b> commands with unspecified remote file names, the remote filename is the
          local filename, which may be altered by a <b>ntrans</b> or <b>nmap</b> setting.  The resulting filename may then
          be altered by the remote server if <b>sunique</b> is on.

<b>FILE</b> <b>TRANSFER</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b>
     The FTP specification specifies many parameters which may affect a file transfer.  The <b>type</b> may be one
     of ``ascii'', ``image'' (binary), ``ebcdic'', and ``local byte size'' (for PDP-10's and PDP-20's
     mostly).  <b>ftp</b> supports the ascii and image types of file transfer, plus local byte size 8 for <b>tenex</b>
     mode transfers.

     <b>ftp</b> supports only the default values for the remaining file transfer parameters: <b>mode</b>, <b>form</b>, and
     <b>struct</b>.

<b>THE</b> <b>.netrc</b> <b>FILE</b>
     The <u>.netrc</u> file contains login and initialization information used by the auto-login process.  It
     resides in the user's home directory, unless overridden with the <b>-N</b> <u>netrc</u> option, or specified in the
     NETRC environment variable.  The following tokens are recognized; they may be separated by spaces,
     tabs, or new-lines:

     <b>machine</b> <u>name</u>
               Identify a remote machine <u>name</u>.  The auto-login process searches the <u>.netrc</u> file for a
               <b>machine</b> token that matches the remote machine specified on the <b>ftp</b> command line or as an <b>open</b>
               command argument.  Once a match is made, the subsequent <u>.netrc</u> tokens are processed, stopping
               when the end of file is reached or another <b>machine</b> or a <b>default</b> token is encountered.

     <b>default</b>   This is the same as <b>machine</b> <u>name</u> except that <b>default</b> matches any name.  There can be only one
               <b>default</b> token, and it must be after all <b>machine</b> tokens.  This is normally used as:

                     default login anonymous password user@site

               thereby giving the user an automatic anonymous FTP login to machines not specified in <u>.netrc</u>.
               This can be overridden by using the <b>-n</b> flag to disable auto-login.

     <b>login</b> <u>name</u>
               Identify a user on the remote machine.  If this token is present, the auto-login process will
               initiate a login using the specified <u>name</u>.

     <b>password</b> <u>string</u>
               Supply a password.  If this token is present, the auto-login process will supply the speci-
               fied string if the remote server requires a password as part of the login process.  Note that
               if this token is present in the <u>.netrc</u> file for any user other than <u>anonymous</u>, <b>ftp</b> will abort
               the auto-login process if the <u>.netrc</u> is readable by anyone besides the user.

     <b>account</b> <u>string</u>
               Supply an additional account password.  If this token is present, the auto-login process will
               supply the specified string if the remote server requires an additional account password, or
               the auto-login process will initiate an ACCT command if it does not.

     <b>macdef</b> <u>name</u>
               Define a macro.  This token functions like the <b>ftp</b> <b>macdef</b> command functions.  A macro is
               defined with the specified name; its contents begin with the next <u>.netrc</u> line and continue
               until a blank line (consecutive new-line characters) is encountered.  If a macro named <b>init</b>
               is defined, it is automatically executed as the last step in the auto-login process.  For
               example,

                     default
                     macdef init
                     epsv4 off

               followed by a blank line.

<b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>EDITING</b>
     <b>ftp</b> supports interactive command line editing, via the <a href="../man3/editline.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/editline">editline(3)</a> library.  It is enabled with the
     <b>edit</b> command, and is enabled by default if input is from a tty.  Previous lines can be recalled and
     edited with the arrow keys, and other GNU Emacs-style editing keys may be used as well.

     The <a href="../man3/editline.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/editline">editline(3)</a> library is configured with a <u>.editrc</u> file - refer to <a href="../man5/editrc.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/editrc">editrc(5)</a> for more information.

     An extra key binding is available to <b>ftp</b> to provide context sensitive command and filename completion
     (including remote file completion).  To use this, bind a key to the <a href="../man3/editline.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/editline">editline(3)</a> command <b>ftp-complete</b>.
     By default, this is bound to the TAB key.

<b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>PROMPT</b>
     By default, <b>ftp</b> displays a command line prompt of ``ftp&gt; '' to the user.  This can be changed with the
     <b>set</b> <b>prompt</b> command.

     A prompt can be displayed on the right side of the screen (after the command input) with the <b>set</b>
     <b>rprompt</b> command.

     The following formatting sequences are replaced by the given information:

           %/   The current remote working directory.

           %c[[0]<u>n</u>],%.[[0]<u>n</u>]
                The trailing component of the current remote working directory, or <u>n</u> trailing components if
                a digit <u>n</u> is given.  If <u>n</u> begins with `0', the number of skipped components precede the
                trailing <!-- a -->component(s)<!-- /a --> in the format ``/&lt;<u>number&gt;trailing</u>'' (for `%c') or ``...<u>trailing</u>'' (for
                `%.').

           %M   The remote host name.

           %m   The remote host name, up to the first `.'.

           %n   The remote user name.

           %%   A single `%'.

<b>ENVIRONMENT</b>
     <b>ftp</b> uses the following environment variables.

     FTPANONPASS    Password to send in an anonymous FTP transfer.  Defaults to ```whoami`@''.

     FTPMODE        Overrides the default operation mode.  Support values are:

                    <b>active</b>   active mode FTP only

                    <b>auto</b>     automatic determination of passive or active (this is the default)

                    <b>gate</b>     gate-ftp mode

                    <b>passive</b>  passive mode FTP only

     FTPPROMPT      Command-line prompt to use.  Defaults to ``ftp&gt; ''.  Refer to <u>COMMAND</u> <u>LINE</u> <u>PROMPT</u> for
                    more information.

     FTPRPROMPT     Command-line right side prompt to use.  Defaults to ``''.  Refer to <u>COMMAND</u> <u>LINE</u> <u>PROMPT</u>
                    for more information.

     FTPSERVER      Host to use as gate-ftp server when <b>gate</b> is enabled.

     FTPSERVERPORT  Port to use when connecting to gate-ftp server when <b>gate</b> is enabled.  Default is port
                    returned by a <b>getservbyname</b>() lookup of ``ftpgate/tcp''.

     FTPUSERAGENT   The value to send for the HTTP User-Agent header.

     HOME           For default location of a <u>.netrc</u> file, if one exists.

     NETRC          An alternate location of the <u>.netrc</u> file.

     PAGER          Used by various commands to display files.  Defaults to <a href="more.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/more">more(1)</a> if empty or not set.

     SHELL          For default shell.

     ftp_proxy      URL of FTP proxy to use when making FTP URL requests (if not defined, use the standard
                    FTP protocol).

                    See http_proxy for further notes about proxy use.

     http_proxy     URL of HTTP proxy to use when making HTTP URL requests.  If proxy authentication is
                    required and there is a username and password in this URL, they will automatically be
                    used in the first attempt to authenticate to the proxy.

                    If ``unsafe'' URL characters are required in the username or password (for example `@'
                    or `/'), encode them with RFC 1738 `%<u>XX</u>' encoding.

                    Note that the use of a username and password in ftp_proxy and http_proxy may be incom-
                    patible with other programs that use it (such as <!-- a -->lynx(1)<!-- /a -->).

                    <u>NOTE</u>: this is not used for interactive sessions, only for command-line fetches.

     no_proxy       A space or comma separated list of hosts (or domains) for which proxying is not to be
                    used.  Each entry may have an optional trailing ":port", which restricts the matching to
                    connections to that port.

<b>EXTENDED</b> <b>PASSIVE</b> <b>MODE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>FIREWALLS</b>
     Some firewall configurations do not allow <b>ftp</b> to use extended passive mode.  If you find that even a
     simple <b>ls</b> appears to hang after printing a message such as this:

           229 Entering Extended Passive Mode (|||58551|)

     then you will need to disable extended passive mode with <b>epsv4</b> <b>off</b>.  See the above section <u>The</u> <u>.netrc</u>
     <u>File</u> for an example of how to make this automatic.

<b>STANDARDS</b>
     <b>ftp</b> attempts to be compliant with RFC 959, RFC 1123, RFC 1738, RFC 2068, RFC 2389, RFC 2428, RFC 2732,
     and <b>draft-ietf-ftpext-mlst-11</b>.

<b>HISTORY</b>
     The <b>ftp</b> command appeared in 4.2BSD.

     Various features such as command line editing, context sensitive command and file completion, dynamic
     progress bar, automatic fetching of files and URLs, modification time preservation, transfer rate
     throttling, configurable command line prompt, and other enhancements over the standard BSD <b>ftp</b> were
     implemented in NetBSD 1.3 and later releases by Luke Mewburn &lt;lukem@NetBSD.org&gt;.

     IPv6 support was added by the WIDE/KAME project (but may not be present in all non-NetBSD versions of
     this program, depending if the operating system supports IPv6 in a similar manner to KAME).

<b>BUGS</b>
     Correct execution of many commands depends upon proper behavior by the remote server.

     An error in the treatment of carriage returns in the 4.2BSD ascii-mode transfer code has been cor-
     rected.  This correction may result in incorrect transfers of binary files to and from 4.2BSD servers
     using the ascii type.  Avoid this problem by using the binary image type.

     <b>ftp</b> assumes that all IPv4 mapped addresses (IPv6 addresses with a form like ::ffff:10.1.1.1) indicate
     IPv4 destinations which can be handled by AF_INET sockets.  However, in certain IPv6 network configura-
     tions, this assumption is not true.  In such an environment, IPv4 mapped addresses must be passed to
     AF_INET6 sockets directly.  For example, if your site uses a SIIT translator for IPv6-to-IPv4 transla-
     tion, <b>ftp</b> is unable to support your configuration.
