<H1>Frequently Asked Questions</H1>

<P><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;
Is QuickTime for Apple computers only?

<BR><B>A:</B>&nbsp;
No. You can create and view QuickTime movies on Windows (95/98/NT/2000) or Macintosh computers.
You can serve QuickTime movies from any Web server (Sun, Linux, NT, Mac, you-name-it).
This book comes with a CD-ROM that includes QuickTime Pro for Windows and Macintosh.

<P><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;
What is QuickTime?

<BR><B>A:</B>&nbsp;
The short answer is that QuickTime is the most popular way to put sound and video on a website or CD.
Of course, it's much more than that--it's a technology that lets you combine motion video, MP3
and other digital audio, MIDI, still images, text, special effects, virtual reality, sprites,
interactive Web tours, and, well, the complete answer would fill a book (what a coincidence!).
QuickTime is a powerful and easy-to-use technology for creating and viewing multimedia.

<P><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;
Can a beginner use use this book?

<BR><B>A:</B>&nbsp;
Yes. The book starts slowly. You should be able to create a simple
Web page before you start, but that's about it. The book will explain what QuickTime is,
show you how to install it, and step you through the basics of converting your existing
media into QuickTime, creating new QuickTime movies, and putting QuickTime on a Web page.

<P><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;
Is there anything for experts in this book?

<BR><B>A:</B>&nbsp;
Plenty. We had the book reviewed by the most advanced users we could find, along with several
QuickTime engineers. They <B>all</B> reported finding useful information, tips, and tricks.

<P><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;
This FAQ doesn't list many questions.

<BR><B>A:</B>&nbsp;
Technically, that isn't a question either, but I take your point.
