/*	File:		TShipSprite.h	Contains:	This is the class used to represent the friendly ship in the game.

A computer controlled ship could be 				different.	Written by: Timothy Carroll		Copyright:	Copyright © 1996-1999 by Apple Computer, Inc., All Rights Reserved.				You may incorporate this Apple sample source code into your program(s) without				restriction.
