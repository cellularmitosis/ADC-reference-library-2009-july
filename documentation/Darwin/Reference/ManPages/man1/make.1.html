MAKE(1)                                      LOCAL USER COMMANDS                                     MAKE(1)



<b>NAME</b>
       make - GNU make utility to maintain groups of programs

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>make</b> [ <b>-f</b> <u>makefile</u> ] [ options ] ... [ targets ] ...

<b>WARNING</b>
       This  man  page  is  an  extract  of the documentation of GNU <u>make</u>.  It is updated only occasionally,
       because the GNU project does not use nroff.  For complete, current documentation, refer to  the  Info
       file <b>make.info</b> which is made from the Texinfo source file <b>make.texi</b>.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The purpose of the <u>make</u> utility is to determine automatically which pieces of a large program need to
       be recompiled, and issue the commands to recompile them.  The manual describes the GNU implementation
       of  <u>make</u>,  which  was  written by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath, and is currently maintained by
       Paul Smith.  Our examples show C programs, since they are most common, but you can use <u>make</u> with  any
       programming language whose compiler can be run with a shell command.  In fact, <u>make</u> is not limited to
       programs.  You can use it to describe any task where some files must be  updated  automatically  from
       others whenever the others change.

       To  prepare  to  use <u>make</u>, you must write a file called the <u>makefile</u> that describes the relationships
       among files in your program, and the states the commands for updating each file.  In a program, typi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cally&nbsp;typically</font>
       cally  the  executable  file is updated from object files, which are in turn made by compiling source
       files.

       Once a suitable makefile exists, each time you change some source files, this simple shell command:

              <b>make</b>

       suffices to perform all necessary recompilations.  The <u>make</u> program uses the makefile data  base  and
       the  last-modification  times of the files to decide which of the files need to be updated.  For each
       of those files, it issues the commands recorded in the data base.

       <u>make</u> executes commands in the <u>makefile</u> to update one or more target <u>names</u>, where <u>name</u> is typically  a
       program.   If  no  <b>-f</b>  option is present, <u>make</u> will look for the makefiles <u>GNUmakefile</u>, <u>makefile</u>, and
       <u>Makefile</u>, in that order.

       Normally you should call your makefile either <u>makefile</u> or <u>Makefile</u>.  (We recommend  <u>Makefile</u>  because
       it  appears  prominently  near the beginning of a directory listing, right near other important files
       such as <u>README</u>.)  The first name checked, <u>GNUmakefile</u>, is not recommended for  most  makefiles.   You
       should  use this name if you have a makefile that is specific to GNU <u>make</u>, and will not be understood
       by other versions of <u>make</u>.  If <u>makefile</u> is `-', the standard input is read.

       <u>make</u> updates a target if it depends on prerequisite files that have been modified  since  the  target
       was last modified, or if the target does not exist.

<b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-b</b>, <b>-m</b>
            These options are ignored for compatibility with other versions of <u>make</u>.

       <b>-B</b>, <b>--always-make</b>
            Unconditionally make all targets.

       <b>-C</b> <u>dir</u>, <b>--directory</b>=<u>dir</u>
            Change  to  directory  <u>dir</u>  before reading the makefiles or doing anything else.  If multiple <b>-C</b>
            options are specified, each is interpreted relative to the previous one: <b>-C</b> / <b>-C</b> etc is  equiva-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lent&nbsp;equivalent</font>
            lent to <b>-C</b> /etc.  This is typically used with recursive invocations of <u>make</u>.

       <b>-d</b>   Print  debugging  information  in addition to normal processing.  The debugging information says
            which files are being considered for remaking, which file-times are being compared and with what
            results,  which  files actually need to be remade, which implicit rules are considered and which
            are applied---everything interesting about how <u>make</u> decides what to do.

       <b>--debug</b><u>[=FLAGS]</u>
            Print debugging information in addition to normal processing.  If the <u>FLAGS</u>  are  omitted,  then
            the  behavior is the same as if <b>-d</b> was specified.  <u>FLAGS</u> may be <u>a</u> for all debugging output (same
            as using <b>-d</b>), <u>b</u> for basic debugging, <u>v</u> for more verbose basic debugging, <u>i</u> for showing  implicit
            rules, <u>j</u> for details on invocation of commands, and <u>m</u> for debugging while remaking makefiles.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--environment-overrides</b>
            Give variables taken from the environment precedence over variables from makefiles.

       +<b>-f</b> <u>file</u>, <b>--file</b>=<u>file</u>, <b>--makefile</b>=<u>FILE</u>
            Use <u>file</u> as a makefile.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--ignore-errors</b>
            Ignore all errors in commands executed to remake files.

       <b>-I</b> <u>dir</u>, <b>--include-dir</b>=<u>dir</u>
            Specifies  a  directory <u>dir</u> to search for included makefiles.  If several <b>-I</b> options are used to
            specify several directories, the directories are searched in the order  specified.   Unlike  the
            arguments  to  other  flags of <u>make</u>, directories given with <b>-I</b> flags may come directly after the
            flag: <b>-I</b><u>dir</u> is allowed, as well as <b>-I</b> <u>dir.</u>  This syntax is allowed for compatibility with the  C
            preprocessor's <b>-I</b> flag.

       <b>-j</b> [<u>jobs</u>], <b>--jobs</b>[=<u>jobs</u>]
            Specifies  the  number  of  <u>jobs</u> (commands) to run simultaneously.  If there is more than one <b>-j</b>
            option, the last one is effective.  If the <b>-j</b> option is given without an argument, <u>make</u> will not
            limit the number of jobs that can run simultaneously.

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--keep-going</b>
            Continue  as  much  as  possible  after  an error.  While the target that failed, and those that
            depend on it, cannot be remade, the other dependencies of these targets can be processed all the
            same.

       <b>-l</b> [<u>load</u>], <b>--load-average</b>[=<u>load</u>]
            Specifies that no new jobs (commands) should be started if there are others jobs running and the
            load average is at least <u>load</u> (a floating-point number).  With no argument, removes  a  previous
            load limit.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--check-symlink-times</b>
            Use the latest mtime between symlinks and target.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--just-print</b>, <b>--dry-run</b>, <b>--recon</b>
            Print the commands that would be executed, but do not execute them.

       <b>-o</b> <u>file</u>, <b>--old-file</b>=<u>file</u>, <b>--assume-old</b>=<u>file</u>
            Do  not  remake  the file <u>file</u> even if it is older than its dependencies, and do not remake any-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">thing&nbsp;anything</font>
            thing on account of changes in <u>file</u>.  Essentially the file is treated as very old and its  rules
            are ignored.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--print-data-base</b>
            Print  the  data  base (rules and variable values) that results from reading the makefiles; then
            execute as usual or as otherwise specified.  This also prints the version information  given  by
            the  <b>-v</b> switch (see below).  To print the data base without trying to remake any files, use <b>make</b>
            <b>-p</b> <b>-f</b><u>/dev/null.</u>

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--question</b>
            ``Question mode''.  Do not run any commands, or print anything; just return an exit status  that
            is zero if the specified targets are already up to date, nonzero otherwise.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--no-builtin-rules</b>
            Eliminate  use  of the built-in implicit rules.  Also clear out the default list of suffixes for
            suffix rules.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--no-builtin-variables</b>
            Don't define any built-in variables.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--silent</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
            Silent operation; do not print the commands as they are executed.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--no-keep-going</b>, <b>--stop</b>
            Cancel the effect of the <b>-k</b> option.  This is never necessary except in a recursive <u>make</u> where <b>-k</b>
            might  be  inherited from the top-level <u>make</u> via MAKEFLAGS or if you set <b>-k</b> in MAKEFLAGS in your
            environment.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--touch</b>
            Touch files (mark them up to date without really changing them) instead of  running  their  com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mands.&nbsp;commands.</font>
            mands.  This is used to pretend that the commands were done, in order to fool future invocations
            of <u>make</u>.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--version</b>
            Print the version of the <u>make</u> program plus a copyright, a list of  authors  and  a  notice  that
            there is no warranty.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--print-directory</b>
            Print a message containing the working directory before and after other processing.  This may be
            useful for tracking down errors from complicated nests of recursive <u>make</u> commands.

       <b>--no-print-directory</b>
            Turn off <b>-w</b>, even if it was turned on implicitly.

       <b>-W</b> <u>file</u>, <b>--what-if</b>=<u>file</u>, <b>--new-file</b>=<u>file</u>, <b>--assume-new</b>=<u>file</u>
            Pretend that the target <u>file</u> has just been modified.  When used with the <b>-n</b> flag, this shows you
            what would happen if you were to modify that file.  Without <b>-n</b>, it is almost the same as running
            a <u>touch</u> command on the given file before running <u>make</u>, except  that  the  modification  time  is
            changed only in the imagination of <u>make</u>.

       <b>--warn-undefined-variables</b>
            Warn when an undefined variable is referenced.

<b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b>
       GNU  <u>make</u>  exits  with a status of zero if all makefiles were successfully parsed and no targets that
       were built failed.  A status of one will be returned if the <b>-q</b> flag was used and <u>make</u> determines that
       a target needs to be rebuilt.  A status of two will be returned if any errors were encountered.
