 <P>Use the application window to control application-wide resources. You use this window mainly to open, create, or delete components inside the application. The application window is also where you define application variables and session variables.    
 Application variables are created when the application starts executing and are        
 deallocated when the application quits. Session variables are created when a new       
 user begins a new session and are deallocated when the session ends. Both application and session variables can be accessed by all of the application's components. "<A HREF="../Script/Script.book.html">Writing WebScript in WebObjects Builder</A>" describes how to use the              
 application window to create application and session variables.
