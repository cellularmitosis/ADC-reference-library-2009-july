<h2> Starting WebObjects Applications </h2>
</a><a name="4904">
As described previously, there are two ways to start an application: autostart and manual. Autostarting applications occurs when the user types the application's URL in a web browser; the WebObjects adaptor looks for a running instance of that application and starts one if it cannot find one. Autostarting is not recommended for deployment, It's convenient but when you allow autostarting, it becomes more difficult to monitor the applications progress. Instead, you can use the Monitor application's interface to start applications. (The application will sit idle until a user tries to access it.) Another alternative is to start applications from the command line. You might start from the command line when you need to see the debugging messages written to standard output. This section describes how to manually start an application using the Monitor or the command line. <p>
