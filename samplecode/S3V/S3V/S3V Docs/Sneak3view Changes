=============================================================================== New Tests - 5/29/96==============================================================================¥ Code Coverage tests - These tests excercise 100% of the RAVE API. Use them to	make sure your engine implements all the required functions¥ Game Scene(Render Cache) - This test uses the cache context feature to render	into a cache context.¥ Game Scene(Underlay/overlay) - This test uses the underlay/overlay API to 	implement clearing and draw a 2d transparenct rect when the scene has finished	rendering¥ Render completion - This tests the render completion callback.=============================================================================== 1.4 - 3/29/96==============================================================================¥ The output from the timing tests is much more informative.  In   addition to having a better format, it now also prints out the size of   the test windows and the bitdepth and size of the monitor(s).  Since    these values can affect the rendering speed, it's helpful to have them   displayed in when comparing test runs.  ¥ Added the ability to call one test from another.  This lets you group a   number of tests together into one composite test so that they all get   run, one after the other.  "Game Scene (Every Format)" is an example of   this.   ¥ Some tests can now be cancelled by typing command-period (principally the   "random" tests).  ¥ The timing information that used to be printed out after every test has   been removed, since it wasn't really relevant.¥ Fixed the bug in the timing tests that sometimes produced 1- or 2-pixel   borders between the triangles.  ¥ Fixed a bug that caused textures that were 1 pixel wide or high to be   mipmapped incorrectly.¥ Finally fixed that benign but annoying write-to-nil bug.=============================================================================== 1.3 - 2/16/96==============================================================================¥ Support for the new RAVE color lookup table mode for textures and bitmaps.  Includes new color table tests.  The game test can now use color table   textures, as well.¥ Support for the new RAVE trimesh API, as well as trimesh tests.¥ Some new random alpha texture and gouraud triangle tests.¥ The S3TestBasic.c file has been split into several smaller files:   S3RandomTests.c, S3TimingTests.c, and S3TextureBitmapTests.c.  The old file   was just getting too large.¥ Sneak3view should automatically update an old preferences files to the   newest version.  ¥ The currently selected engine name is displayed in the title bars of   the test windows, instead of the somewhat uninformative labels "Left" and   "Right".¥ Partial fix for the problem of windows opening off-screen after moving   the menubar from one display to another.  The window should now move so that   its titlebar is completely onscreen.  This will work as long as the   title bar is at least partially outside the bounding box of the desktop   region (which is different from the actual desktop region when you have   multiple, differently-sized monitors).  ¥ The about box now disables all menus and beeps if you click anywhere but   on it, making it impossible to open more than one copy.  Clicking on it or   typing return, enter, command-period, or escape will dismiss it.  A splash   screen now appears at startup.¥ The test output area at the bottom of the settings windows now scrolls to   the bottom whenever new text is printed there.  This makes it easier to see   what a test has printed.=============================================================================== 1.2 - 1/22/96==============================================================================¥ An arguments field which you can use to pass parameters to your test.¥ Duplicate window command to quickly create an identical settings window.¥ S3GetNearbyPICT(), which enables you to easily use more than one texture   in your tests.¥ A game-like test that more closely approximates a frame from a typical   game than previous tests did.¥ Fix for an occasional bug where the test windows' size and position   could get out of sync with the settings document.=============================================================================== 1.1==============================================================================¥ Bitmap comparison window.¥ Argument string which gets passed to each test for its own use.¥ About box.
