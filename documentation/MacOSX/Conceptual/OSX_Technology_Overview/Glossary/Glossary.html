This server is shared by all running applications and contains data that the user has cut or copied, as well as other data that one application wants to transfer to another, such as in dragging operations. Data in the Clipboard is associated with a name that indicates how it is to be used.

Distributed notifications provide a way for a process to broadcast an alert (along with additional data) to any other process that makes itself an observer of that notification.

Another advantage of vector graphics is that the resulting image file is typically smaller than a bitmap file containing the same image.
