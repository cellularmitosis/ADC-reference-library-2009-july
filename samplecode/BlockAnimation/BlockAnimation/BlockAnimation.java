Abstract:  

        PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS DEEPLY FLAWED CODE!
    
        This is an example which INCORRECTLY handles
        animation. It is designed as a simple example which
        developers can use with our debugging tools
        to identify and isolate a problem.

        This example consists of two main parts: 

        1) a JFrame with lots of JPanels inside
         
        2) many JPanels which periodically change
           their background color and repaint

        The primary flaw is that this example creates one 
		timer thread per JPanel (500+ threads) rather
		than juts the single timer thread it needs.
