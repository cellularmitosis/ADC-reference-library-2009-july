QuickDraw&nbsp;3D is extremely portable and operates independently of the native window system.

Although QuickDraw&nbsp;3D provides a large set of basic 3D objects and operations, it is also designed for easy extensibility, so that you can add custom capabilities (for instance, custom object types, attributes, renderers, and shading algorithms) to those provided by QuickDraw&nbsp;3D<I CLASS="italics">.</I></P><P CLASS="T1.Text1"><A NAME="pgfId=67068"> </A>To use this document, you should be generally familiar with computer graphics and with 3D modeling and rendering techniques. This document explains some of the fundamental 3D concepts, but it is not intended to be either an introduction to or a technical reference for 3D graphics in general. Rather, it explains how QuickDraw&nbsp;3D implements the standard techniques for 3D modeling, rendering, and interaction. You can consult the Bibliography for a list of some books that might help you acquire a basic knowledge of those techniques.</P><P CLASS="T1.Text1"><A NAME="pgfId=67072"> </A>The book <I CLASS="italics">3D Computer Graphics, </I>second edition, by Alan Watt is particularly helpful for beginners.</P><P CLASS="T1.Text1"><A NAME="pgfId=67076"> </A>You should also be familiar with the techniques that underlie object-oriented programming. QuickDraw&nbsp;3D is object oriented in the sense that many of its capabilities are accessed by creating and manipulating QuickDraw&nbsp;3D objects. In addition, QuickDraw&nbsp;3D classes (of which QuickDraw&nbsp;3D objects are instances) are arranged in a hierarchy, which provides for method inheritance and method overriding.</P><P CLASS="T1.Text1"><A NAME="pgfId=67090"> </A><A NAME="29597"> </A>Currently, only C language programming interfaces are available.</P><P CLASS="T1.Text1"><A NAME="pgfId=67096"> </A>You should begin this document by reading the chapter &quot;Introduction to QuickDraw&nbsp;3D.&quot; That chapter describes the basic capabilities provided by QuickDraw&nbsp;3D and the QuickDraw&nbsp;3D application programming interfaces that you use to create and manipulate objects in that hierarchy. It also provides source code samples illustrating how to use QuickDraw&nbsp;3D to define, configure, and render simple 3D models.</P><P CLASS="T1.Text1"><A NAME="pgfId=67107"> </A>If you just want to be able to display an existing 3D model in a window and don't need to use the powerful capabilities of QuickDraw&nbsp;3D, you can use the 3D&nbsp;Viewer supplied with QuickDraw&nbsp;3D. The 3D&nbsp;Viewer allows you to display 3D data with minimal programming effort. It is therefore analogous to the movie controller provided with QuickTime. Read the chapter &quot;3D&nbsp;Viewer&quot; for complete information.</P><P CLASS="T1.Text1"><A NAME="pgfId=67120"> </A>Once you are familiar with the basic uses of QuickDraw&nbsp;3D, you can read the remaining chapters in this document for more information on any particular topic. For example, for complete information on the types of lights provided by QuickDraw&nbsp;3D, see the chapter &quot;Light Objects.&quot;</P><P CLASS="T1.Text1"><A NAME="pgfId=67000"> </A>&nbsp;</P><hr>&#169; 1997 Apple Computer, Inc.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><!-- start of footer --><!--#include virtual="/includes/framesetfooter" --><!-- end of footer --></BODY></HTML>
