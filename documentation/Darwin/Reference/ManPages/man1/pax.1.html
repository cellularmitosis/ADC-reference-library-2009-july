<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
     <b>pax</b> will read, write, and list the members of an archive file, and will copy directory hierarchies.
     <b>pax</b> operation is independent of the specific archive format, and supports a wide variety of different
     archive formats.  A list of supported archive formats can be found under the description of the <b>-x</b>
     option.

     The presence of the <b>-r</b> and the <b>-w</b> options specifies which of the following functional modes <b>pax</b> will
     operate under: <u>list</u>, <u>read</u>, <u>write</u>, and <u>copy</u>.

     &lt;none&gt;  <u>List</u>.  <b>pax</b> will write to standard output a table of contents of the members of the archive file
             read from standard input, whose pathnames match the specified <u>patterns</u>.  The table of contents
             contains one filename per line and is written using single line buffering.

     <b>-r</b>      <u>Read</u>.  <b>pax</b> extracts the members of the archive file read from the standard input, with path-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">names&nbsp;pathnames</font>
             names matching the specified <u>patterns</u>.  The archive format and blocking is automatically deter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mined&nbsp;determined</font>
             mined on input.  When an extracted file is a directory, the entire file hierarchy rooted at
             that directory is extracted.  All extracted files are created relative to the current file
             hierarchy.  The setting of ownership, access and modification times, and file mode of the
             extracted files are discussed in more detail under the <b>-p</b> option.

     <b>-w</b>      <u>Write</u>.  <b>pax</b> writes an archive containing the <u>file</u> operands to standard output using the speci-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fied&nbsp;specified</font>
             fied archive format.  When no <u>file</u> operands are specified, a list of files to copy with one per
             line is read from standard input.  When a <u>file</u> operand is also a directory, the entire file
             hierarchy rooted at that directory will be included.

     <b>-r</b> <b>-w</b>   <u>Copy</u>.  <b>pax</b> copies the <u>file</u> operands to the destination <u>directory</u>.  When no <u>file</u> operands are
             specified, a list of files to copy with one per line is read from the standard input.  When a
             <u>file</u> operand is also a directory the entire file hierarchy rooted at that directory will be
             included.  The effect of the <u>copy</u> is as if the copied files were written to an archive file and
             then subsequently extracted, except that there may be hard links between the original and the
             copied files (see the <b>-l</b> option below).

             <u>Warning</u>: The destination <u>directory</u> must not be one of the <u>file</u> operands or a member of a file
             hierarchy rooted at one of the <u>file</u> operands.  The result of a <u>copy</u> under these conditions is
             unpredictable.

     While processing a damaged archive during a <u>read</u> or <u>list</u> operation, <b>pax</b> will attempt to recover from
     media defects and will search through the archive to locate and process the largest number of archive
     members possible (see the <b>-E</b> option for more details on error handling).

     The <u>directory</u> operand specifies a destination directory pathname.  If the <u>directory</u> operand does not
     exist, or it is not writable by the user, or it is not of type directory, <b>pax</b> will exit with a non-zero
     exit status.

     The <u>pattern</u> operand is used to select one or more pathnames of archive members.  Archive members are
     selected using the pattern matching notation described by <a href="../man3/fnmatch.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/fnmatch">fnmatch(3)</a>.  When the <u>pattern</u> operand is not
     supplied, all members of the archive will be selected.  When a <u>pattern</u> matches a directory, the entire
     file hierarchy rooted at that directory will be selected.  When a <u>pattern</u> operand does not select at
     least one archive member, <b>pax</b> will write these <u>pattern</u> operands in a diagnostic message to standard
     error and then exit with a non-zero exit status.

     The <u>file</u> operand specifies the pathname of a file to be copied or archived.  When a <u>file</u> operand does
     not select at least one archive member, <b>pax</b> will write these <u>file</u> operand pathnames in a diagnostic
     message to standard error and then exit with a non-zero exit status.

     The options are as follows:

     <b>-0</b>      Use the NUL (`\0') character as a pathname terminator, instead of newline (`\n').  This applies
             only to the pathnames read from standard input in the write and copy modes, and to the path-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">names&nbsp;pathnames</font>
             names written to standard output in list mode.  This option is expected to be used in concert
             with the <b>-print0</b> function in <a href="find.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/find">find(1)</a> or the <b>-0</b> flag in <a href="xargs.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/xargs">xargs(1)</a>.

     <b>-a</b>      Append <u>files</u> to the end of an archive that was previously written.  If an archive format is not
             specified with a <b>-x</b> option, the format currently being used in the archive will be selected.
             Any attempt to append to an archive in a format different from the format already used in the
             archive will cause <b>pax</b> to exit immediately with a non-zero exit status.  The blocking size used
             in the archive volume where writing starts will continue to be used for the remainder of that
             archive volume.

             <u>Warning</u>: Many storage devices are not able to support the operations necessary to perform an
             append operation.  Any attempt to append to an archive stored on such a device may damage the
             archive or have other unpredictable results.  Tape drives in particular are more likely to not
             support an append operation.  An archive stored in a regular file system file or on a disk
             device will usually support an append operation.

     <b>-B</b> <u>bytes</u>
             Limit the number of bytes written to a single archive volume to <u>bytes</u>.  The <u>bytes</u> limit can end
             with `m', `k', or `b' to specify multiplication by 1048576 (1M), 1024 (1K) or 512, respec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tively.&nbsp;respectively.</font>
             tively.  A pair of <u>bytes</u> limits can be separated by `x' to indicate a product.

             <u>Warning</u>: Only use this option when writing an archive to a device which supports an end of file
             read condition based on last (or largest) write offset (such as a regular file or a tape
             drive).  The use of this option with a floppy or hard disk is not recommended.

     <b>-b</b> <u>blocksize</u>
             When <u>writing</u> an archive, block the output at a positive decimal integer number of bytes per
             write to the archive file.  The <u>blocksize</u> must be a multiple of 512 bytes with a maximum of
             64512 bytes.  Archives larger than 32256 bytes violate the POSIX standard and will not be por-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">table&nbsp;portable</font>
             table to all systems.  A <u>blocksize</u> can end with `k' or `b' to specify multiplication by 1024
             (1K) or 512, respectively.  A pair of <u>blocksizes</u> can be separated by `x' to indicate a product.
             A specific archive device may impose additional restrictions on the size of blocking it will
             support.  When blocking is not specified, the default <u>blocksize</u> is dependent on the specific
             archive format being used (see the <b>-x</b> option).

     <b>-c</b>      Match all file or archive members <u>except</u> those specified by the <u>pattern</u> and <u>file</u> operands.

     <b>-D</b>      This option is the same as the <b>-u</b> option, except that the file inode change time is checked
             instead of the file modification time.  The file inode change time can be used to select files
             whose inode information (e.g., UID, GID, etc.) is newer than a copy of the file in the destina-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;destination</font>
             tion <u>directory</u>.

     <b>-d</b>      Cause files of type directory being copied or archived, or archive members of type directory
             being extracted, to match only the directory file or archive member and not the file hierarchy
             rooted at the directory.

     <b>-E</b> <u>limit</u>
             Limit the number of consecutive read faults while trying to read a flawed archive to <u>limit</u>.
             With a positive <u>limit</u>, <b>pax</b> will attempt to recover from an archive read error and will continue
             processing starting with the next file stored in the archive.  A <u>limit</u> of 0 will cause <b>pax</b> to
             stop operation after the first read error is detected on an archive volume.  A <u>limit</u> of NONE
             will cause <b>pax</b> to attempt to recover from read errors forever.  The default <u>limit</u> is a small
             positive number of retries.

             <u>Warning</u>: Using this option with NONE should be used with extreme caution as <b>pax</b> may get stuck
             in an infinite loop on a very badly flawed archive.

     <b>-f</b> <u>archive</u>
             Specify <u>archive</u> as the pathname of the input or output archive, overriding the default standard
             input (for <u>list</u> and <u>read</u>) or standard output (for <u>write</u>).  A single archive may span multiple
             files and different archive devices.  When required, <b>pax</b> will prompt for the pathname of the
             file or device of the next volume in the archive.

     <b>-G</b> <u>group</u>
             Select a file based on its <u>group</u> name, or when starting with a <b>#</b>, a numeric gid.  A `\' can be
             used to escape the <b>#</b>.  Multiple <b>-G</b> options may be supplied and checking stops with the first
             match.

     <b>-H</b>      Follow only command-line symbolic links while performing a physical file system traversal.

     <b>-i</b>      Interactively rename files or archive members.  For each archive member matching a <u>pattern</u> op-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">erand&nbsp;operand</font>
             erand or each file matching a <u>file</u> operand, <b>pax</b> will prompt to <u>/dev/tty</u> giving the name of the
             file, its file mode, and its modification time.  <b>pax</b> will then read a line from <u>/dev/tty</u>.  If
             this line is blank, the file or archive member is skipped.  If this line consists of a single
             period, the file or archive member is processed with no modification to its name.  Otherwise,
             its name is replaced with the contents of the line.  <b>pax</b> will immediately exit with a non-zero
             exit status if EOF is encountered when reading a response or if <u>/dev/tty</u> cannot be opened for
             reading and writing.

     <b>-k</b>      Do not overwrite existing files.

     <b>-L</b>      Follow all symbolic links to perform a logical file system traversal.

     <b>-l</b>      (The lowercase letter ``ell.'') Link files.  In the <u>copy</u> mode (<b>-r</b> <b>-w</b>), hard links are made
             between the source and destination file hierarchies whenever possible.

     <b>-n</b>      Select the first archive member that matches each <u>pattern</u> operand.  No more than one archive
             member is matched for each <u>pattern</u>.  When members of type directory are matched, the file hier-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">archy&nbsp;hierarchy</font>
             archy rooted at that directory is also matched (unless <b>-d</b> is also specified).

     <b>-O</b>      Force the archive to be one volume.  If a volume ends prematurely, <b>pax</b> will not prompt for a
             new volume.  This option can be useful for automated tasks where error recovery cannot be per-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">formed&nbsp;performed</font>
             formed by a human.

     <b>-o</b> <u>options</u>
             Information to modify the algorithm for extracting or writing archive files which is specific
             to the archive format specified by <b>-x</b>.  In general, <u>options</u> take the form: <u>name</u>=<u>value</u>.

             If the "-x pax" option is used, the ":=" form of keyword specification is supported.  Also, the
             following new keywords are implemented:

             <b></b><b><u>oo</u></b>   delete=&lt;pattern&gt;

             <b></b><b><u>oo</u></b>   exthdr.name=&lt;string&gt;

                 fiers)

             <b></b><b><u>oo</u></b>   times

             <b></b><b><u>oo</u></b>   all keywords in pax Extended Header, with the following restrictions:

                 charset       keyword recognized, but ignored

                 realtime.any  keyword not recognized

                 security.any  keyword not recognized

             In "copy mode", only the following new keywords are supported:

             <b></b><b><u>oo</u></b>   delete=

             <b></b><b><u>oo</u></b>   invalid=

             <b></b><b><u>oo</u></b>   path= (from pax Extended Header description)

     <b>-P</b>      Do not follow symbolic links, perform a physical file system traversal.  This is the default
             mode.

     <b>-p</b> <u>string</u>
             Specify one or more file characteristic options (privileges).  The <u>string</u> option-argument is a
             string specifying file characteristics to be retained or discarded on extraction.  The string
             consists of the specification characters <b>a</b>, <b>e</b>, <b>m</b>, <b>o</b>, and <b>p</b>.  Multiple characteristics can be
             concatenated within the same string and multiple <b>-p</b> options can be specified.  The meanings of
             the specification characters are as follows:

             <b>a</b>   Do not preserve file access times.  By default, file access times are preserved whenever
                 possible.

             <b>e</b>   `Preserve everything', the user ID, group ID, file mode bits, file access time, and file
                 modification time.  This is intended to be used by <u>root</u>, someone with all the appropriate
                 privileges, in order to preserve all aspects of the files as they are recorded in the ar-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">chive.&nbsp;archive.</font>
                 chive.  The <b>e</b> flag is the sum of the <b>o</b> and <b>p</b> flags.

             <b>m</b>   Do not preserve file modification times.  By default, file modification times are preserved
                 whenever possible.

             <b>o</b>   Preserve the user ID and group ID.

             <b>p</b>   `Preserve' the file mode bits.  This is intended to be used by a <u>user</u> with regular privi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">leges&nbsp;privileges</font>
                 leges who wants to preserve all aspects of the file other than the ownership.  The file
                 times are preserved by default, but two other flags are offered to disable this and use the
                 time of extraction instead.

             In the preceding list, `preserve' indicates that an attribute stored in the archive is given to
             the extracted file, subject to the permissions of the invoking process.  Otherwise the
             attribute of the extracted file is determined as part of the normal file creation action.  If
             neither the <b>e</b> nor the <b>o</b> specification character is specified, or the user ID and group ID are
             not preserved for any reason, <b>pax</b> will not set the S_ISUID (<u>setuid</u>) and S_ISGID (<u>setgid</u>) bits
             of the file mode.  If the preservation of any of these items fails for any reason, <b>pax</b> will
             write a diagnostic message to standard error.  Failure to preserve these items will affect the
             final exit status, but will not cause the extracted file to be deleted.  If the file character-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">istic&nbsp;characteristic</font>
             istic letters in any of the string option-arguments are duplicated or conflict with each other,
             the <!-- a -->one(s)<!-- /a --> given last will take precedence.  For example, if
                   <b>-p</b> <u>eme</u>
             is specified, file modification times are still preserved.

     <b>-r</b>      Read an archive file from standard input and extract the specified <u>files</u>.  If any intermediate
             directories are needed in order to extract an archive member, these directories will be created
             as if <a href="../man2/mkdir.2.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/2/mkdir">mkdir(2)</a> was called with the bitwise inclusive OR of S_IRWXU, S_IRWXG, and S_IRWXO as the
             mode argument.  When the selected archive format supports the specification of linked files and
             these files cannot be linked while the archive is being extracted, <b>pax</b> will write a diagnostic
             message to standard error and exit with a non-zero exit status at the completion of operation.

     <b>-s</b> <u>replstr</u>
             Modify the file or archive member names specified by the <u>pattern</u> or <u>file</u> operands according to
             the substitution expression <u>replstr</u>, using the syntax of the <a href="ed.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ed">ed(1)</a> utility regular expressions.
             The format of these regular expressions is:
                   /old/new/[gp]
             As in <a href="ed.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ed">ed(1)</a>, <b>old</b> is a basic regular expression and <b>new</b> can contain an ampersand (`&amp;'), `\n'
             (where <u>n</u> is a digit) back-references, or subexpression matching.  The <b>old</b> string may also con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tain&nbsp;contain</font>
             tain newline characters.  Any non-null character can be used as a delimiter (`/' is shown
             here).  Multiple <b>-s</b> expressions can be specified.  The expressions are applied in the order
             they are specified on the command line, terminating with the first successful substitution.
             The optional trailing <b>g</b> continues to apply the substitution expression to the pathname sub-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">string,&nbsp;substring,</font>
             string, which starts with the first character following the end of the last successful substi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tution.&nbsp;substitution.</font>
             tution.  The first unsuccessful substitution stops the operation of the <b>g</b> option.  The optional
             trailing <b>p</b> will cause the final result of a successful substitution to be written to standard
             error in the following format:
                   &lt;original pathname&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;new pathname&gt;
             File or archive member names that substitute to the empty string are not selected and will be
             skipped.

     <b>-T</b> <u>[from</u><b>_</b><u>date][,to</u><b>_</b><u>date][/[c][m]]</u>
             Allow files to be selected based on a file modification or inode change time falling within a
             specified time range of <u>from</u><b>_</b><u>date</u> to <u>to</u><b>_</b><u>date</u> (the dates are inclusive).  If only a <u>from</u><b>_</b><u>date</u> is
             supplied, all files with a modification or inode change time equal to or younger are selected.
             If only a <u>to</u><b>_</b><u>date</u> is supplied, all files with a modification or inode change time equal to or
             older will be selected.  When the <u>from</u><b>_</b><u>date</u> is equal to the <u>to</u><b>_</b><u>date</u>, only files with a modifi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cation&nbsp;modification</font>
             cation or inode change time of exactly that time will be selected.

             When <b>pax</b> is in the <u>write</u> or <u>copy</u> mode, the optional trailing field <u>[c][m]</u> can be used to deter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mine&nbsp;determine</font>
             mine which file time (inode change, file modification or both) are used in the comparison.  If
             neither is specified, the default is to use file modification time only.  The <u>m</u> specifies the
             comparison of file modification time (the time when the file was last written).  The <u>c</u> speci-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fies&nbsp;specifies</font>
             fies the comparison of inode change time (the time when the file inode was last changed; e.g.,
             a change of owner, group, mode, etc).  When <u>c</u> and <u>m</u> are both specified, then the modification
             and inode change times are both compared.  The inode change time comparison is useful in
             selecting files whose attributes were recently changed or selecting files which were recently
             created and had their modification time reset to an older time (as what happens when a file is
             extracted from an archive and the modification time is preserved).  Time comparisons using both
             file times is useful when <b>pax</b> is used to create a time based incremental archive (only files
             that were changed during a specified time range will be archived).

             A time range is made up of six different fields and each field must contain two digits.  The
             format is:
                   [[[[[cc]yy]mm]dd]HH]MM[.SS]
             Where <b>cc</b> is the first two digits of the year (the century), <b>yy</b> is the last two digits of the
             year, the first <b>mm</b> is the month (from 01 to 12), <b>dd</b> is the day of the month (from 01 to 31), <b>HH</b>
             is the hour of the day (from 00 to 23), <b>MM</b> is the minute (from 00 to 59), and <b>SS</b> is the seconds
             (from 00 to 59).  The minute field <b>MM</b> is required, while the other fields are optional and must
             be added in the following order:
                  <b>HH</b>, <b>dd</b>, <b>mm</b>, <b>yy</b>, <b>cc</b>.
             The <b>SS</b> field may be added independently of the other fields.  Time ranges are relative to the
             current time, so
                   <b>-T</b> <u>1234/cm</u>
             would select all files with a modification or inode change time of 12:34 PM today or later.
             Multiple <b>-T</b> time range can be supplied and checking stops with the first match.

     <b>-t</b>      Reset the access times of any file or directory read or accessed by <b>pax</b> to be the same as they
             were before being read or accessed by <b>pax</b>.

     <b>-U</b> <u>user</u>
             Select a file based on its <u>user</u> name, or when starting with a <b>#</b>, a numeric UID.  A `\' can be
             used to escape the <b>#</b>.  Multiple <b>-U</b> options may be supplied and checking stops with the first
             match.

     <b>-u</b>      Ignore files that are older (having a less recent file modification time) than a pre-existing
             file or archive member with the same name.  During <u>read</u>, an archive member with the same name
             as a file in the file system will be extracted if the archive member is newer than the file.
             During <u>write</u>, a file system member with the same name as an archive member will be written to
             the archive if it is newer than the archive member.  During <u>copy</u>, the file in the destination
             hierarchy is replaced by the file in the source hierarchy or by a link to the file in the
             source hierarchy if the file in the source hierarchy is newer.

     <b>-v</b>      During a <u>list</u> operation, produce a verbose table of contents using the format of the <a href="ls.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ls">ls(1)</a>
             utility with the <b>-l</b> option.  For pathnames representing a hard link to a previous member of the
             archive, the output has the format:
                   &lt;ls -l listing&gt; == &lt;link name&gt;
             For pathnames representing a symbolic link, the output has the format:
                   &lt;ls -l listing&gt; =&gt; &lt;link name&gt;
             Where &lt;ls -l listing&gt; is the output format specified by the <a href="ls.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ls">ls(1)</a> utility when used with the <b>-l</b>
             option.  Otherwise for all the other operational modes (<u>read</u>, <u>write</u>, and <u>copy</u>), pathnames are
             written and flushed to standard error without a trailing newline as soon as processing begins
             on that file or archive member.  The trailing newline is not buffered and is written only after
             the file has been read or written.

     <b>-w</b>      Write files to the standard output in the specified archive format.  When no <u>file</u> operands are
             specified, standard input is read for a list of pathnames with one per line without any leading
             or trailing &lt;blanks&gt;.

     <b>-X</b>      When traversing the file hierarchy specified by a pathname, do not descend into directories
             that have a different device ID.  See the st_dev field as described in <a href="../man2/stat.2.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/2/stat">stat(2)</a> for more infor-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mation&nbsp;information</font>
             mation about device IDs.

     <b>-x</b> <u>format</u>
             Specify the output archive format, with the default format being <u>ustar</u>.  <b>pax</b> currently supports
             the following formats:

             <u>bcpio</u>    The old binary cpio format.  The default blocksize for this format is 5120 bytes.
                      This format is not very portable and should not be used when other formats are avail-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able.&nbsp;available.</font>
                      able.  Inode and device information about a file (used for detecting file hard links
                      by this format), which may be truncated by this format, is detected by <b>pax</b> and is
                      repaired.

             <u>cpio</u>     The extended cpio interchange format specified in the IEEE Std 1003.2 (``POSIX.2'')
                      standard.  The default blocksize for this format is 5120 bytes.  Inode and device
                      information about a file (used for detecting file hard links by this format), which
                      may be truncated by this format, is detected by <b>pax</b> and is repaired.

             <u>pax</u>      "pax interchange format", described in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION of the pax interchange
                      format in The Open Group's SUSv3 specification.  Includes support for pax Header
                      Block, pax Extended Header, pax Extended Header Keyword Precedence, and pax Extended
                      Header File Times.

             <u>sv4cpio</u>  The System V release 4 cpio.  The default blocksize for this format is 5120 bytes.
                      Inode and device information about a file (used for detecting file hard links by this
                      format), which may be truncated by this format, is detected by <b>pax</b> and is repaired.

             <u>sv4crc</u>   The System V release 4 cpio with file crc checksums.  The default blocksize for this
                      format is 5120 bytes.  Inode and device information about a file (used for detecting
                      file hard links by this format), which may be truncated by this format, is detected by
                      <b>pax</b> and is repaired.

             <u>tar</u>      The old BSD tar format as found in BSD4.3.  The default blocksize for this format is
                      10240 bytes.  Pathnames stored by this format must be 100 characters or less in
                      length.  Only <u>regular</u> files, <u>hard</u> <u>links</u>, <u>soft</u> <u>links</u>, and <u>directories</u> will be archived
                      (other file system types are not supported).  For backwards compatibility with even
                      older tar formats, a <b>-o</b> option can be used when writing an archive to omit the storage
                      of directories.  This option takes the form:
                            <b>-o</b> <b>write_opt=nodir</b>

             <u>ustar</u>    The extended tar interchange format specified in the IEEE Std 1003.2 (``POSIX.2'')
                      standard.  The default blocksize for this format is 10240 bytes.  Filenames stored by
                      this format must be 100 characters or less in length; the total pathname must be 255
                      characters or less.

             <b>pax</b> will detect and report any file that it is unable to store or extract as the result of any
             specific archive format restrictions.  The individual archive formats may impose additional
             restrictions on use.  Typical archive format restrictions include (but are not limited to):
             file pathname length, file size, link pathname length, and the type of the file.

     <b>-Y</b>      This option is the same as the <b>-D</b> option, except that the inode change time is checked using
             the pathname created after all the file name modifications have completed.

     <b>-Z</b>      This option is the same as the <b>-u</b> option, except that the modification time is checked using
             the pathname created after all the file name modifications have completed.

     <b>-z</b>      Use <a href="gzip.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/gzip">gzip(1)</a> to compress (decompress) the archive while writing (reading).  Incompatible with
             <b>-a</b>.

     The options that operate on the names of files or archive members (<b>-c</b>, <b>-i</b>, <b>-n</b>, <b>-s</b>, <b>-u</b>, <b>-v</b>, <b>-D</b>, <b>-G</b>, <b>-T</b>,
     <b>-U</b>, <b>-Y</b>, and <b>-Z</b>) interact as follows.

     When extracting files during a <u>read</u> operation, archive members are `selected', based only on the user
     specified pattern operands as modified by the <b>-c</b>, <b>-n</b>, <b>-u</b>, <b>-D</b>, <b>-G</b>, <b>-T</b>, <b>-U</b> options.  Then any <b>-s</b> and <b>-i</b>
     options will modify in that order, the names of these selected files.  Then the <b>-Y</b> and <b>-Z</b> options will
     be applied based on the final pathname.  Finally, the <b>-v</b> option will write the names resulting from
     these modifications.

     When archiving files during a <u>write</u> operation, or copying files during a <u>copy</u> operation, archive mem-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">bers&nbsp;members</font>
     bers are `selected', based only on the user specified pathnames as modified by the <b>-n</b>, <b>-u</b>, <b>-D</b>, <b>-G</b>, <b>-T</b>,
     and <b>-U</b> options (the <b>-D</b> option only applies during a copy operation).  Then any <b>-s</b> and <b>-i</b> options will
     modify in that order, the names of these selected files.  Then during a <u>copy</u> operation the <b>-Y</b> and the
     <b>-Z</b> options will be applied based on the final pathname.  Finally, the <b>-v</b> option will write the names
     resulting from these modifications.

     When one or both of the <b>-u</b> or <b>-D</b> options are specified along with the <b>-n</b> option, a file is not consid-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ered&nbsp;considered</font>
     ered selected unless it is newer than the file to which it is compared.

<b>ENVIRONMENT</b>
     TMPDIR      Path in which to store temporary files.

<b>EXAMPLES</b>
     $ pax -w -f /dev/rst0 .

     Copies the contents of the current directory to the device <u>/dev/rst0</u>.

     $ pax -v -f filename

     Gives the verbose table of contents for an archive stored in <u>filename</u>.

     $ mkdir newdir; cd olddir; pax -rw . newdir

     This sequence of commands will copy the entire <u>olddir</u> directory hierarchy to <u>newdir</u>.

     $ pax -r -s ',^//*usr//*,,' -f a.pax

     Reads the archive <u>a.pax</u>, with all files rooted in <u>/usr</u> into the archive extracted relative to the cur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rent&nbsp;current</font>
     rent directory.

     $ pax -rw -i . dest_dir

     Can be used to interactively select the files to copy from the current directory to <u>dest</u><b>_</b><u>dir</u>.

     $ pax -r -pe -U root -G bin -f a.pax

     Extract all files from the archive <u>a.pax</u> which are owned by <u>root</u> with group <u>bin</u> and preserve all file
     permissions.

     $ pax -r -w -v -Y -Z home /backup

     Update (and list) only those files in the destination directory <u>/backup</u> which are older (less recent
     inode change or file modification times) than files with the same name found in the source file tree
     <u>home</u>.

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
     <b>pax</b> will exit with one of the following values:

     0   All files were processed successfully.

     1   An error occurred.

     Whenever <b>pax</b> cannot create a file or a link when reading an archive or cannot find a file when writing
     an archive, or cannot preserve the user ID, group ID, or file mode when the <b>-p</b> option is specified, a
     diagnostic message is written to standard error and a non-zero exit status will be returned, but pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cessing&nbsp;processing</font>
     cessing will continue.  In the case where <b>pax</b> cannot create a link to a file, <b>pax</b> will not create a
     second copy of the file.

     If the extraction of a file from an archive is prematurely terminated by a signal or error, <b>pax</b> may
     have only partially extracted a file the user wanted.  Additionally, the file modes of extracted files
     and directories may have incorrect file bits, and the modification and access times may be wrong.

     If the creation of an archive is prematurely terminated by a signal or error, <b>pax</b> may have only par-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tially&nbsp;partially</font>
     tially created the archive, which may violate the specific archive format specification.

     If, while doing a <u>copy</u>, <b>pax</b> detects a file is about to overwrite itself, the file is not copied, a
     diagnostic message is written to standard error and when <b>pax</b> completes it will exit with a non-zero
     exit status.

<b>STANDARDS</b>
     The <b>pax</b> utility is a superset of the IEEE Std 1003.2 (``POSIX.2'') standard.  The options <b>-B</b>, <b>-D</b>, <b>-E</b>,
     <b>-G</b>, <b>-H</b>, <b>-L</b>, <b>-O</b>, <b>-P</b>, <b>-T</b>, <b>-U</b>, <b>-Y</b>, <b>-Z</b>, the archive formats <u>bcpio</u>, <u>sv4cpio</u>, <u>sv4crc</u>, <u>tar</u>, and the flawed ar-
     chive handling during <u>list</u> and <u>read</u> operations are extensions to the POSIX standard.
