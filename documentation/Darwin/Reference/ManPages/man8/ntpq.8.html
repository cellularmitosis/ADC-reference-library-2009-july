NTPQ(8)                   BSD System Manager's Manual                  NTPQ(8)

<b>NAME</b>
     <b>ntpq</b> -- standard NTP query program

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
     <b>ntpq</b> [<b>-inp</b>] [<b>-c</b> <u>command</u>] [<u>host</u> <u>...</u>]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
     The <b>ntpq</b> utility is used to query NTP servers which implement the recommended NTP mode 6 control mes-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sage&nbsp;message</font>
     sage format about current state and to request changes in that state.  The program may be run either in
     interactive mode or controlled using command line arguments.  Requests to read and write arbitrary
     variables can be assembled, with raw and pretty-printed output options being available.  The <b>ntpq</b> util-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ity&nbsp;utility</font>
     ity can also obtain and print a list of peers in a common format by sending multiple queries to the
     server.

     If one or more request options is included on the command line when <b>ntpq</b> is executed, each of the
     requests will be sent to the NTP servers running on each of the hosts given as command line arguments,
     or on localhost by default.  If no request options are given, <b>ntpq</b> will attempt to read commands from
     the standard input and execute these on the NTP server running on the first host given on the command
     line, again defaulting to localhost when no other host is specified.  The <b>ntpq</b> utility will prompt for
     commands if the standard input is a terminal device.

     The <b>ntpq</b> utility uses NTP mode 6 packets to communicate with the NTP server, and hence can be used to
     query any compatible server on the network which permits it.  Note that since NTP is a UDP protocol
     this communication will be somewhat unreliable, especially over large distances in terms of network
     topology.  The <b>ntpq</b> utility makes one attempt to retransmit requests, and will time requests out if the
     remote host is not heard from within a suitable timeout time.

     For examples and usage, see the "NTP Debugging Techniques" page (available as part of the HTML documen-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tation&nbsp;documentation</font>
     tation provided in <u>/usr/share/doc/ntp</u>).

     The following options are available:

     <b>-c</b>      The following argument is interpreted as an interactive format command and is added to the list
             of commands to be executed on the specified <!-- a -->host(s)<!-- /a -->.  Multiple <b>-c</b> options may be given.

     <b>-i</b>      Force <b>ntpq</b> to operate in interactive mode.  Prompts will be written to the standard output and
             commands read from the standard input.

     <b>-n</b>      Output all host addresses in dotted-quad numeric format rather than converting to the canonical
             host names.

     <b>-p</b>      Print a list of the peers known to the server as well as a summary of their state.  This is
             equivalent to the <b>peers</b> interactive command.

     Specifying a command line option other than <b>-i</b> or <b>-n</b> will cause the specified query (queries) to be
     sent to the indicated <!-- a -->host(s)<!-- /a --> immediately.  Otherwise, <b>ntpq</b> will attempt to read interactive format
     commands from the standard input.

   <b>Internal</b> <b>Commands</b>
     Interactive format commands consist of a keyword followed by zero to four arguments.  Only enough char-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">acters&nbsp;characters</font>
     acters of the full keyword to uniquely identify the command need be typed.  The output of a command is
     normally sent to the standard output, but optionally the output of individual commands may be sent to a
     file by appending a `&gt;', followed by a file name, to the command line.  A number of interactive format
     commands are executed entirely within the <b>ntpq</b> utility itself and do not result in NTP mode 6 requests
     being sent to a server.  These are described following.

     <b>?</b> [<u>command</u><b>_</b><u>keyword</u>]

     <b>help</b> [<u>command</u><b>_</b><u>keyword</u>]
             A `?' by itself will print a list of all the command keywords known to this incarnation of
             <b>ntpq</b>.  A `?' followed by a command keyword will print function and usage information about the
             command.  This command is probably a better source of information about <b>ntpq</b> than this manual
             page.

     <b>addvars</b> <u>variable</u><b>_</b><u>name</u>[=<u>value</u> <u>...</u>]

     <b>rmvars</b> <u>variable</u><b>_</b><u>name</u> <u>...</u>

     <b>clearvars</b>
             The data carried by NTP mode 6 messages consists of a list of items of the form
             `variable_name=value', where the `=value' is ignored, and can be omitted, in requests to the
             server to read variables.  The <b>ntpq</b> utility maintains an internal list in which data to be
             included in control messages can be assembled, and sent using the <b>readlist</b> and <b>writelist</b> com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mands&nbsp;commands</font>
             mands described below.  The <b>addvars</b> command allows variables and their optional values to be
             added to the list.  If more than one variable is to be added, the list should be comma-sepa-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rated&nbsp;comma-separated</font>
             rated and not contain white space.  The <b>rmvars</b> command can be used to remove individual vari-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ables&nbsp;variables</font>
             ables from the list, while the <b>clearlist</b> command removes all variables from the list.

     <b>authenticate</b> <b>yes</b> | <b>no</b>
             Normally <b>ntpq</b> does not authenticate requests unless they are write requests.  The command
             `authenticate yes' causes <b>ntpq</b> to send authentication with all requests it makes.  Authenti-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cated&nbsp;Authenticated</font>
             cated requests causes some servers to handle requests slightly differently, and can occasion-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ally&nbsp;occasionally</font>
             ally melt the CPU in fuzzballs if you turn authentication on before doing a <b>peer</b> display.

     <b>cooked</b>  Causes output from query commands to be "cooked", so that variables which are recognized by
             <b>ntpq</b> will have their values reformatted for human consumption.  Variables which <b>ntpq</b> thinks
             should have a decodable value but didn't are marked with a trailing `?'.

     <b>debug</b> <b>more</b> | <b>less</b> | <b>off</b>
             Turns internal query program debugging on and off.

     <b>delay</b> <u>milliseconds</u>
             Specify a time interval to be added to timestamps included in requests which require authenti-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cation.&nbsp;authentication.</font>
             cation.  This is used to enable (unreliable) server reconfiguration over long delay network
             paths or between machines whose clocks are unsynchronized.  Actually the server does not now
             require timestamps in authenticated requests, so this command may be obsolete.

     <b>host</b> <u>hostname</u>
             Set the host to which future queries will be sent.  Hostname may be either a host name or a
             numeric address.

     <b>hostnames</b> <b>yes</b> | <b>no</b>
             If <b>yes</b> is specified, host names are printed in information displays.  If <b>no</b> is specified,
             numeric addresses are printed instead.  The default is <b>yes</b>, unless modified using the command
             line <b>-n</b> switch.

     <b>keyid</b> <u>keyid</u>
             This command allows the specification of a key number to be used to authenticate configuration
             requests.  This must correspond to a key number the server has been configured to use for this
             purpose.

     <b>ntpversion</b> <b>1</b> | <b>2</b> | <b>3</b> | <b>4</b>
             Sets the NTP version number which <b>ntpq</b> claims in packets.  Defaults to 3, Note that mode 6 con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">trol&nbsp;control</font>
             trol messages (and modes, for that matter) didn't exist in NTP version 1.  There appear to be
             no servers left which demand version 1.

     <b>quit</b>    Exit <b>ntpq</b>.

     <b>passwd</b>  This command prompts you to type in a password (which will not be echoed) which will be used to
             authenticate configuration requests.  The password must correspond to the key configured for
             use by the NTP server for this purpose if such requests are to be successful.

     <b>raw</b>     Causes all output from query commands is printed as received from the remote server.  The only
             formating/interpretation done on the data is to transform nonascii data into a printable (but
             barely understandable) form.

     <b>timeout</b> <u>milliseconds</u>
             Specify a timeout period for responses to server queries.  The default is about 5000 millisec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">onds.&nbsp;milliseconds.</font>
             onds.  Note that since <b>ntpq</b> retries each query once after a timeout, the total waiting time for
             a timeout will be twice the timeout value set.

   <b>Control</b> <b>Message</b> <b>Commands</b>
     Each peer known to an NTP server has a 16 bit integer association identifier assigned to it.  NTP con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">trol&nbsp;control</font>
     trol messages which carry peer variables must identify the peer the values correspond to by including
     its association ID.  An association ID of 0 is special, and indicates the variables are system vari-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ables,&nbsp;variables,</font>
     ables, whose names are drawn from a separate name space.

     Control message commands result in one or more NTP mode 6 messages being sent to the server, and cause
     the data returned to be printed in some format.  Most commands currently implemented send a single mes-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sage&nbsp;message</font>
     sage and expect a single response.  The current exceptions are the peers command, which will send a
     preprogrammed series of messages to obtain the data it needs, and the mreadlist and mreadvar commands,
     which will iterate over a range of associations.

     <b>associations</b>
             Obtains and prints a list of association identifiers and peer statuses for in-spec peers of the
             server being queried.  The list is printed in columns.  The first of these is an index number-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;numbering</font>
             ing the associations from 1 for internal use, the second the actual association identifier
             returned by the server and the third the status word for the peer.  This is followed by a num-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ber&nbsp;number</font>
             ber of columns containing data decoded from the status word.  See the peers command for a
             decode of the `condition' field.  Note that the data returned by the <b>associations</b> command is
             cached internally in <b>ntpq</b>.  The index is then of use when dealing with stupid servers which use
             association identifiers which are hard for humans to type, in that for any subsequent commands
             which require an association identifier as an argument, the form of index may be used as an
             alternative.

     <b>clockvar</b> [<u>assocID</u>] [<u>variable</u><b>_</b><u>name</u>[=<u>value</u> <u>...</u>]] <u>...</u>

     <b>cv</b> [<u>assocID</u>] [<u>variable</u><b>_</b><u>name</u>[=<u>value</u> <u>...</u>]] <u>...</u>
             Requests that a list of the server's clock variables be sent.  Servers which have a radio clock
             or other external synchronization will respond positively to this.  If the association identi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fier&nbsp;identifier</font>
             fier is omitted or zero the request is for the variables of the `system clock' and will gener-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ally&nbsp;generally</font>
             ally get a positive response from all servers with a clock.  If the server treats clocks as
             pseudo-peers, and hence can possibly have more than one clock connected at once, referencing
             the appropriate peer association ID will show the variables of a particular clock.  Omitting
             the variable list will cause the server to return a default variable display.

     <b>lassociations</b>
             Obtains and prints a list of association identifiers and peer statuses for all associations for
             which the server is maintaining state.  This command differs from the <b>associations</b> command only
             for servers which retain state for out-of-spec client associations (i.e., fuzzballs).  Such
             associations are normally omitted from the display when the <b>associations</b> command is used, but
             are included in the output of <b>lassociations</b>.

     <b>lpassociations</b>
             Print data for all associations, including out-of-spec client associations, from the internally
             cached list of associations.  This command differs from <b>passociations</b> only when dealing with
             fuzzballs.

     <b>lpeers</b>  Like R peers, except a summary of all associations for which the server is maintaining state is
             printed.  This can produce a much longer list of peers from fuzzball servers.

     <b>mreadlist</b> <u>assocID</u> <u>assocID</u>

     <b>mrl</b> <u>assocID</u> <u>assocID</u>
             Like the <b>readlist</b> command, except the query is done for each of a range of (nonzero) associa-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;association</font>
             tion IDs.  This range is determined from the association list cached by the most recent
             <b>associations</b> command.

     <b>mreadvar</b> <u>assocID</u> <u>assocID</u> [<u>variable</u><b>_</b><u>name</u>[=<u>value</u> <u>...</u>]]

     <b>mrv</b> <u>assocID</u> <u>assocID</u> [<u>variable</u><b>_</b><u>name</u>[=<u>value</u> <u>...</u>]]
             Like the <b>readvar</b> command, except the query is done for each of a range of (nonzero) association
             IDs.  This range is determined from the association list cached by the most recent <b>associations</b>
             command.

     <b>opeers</b>  An old form of the <b>peers</b> command with the reference ID replaced by the local interface address.

     <b>passociations</b>
             Displays association data concerning in-spec peers from the internally cached list of associa-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tions.&nbsp;associations.</font>
             tions.  This command performs identically to the <b>associations</b> except that it displays the
             internally stored data rather than making a new query.

     <b>peers</b>   Obtains a current list peers of the server, along with a summary of each peer's state.  Summary
             information includes the address of the remote peer, the reference ID (0.0.0.0 if this is
             unknown), the stratum of the remote peer, the type of the peer (local, unicast, multicast or
             broadcast), when the last packet was received, the polling interval, in seconds, the reachabil-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ity&nbsp;reachability</font>
             ity register, in octal, and the current estimated delay, offset and dispersion of the peer, all
             in milliseconds.  The character in the left margin indicates the fate of this peer in the clock
             selection process.  Following is a list of these characters, the pigeon used in the <b>rv</b> command,
             and a short explanation of the condition revealed.

             space   (reject) The peer is discarded as unreachable, synchronized to this server (synch loop)
                     or outrageous synchronization distance.

             x       (falsetick) The peer is discarded by the intersection algorithm as a falseticker.

             .       (excess) The peer is discarded as not among the first ten peers sorted by synchroniza-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;synchronization</font>
                     tion distance and so is probably a poor candidate for further consideration.

             -       (outlyer) The peer is discarded by the clustering algorithm as an outlyer.

             +       (candidate) The peer is a survivor and a candidate for the combining algorithm.

             #       (selected) The peer is a survivor, but not among the first six peers sorted by synchro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nization&nbsp;synchronization</font>
                     nization distance.  If the association is ephemeral, it may be demobilized to conserve
                     resources.

             *       (peer) The peer has been declared the system peer and lends its variables to the system
                     variables.

             o       ((pps.peer)) The peer has been declared the system peer and lends its variables to the
                     system variables.  However, the actual system synchronization is derived from a pulse-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">per-second&nbsp;pulseper-second</font>
                     per-second (PPS) signal, either indirectly via the PPS reference clock driver or
                     directly via kernel interface.

     The <u>flash</u> variable is a valuable debugging aid.  It displays the results of the original sanity checks
     defined in the NTP specification RFC-1305 and additional ones added in NTP Version 4.  There are eleven
     tests called <b>TEST1</b> through <b>TEST11</b>.  The tests are performed in a certain order designed to gain maximum
     diagnostic information while protecting against accidental or malicious errors.  The <u>flash</u> variable is
     first initialized to zero.  If after each set of tests one or more bits are set, the packet is dis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">carded.&nbsp;discarded.</font>
     carded.

     Tests <b>TEST4</b> and <b>TEST5</b> check the access permissions and cryptographic message digest.  If any bits are
     set after that, the packet is discarded.  Tests <b>TEST10</b> and <b>TEST11</b> check the authentication state using
     Autokey public-key cryptography, as described in the <u>Authentication</u> <u>Options</u> section of <a href="../man5/ntp.conf.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/ntp.conf">ntp.conf(5)</a>.  If
     any bits are set and the association has previously been marked reachable, the packet is discarded;
     otherwise, the originate and receive timestamps are saved, as required by the NTP protocol, and pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cessing&nbsp;processing</font>
     cessing continues.

     Tests <b>TEST1</b> through <b>TEST3</b> check the packet timestamps from which the offset and delay are calculated.
     If any bits are set, the packet is discarded; otherwise, the packet header variables are saved.  Tests
     <b>TEST6</b> through <b>TEST8</b> check the health of the server.  If any bits are set, the packet is discarded; oth-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">erwise,&nbsp;otherwise,</font>
     erwise, the offset and delay relative to the server are calculated and saved.  Test <b>TEST9</b> checks the
     health of the association itself.  If any bits are set, the packet is discarded; otherwise, the saved
     variables are passed to the clock filter and mitigation algorithms.

     The <u>flash</u> bits for each test read in increasing order from the least significant bit are defined as
     follows.

     <b>TEST1</b>   Duplicate packet.  The packet is at best a casual retransmission and at worst a malicious
             replay.

     <b>TEST2</b>   Bogus packet.  The packet is not a reply to a message previously sent.  This can happen when
             the NTP daemon is restarted and before somebody else notices.

     <b>TEST3</b>   Unsynchronized.  One or more timestamp fields are invalid.  This normally happens when the
             first packet from a peer is received.

     <b>TEST4</b>   Access is denied.  See the "Access Control" page.

     <b>TEST5</b>   Cryptographic authentication fails.  See the <u>Authentication</u> <u>Options</u> section of <a href="../man5/ntp.conf.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/ntp.conf">ntp.conf(5)</a>.

     <b>TEST6</b>   The server is unsynchronized.  Wind up its clock first.

     <b>TEST7</b>   The server stratum is at the maximum than 15.  It is probably unsynchronized and its clock
             needs to be wound up.

     <b>TEST8</b>   Either the root delay or dispersion is greater than one second, which is highly unlikely unless
             the peer is synchronized to Mars.

     <b>TEST9</b>   Either the peer delay or dispersion is greater than one second, which is highly unlikely unless
             the peer is on Mars.

     <b>TEST10</b>  The autokey protocol has detected an authentication failure.  See the <u>Authentication</u> <u>Options</u>
             section of <a href="../man5/ntp.conf.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/ntp.conf">ntp.conf(5)</a>.

     <b>TEST11</b>  The autokey protocol has not verified the server or peer is authentic and has valid public key
             credentials.  See the <u>Authentication</u> <u>Options</u> section of <a href="../man5/ntp.conf.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/ntp.conf">ntp.conf(5)</a>.

     Additional system variables used by the NTP Version 4 Autokey support include the following:

     <b>certificate</b> <u>filestamp</u>
             Shows the NTP seconds when the certificate file was created.

     <b>hostname</b> <u>host</u>
             Shows the name of the host as returned by the Unix <a href="../man3/gethostname.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/gethostname">gethostname(3)</a> library function.

     <b>flags</b> <u>hex</u>
             Shows the current flag bits, where the <u>hex</u> bits are interpreted as follows:

             0x01    autokey enabled

             0x02    RSA public/private key files present

             0x04    PKI certificate file present

             0x08    Diffie-Hellman parameters file present

             0x10    NIST leapseconds table file present

     <b>leapseconds</b> <u>filestamp</u>
             Shows the NTP seconds when the NIST leapseconds table file was created.

     <b>params</b> <u>filestamp</u>
             Shows the NTP seconds when the Diffie-Hellman agreement parameter file was created.

     <b>publickey</b> <u>filestamp</u>
             Shows the NTP seconds when the RSA public/private key files were created.

     <b>refresh</b> <u>filestamp</u>
             Shows the NTP seconds when the public cryptographic values were refreshed and signed.

     <b>tai</b> <u>offset</u>
             Shows the TAI-UTC offset in seconds obtained from the NIST leapseconds table.

     Additional peer variables used by the NTP Version 4 Autokey support include the following:

     <b>certificate</b> <u>filestamp</u>
             Shows the NTP seconds when the certificate file was created.

     <b>flags</b> <u>hex</u>
             Shows the current flag bits, where the <u>hex</u> bits are interpreted as in the system variable of
             the same name.  The bits are set in the first autokey message received from the server and then
             reset as the associated data are obtained from the server and stored.

     <b>hcookie</b> <u>hex</u>
             Shows the host cookie used in the key agreement algorithm.

     <b>initkey</b> <u>key</u>
             Shows the initial key used by the key list generator in the autokey protocol.

     <b>initsequence</b> <u>index</u>
             Shows the initial index used by the key list generator in the autokey protocol.

     <b>pcookie</b> <u>hex</u>
             Specifies the peer cookie used in the key agreement algorithm.

     <b>timestamp</b> <u>time</u>
             Shows the NTP seconds when the last autokey key list was generated and signed.

     <b>pstatus</b> <u>assocID</u>
             Sends a read status request to the server for the given association.  The names and values of
             the peer variables returned will be printed.  Note that the status word from the header is dis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">played&nbsp;displayed</font>
             played preceding the variables, both in hexadecimal and in pidgeon English.

     <b>readlist</b> <u>assocID</u>

     <b>rl</b> <u>assocID</u>
             Requests that the values of the variables in the internal variable list be returned by the
             server.  If the association ID is omitted or is 0 the variables are assumed to be system vari-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ables.&nbsp;variables.</font>
             ables.  Otherwise they are treated as peer variables.  If the internal variable list is empty a
             request is sent without data, which should induce the remote server to return a default dis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">play.&nbsp;display.</font>
             play.

     <b>readvar</b> <u>assocID</u> <u>variable</u><b>_</b><u>name</u>[=<u>value</u>] <u>...</u>

     <b>rv</b> <u>assocID</u> <u>variable</u><b>_</b><u>name</u>[=<u>value</u>] <u>...</u>
             Requests that the values of the specified variables be returned by the server by sending a read
             variables request.  If the association ID is omitted or is given as zero the variables are sys-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tem&nbsp;system</font>
             tem variables, otherwise they are peer variables and the values returned will be those of the
             corresponding peer.  Omitting the variable list will send a request with no data which should
             induce the server to return a default display.

     <b>writevar</b> <u>assocID</u> <u>variable</u><b>_</b><u>name</u>[=<u>value</u>] <u>...</u>
             Like the readvar request, except the specified variables are written instead of read.

     <b>writelist</b> [<u>assocID</u>]
             Like the readlist request, except the internal list variables are written instead of read.

<b>BUGS</b>
     The <b>peers</b> command is non-atomic and may occasionally result in spurious error messages about invalid
     associations occurring and terminating the command.  The timeout time is a fixed constant, which means
     you wait a long time for timeouts since it assumes sort of a worst case.  The program should improve
     the timeout estimate as it sends queries to a particular host, but doesn't.
