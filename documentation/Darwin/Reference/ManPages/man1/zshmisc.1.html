<b>SIMPLE</b> <b>COMMANDS</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>PIPELINES</b>
       A  <u>simple</u>  <u>command</u> is a sequence of optional parameter assignments followed by blank-separated words,
       with optional redirections interspersed.  The first word is the  command  to  be  executed,  and  the
       remaining  words,  if  any,  are arguments to the command.  If a command name is given, the parameter
       assignments modify the environment of the command when it is executed.  The value of a simple command
       is its exit status, or 128 plus the signal number if terminated by a signal.  For example,

              <b>echo</b> <b>foo</b>

       is a simple command with arguments.

       A  <u>pipeline</u>  is either a simple command, or a sequence of two or more simple commands where each com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
       mand is separated from the next by `<b>|</b>' or `<b>|&amp;</b>'.  Where commands are separated by  `<b>|</b>',  the  standard
       output  of  the  first command is connected to the standard input of the next.  `<b>|&amp;</b>' is shorthand for
       `<b>2&gt;&amp;1</b> <b>|</b>', which connects both the standard output and the standard error of the command to the  stan-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dard&nbsp;standard</font>
       dard  input  of the next.  The value of a pipeline is the value of the last command, unless the pipe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">line&nbsp;pipeline</font>
       line is preceded by `<b>!</b>' in which case the value is the logical inverse of the value of the last  com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand.&nbsp;command.</font>
       mand.  For example,

              <b>echo</b> <b>foo</b> <b>|</b> <b>sed</b> <b>'s/foo/bar/'</b>

       is  a  pipeline,  where  the output (`<b>foo</b>' plus a newline) of the first command will be passed to the
       input of the second.

       If a pipeline is preceded by `<b>coproc</b>', it is executed as a coprocess; a two-way pipe  is  established
       between  it  and the parent shell.  The shell can read from or write to the coprocess by means of the
       `<b>&gt;&amp;p</b>' and `<b>&lt;&amp;p</b>' redirection operators or with `<b>print</b> <b>-p</b>' and `<b>read</b> <b>-p</b>'.  A pipeline  cannot  be  pre-
       ceded by both `<b>coproc</b>' and `<b>!</b>'.  If job control is active, the coprocess can be treated in other than
       input and output as an ordinary background job.

       A <u>sublist</u> is either a single pipeline, or a sequence of two or more pipelines separated  by  `<b>&amp;&amp;</b>'  or
       `<b>||</b>'.  If two pipelines are separated by `<b>&amp;&amp;</b>', the second pipeline is executed only if the first suc-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ceeds&nbsp;succeeds</font>
       ceeds (returns a zero status).  If two pipelines are separated by `<b>||</b>', the second is  executed  only
       if  the  first  fails  (returns a nonzero status).  Both operators have equal precedence and are left
       associative.  The value of the sublist is the value of the last pipeline executed.  For example,

              <b>dmesg</b> <b>|</b> <b>grep</b> <b>panic</b> <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <b>print</b> <b>yes</b>

       is a sublist consisting of two pipelines, the second just a simple command which will be executed  if
       and only if the <b>grep</b> command returns a zero status.  If it does not, the value of the sublist is that
       return status, else it is the status returned by the <b>print</b> (almost certainly zero).

       A <u>list</u> is a sequence of zero or more sublists, in which each sublist is terminated by `<b>;</b>', `<b>&amp;</b>', `<b>&amp;|</b>',
       `<b>&amp;!</b>', or a newline.  This terminator may optionally be omitted from the last sublist in the list when
       the list appears as a complex command inside `<b>(</b>...<b>)</b>' or `<b>{</b>...<b>}</b>'.  When a sublist is terminated by `<b>;</b>'
       or newline, the shell waits for it to finish before executing the next sublist.  If a sublist is ter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">minated&nbsp;terminated</font>
       minated by a `<b>&amp;</b>', `<b>&amp;|</b>', or `<b>&amp;!</b>', the shell executes the last pipeline in it in  the  background,  and
       does not wait for it to finish (note the difference from other shells which execute the whole sublist
       in the background).  A backgrounded pipeline returns a status of zero.

       More generally, a list can be seen as a set of any shell commands whatsoever, including  the  complex
       commands below; this is implied wherever the word `list' appears in later descriptions.  For example,
       the commands in a shell function form a special sort of list.

<b>PRECOMMAND</b> <b>MODIFIERS</b>
       A simple command may be preceded by a <u>precommand</u> <u>modifier</u>, which will alter how the command is inter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">preted.&nbsp;interpreted.</font>
       preted.   These  modifiers  are  shell  builtin  commands  with the exception of <b>nocorrect</b> which is a
       reserved word.

       <b>-</b>      The command is executed with a `<b>-</b>' prepended to its <b>argv[0]</b> string.

       <b>noglob</b> Filename generation (globbing) is not performed on any of the words.

       <b>nocorrect</b>
              Spelling correction is not done on any of the words.  This must appear before any  other  pre-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">command&nbsp;precommand</font>
              command  modifier,  as  it  is interpreted immediately, before any parsing is done.  It has no
              effect in non-interactive shells.

       <b>exec</b>   The command is executed in the parent shell without forking.

       <b>command</b>
              The command word is taken to be the name of an external command, rather than a shell  function
              or builtin.

       <b>builtin</b>
              The command word is taken to be the name of a builtin command, rather than a shell function or
              external command.

<b>COMPLEX</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       A <u>complex</u> <u>command</u> in zsh is one of the following:

       <b>if</b> <u>list</u> <b>then</b> <u>list</u> [ <b>elif</b> <u>list</u> <b>then</b> <u>list</u> ] ... [ <b>else</b> <u>list</u> ] <b>fi</b>
              The <b>if</b> <u>list</u> is executed, and if it returns a zero exit status,  the  <b>then</b>  <u>list</u>  is  executed.
              Otherwise, the <b>elif</b> <u>list</u> is executed and if its status is zero, the <b>then</b> <u>list</u> is executed.  If
              each <b>elif</b> <u>list</u> returns nonzero status, the <b>else</b> <u>list</u> is executed.

       <b>for</b> <u>name</u> ... [ <b>in</b> <u>word</u> ... ] <u>term</u> <b>do</b> <u>list</u> <b>done</b>
              where <u>term</u> is at least one newline or <b>;</b>.  Expand the list of <u>word</u>s, and set the parameter <u>name</u>
              to  each  of them in turn, executing <u>list</u> each time.  If the <b>in</b> <u>word</u> is omitted, use the posi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tional&nbsp;positional</font>
              tional parameters instead of the <u>word</u>s.

              More than one parameter <u>name</u> can appear before the list of <u>word</u>s.  If <u>N</u> <u>name</u>s are given,  then
              on  each  execution of the loop the next <b>N</b> <u>word</u>s are assigned to the corresponding parameters.
              If there are more <u>name</u>s than remaining <u>word</u>s, the remaining parameters are  each  set  to  the
              empty  string.   Execution  of  the loop ends when there is no remaining <u>word</u> to assign to the
              first <u>name</u>.  It is only possible for <b>in</b> to appear as the first <u>name</u> in the list, else it  will
              be treated as marking the end of the list.

       <b>for</b> <b>((</b> [<u>expr1</u>] <b>;</b> [<u>expr2</u>] <b>;</b> [<u>expr3</u>] <b>))</b> <b>do</b> <u>list</u> <b>done</b>
              The  arithmetic expression <u>expr1</u> is evaluated first (see the section `Arithmetic Evaluation').
              The arithmetic expression <u>expr2</u> is repeatedly evaluated until it evaluates to  zero  and  when
              non-zero,  <u>list</u>  is executed and the arithmetic expression <u>expr3</u> evaluated.  If any expression
              is omitted, then it behaves as if it evaluated to 1.

       <b>while</b> <u>list</u> <b>do</b> <u>list</u> <b>done</b>
              Execute the <b>do</b> <u>list</u> as long as the <b>while</b> <u>list</u> returns a zero exit status.

       <b>until</b> <u>list</u> <b>do</b> <u>list</u> <b>done</b>
              Execute the <b>do</b> <u>list</u> as long as <b>until</b> <u>list</u> returns a nonzero exit status.

       <b>repeat</b> <u>word</u> <b>do</b> <u>list</u> <b>done</b>
              <u>word</u> is expanded and treated as an arithmetic expression, which must evaluate to a  number  <u>n</u>.
              <u>list</u> is then executed <u>n</u> times.

       <b>case</b> <u>word</u> <b>in</b> [ [<b>(</b>] <u>pattern</u> [ <b>|</b> <u>pattern</u> ] ... <b>)</b> <u>list</u> (<b>;;</b>|<b>;&amp;</b>|<b>;|</b>) ] ... <b>esac</b>
              Execute the <u>list</u> associated with the first <u>pattern</u> that matches <u>word</u>, if any.  The form of the
              patterns is the same as that used for filename generation.  See the section `Filename  Genera-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion'.&nbsp;Generation'.</font>
              tion'.

              If  the <u>list</u> that is executed is terminated with <b>;&amp;</b> rather than <b>;;</b>, the following list is also
              executed.  The rule for the terminator of the following list <b>;;</b>, <b>;&amp;</b> or <b>;|</b>  is  applied  unless
              the <b>esac</b> is reached.

              If  the  <u>list</u>  that is executed is terminated with <b>;|</b> the shell continues to scan the <u>pattern</u>s
              looking for the next match, executing the corresponding <u>list</u>, and applying the  rule  for  the
              corresponding terminator <b>;;</b>, <b>;&amp;</b> or <b>;|</b>.  Note that <u>word</u> is not re-expanded; all applicable <u>pat</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">terns&nbsp;patterns</font>
              <u>tern</u>s are tested with the same <u>word</u>.

       <b>select</b> <u>name</u> [ <b>in</b> <u>word</u> ... <u>term</u> ] <b>do</b> <u>list</u> <b>done</b>
              where <u>term</u> is one or more newline or <b>;</b> to terminate the <u>word</u>s.  Print the set of  <u>word</u>s,  each
              preceded  by a number.  If the <b>in</b> <u>word</u> is omitted, use the positional parameters.  The <b>PROMPT3</b>
              prompt is printed and a line is read from the line editor if the shell is interactive and that
              is  active,  or else standard input.  If this line consists of the number of one of the listed
              <u>word</u>s, then the parameter <u>name</u> is set to the <u>word</u> corresponding to this number.  If this  line
              is  empty, the selection list is printed again.  Otherwise, the value of the parameter <u>name</u> is
              set to null.  The contents of the line read from standard input  is  saved  in  the  parameter
              <b>REPLY</b>.  <u>list</u> is executed for each selection until a break or end-of-file is encountered.

       <b>(</b> <u>list</u> <b>)</b>
              Execute  <u>list</u>  in a subshell.  Traps set by the <b>trap</b> builtin are reset to their default values
              while executing <u>list</u>.

       <b>{</b> <u>list</u> <b>}</b>
              Execute <u>list</u>.

       <b>{</b> <u>try-list</u> <b>}</b> <b>always</b> <b>{</b> <u>always-list</u> <b>}</b>
              First execute <u>try-list</u>.  Regardless of errors, or <b>break</b>, <b>continue</b>, or <b>return</b> commands  encoun-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tered&nbsp;encountered</font>
              tered  within  <u>try-list</u>, execute <u>always-list</u>.  Execution then continues from the result of the
              execution of <u>try-list</u>; in other words, any error, or <b>break</b>, <b>continue</b>,  or  <b>return</b>  command  is
              treated  in  the  normal  way, as if <u>always-list</u> were not present.  The two chunks of code are
              referred to as the `try block' and the `always block'.

              Optional newlines or semicolons may appear after the <b>always</b>; note, however, that they may  <u>not</u>
              appear between the preceeding closing brace and the <b>always</b>.

              An  `error'  in  this  context is a condition such as a syntax error which causes the shell to
              abort execution of the current function, script, or list.  Syntax errors encountered while the
              shell  is parsing the code do not cause the <u>always-list</u> to be executed.  For example, an erro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">neously&nbsp;erroneously</font>
              neously constructed <b>if</b> block in <b>try-list</b> would cause the shell to  abort  during  parsing,  so
              that <b>always-list</b> would not be executed, while an erroneous substitution such as <b>${*foo*}</b> would
              cause a run-time error, after which <b>always-list</b> would be executed.

              An error condition can be tested and reset with the special integer variable  <b>TRY_BLOCK_ERROR</b>.
              Outside  an  <b>always-list</b>  the  value  is  irrelevant,  but  it  is  initialised to <b>-1</b>.  Inside
              <b>always-list</b>, the value is 1 if an error occurred in the <b>try-list</b>, else 0.  If  <b>TRY_BLOCK_ERROR</b>
              is  set  to 0 during the <b>always-list</b>, the error condition caused by the <b>try-list</b> is reset, and
              shell execution continues normally after the end of <b>always-list</b>.  Altering  the  value  during
              the <b>try-list</b> is not useful (unless this forms part of an enclosing <b>always</b> block).

              Regardless  of <b>TRY_BLOCK_ERROR</b>, after the end of <b>always-list</b> the normal shell status <b>$?</b> is the
              value returned from <b>always-list</b>.  This will be  non-zero  if  there  was  an  error,  even  if
              <b>TRY_BLOCK_ERROR</b> was set to zero.

              The  following executes the given code, ignoring any errors it causes.  This is an alternative
              to the usual convention of protecting code by executing it in a subshell.

                     <b>{</b>
                         <b>#</b> <b>code</b> <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>cause</b> <b>an</b> <b>error</b>
                       <b>}</b> <b>always</b> <b>{</b>
                         <b>#</b> <b>This</b> <b>code</b> <b>is</b> <b>executed</b> <b>regardless</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>error.</b>
                         <b>((</b> <b>TRY_BLOCK_ERROR</b> <b>=</b> <b>0</b> <b>))</b>
                     <b>}</b>
                     <b>#</b> <b>The</b> <b>error</b> <b>condition</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reset.</b>

              An <b>exit</b> command (or a <b>return</b> command executed at the outermost function  level  of  a  script)
              encountered in <b>try-list</b> does <u>not</u> cause the execution of <u>always-list</u>.  Instead, the shell exits
              immediately after any <b>EXIT</b> trap has been executed.

       <b>function</b> <u>word</u> ... [ <b>()</b> ] [ <u>term</u> ] <b>{</b> <u>list</u> <b>}</b>
       <u>word</u> ... <b>()</b> [ <u>term</u> ] <b>{</b> <u>list</u> <b>}</b>
       <u>word</u> ... <b>()</b> [ <u>term</u> ] <u>command</u>
              where <u>term</u> is one or more newline or <b>;</b>.  Define a function which is referenced by any  one  of
              <u>word</u>.  Normally, only one <u>word</u> is provided; multiple <u>word</u>s are usually only useful for setting
              traps.  The body of the function is the <u>list</u> between the <b>{</b> and  <b>}</b>.   See  the  section  `Func-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tions'.&nbsp;`Functions'.</font>
              tions'.

              If  the  option <b>SH_GLOB</b> is set for compatibility with other shells, then whitespace may appear
              between between the left and right parentheses when there is a single  <u>word</u>;   otherwise,  the
              parentheses will be treated as forming a globbing pattern in that case.

       <b>time</b> [ <u>pipeline</u> ]
              The <u>pipeline</u> is executed, and timing statistics are reported on the standard error in the form
              specified by the <b>TIMEFMT</b> parameter.  If <u>pipeline</u> is omitted, print statistics about the  shell
              process and its children.

       <b>[[</b> <u>exp</u> <b>]]</b>
              Evaluates the conditional expression <u>exp</u> and return a zero exit status if it is true.  See the
              section `Conditional Expressions' for a description of <u>exp</u>.

<b>ALTERNATE</b> <b>FORMS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>COMPLEX</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       Many of zsh's complex commands have alternate forms.  These particular versions of  complex  commands
       should  be considered deprecated and may be removed in the future.  The versions in the previous sec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;section</font>
       tion should be preferred instead.

       The short versions below only work if <u>sublist</u> is of the form `<b>{</b> <u>list</u> <b>}</b>' or if the <b>SHORT_LOOPS</b>  option
       is  set.   For  the  <b>if</b>, <b>while</b> and <b>until</b> commands, in both these cases the test part of the loop must
       also be suitably delimited, such as by `<b>[[</b> <b>...</b> <b>]]</b>' or `<b>((</b> <b>...</b> <b>))</b>', else the end of the test will  not
       be  recognized.  For the <b>for</b>, <b>repeat</b>, <b>case</b> and <b>select</b> commands no such special form for the arguments
       is necessary, but the other condition (the special form of <u>sublist</u> or use of the <b>SHORT_LOOPS</b>  option)
       still applies.

       <b>if</b> <u>list</u> <b>{</b> <u>list</u> <b>}</b> [ <b>elif</b> <u>list</u> <b>{</b> <u>list</u> <b>}</b> ] ... [ <b>else</b> <b>{</b> <u>list</u> <b>}</b> ]
              An alternate form of <b>if</b>.  The rules mean that

                     <b>if</b> <b>[[</b> <b>-o</b> <b>ignorebraces</b> <b>]]</b> <b>{</b>
                       <b>print</b> <b>yes</b>
                     <b>}</b>

              works, but

                     <b>if</b> <b>true</b> <b>{</b>  <b>#</b> <b>Does</b> <b>not</b> <b>work!</b>
                       <b>print</b> <b>yes</b>
                     <b>}</b>

              does <u>not</u>, since the test is not suitably delimited.

       <b>if</b> <u>list</u> <u>sublist</u>
              A short form of the alternate `if'.  The same limitations on the form of <u>list</u> apply as for the
              previous form.

       <b>for</b> <u>name</u> ... <b>(</b> <u>word</u> ... <b>)</b> <u>sublist</u>
              A short form of <b>for</b>.

       <b>for</b> <u>name</u> ... [ <b>in</b> <u>word</u> ... ] <u>term</u> <u>sublist</u>
              where <u>term</u> is at least one newline or <b>;</b>.  Another short form of <b>for</b>.

       <b>for</b> <b>((</b> [<u>expr1</u>] <b>;</b> [<u>expr2</u>] <b>;</b> [<u>expr3</u>] <b>))</b> <u>sublist</u>
              A short form of the arithmetic <b>for</b> command.

       <b>foreach</b> <u>name</u> ... <b>(</b> <u>word</u> ... <b>)</b> <u>list</u> <b>end</b>
              Another form of <b>for</b>.

       <b>while</b> <u>list</u> <b>{</b> <u>list</u> <b>}</b>
              An alternative form of <b>while</b>.  Note the limitations on the form of <u>list</u> mentioned above.

       <b>until</b> <u>list</u> <b>{</b> <u>list</u> <b>}</b>
              An alternative form of <b>until</b>.  Note the limitations on the form of <u>list</u> mentioned above.

       <b>repeat</b> <u>word</u> <u>sublist</u>
              This is a short form of <b>repeat</b>.

       <b>case</b> <u>word</u> <b>{</b> [ [<b>(</b>] <u>pattern</u> [ <b>|</b> <u>pattern</u> ] ... <b>)</b> <u>list</u> (<b>;;</b>|<b>;&amp;</b>|<b>;|</b>) ] ... <b>}</b>
              An alternative form of <b>case</b>.

       <b>select</b> <u>name</u> [ <b>in</b> <u>word</u> <u>term</u> ] <u>sublist</u>
              where <u>term</u> is at least one newline or <b>;</b>.  A short form of <b>select</b>.

<b>RESERVED</b> <b>WORDS</b>
       The following words are recognized as reserved words when used as the first word of a command  unless
       quoted or disabled using <b>disable</b> <b>-r</b>:

       <b>do</b>  <b>done</b>  <b>esac</b> <b>then</b> <b>elif</b> <b>else</b> <b>fi</b> <b>for</b> <b>case</b> <b>if</b> <b>while</b> <b>function</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>time</b> <b>until</b> <b>select</b> <b>coproc</b> <b>nocorrect</b>
       <b>foreach</b> <b>end</b> <b>!</b> <b>[[</b> <b>{</b> <b>}</b>

       Additionally, `<b>}</b>' is recognized in any position if the <b>IGNORE_BRACES</b> option is not set.

<b>COMMENTS</b>
       In noninteractive shells, or in interactive shells with the <b>INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS</b> option set,  a  word
       beginning  with  the third character of the <b>histchars</b> parameter (`<b>#</b>' by default) causes that word and
       all the following characters up to a newline to be ignored.

<b>ALIASING</b>
       Every token in the shell input is checked to see if there is an alias defined for it.  If so,  it  is
       replaced  by  the  text of the alias if it is in command position (if it could be the first word of a
       simple command), or if the alias is global.  If the text ends with a space,  the  next  word  in  the
       shell  input  is  treated  as though it were in command position for purposes of alias expansion.  An
       alias is defined using the <b>alias</b> builtin; global aliases may be defined using the <b>-g</b> option  to  that
       builtin.

       Alias  expansion  is  done  on  the  shell input before any other expansion except history expansion.
       Therefore, if an alias is defined for the word <b>foo</b>, alias expansion may be avoided by quoting part of
       the word, e.g. <b>\foo</b>.  But there is nothing to prevent an alias being defined for <b>\foo</b> as well.

<b>QUOTING</b>
       A  character  may be <u>quoted</u> (that is, made to stand for itself) by preceding it with a `<b>\</b>'.  `<b>\</b>' fol-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lowed&nbsp;followed</font>
       lowed by a newline is ignored.

       A string enclosed between `<b>$'</b>' and `<b>'</b>' is processed the same way as the string arguments of the <b>print</b>
       builtin,  and  the resulting string is considered to be entirely quoted.  A literal `<b>'</b>' character can
       be included in the string by using the `<b>\'</b>' escape.

       All characters enclosed between a pair of single quotes (<b>''</b>) that  is  not  preceded  by  a  `<b>$</b>'  are
       quoted.   A  single  quote  cannot appear within single quotes unless the option <b>RC_QUOTES</b> is set, in
       which case a pair of single quotes are turned into a single quote.  For example,

              <b>print</b> <b>''''</b>

       outputs nothing apart from a newline if <b>RC_QUOTES</b> is not set, but one single quote if it is set.

       Inside double quotes (<b>""</b>), parameter and command substitution occur, and `<b>\</b>'  quotes  the  characters
       `<b>\</b>', `<b>`</b>', `<b>"</b>', and `<b>$</b>'.

<b>REDIRECTION</b>
       If  a command is followed by <b>&amp;</b> and job control is not active, then the default standard input for the
       command is the empty file <b>/dev/null</b>.  Otherwise, the environment for the execution of a command  con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tains&nbsp;contains</font>
       tains the file descriptors of the invoking shell as modified by input/output specifications.

       The  following  may  appear  anywhere in a simple command or may precede or follow a complex command.
       Expansion occurs before <u>word</u> or <u>digit</u> is used except as noted below.  If the result  of  substitution
       on <u>word</u> produces more than one filename, redirection occurs for each separate filename in turn.

       <b>&lt;</b> <u>word</u> Open file <u>word</u> for reading as standard input.

       <b>&lt;&gt;</b> <u>word</u>
              Open  file <u>word</u> for reading and writing as standard input.  If the file does not exist then it
              is created.

       <b>&gt;</b> <u>word</u> Open file <u>word</u> for writing as standard output.  If the file does not exist then it is created.
              If  the  file  exists, and the <b>CLOBBER</b> option is unset, this causes an error; otherwise, it is
              truncated to zero length.

       <b>&gt;|</b> <u>word</u>
       <b>&gt;!</b> <u>word</u>
              Same as <b>&gt;</b>, except that the file is truncated to zero length if it exists, even if  <b>CLOBBER</b>  is
              unset.

       <b>&gt;&gt;</b> <u>word</u>
              Open file <u>word</u> for writing in append mode as standard output.  If the file does not exist, and
              the <b>CLOBBER</b> option is unset, this causes an error; otherwise, the file is created.

       <b>&gt;&gt;|</b> <u>word</u>
       <b>&gt;&gt;!</b> <u>word</u>
              Same as <b>&gt;&gt;</b>, except that the file is created if it does not exist, even if <b>CLOBBER</b> is unset.

       <b>&lt;&lt;</b>[<b>-</b>] <u>word</u>
              The shell input is read up to a line that is the same as  <u>word</u>,  or  to  an  end-of-file.   No
              parameter  expansion,  command  substitution or filename generation is performed on <u>word</u>.  The
              resulting document, called a <u>here-document</u>, becomes the standard input.

              If any character of <u>word</u> is quoted with single or double quotes or a `<b>\</b>', no interpretation is
              placed  upon  the  characters  of the document.  Otherwise, parameter and command substitution
              occurs, `<b>\</b>' followed by a newline is removed, and `<b>\</b>' must be used  to  quote  the  characters
              `<b>\</b>', `<b>$</b>', `<b>`</b>' and the first character of <u>word</u>.

              Note  that <u>word</u> itself does not undergo shell expansion.  Backquotes in <u>word</u> do not have their
              usual effect; instead they behave similarly to double quotes, except that the backquotes them-
              selves  are  passed  through unchanged.  (This information is given for completeness and it is
              not recommended that backquotes be used.)  Quotes in  the  form  <b>$'</b><u>...</u><b>'</b>  have  their  standard
              effect of expanding backslashed references to special characters.

              If <b>&lt;&lt;-</b> is used, then all leading tabs are stripped from <u>word</u> and from the document.

       <b>&lt;&lt;&lt;</b> <u>word</u>
              Perform  shell  expansion  on  <u>word</u> and pass the result to standard input.  This is known as a
              <u>here-string</u>.  Compare the use of <u>word</u> in here-documents above, where  <u>word</u>  does  not  undergo
              shell expansion.

       <b>&lt;&amp;</b> <u>number</u>
       <b>&gt;&amp;</b> <u>number</u>
              The standard input/output is duplicated from file descriptor <u>number</u> (see <a href="../man2/dup2.2.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/2/dup2"><u>dup2</u>(2)</a>).

       <b>&lt;&amp;</b> <b>-</b>
       <b>&gt;&amp;</b> <b>-</b>   Close the standard input/output.

       <b>&lt;&amp;</b> <b>p</b>
       <b>&gt;&amp;</b> <b>p</b>   The input/output from/to the coprocess is moved to the standard input/output.

       <b>&gt;&amp;</b> <u>word</u>
       <b>&amp;&gt;</b> <u>word</u>
              (Except  where  `<b>&gt;&amp;</b>  <u>word</u>' matches one of the above syntaxes; `<b>&amp;&gt;</b>' can always be used to avoid
              this ambiguity.)  Redirects both standard output and standard error (file descriptor 2) in the
              manner  of  `<b>&gt;</b>  <u>word</u>'.   Note  that this does <u>not</u> have the same effect as `<b>&gt;</b> <u>word</u> <b>2&gt;&amp;1</b>' in the
              presence of multios (see the section below).

       <b>&gt;&amp;|</b> <u>word</u>
       <b>&gt;&amp;!</b> <u>word</u>
       <b>&amp;&gt;|</b> <u>word</u>
       <b>&amp;&gt;!</b> <u>word</u>
              Redirects both standard output and standard error (file descriptor 2) in  the  manner  of  `<b>&gt;|</b>
              <u>word</u>'.

       <b>&gt;&gt;&amp;</b> <u>word</u>
       <b>&amp;&gt;&gt;</b> <u>word</u>
              Redirects  both  standard  output  and standard error (file descriptor 2) in the manner of `<b>&gt;&gt;</b>
              <u>word</u>'.

       <b>&gt;&gt;&amp;|</b> <u>word</u>
       <b>&gt;&gt;&amp;!</b> <u>word</u>
       <b>&amp;&gt;&gt;|</b> <u>word</u>
       <b>&amp;&gt;&gt;!</b> <u>word</u>
              Redirects both standard output and standard error (file descriptor 2) in the  manner  of  `<b>&gt;&gt;|</b>
              <u>word</u>'.

       If one of the above is preceded by a digit, then the file descriptor referred to is that specified by
       the digit instead of the default 0 or 1.  The order in which redirections are specified  is  signifi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cant.&nbsp;significant.</font>
       cant.   The  shell  evaluates each redirection in terms of the (<u>file</u> <u>descriptor</u>, <u>file</u>) association at
       the time of evaluation.  For example:

              ... <b>1&gt;</b><u>fname</u> <b>2&gt;&amp;1</b>

       first associates file descriptor 1 with file <u>fname</u>.  It then associates file descriptor  2  with  the
       file associated with file descriptor 1 (that is, <u>fname</u>).  If the order of redirections were reversed,
       file descriptor 2 would be associated with the terminal (assuming file descriptor  1  had  been)  and
       then file descriptor 1 would be associated with file <u>fname</u>.

       If  instead  of  a  digit  one  of  the operators above is preceded by a valid identifier enclosed in
       braces, the shell will open a new file descriptor that is guaranteed to be at least 10  and  set  the
       parameter  named  by  the identifier to the file descriptor opened.  No whitespace is allowed between
       the closing brace and the redirection character.  The option <b>IGNORE_BRACES</b>  must  not  be  set.   For
       example:

              ... {myfd}&gt;&amp;1

       This opens a new file descriptor that is a duplicate of file descriptor 1 and sets the parameter <b>myfd</b>
       to the number of the file descriptor, which will be at least 10.  The  new  file  descriptor  can  be
       written to using the syntax <b>&gt;&amp;$myfd</b>.

       The  syntax  <b>{</b><u>varid</u><b>}&gt;&amp;-</b>, for example <b>{myfd}&gt;&amp;-</b>, may be used to close a file descriptor opened in this
       fashion.  Note that the parameter given by <u>varid</u> must previously be set to a file descriptor in  this
       case.

       It  is  an  error  to open or close a file descriptor in this fashion when the parameter is readonly.
       However, it is not an error to read or write a file descriptor using <b>&lt;&amp;$</b><u>param</u> or <b>&gt;&amp;$</b><u>param</u> if <u>param</u> is
       readonly.

       If  the  option  <b>CLOBBER</b> is unset, it is an error to open a file descriptor using a parameter that is
       already set to an open file descriptor previously allocated by this mechanism.  Unsetting the parame-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ter&nbsp;parameter</font>
       ter before using it for allocating a file descriptor avoids the error.

       Note  that this mechanism merely allocates or closes a file descriptor; it does not perform any redi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rections&nbsp;redirections</font>
       rections from or to it.  It is usually convenient to allocate a file descriptor prior to  use  as  an
       argument  to  <b>exec</b>.  The following shows a typical sequence of allocation, use, and closing of a file
       descriptor:

              <b>integer</b> <b>myfd</b>
              <b>exec</b> <b>{myfd}&gt;~/logs/mylogfile.txt</b>
              <b>print</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>log</b> <b>message.</b> <b>&gt;&amp;$myfd</b>
              <b>exec</b> <b>{myfd}&gt;&amp;</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">Note&nbsp;{myfd}&gt;&amp;Note</font>

       Note that the expansion of the variable in the expression <b>&gt;&amp;$myfd</b> occurs at the point the redirection
       is  opened.   This is after the expansion of command arguments and after any redirections to the left
       on the command line have been processed.

       The `<b>|&amp;</b>' command separator described in <u>Simple</u> <u>Commands</u> <u>&amp;</u> <u>Pipelines</u> in <u>zshmisc</u>(1) is a shorthand  for
       `<b>2&gt;&amp;1</b> <b>|</b>'.

       The  various  forms  of  process substitution, `<b>&lt;(</b><u>list</u><b>)</b>', and `<b>=(</b><u>list</u>())' for input and `<b>&gt;(</b><u>list</u><b>)</b>' for
       output, are often used together with redirection.  For example, if <u>word</u> in an output  redirection  is
       of  the form `<b>&gt;(</b><u>list</u><b>)</b>' then the output is piped to the command represented by <u>list</u>.  See <u>Process</u> <u>Sub</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">stitution&nbsp;Substitution</font>
       <u>stitution</u> in <a href="zshexpn.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/zshexpn"><u>zshexpn</u>(1)</a>.

<b>MULTIOS</b>
       If the user tries to open a file descriptor for writing more than once,  the  shell  opens  the  file
       descriptor as a pipe to a process that copies its input to all the specified outputs, similar to <b>tee</b>,
       provided the <b>MULTIOS</b> option is set, as it is by default.  Thus:

              <b>date</b> <b>&gt;foo</b> <b>&gt;bar</b>

       writes the date to two files, named `<b>foo</b>' and `<b>bar</b>'.  Note that a pipe is  an  implicit  redirection;
       thus

              <b>date</b> <b>&gt;foo</b> <b>|</b> <b>cat</b>

       writes the date to the file `<b>foo</b>', and also pipes it to cat.

       If  the  <b>MULTIOS</b>  option  is set, the word after a redirection operator is also subjected to filename
       generation (globbing).  Thus

              <b>:</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>*</b>

       will truncate all files in the current directory, assuming there's at least one.  (Without  the  <b>MUL</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">TIOS&nbsp;MULTIOS</font>
       <b>TIOS</b> option, it would create an empty file called `<b>*</b>'.)  Similarly, you can do

              <b>echo</b> <b>exit</b> <b>0</b> <b>&gt;&gt;</b> <b>*.sh</b>

       If  the  user  tries  to  open a file descriptor for reading more than once, the shell opens the file
       descriptor as a pipe to a process that copies all the specified inputs to its  output  in  the  order
       specified, similar to <b>cat</b>, provided the <b>MULTIOS</b> option is set.  Thus

              <b>sort</b> <b>&lt;foo</b> <b>&lt;fubar</b>

       or even

              <b>sort</b> <b>&lt;f{oo,ubar}</b>

       is equivalent to `<b>cat</b> <b>foo</b> <b>fubar</b> <b>|</b> <b>sort</b>'.

       Expansion  of  the  redirection  argument occurs at the point the redirection is opened, at the point
       described above for the expansion of the variable in <b>&gt;&amp;$myfd</b>.

       Note that a pipe is an implicit redirection; thus

              <b>cat</b> <b>bar</b> <b>|</b> <b>sort</b> <b>&lt;foo</b>

       is equivalent to `<b>cat</b> <b>bar</b> <b>foo</b> <b>|</b> <b>sort</b>' (note the order of the inputs).

       If the <b>MULTIOS</b> option is <u>un</u>set, each redirection replaces the  previous  redirection  for  that  file
       descriptor.  However, all files redirected to are actually opened, so

              <b>echo</b> <b>foo</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>bar</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>baz</b>

       when <b>MULTIOS</b> is unset will truncate bar, and write `<b>foo</b>' into baz.

       There  is a problem when an output multio is attached to an external program.  A simple example shows
       this:

              <b>cat</b> <b>file</b> <b>&gt;file1</b> <b>&gt;file2</b>
              <b>cat</b> <b>file1</b> <b>file2</b>

       Here, it is possible that the second `<b>cat</b>' will not display the full  contents  of  <b>file1</b>  and  <b>file2</b>
       (i.e. the original contents of <b>file</b> repeated twice).

       The  reason  for this is that the multios are spawned after the <b>cat</b> process is forked from the parent
       shell, so the parent shell does not wait for the multios to finish writing data.  This means the com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
       mand  as shown can exit before <b>file1</b> and <b>file2</b> are completely written.  As a workaround, it is possi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ble&nbsp;possible</font>
       ble to run the <b>cat</b> process as part of a job in the current shell:

              <b>{</b> <b>cat</b> <b>file</b> <b>}</b> <b>&gt;file</b> <b>&gt;file2</b>

       Here, the <b>{</b><u>...</u><b>}</b> job will pause to wait for both files to be written.


<b>REDIRECTIONS</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>NO</b> <b>COMMAND</b>
       When a simple command consists of one or more  redirection  operators  and  zero  or  more  parameter
       assignments, but no command name, zsh can behave in several ways.

       If  the  parameter  <b>NULLCMD</b> is not set or the option <b>CSH_NULLCMD</b> is set, an error is caused.  This is
       the <b>csh</b> behavior and <b>CSH_NULLCMD</b> is set by default when emulating <b>csh</b>.

       If the option <b>SH_NULLCMD</b> is set, the builtin `<b>:</b>' is inserted as a command  with  the  given  redirec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tions.&nbsp;redirections.</font>
       tions.  This is the default when emulating <b>sh</b> or <b>ksh</b>.

       Otherwise,  if the parameter <b>NULLCMD</b> is set, its value will be used as a command with the given redi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rections.&nbsp;redirections.</font>
       rections.  If both <b>NULLCMD</b> and <b>READNULLCMD</b> are set, then the value of the latter will be used instead
       of  that  of  the  former when the redirection is an input.  The default for <b>NULLCMD</b> is `<b>cat</b>' and for
       <b>READNULLCMD</b> is `<b>more</b>'. Thus

              <b>&lt;</b> <b>file</b>

       shows the contents of <b>file</b> on standard output, with paging if that is a terminal.  <b>NULLCMD</b> and  <b>READ-</b>
       <b>NULLCMD</b> may refer to shell functions.


<b>COMMAND</b> <b>EXECUTION</b>
       If  a  command  name  contains  no slashes, the shell attempts to locate it.  If there exists a shell
       function by that name, the function is invoked as described in the  section  `Functions'.   If  there
       exists a shell builtin by that name, the builtin is invoked.

       Otherwise,  the shell searches each element of <b>$path</b> for a directory containing an executable file by
       that name.  If the search is unsuccessful, the shell prints an error message and  returns  a  nonzero
       exit status.

       If  execution fails because the file is not in executable format, and the file is not a directory, it
       is assumed to be a shell script.  <b>/bin/sh</b> is spawned to execute it.  If the program is a file  begin-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ning&nbsp;beginning</font>
       ning  with `<b>#!</b>', the remainder of the first line specifies an interpreter for the program.  The shell
       will execute the specified interpreter on operating systems that do not handle this executable format
       in the kernel.

<b>FUNCTIONS</b>
       Shell  functions  are  defined  with  the <b>function</b> reserved word or the special syntax `<u>funcname</u> <b>()</b>'.
       Shell functions are read in and stored internally.  Alias names are resolved  when  the  function  is
       read.  Functions are executed like commands with the arguments passed as positional parameters.  (See
       the section `Command Execution'.)

       Functions execute in the same process as the caller and share all files and present working directory
       with  the  caller.   A trap on <b>EXIT</b> set inside a function is executed after the function completes in
       the environment of the caller.

       The <b>return</b> builtin is used to return from function calls.

       Function identifiers can be listed with the <b>functions</b> builtin.  Functions can be undefined  with  the
       <b>unfunction</b> builtin.

<b>AUTOLOADING</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b>
       A  function  can  be  marked  as  <u>undefined</u> using the <b>autoload</b> builtin (or `<b>functions</b> <b>-u</b>' or `<b>typeset</b>
       <b>-fu</b>').  Such a function has no body.  When the function is first executed, the shell searches for its
       definition  using  the  elements  of the <b>fpath</b> variable.  Thus to define functions for autoloading, a
       typical sequence is:

              <b>fpath=(~/myfuncs</b> <b>$fpath)</b>
              <b>autoload</b> <b>myfunc1</b> <b>myfunc2</b> <b>...</b>

       The usual alias expansion during reading will be suppressed if the <b>autoload</b> builtin or its equivalent
       is  given the option <b>-U</b>. This is recommended for the use of functions supplied with the zsh distribu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion.&nbsp;distribution.</font>
       tion.  Note that for functions precompiled with the <b>zcompile</b> builtin command the flag <b>-U</b> must be pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">vided&nbsp;provided</font>
       vided when the <b>.zwc</b> file is created, as the corresponding information is compiled into the latter.

       For  each  <u>element</u> in <b>fpath</b>, the shell looks for three possible files, the newest of which is used to
       load the definition for the function:

       <u>element</u><b>.zwc</b>
              A file created with the <b>zcompile</b> builtin command, which is expected to contain the definitions
              for all functions in the directory named <u>element</u>.  The file is treated in the same manner as a
              directory containing files for functions and is searched for the definition of  the  function.
              If the definition is not found, the search for a definition proceeds with the other two possi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">bilities&nbsp;possibilities</font>
              bilities described below.

              If <u>element</u> already includes a <b>.zwc</b> extension (i.e. the extension was explicitly given  by  the
              user),  <u>element</u>  is  searched  for the definition of the function without comparing its age to
              that of other files; in fact, there does not need to be any directory  named  <u>element</u>  without
              the  suffix.   Thus including an element such as `<b>/usr/local/funcs.zwc</b>' in <b>fpath</b> will speed up
              the search for functions, with the disadvantage that functions  included  must  be  explicitly
              recompiled by hand before the shell notices any changes.

       <u>element</u><b>/</b><u>function</u><b>.zwc</b>
              A  file  created  with <b>zcompile</b>, which is expected to contain the definition for <u>function</u>.  It
              may include other function definitions as well, but those are neither loaded nor  executed;  a
              file found in this way is searched <u>only</u> for the definition of <u>function</u>.

       <u>element</u><b>/</b><u>function</u>
              A file of zsh command text, taken to be the definition for <u>function</u>.

       In summary, the order of searching is, first, in the <u>parents</u> <u>of</u> directories in <b>fpath</b> for the newer of
       either a compiled directory or a directory in <b>fpath</b>; second, if more than one  of  these  contains  a
       definition  for the function that is sought, the leftmost in the <b>fpath</b> is chosen; and third, within a
       directory, the newer of either a compiled function or an ordinary function definition is used.

       If the <b>KSH_AUTOLOAD</b> option is set, or the file contains only a simple definition of the function, the
       file's  contents  will be executed.  This will normally define the function in question, but may also
       perform initialization, which is executed in the context of the function execution, and may therefore
       define local parameters.  It is an error if the function is not defined by loading the file.

       Otherwise,  the  function  body  (with no surrounding `<u>funcname</u><b>()</b> <b>{</b><u>...</u><b>}</b>') is taken to be the complete
       contents of the file.  This form allows the file to be used directly as an executable  shell  script.
       If  processing  of  the  file  results  in  the function being re-defined, the function itself is not
       re-executed.  To force the shell to perform initialization and then call the  function  defined,  the
       file should contain initialization code (which will be executed then discarded) in addition to a com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">plete&nbsp;complete</font>
       plete function definition (which will be retained for subsequent calls to the function), and  a  call
       to the shell function, including any arguments, at the end.

       For example, suppose the autoload file <b>func</b> contains

              <b>func()</b> <b>{</b> <b>print</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>func;</b> <b>}</b>
              <b>print</b> <b>func</b> <b>is</b> <b>initialized</b>

       then  `<b>func;</b>  <b>func</b>'  with <b>KSH_AUTOLOAD</b> set will produce both messages on the first call, but only the
       message `<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>func</b>' on the second and subsequent calls.  Without <b>KSH_AUTOLOAD</b> set, it will produce
       the  initialization  message  on  the  first call, and the other message on the second and subsequent
       calls.

       It is also possible to create a function that is not marked as autoloaded, but which  loads  its  own
       definition by searching <b>fpath</b>, by using `<b>autoload</b> <b>-X</b>' within a shell function.  For example, the fol-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lowing&nbsp;following</font>
       lowing are equivalent:

              <b>myfunc()</b> <b>{</b>
                <b>autoload</b> <b>-X</b>
              <b>}</b>
              <b>myfunc</b> <b>args...</b>

       and

              <b>unfunction</b> <b>myfunc</b>   <b>#</b> <b>if</b> <b>myfunc</b> <b>was</b> <b>defined</b>
              <b>autoload</b> <b>myfunc</b>
              <b>myfunc</b> <b>args...</b>

       In fact, the <b>functions</b> command outputs `<b>builtin</b> <b>autoload</b> <b>-X</b>' as the body of an  autoloaded  function.
       This is done so that

              <b>eval</b> <b>"$(functions)"</b>

       produces  a  reasonable  result.  A true autoloaded function can be identified by the presence of the
       comment `<b>#</b> <b>undefined</b>' in the body, because all comments are discarded from defined functions.

       To load the definition of an autoloaded function <b>myfunc</b> without executing <b>myfunc</b>, use:

              <b>autoload</b> <b>+X</b> <b>myfunc</b>


<b>SPECIAL</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b>
       Certain functions, if defined, have special meaning to the shell.

       In the case of <b>chpwd</b>, <b>periodic</b>, <b>precmd</b> and <b>preexec</b> it is possible to define an  array  that  has  the
       same  name  with `<b>_functions</b>' appended.  Any element in such an array is taken as the name of a func-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;function</font>
       tion to execute; it is executed in the same context and with the same arguments as  the  basic  func-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion.&nbsp;function.</font>
       tion.    For   example,   if   <b>$chpwd_functions</b>   is   an  array  containing  the  values  `<b>mychpwd</b>',
       `<b>chpwd_save_dirstack</b>', then the shell attempts  to  execute  the  functions  `<b>chpwd</b>',  `<b>mychpwd</b>'  and
       `<b>chpwd_save_dirstack</b>', in that order.  Any function that does not exist is silently ignored.  A func-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;function</font>
       tion found by this mechanism is referred to elsewhere as a `hook function'.  An error in any function
       causes  subsequent  functions  not  to be run.  Note further that an error in a <b>precmd</b> hook causes an
       immediately following <b>periodic</b> function not to run (thought it may run at the next opportunity).

       <b>chpwd</b>  Executed whenever the current working directory is changed.

       <b>periodic</b>
              If the parameter <b>PERIOD</b> is set, this function is executed every <b>$PERIOD</b> seconds, just before a
              prompt.   Note  that if multiple functions are defined using the array <b>periodic_functions</b> only
              one period is applied to the complete set of functions, and the scheduled time is not reset if
              the list of functions is altered.  Hence the set of functions is always called together.

       <b>precmd</b> Executed before each prompt.

       <b>preexec</b>
              Executed just after a command has been read and is about to be executed.  If the history mech-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">anism&nbsp;mechanism</font>
              anism is active (and the line was not discarded from the history buffer), the string that  the
              user  typed is passed as the first argument, otherwise it is an empty string.  The actual com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
              mand that will be executed (including expanded aliases) is passed in two different forms:  the
              second  argument is a single-line, size-limited version of the command (with things like func-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;function</font>
              tion bodies elided); the third argument contains the full text that is being executed.

       <b>zshexit</b>
              Executed at the point where the main shell is about to exit normally.  This is not  called  by
              exiting  subshells,  nor when the <b>exec</b> precommand modifier is used before an external command.
              Also, unlike <b>TRAPEXIT</b>, it is not called when functions exit.

       <b>TRAP</b><u>NAL</u>
              If defined and non-null, this function will be executed whenever the shell  catches  a  signal
              <b>SIG</b><u>NAL</u>,  where <u>NAL</u> is a signal name as specified for the <b>kill</b> builtin.  The signal number will
              be passed as the first parameter to the function.

              If a function of this form is defined and null, the shell and processes  spawned  by  it  will
              ignore <b>SIG</b><u>NAL</u>.

              The  return  status  from  the  function  is  handled specially.  If it is zero, the signal is
              assumed to have been handled, and execution continues normally.   Otherwise,  the  shell  will
              behave as interrupted except that the return status of the trap is retained.

              Programs  terminated  by uncaught signals typically return the status 128 plus the signal num-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ber.&nbsp;number.</font>
              ber.  Hence the following causes the handler for <b>SIGINT</b> to print a  message,  then  mimic  the
              usual effect of the signal.

                     <b>TRAPINT()</b> <b>{</b>
                       <b>print</b> <b>"Caught</b> <b>SIGINT,</b> <b>aborting."</b>
                       <b>return</b> <b>$((</b> <b>128</b> <b>+</b> <b>$1</b> <b>))</b>
                     <b>}</b>

              The functions <b>TRAPZERR</b>, <b>TRAPDEBUG</b> and <b>TRAPEXIT</b> are never executed inside other traps.

       <b>TRAPDEBUG</b>
              Executed after each command.

       <b>TRAPEXIT</b>
              Executed  when  the  shell exits, or when the current function exits if defined inside a func-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion.&nbsp;function.</font>
              tion.  The value of <b>$?</b> at the start of execution is the exit status of the shell or the return
              status of the function exiting.

       <b>TRAPZERR</b>
              Executed whenever a command has a non-zero exit status.  However, the function is not executed
              if the command occurred in a sublist followed by `<b>&amp;&amp;</b>' or `<b>||</b>'; only the  final  command  in  a
              sublist  of  this  type causes the trap to be executed.  The function <b>TRAPERR</b> acts the same as
              <b>TRAPZERR</b> on systems where there is no <b>SIGERR</b> (this is the usual case).

       The functions beginning `<b>TRAP</b>' may alternatively be defined with  the  <b>trap</b>  builtin:   this  may  be
       preferable for some uses, as they are then run in the environment of the calling process, rather than
       in their own function environment.  Apart from the difference in calling procedure and the fact  that
       the function form appears in lists of functions, the forms

              <b>TRAPNAL()</b> <b>{</b>
               <b>#</b> <b>code</b>
              <b>}</b>

       and

              <b>trap</b> <b>'</b>
               <b>#</b> <b>code</b>
              <b>'</b> <b>NAL</b>

       are equivalent.

<b>JOBS</b>
       If  the  <b>MONITOR</b> option is set, an interactive shell associates a <u>job</u> with each pipeline.  It keeps a
       table of current jobs, printed by the <b>jobs</b> command, and assigns them small integer numbers.   When  a
       job is started asynchronously with `<b>&amp;</b>', the shell prints a line to standard error which looks like:

              <b>[1]</b> <b>1234</b>

       indicating  that  the  job  which was started asynchronously was job number 1 and had one (top-level)
       process, whose process ID was 1234.

       If a job is started with `<b>&amp;|</b>' or `<b>&amp;!</b>', then that job is immediately disowned.  After startup, it does
       not have a place in the job table, and is not subject to the job control features described here.

       If you are running a job and wish to do something else you may hit the key ^Z (control-Z) which sends
       a <b>TSTP</b> signal to the current job:  this key may be redefined by the <b>susp</b> option of the external  <b>stty</b>
       command.   The shell will then normally indicate that the job has been `suspended', and print another
       prompt.  You can then manipulate the state of this job, putting it in the background with the <b>bg</b> com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand,&nbsp;command,</font>
       mand,  or run some other commands and then eventually bring the job back into the foreground with the
       foreground command <b>fg</b>.  A ^Z takes effect immediately and is like an interrupt in that pending output
       and unread input are discarded when it is typed.

       A  job  being  run  in the background will suspend if it tries to read from the terminal.  Background
       jobs are normally allowed to produce output, but this can be disabled by  giving  the  command  `<b>stty</b>
       <b>tostop</b>'.  If you set this tty option, then background jobs will suspend when they try to produce out-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">put&nbsp;output</font>
       put like they do when they try to read input.

       When a command is suspended and continued later with the <b>fg</b> or <b>wait</b> builtins, zsh restores tty  modes
       that  were  in  effect  when it was suspended.  This (intentionally) does not apply if the command is
       continued via `<b>kill</b> <b>-CONT</b>', nor when it is continued with <b>bg</b>.

       There are several ways to refer to jobs in the shell.  A job can be referred to by the process ID  of
       any process of the job or by one of the following:

       <b>%</b><u>number</u>
              The job with the given number.
       <b>%</b><u>string</u>
              Any job whose command line begins with <u>string</u>.
       <b>%?</b><u>string</u>
              Any job whose command line contains <u>string</u>.
       <b>%%</b>     Current job.
       <b>%+</b>     Equivalent to `<b>%%</b>'.
       <b>%-</b>     Previous job.

       The  shell  learns  immediately whenever a process changes state.  It normally informs you whenever a
       job becomes blocked so that no further progress is possible.  If the <b>NOTIFY</b> option  is  not  set,  it
       waits  until  just  before it prints a prompt before it informs you.  All such notifications are sent
       directly to the terminal, not to the standard output or standard error.

       When the monitor mode is on, each background job that completes triggers any trap set for <b>CHLD</b>.

       When you try to leave the shell while jobs are running or suspended, you will  be  warned  that  `You
       have  suspended  (running) jobs'.  You may use the <b>jobs</b> command to see what they are.  If you do this
       or immediately try to exit again, the shell will not warn you a second time; the suspended jobs  will
       be terminated, and the running jobs will be sent a <b>SIGHUP</b> signal, if the <b>HUP</b> option is set.

       To  avoid having the shell terminate the running jobs, either use the <b>nohup</b> command (see <a href="nohup.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/nohup"><u>nohup</u>(1)</a>) or
       the <b>disown</b> builtin.

<b>SIGNALS</b>
       The <b>INT</b> and <b>QUIT</b> signals for an invoked command are ignored if the command is followed by `<b>&amp;</b>' and the
       <b>MONITOR</b>  option  is not active.  The shell itself always ignores the <b>QUIT</b> signal.  Otherwise, signals
       have the values inherited by the shell from its parent (but see the <b>TRAP</b><u>NAL</u> special functions in  the
       section `Functions').

<b>ARITHMETIC</b> <b>EVALUATION</b>
       The  shell  can perform integer and floating point arithmetic, either using the builtin <b>let</b>, or via a
       substitution of the form <b>$((...))</b>.  For integers, the shell is usually compiled to use 8-byte  preci-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion&nbsp;precision</font>
       sion  where  this  is available, otherwise precision is 4 bytes.  This can be tested, for example, by
       giving the command `<b>print</b> <b>-</b> <b>$((</b> <b>12345678901</b> <b>))</b>'; if the number appears unchanged, the precision is at
       least 8 bytes.  Floating point arithmetic is always double precision.

       The  <b>let</b>  builtin  command  takes  arithmetic expressions as arguments; each is evaluated separately.
       Since many of the arithmetic operators, as well as spaces, require quoting, an  alternative  form  is
       provided:  for  any  command  which  begins with a `<b>((</b>', all the characters until a matching `<b>))</b>' are
       treated as a quoted expression and arithmetic expansion performed as for an argument  of  <b>let</b>.   More
       precisely, `<b>((</b><u>...</u><b>))</b>' is equivalent to `<b>let</b> <b>"</b><u>...</u><b>"</b>'.  The return status is 0 if the arithmetic value of
       the expression is non-zero, and 1 otherwise.

       For example, the following statement

              <b>((</b> <b>val</b> <b>=</b> <b>2</b> <b>+</b> <b>1</b> <b>))</b>

       is equivalent to

              <b>let</b> <b>"val</b> <b>=</b> <b>2</b> <b>+</b> <b>1"</b>

       both assigning the value 3 to the shell variable <b>val</b> and returning a zero status.

       Integers can be in bases other than 10.  A leading `<b>0x</b>' or `<b>0X</b>' denotes  hexadecimal.   Integers  may
       also  be of the form `<u>base</u><b>#</b><u>n</u>', where <u>base</u> is a decimal number between two and thirty-six representing
       the arithmetic base and <u>n</u> is a number in that base (for example, `<b>16#ff</b>' is 255 in hexadecimal).  The
       <u>base</u><b>#</b>  may  also  be  omitted,  in  which case base 10 is used.  For backwards compatibility the form
       `<b>[</b><u>base</u><b>]</b><u>n</u>' is also accepted.

       It is also possible to specify a base to be used for  output  in  the  form  `<b>[#</b><u>base</u><b>]</b>',  for  example
       `<b>[#16]</b>'.  This is used when outputting arithmetical substitutions or when assigning to scalar parame-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ters,&nbsp;parameters,</font>
       ters, but an explicitly defined integer or floating point parameter will  not  be  affected.   If  an
       integer  variable  is  implicitly defined by an arithmetic expression, any base specified in this way
       will be set as the variable's output arithmetic base as if  the  option  `<b>-i</b>  <u>base</u>'  to  the  <b>typeset</b>
       builtin  had been used.  The expression has no precedence and if it occurs more than once in a mathe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">matical&nbsp;mathematical</font>
       matical expression, the last encountered is used.  For clarity it is recommended that  it  appear  at
       the beginning of an expression.  As an example:

              <b>typeset</b> <b>-i</b> <b>16</b> <b>y</b>
              <b>print</b> <b>$((</b> <b>[#8]</b> <b>x</b> <b>=</b> <b>32,</b> <b>y</b> <b>=</b> <b>32</b> <b>))</b>
              <b>print</b> <b>$x</b> <b>$y</b>

       outputs  first `<b>8#40</b>', the rightmost value in the given output base, and then `<b>8#40</b> <b>16#20</b>', because <b>y</b>
       has been explicitly declared to have output base 16, while <b>x</b> (assuming it does not already exist)  is
       implicitly typed by the arithmetic evaluation, where it acquires the output base 8.

       If  the <b>C_BASES</b> option is set, hexadecimal numbers in the standard C format, for example <b>0xFF</b> instead
       of the usual `<b>16#FF</b>'.  If the option <b>OCTAL_ZEROES</b> is also set (it is not by default),  octal  numbers
       will  be treated similarly and hence appear as `<b>077</b>' instead of `<b>8#77</b>'.  This option has no effect on
       the output of bases other than hexadecimal and octal, and these  formats  are  always  understood  on
       input.

       When  an output base is specified using the `<b>[#</b><u>base</u><b>]</b>' syntax, an appropriate base prefix will be out-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">put&nbsp;output</font>
       put if necessary, so that the value output is valid syntax for input.  If the <b>#</b> is doubled, for exam-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ple&nbsp;example</font>
       ple `<b>[##16]</b>', then no base prefix is output.

       Floating point constants are recognized by the presence of a decimal point or an exponent.  The deci-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mal&nbsp;decimal</font>
       mal point may be the first character of the constant, but the exponent character <b>e</b> or <b>E</b> may  not,  as
       it will be taken for a parameter name.

       An arithmetic expression uses nearly the same syntax, precedence, and associativity of expressions in
       C.  The following operators are supported (listed in decreasing order of precedence):

       <b>+</b> <b>-</b> <b>!</b> <b>~</b> <b>++</b> <b>-</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">unary&nbsp;-unary</font>
              unary plus/minus, logical NOT, complement, {pre,post}{in,de}crement
       <b>&lt;&lt;</b> <b>&gt;&gt;</b>  bitwise shift left, right
       <b>&amp;</b>      bitwise AND
       <b>^</b>      bitwise XOR
       <b>|</b>      bitwise OR
       <b>**</b>     exponentiation

              assignment
       <b>,</b>      comma operator

       The operators `<b>&amp;&amp;</b>', `<b>||</b>', `<b>&amp;&amp;=</b>', and `<b>||=</b>' are short-circuiting, and  only  one  of  the  latter  two
       expressions  in a ternary operator is evaluated.  Note the precedence of the bitwise AND, OR, and XOR
       operators.

       Mathematical functions can be called with the syntax `<u>func</u><b>(</b><u>args</u><b>)</b>', where the function decides if  the
       <u>args</u>  is  used  as  a string or a comma-separated list of arithmetic expressions. The shell currently
       defines no mathematical functions by default, but the module <b>zsh/mathfunc</b>  may  be  loaded  with  the
       <b>zmodload</b> builtin to provide standard floating point mathematical functions.

       An  expression  of  the  form `<b>##</b><u>x</u>' where <u>x</u> is any character sequence such as `<b>a</b>', `<b>^A</b>', or `<b>\M-\C-x</b>'
       gives the value of this character and an expression of the form `<b>#</b><u>foo</u>' gives the value of  the  first
       character  of the contents of the parameter <u>foo</u>.  Character values are according to the character set
       used in the current locale; for multibyte character handling the option <b>MULTIBYTE</b> must be set.   Note
       that this form is different from `<b>$#</b><u>foo</u>', a standard parameter substitution which gives the length of
       the parameter <u>foo</u>.  `<b>#\</b>' is accepted instead of `<b>##</b>', but its use is deprecated.

       Named parameters and subscripted arrays can be referenced by name  within  an  arithmetic  expression
       without using the parameter expansion syntax.  For example,

              <b>((val2</b> <b>=</b> <b>val1</b> <b>*</b> <b>2))</b>

       assigns twice the value of <b>$val1</b> to the parameter named <b>val2</b>.

       An  internal  integer  representation of a named parameter can be specified with the <b>integer</b> builtin.
       Arithmetic evaluation is performed on the value of each assignment  to  a  named  parameter  declared
       integer  in this manner.  Assigning a floating point number to an integer results in rounding down to
       the next integer.

       Likewise, floating point numbers can be declared with the <b>float</b> builtin; there are two types, differ-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;differing</font>
       ing  only  in  their  output  format, as described for the <b>typeset</b> builtin.  The output format can be
       bypassed by using arithmetic substitution instead of the parameter substitution, i.e. `<b>${</b><u>float</u><b>}</b>' uses
       the defined format, but `<b>$((</b><u>float</u><b>))</b>' uses a generic floating point format.

       Promotion  of  integer  to  floating  point values is performed where necessary.  In addition, if any
       operator which requires an integer (`<b>~</b>', `<b>&amp;</b>', `<b>|</b>', `<b>^</b>', `<b>%</b>', `<b>&lt;&lt;</b>', `<b>&gt;&gt;</b>' and  their  equivalents  with
       assignment) is given a floating point argument, it will be silently rounded down to the next integer.

       Scalar variables can hold integer or floating point values at different times; there is no memory  of
       the numeric type in this case.

       If  a  variable  is first assigned in a numeric context without previously being declared, it will be
       implicitly typed as <b>integer</b> or <b>float</b> and retain that type either until the type is explicitly changed
       or until the end of the scope.  This can have unforeseen consequences.  For example, in the loop

              <b>for</b> <b>((</b> <b>f</b> <b>=</b> <b>0;</b> <b>f</b> <b>&lt;</b> <b>1;</b> <b>f</b> <b>+=</b> <b>0.1</b> <b>));</b> <b>do</b>
              <b>#</b> <b>use</b> <b>$f</b>
              <b>done</b>

       if  <b>f</b>  has not already been declared, the first assignment will cause it to be created as an integer,
       and consequently the operation `<b>f</b> <b>+=</b> <b>0.1</b>' will always cause the result to be truncated  to  zero,  so
       that  the  loop  will  fail.  A simple fix would be to turn the initialization into `<b>f</b> <b>=</b> <b>0.0</b>'.  It is
       therefore best to declare numeric variables with explicit types.

<b>CONDITIONAL</b> <b>EXPRESSIONS</b>
       A <u>conditional</u> <u>expression</u> is used with the <b>[[</b> compound command to test attributes of files and to com-
       pare  strings.   Each expression can be constructed from one or more of the following unary or binary
       expressions:

              true if <u>file</u> exists and is a character special file.

       <b>-d</b> <u>file</u>
              true if <u>file</u> exists and is a directory.

       <b>-o</b> <u>option</u>
              true if option named <u>option</u> is on.  <u>option</u> may be a single character, in which case  it  is  a
              single letter option name.  (See the section `Specifying Options'.)

       <b>-p</b> <u>file</u>
              true if <u>file</u> exists and is a FIFO special file (named pipe).

       <b>-x</b> <u>file</u>
              true if <u>file</u> exists and is executable by current process.  If <u>file</u> exists and is a  directory,
              then the current process has permission to search in the directory.

              true if <u>file1</u> exists and is newer than <u>file2</u>.

       <u>file1</u> <b>-ot</b> <u>file2</u>
              true if <u>file1</u> exists and is older than <u>file2</u>.

       <u>file1</u> <b>-ef</b> <u>file2</u>
              true if <u>file1</u> and <u>file2</u> exist and refer to the same file.

       <u>string</u> <b>=</b> <u>pattern</u>
       <u>string</u> <b>==</b> <u>pattern</u>
              true  if  <u>string</u>  matches  <u>pattern</u>.   The `<b>==</b>' form is the preferred one.  The `<b>=</b>' form is for
              backward compatibility and should be considered obsolete.

       <u>string</u> <b>!=</b> <u>pattern</u>
              true if <u>string</u> does not match <u>pattern</u>.

       <u>string1</u> <b>&lt;</b> <u>string2</u>
              true if <u>string1</u> comes before <u>string2</u> based on ASCII value of their characters.

       <u>string1</u> <b>&gt;</b> <u>string2</u>
              true if <u>string1</u> comes after <u>string2</u> based on ASCII value of their characters.

       <u>exp1</u> <b>-eq</b> <u>exp2</u>
              true if <u>exp1</u> is numerically equal to <u>exp2</u>.

       <u>exp1</u> <b>-ne</b> <u>exp2</u>
              true if <u>exp1</u> is numerically not equal to <u>exp2</u>.

       <u>exp1</u> <b>-lt</b> <u>exp2</u>
              true if <u>exp1</u> is numerically less than <u>exp2</u>.

       <u>exp1</u> <b>-gt</b> <u>exp2</u>
              true if <u>exp1</u> is numerically greater than <u>exp2</u>.

       <u>exp1</u> <b>-le</b> <u>exp2</u>
              true if <u>exp1</u> is numerically less than or equal to <u>exp2</u>.

       <u>exp1</u> <b>-ge</b> <u>exp2</u>
              true if <u>exp1</u> is numerically greater than or equal to <u>exp2</u>.

       <b>(</b> <u>exp</u> <b>)</b>
              true if <u>exp</u> is true.

       <b>!</b> <u>exp</u>  true if <u>exp</u> is false.

       <u>exp1</u> <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <u>exp2</u>
              true if <u>exp1</u> and <u>exp2</u> are both true.

       <u>exp1</u> <b>||</b> <u>exp2</u>
              true if either <u>exp1</u> or <u>exp2</u> is true.

       Normal shell expansion is performed on the <u>file</u>, <u>string</u> and <u>pattern</u> arguments, but the result of each
       expansion  is constrained to be a single word, similar to the effect of double quotes.  However, pat-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tern&nbsp;pattern</font>
       tern metacharacters are active for the <u>pattern</u> arguments; the patterns are the same as those used for
       filename  generation,  see <a href="zshexpn.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/zshexpn"><u>zshexpn</u>(1)</a>, but there is no special behaviour of `<b>/</b>' nor initial dots, and
       no glob qualifiers are allowed.

       In each of the above expressions, if <u>file</u> is of the form `<b>/dev/fd/</b><u>n</u>', where <u>n</u> is an integer, then the
       test  applied  to  the open file whose descriptor number is <u>n</u>, even if the underlying system does not
       support the <b>/dev/fd</b> directory.

       In the forms which do numeric comparison, the expressions <u>exp</u> undergo arithmetic expansion as if they
       were enclosed in <b>$((...))</b>.

       For example, the following:

              <b>[[</b> <b>(</b> <b>-f</b> <b>foo</b> <b>||</b> <b>-f</b> <b>bar</b> <b>)</b> <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <b>$report</b> <b>=</b> <b>y*</b> <b>]]</b> <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <b>print</b> <b>File</b> <b>exists.</b>

       tests  if  either file <b>foo</b> or file <b>bar</b> exists, and if so, if the value of the parameter <b>report</b> begins
       with `<b>y</b>'; if the complete condition is true, the message `<b>File</b> <b>exists.</b>' is printed.

<b>PROMPT</b> <b>EXPANSION</b>
       Prompt sequences undergo a special form of expansion.  This type of expansion is also available using
       the <b>-P</b> option to the <b>print</b> builtin.

       If  the <b>PROMPT_SUBST</b> option is set, the prompt string is first subjected to <u>parameter</u> <u>expansion</u>, <u>com</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
       <u>mand</u> <u>substitution</u> and <u>arithmetic</u> <u>expansion</u>.  See <a href="zshexpn.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/zshexpn"><u>zshexpn</u>(1)</a>.

       Certain escape sequences may be recognised in the prompt string.

       If the <b>PROMPT_BANG</b> option is set, a `<b>!</b>' in the prompt is replaced by the current history  event  num-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ber.&nbsp;number.</font>
       ber.  A literal `<b>!</b>' may then be represented as `<b>!!</b>'.

       If the <b>PROMPT_PERCENT</b> option is set, certain escape sequences that start with `<b>%</b>' are expanded.  Some
       escapes take an optional integer argument, which should appear between the `<b>%</b>' and the next character
       of the sequence.  The following escape sequences are recognized:


   <b>Special</b> <b>characters</b>
       <b>%%</b>     A `<b>%</b>'.

       <b>%)</b>     A `<b>)</b>'.


   <b>Login</b> <b>information</b>
       <b>%l</b>     The  line  (tty)  the  user  is logged in on, without `<b>/dev/</b>' prefix.  If the name starts with
              `<b>/dev/tty</b>', that prefix is stripped.

       <b>%M</b>     The full machine hostname.

       <b>%m</b>     The hostname up to the first `<b>.</b>'.  An integer may follow the `<b>%</b>' to specify  how  many  compo-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nents&nbsp;components</font>
              nents  of the hostname are desired.  With a negative integer, trailing components of the host-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">name&nbsp;hostname</font>
              name are shown.

       <b>%n</b>     <b>$USERNAME</b>.

       <b>%y</b>     The line (tty) the user is logged  in  on,  without  `<b>/dev/</b>'  prefix.   This  does  not  treat
              `<b>/dev/tty</b>' names specially.


   <b>Shell</b> <b>state</b>
       <b>%#</b>     A  `<b>#</b>' if the shell is running with privileges, a `<b>%</b>' if not.  Equivalent to `<b>%(!.#.%%)</b>'.  The
              definition of `privileged', for these purposes, is that either the effective user ID is  zero,
              or,  if  POSIX.1e capabilities are supported, that at least one capability is raised in either
              the Effective or Inheritable capability vectors.

       <b>%?</b>     The return status of the last command executed just before the prompt.

       <b>%_</b>     The status of the parser, i.e. the shell constructs (like  `<b>if</b>'  and  `<b>for</b>')  that  have  been
              started  on  the  command  line. If given an integer number that many strings will be printed;
              zero or negative or no integer means print as many as there  are.   This  is  most  useful  in
              prompts <b>PS2</b> for continuation lines and <b>PS4</b> for debugging with the <b>XTRACE</b> option; in the latter
              case it will also work non-interactively.

       <b>%d</b>
       <b>%/</b>     Present working directory (<b>$PWD</b>).  If an integer follows the `<b>%</b>', it  specifies  a  number  of
              trailing  components of <b>$PWD</b> to show; zero means the whole path.  A negative integer specifies
              leading components, i.e. <b>%-1d</b> specifies the first component.

       <b>%~</b>     As <b>%d</b> and <b>%/</b>, but if <b>$PWD</b> has a named directory as its prefix, that part is replaced by a  `<b>~</b>'
              followed  by  the  name of the directory.  If it starts with <b>$HOME</b>, that part is replaced by a
              `<b>~</b>'.

       <b>%h</b>
       <b>%!</b>     Current history event number.

       <b>%i</b>     The line number currently being executed in the script, sourced file, or shell function  given
              by <b>%N</b>.  This is most useful for debugging as part of <b>$PS4</b>.

       <b>%j</b>     The number of jobs.

       <b>%L</b>     The current value of <b>$SHLVL</b>.

       <b>%N</b>     The  name  of  the  script,  sourced  file, or shell function that zsh is currently executing,
              whichever was started most recently.  If there is none, this is equivalent  to  the  parameter
              <b>$0</b>.   An  integer  may follow the `<b>%</b>' to specify a number of trailing path components to show;
              zero means the full path.  A negative integer specifies leading components.

       <b>%c</b>
       <b>%.</b>
       <b>%C</b>     Trailing component of <b>$PWD</b>.  An integer may follow the `<b>%</b>' to get  more  than  one  component.
              Unless  `<b>%C</b>' is used, tilde contraction is performed first.  These are deprecated as <b>%c</b> and <b>%C</b>
              are equivalent to <b>%1~</b> and <b>%1/</b>, respectively, while explicit positive integers  have  the  same
              effect as for the latter two sequences.


   <b>Date</b> <b>and</b> <b>time</b>
       <b>%D</b>     The date in <u>yy</u><b>-</b><u>mm</u><b>-</b><u>dd</u> format.

       <b>%T</b>     Current time of day, in 24-hour format.

       <b>%t</b>

       <b>%*</b>     Current time of day in 24-hour format, with seconds.

       <b>%w</b>     The date in <u>day</u><b>-</b><u>dd</u> format.

       <b>%W</b>     The date in <u>mm</u><b>/</b><u>dd</u><b>/</b><u>yy</u> format.

       <b>%D{</b><u>string</u><b>}</b>
              <u>string</u>  is  formatted  using  the <b>strftime</b> function.  See <a href="../man3/strftime.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/strftime"><u>strftime</u>(3)</a> for more details.  Three
              additional codes are available:  <b>%f</b> prints the day of the month, like <b>%e</b> but without any  pre-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ceding&nbsp;preceding</font>
              ceding  space  if the day is a single digit, and <b>%K</b>/<b>%L</b> correspond to <b>%k</b>/<b>%l</b> for the hour of the
              day (24/12 hour clock) in the same way.


   <b>Visual</b> <b>effects</b>
       <b>%B</b> (<b>%b</b>)
              Start (stop) boldface mode.

       <b>%E</b>     Clear to end of line.

       <b>%U</b> (<b>%u</b>)
              Start (stop) underline mode.

       <b>%S</b> (<b>%s</b>)
              Start (stop) standout mode.

       <b>%{</b>...<b>%}</b>
              Include a string as a literal escape sequence.  The string within the braces should not change
              the cursor position.  Brace pairs can nest.


   <b>Conditional</b> <b>substrings</b>
       <b>%v</b>     The  value of the first element of the <b>psvar</b> array parameter.  Following the `<b>%</b>' with an inte-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ger&nbsp;integer</font>
              ger gives that element of the array.  Negative integers count from the end of the array.

       <b>%(</b><u>x.true-text.false-text</u><b>)</b>
              Specifies a ternary expression.  The character following the <u>x</u> is arbitrary; the same  charac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ter&nbsp;character</font>
              ter is used to separate the text for the `true' result from that for the `false' result.  This
              separator may not appear in the <u>true-text</u>, except as part of a %-escape sequence.  A  `<b>)</b>'  may
              appear  in  the  <u>false-text</u>  as  `<b>%)</b>'.   <u>true-text</u>  and  <u>false-text</u> may both contain arbitrar-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ily-nested&nbsp;arbitrarily-nested</font>
              ily-nested escape sequences, including further ternary expressions.

              The left parenthesis may be preceded or followed by a positive integer <u>n</u>,  which  defaults  to
              zero.   A  negative  integer will be multiplied by -1.  The test character <u>x</u> may be any of the
              following:

              <b>!</b>      True if the shell is running with privileges.
              <b>#</b>      True if the effective uid of the current process is <u>n</u>.
              <b>?</b>      True if the exit status of the last command was <u>n</u>.
              <b>_</b>      True if at least <u>n</u> shell constructs were started.
              <b>C</b>

                     tory, hence <b>/</b> is counted as 0 elements.
              <b>c</b>
              <b>.</b>
              <b>~</b>      True  if the current path, with prefix replacement, has at least <u>n</u> elements relative to
                     the root directory, hence <b>/</b> is counted as 0 elements.
              <b>D</b>      True if the month is equal to <u>n</u> (January = 0).
              <b>d</b>      True if the day of the month is equal to <u>n</u>.
              <b>g</b>      True if the effective gid of the current process is <u>n</u>.
              <b>j</b>      True if the number of jobs is at least <u>n</u>.
              <b>L</b>      True if the <b>SHLVL</b> parameter is at least <u>n</u>.
              <b>l</b>      True if at least <u>n</u> characters have already been printed on the current line.
              <b>S</b>      True if the <b>SECONDS</b> parameter is at least <u>n</u>.
              <b>T</b>      True if the time in hours is equal to <u>n</u>.
              <b>t</b>      True if the time in minutes is equal to <u>n</u>.
              <b>v</b>      True if the array <b>psvar</b> has at least <u>n</u> elements.
              <b>w</b>      True if the day of the week is equal to <u>n</u> (Sunday = 0).

       <b>%&lt;</b><u>string</u><b>&lt;</b>
       <b>%&gt;</b><u>string</u><b>&gt;</b>
       <b>%[</b><u>xstring</u><b>]</b>
              Specifies truncation behaviour for the remainder of the prompt string.  The third, deprecated,
              form  is  equivalent to `<b>%</b><u>xstringx</u>', i.e. <u>x</u> may be `<b>&lt;</b>' or `<b>&gt;</b>'.  The numeric argument, which in
              the third form may appear immediately after the `<b>[</b>', specifies the maximum permitted length of
              the  various  strings  that  can  be displayed in the prompt.  The <u>string</u> will be displayed in
              place of the truncated portion of any string; note this does not undergo prompt expansion.

              The forms with `<b>&lt;</b>' truncate at the left of the string, and the forms with `<b>&gt;</b>' truncate at  the
              right  of  the  string.   For  example,  if  the current directory is `<b>/home/pike</b>', the prompt
              `<b>%8&lt;..&lt;%/</b>' will expand to `<b>..e/pike</b>'.  In this string, the terminating character (`<b>&lt;</b>', `<b>&gt;</b>'  or
              `<b>]</b>'),  or  in  fact any character, may be quoted by a preceding `<b>\</b>'; note when using <b>print</b> <b>-P</b>,
              however, that this must be doubled as the string is also subject to standard <b>print</b> processing,
              in addition to any backslashes removed by a double quoted string:  the worst case is therefore
              `<b>print</b> <b>-P</b> <b>"%&lt;\\\\&lt;&lt;..."</b>'.

              If the <u>string</u> is longer than the specified truncation length, it will  appear  in  full,  com-
              pletely replacing the truncated string.

              The  part of the prompt string to be truncated runs to the end of the string, or to the end of
              the next enclosing group of the `<b>%(</b>' construct, or to the next truncation encountered  at  the
              same grouping level (i.e. truncations inside a `<b>%(</b>' are separate), which ever comes first.  In
              particular, a truncation with argument zero (e.g. `<b>%&lt;&lt;</b>') marks the end of  the  range  of  the
              string  to  be  truncated  while turning off truncation from there on. For example, the prompt
              '%10&lt;...&lt;%~%&lt;&lt;%# ' will print a truncated representation of the current directory, followed by
              a  `<b>%</b>' or `<b>#</b>', followed by a space.  Without the `<b>%&lt;&lt;</b>', those two characters would be included
              in the string to be truncated.
