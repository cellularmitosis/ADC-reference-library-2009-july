<installer-script minSpecVersion="1.0">
<!-- 
	Purpose: To show the basic use of scripts with choices.						
	Overview: Shows two choices which are mutally exclusive.  You can only install one or the other.  															

	Note: This sample does not install any software, but just shows how to use choices.  It is useful to design the choice-outline without software involved to get the rest of the pieces in place first.

    <title>My Great Software</title>

	<script>
<!-- 
	This function ensures that the current choice is not selected if another choice is.																	
-->
		function exclusively_selected(otherChoice)
		{
<!-- 
	The one required argument for this function is a choice object.	If that choice object is selected, then we should not be.  Since all choice scripts are run for every choice but a choice who's selected is changed directly by the user, this function will only get called for one choice at a time. Also, make sure the otherChoice object exists before trying to access one of it's attributes.	
-->
			if(otherChoice &amp;&amp; otherChoice.selected)
				return false;

			return true;
		}
	</script>

<!-- 
	This is a simple choice outline with two choices, choice1 and choice2.			
-->
    <choices-outline>
    	<line choice='choice1'/>
    	<line choice='choice2'/>
    </choices-outline>

	
<!-- 
	This choice contains the script "selected".  The following scripts are defined for choices: selected, enabled, and visible.  These scripts are run for every choice every time a change is made to the selected state of the outline. In addition, start_selected, start_enabled, and start_visible are run once to	get an initial state.  All 6 of these scripts return true or false. The "selected" attributed below calls the exclusively_selected function above and passes choices["choice2"] as its argument.  choices is an object that holds all choices, each choice can be accessed by using the choice id.  The attribute value for any JS object can be accessed in two ways object['attribute'] or	object.attribute. Since choice ids can contain special characters used by the JS language, it is safer to use the first method.	
-->
    <choice id="choice1" 
    	title="choice1"
    	selected='exclusively_selected(choices["choice2"])'/>

<!-- 
	This choice uses the same logic as choice1's exclusively_selected function, but does its work inline.  The script attributes can be either JavaScript or a JavaScript function, as long as its value is a boolean.						
-->
    <choice id="choice2" 
    	title="choice2"
    	selected='!(choices["choice1"].selected)'/>
