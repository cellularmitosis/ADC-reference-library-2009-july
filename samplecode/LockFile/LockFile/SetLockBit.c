/*	File:		SetLockBit.c	Contains:	Sample to demonstrate setting the file lock bit.  This action				atom code resource must be called through a post installation action				atom.  In the selector field, pass in the name of the target 'infs'				resource id.  The code resource gets the resource, converts the partial				path name field to a pascal string, then calls, SetFLock.  A result of 				true is always returned so as not to abort the installation.						This action atom is designed for use by both Installer 3.2 and 3.3	Written by: Rich Kubota		Copyright:	Copyright  1990-1999 by Apple Computer, Inc., All Rights Reserved.				You may incorporate this Apple sample source code into your program(s) without				restriction.
