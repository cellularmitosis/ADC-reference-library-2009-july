<p>There are many distributed multi-tier Java-based architectures
on the market today. So how do they compare to WebObjects Java Client?</p>
<p>Client JDBC applications use a fat-client architecture. Custom
code invokes JDBC on the client, which in turn goes through a driver
to communicate with a JDBC proxy on the server. This proxy makes
the necessary client-library calls on the server.</p>
<p>The shortcomings of this architecture are typical of all fat-client
architectures. Security is a problem because the bytecodes on the
client are easily decompiled, leaving both sensitive data and business
rules at risk. In addition, this architecture doesn't scale; it
is expensive to move data over the channel to the client. Also,
client JDBC applications access the data source directly&#151;there
is no server layer to validate data or control access to the data source. </p>
<p>JDBC three-tier applications (with CORBA as the transport)
are a big improvement over client JDBC applications. In this architecture,
the client can be thin since all that is required on the client
side are the Java Foundation Classes (JFC), nonsensitive custom
code (usually for managing the user interface), and CORBA stubs
for communicating with the server. Sensitive business logic and
database connection logic are stored on the server. In addition, the
server handles all data-intensive computations.</p>
<p>The JDBC three-tier architecture has its own weaknesses. First,
it results in too much network traffic. Because this architecture
uses proxy business objects on the client as handles to real objects
on the server, each client request for an attribute is forwarded
to the server, causing a separate round trip. Second, JDBC three-tier
requires developers to write much of the code themselves, from code
for database access and data packaging, to code for user interface
synchronization and change tracking. Finally JDBC three-tier does
not provide much of the functionality associated with application
servers, such as application monitoring and load balancing, nor
does it provide HTML integration.</p>
<p>The Java Client architecture, however, scales well since real,
fully functional data objects are copied to the client and round
trips are made to the server only for database commits and new data
fetches. Also, Java Client applications are designed to leverage
custom business logic that lets you control which business objects
are sent to the client and lets you validate data from the client
before it's committed to the data store (the server has the last word
on what data is committed).</p>
