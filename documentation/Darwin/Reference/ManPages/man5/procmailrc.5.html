PROCMAILRC(5)                                                                                  PROCMAILRC(5)



<b>NAME</b>
       procmailrc - procmail rcfile

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>$HOME/.procmailrc</b>

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       For a quick start, see <b>NOTES</b> at the end of the <a href="../man1/procmail.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/procmail"><b>procmail</b>(1)</a> man page.

       The  rcfile  can  contain  a  mixture of environment variable assignments (some of which have special
       meanings to procmail), and recipes.  In their most simple appearance, the recipes are simply one line
       regular  expressions that are searched for in the header of the arriving mail.  The first recipe that
       matches is used to determine where the mail has to go (usually a file).  If processing falls off  the
       end of the rcfile, procmail will deliver the mail to <b>$DEFAULT</b>.

       There  are  two  kinds  of recipes: delivering and non-delivering recipes.  If a <u>delivering</u> <u>recipe</u> is
       found to match, procmail considers the mail (you guessed it) delivered and will <u>cease</u> <u>processing</u>  the
       rcfile  after having successfully executed the action line of the recipe.  If a <u>non-delivering</u> <u>recipe</u>
       is found to match, processing of the rcfile will <u>continue</u> after the action line of  this  recipe  has
       been executed.

       Delivering  recipes  are  those that cause header and/or body of the mail to be: written into a file,
       absorbed by a program or forwarded to a mailaddress.

       Non-delivering recipes are: those that cause the output of a program or filter to be captured back by
       procmail or those that start a nesting block.

       You  can tell procmail to treat a <u>delivering</u> <u>recipe</u> as if it were a non-delivering recipe by specify-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;specifying</font>
       ing the `c' flag on such a recipe.  This will make procmail generate a <u>carbon</u> <u>copy</u>  of  the  mail  by
       delivering it to this recipe, yet continue processing the rcfile.

       By using any number of recipes you can presort your mail extremely straightforward into several mail-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">folders.&nbsp;mailfolders.</font>
       folders.  Bear in mind though that the mail can arrive concurrently in these mailfolders (if  several
       procmail  programs  happen  to run at the same time, not unlikely if a lot of mail arrives).  To make
       sure this does not result in a mess, proper use of lockfiles is highly recommended.

       The environment variable <b>assignments</b> and <b>recipes</b> can be freely intermixed in the rcfile. If any envi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ronment&nbsp;environment</font>
       ronment  variable  has  a special meaning to procmail, it will be used appropriately the moment it is
       parsed (i.e., you can change the current directory whenever you want by  specifying  a  new  <b>MAILDIR</b>,
       switch  lockfiles by specifying a new <b>LOCKFILE</b>, change the umask at any time, etc., the possibilities
       are endless :-).

       The assignments and substitutions of these environment variables are handled exactly  like  in  <a href="../man1/sh.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/sh"><b>sh</b>(1)</a>
       (that includes all possible quotes and escapes), with the added bonus that blanks around the '=' sign
       are ignored and that, if an environment variable appears without a trailing '=', it will  be  removed
       from the environment.  Any program in backquotes started by procmail will have the entire mail at its
       stdin.


   <b>Comments</b>
       A word beginning with # and all the following characters up to a NEWLINE are ignored.  This does  not
       apply to condition lines, which cannot be commented.

   <b>Recipes</b>
       A line starting with ':' marks the beginning of a recipe.  It has the following format:

              :0 [<u>flags</u>] [ : [<u>locallockfile</u>] ]
              &lt;zero or more conditions (one per line)&gt;
              &lt;exactly one action line&gt;

       Conditions  start  with  a  leading `*', everything after that character is passed on to the internal
       egrep <b>literally</b>, except for leading and trailing whitespace.   These  regular  expressions  are  <b>com</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pletely&nbsp;completely</font>
       <b>pletely</b>  compatible  to  the normal <a href="../man1/egrep.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/egrep"><b>egrep</b>(1)</a> extended regular expressions.  See also <b>Extended</b> <b>regular</b>
       <b>expressions</b>.

       Conditions are anded; if there are no conditions the result will be true by default.

       <u>Flags</u> can be any of the following:

       <b>H</b>    Egrep the header (default).

       <b>B</b>    Egrep the body.

       <b>D</b>    Tell the internal egrep to distinguish between upper and lower case  (contrary  to  the  default
            which is to ignore case).

       <b>A</b>    This recipe will not be executed unless the conditions on the last preceding recipe (on the cur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rent&nbsp;current</font>
            rent block-nesting level) without the `A' or `a' flag matched as well.  This allows you to chain
            actions that depend on a common condition.

       <b>a</b>    Has the same meaning as the `A' flag, with the additional condition that the immediately preced-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;preceding</font>
            ing recipe must have been <u>successfully</u> completed before this recipe is executed.

       <b>E</b>    This recipe only executes if the immediately preceding recipe was not  executed.   Execution  of
            this  recipe also disables any immediately following recipes with the 'E' flag.  This allows you
            to specify `else if' actions.

       <b>e</b>    This recipe only executes if the immediately preceding recipe <u>failed</u> (i.e., the action line  was
            attempted, but resulted in an error).

       <b>h</b>    Feed the header to the pipe, file or mail destination (default).

       <b>b</b>    Feed the body to the pipe, file or mail destination (default).

       <b>f</b>    Consider the pipe as a filter.

       <b>c</b>    Generate  a  <b>carbon</b>  <b>copy</b>  of this mail.  This only makes sense on <u>delivering</u> recipes.  The only
            non-delivering recipe this flag has an effect on is on a nesting block, in order to  generate  a
            carbon  copy  this  will  <b>clone</b>  the running procmail process (lockfiles will not be inherited),
            whereby the clone will proceed as usual and the parent will jump across the block.

       <b>w</b>    Wait for the filter or program to finish and check its exitcode (normally ignored); if the  fil-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ter&nbsp;filter</font>
            ter is unsuccessful, then the text will not have been filtered.

       <b>W</b>    Has the same meaning as the `w' flag, but will suppress any `Program failure' message.

       <b>i</b>    Ignore any write errors on this recipe (i.e., usually due to an early closed pipe).

       <b>r</b>    Raw mode, do not try to ensure the mail ends with an empty line, write it out as is.

       There  are  some special conditions you can use that are not straight regular expressions.  To select
       them, the condition must start with:

       <b>!</b>    Invert the condition.

       <b>$</b>    Evaluate the remainder of this condition according to <a href="../man1/sh.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/sh"><b>sh</b>(1)</a>  substitution  rules  inside  double
            quotes, skip leading whitespace, then reparse it.

       <b>?</b>    Use the exitcode of the specified program.

       <b>&lt;</b>    Check  if  the  total  length  of  the mail is shorter than the specified (in decimal) number of
            bytes.

       <b>&gt;</b>    Analogous to '&lt;'.

       <b>variablename</b> <u>??</u>
            Match the remainder of this condition against the value of this environment variable (which can-
            not  be  a  pseudo  variable).   A special case is if variablename is equal to `B', `H', `HB' or
            `BH'; this merely overrides the default header/body search area defined by the initial flags  on
            this recipe.

       <b>\</b>    To quote any of the above at the start of the line.

   <b>Local</b> <b>lockfile</b>
       If  you  put a second (trailing) ':' on the first recipe line, then procmail will use a <u>locallockfile</u>
       (for this recipe only).  You can optionally specify the locallockfile to use; if you  don't  however,
       procmail will use the destination filename (or the filename following the first '&gt;&gt;') and will append
       $LOCKEXT to it.

   <b>Recipe</b> <b>action</b> <b>line</b>
       The action line can start with the following characters:

       <b>!</b>      Forwards to all the specified mail addresses.

       <b>|</b>      Starts the specified program, possibly in $SHELL if any  of  the  characters  $SHELLMETAS  are
              spotted.   You can optionally prepend this pipe symbol with <u>variable=</u>, which will cause stdout
              of the program to be captured in the environment <u>variable</u> (procmail will  <b>not</b>  terminate  pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cessing&nbsp;processing</font>
              cessing the rcfile at this point).  If you specify just this pipe symbol, without any program,
              then procmail will pipe the mail to stdout.

       <b>{</b>      Followed by at least one space, tab or newline will mark the start of a nesting block.  Every-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">thing&nbsp;Everything</font>
              thing  up till the next closing brace will depend on the conditions specified for this recipe.
              Unlimited nesting is permitted.  The closing brace exists merely to delimit the block, it will
              <u>not</u>  cause procmail to terminate in any way.  If the end of a block is reached processing will
              continue as usual after the block.  On a nesting block, the flags `H' and `B' only affect  the
              conditions leading up to the block, the flags `h' and `b' have no effect whatsoever.

       Anything else will be taken as a mailbox name (either a filename or a directory, absolute or relative
       to the current directory (see MAILDIR)).  If it is a (possibly yet nonexistent)  filename,  the  mail
       will be appended to it.

       If  it  is  a  directory, the mail will be delivered to a newly created, guaranteed to be unique file
       named $MSGPREFIX* in the specified directory.  If the mailbox name ends in "/.", then this  directory
       is  presumed  to be an MH folder; i.e., procmail will use the next number it finds available.  If the
       mailbox name ends in "/", then this directory is presumed to be a maildir folder; i.e., procmail will
       deliver the message to a file in a subdirectory named "tmp" and rename it to be inside a subdirectory
       named "new".  If the mailbox is specified to be an MH folder or maildir folder, procmail will  create
       the  necessary directories if they don't exist, rather than treat the mailbox as a non-existent file-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">name.&nbsp;filename.</font>
       name.  When procmail is delivering to directories, you can specify multiple directories to deliver to
       (procmail will do so utilising hardlinks).

       Other cleared or preset environment variables are IFS, ENV and PWD.

       For security reasons, upon startup procmail will wipe out all environment  variables  that  are  sus-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pected&nbsp;suspected</font>
       pected of modifying the behavior of the runtime linker.

   <b>Environment</b>
       Before  you  get  lost  in the multitude of environment variables, keep in mind that all of them have
       reasonable defaults.

       <b>MAILDIR</b>     Current directory while procmail is executing (that means that all paths are relative  to
                   $MAILDIR).

       <b>DEFAULT</b>     Default  <b>mailbox</b>  file  (if not told otherwise, procmail will dump mail in this mailbox).
                   Procmail will automatically use $DEFAULT$LOCKEXT as lockfile prior  to  writing  to  this
                   mailbox.   You  do not need to set this variable, since it already points to the standard
                   system mailbox.

       <b>LOGFILE</b>     This file will also contain any error or diagnostic messages from procmail (normally none
                   :-)  or any other programs started by procmail.  If this file is not specified, any diag-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nostics&nbsp;diagnostics</font>
                   nostics or error messages will be mailed back to the sender.  See also <b>LOGABSTRACT</b>.

       <b>VERBOSE</b>     You can turn on <u>extended</u> <u>diagnostics</u> by setting this variable to `yes' or `on',  to  turn
                   it off again set it to `no' or `off'.

       <b>LOGABSTRACT</b> Just before procmail exits it logs an abstract of the delivered message in $LOGFILE show-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;showing</font>
                   ing the `From ' and `Subject:' fields of the header, what folder it finally went  to  and
                   how  long  (in  bytes)  the message was.  By setting this variable to `no', generation of
                   this abstract is suppressed.  If you set it to `all', procmail will log an  abstract  for
                   every successful <u>delivering</u> <u>recipe</u> it processes.

       <b>LOG</b>         Anything assigned to this variable will be appended to $LOGFILE.

       <b>ORGMAIL</b>     Usually  the  system  mailbox  (<b>OR</b>i<b>G</b>inal  <b>MAIL</b>box).   If,  for  some obscure reason (like
                   `<b>filesystem</b> <b>full</b>') the mail could not be delivered, then this mailbox will  be  the  last
                   resort.   If  procmail  fails  to save the mail in here (deep, deep trouble :-), then the
                   mail will bounce back to the sender.

       <b>LOCKFILE</b>    Global semaphore file.  If this file already exists, procmail will wait until it has gone
                   before  proceeding, and will create it itself (cleaning it up when ready, of course).  If
                   more than one <u>lockfile</u> are specified, then the previous one will be removed before trying
                   to  create  the  new one.  The use of a global lockfile is discouraged, whenever possible
                   use locallockfiles (on a per recipe basis) instead.

       <b>LOCKEXT</b>     Default extension that is appended to a destination file to determine what local <u>lockfile</u>
                   to use (only if turned on, on a per-recipe basis).

       <b>LOCKSLEEP</b>   Number  of  seconds  procmail  will  sleep  before  retrying on a <u>lockfile</u> (if it already
                   existed); if not specified, it defaults to 8 seconds.

       <b>LOCKTIMEOUT</b> Number of seconds that have to have passed since a  <u>lockfile</u>  was  last  modified/created
                   before  procmail  decides  that this must be an erroneously leftover lockfile that can be
                   removed by force now.  If zero, then no timeout will be used and procmail will wait  for-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ever&nbsp;forever</font>
                   ever  until the lockfile is removed; if not specified, it defaults to 1024 seconds.  This
                   variable is useful to prevent  indefinite  hangups  of  <b>sendmail</b>/procmail.   Procmail  is
                   immune to clock skew across machines.

       <b>TIMEOUT</b>     Number  of  seconds  that  have to have passed before procmail decides that some child it
                   started must be hanging.  The offending program will  receive  a  TERMINATE  signal  from
                   procmail,  and  processing of the rcfile will continue.  If zero, then no timeout will be
                   used and procmail will wait forever until the child has terminated; if not specified,  it
                   defaults to 960 seconds.

       <b>MSGPREFIX</b>   Filename  prefix that is used when delivering to a directory (not used when delivering to
                   a maildir or an MH directory).

       <b>HOST</b>        If this is not the <u>hostname</u> of the machine, processing of the current <u>rcfile</u> will immedi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ately&nbsp;immediately</font>
                   ately  cease.  If  other rcfiles were specified on the command line, processing will con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tinue&nbsp;continue</font>
                   tinue with the next one.  If all rcfiles are exhausted, the program will  terminate,  but
                   will  not  generate  an  error  (i.e.,  to the mailer it will seem that the mail has been
                   delivered).

       <b>UMASK</b>       The name says it all (if it doesn't, then forget about this one :-).   Anything  assigned
                   to  UMASK  is taken as an <b>octal</b> number.  If not specified, the umask defaults to 077.  If
                   the umask permits o+x, all the mailboxes procmail delivers to directly  will  receive  an
                   o+x mode change.  This can be used to check if new mail arrived.

       <b>SHELLMETAS</b>  If  any  of  the characters in SHELLMETAS appears in the line specifying a filter or pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">gram,&nbsp;program,</font>
                   gram, the line will be fed to $SHELL instead of being executed directly.

       <b>SHELLFLAGS</b>  Any invocation of $SHELL will be like:
                   "$SHELL" "$SHELLFLAGS" "$*";

       <b>SENDMAIL</b>    If you're not using the <u>forwarding</u> facility don't worry about this one.  It specifies the
                   program being called to forward any mail.
                   It gets invoked as: "$SENDMAIL" $SENDMAILFLAGS "$@";

       <b>NORESRETRY</b>  Number  of  retries  that  are to be made if any `<b>process</b> <b>table</b> <b>full</b>', `<b>file</b> <b>table</b> <b>full</b>',
                   `<b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>memory</b>' or `<b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>swap</b> <b>space</b>' error should occur.  If this number  is  negative,
                   then  procmail  will  retry  indefinitely; if not specified, it defaults to 4 times.  The
                   retries occur with a $SUSPEND second interval.  The idea behind this is  that  if,  e.g.,
                   the  <u>swap</u>  <u>space</u>  has  been exhausted or the <u>process</u> <u>table</u> is full, usually several other
                   programs will either detect this as well and abort or crash 8-), thereby freeing valuable
                   <u>resources</u> for procmail.

       <b>SUSPEND</b>     Number  of  seconds that procmail will pause if it has to wait for something that is cur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rently&nbsp;currently</font>
                   rently unavailable (memory, fork, etc.); if not specified, it will default to 16 seconds.
                   See also: <b>LOCKSLEEP</b>.

       <b>LINEBUF</b>     Length of the internal line buffers, cannot be set smaller than 128.  All lines read from
                   the <u>rcfile</u> should not exceed $LINEBUF characters before  and  after  expansion.   If  not
                   specified,  it  defaults  to  2048.   This  limit,  of course, does <u>not</u> apply to the mail
                   itself, which can have arbitrary line lengths, or could be a binary file for that matter.
                   See also PROCMAIL_OVERFLOW.

       <b>DELIVERED</b>   If  set  to  `yes' procmail will pretend (to the mail agent) the mail has been delivered.
                   If mail cannot be delivered after having met this assignment (set  to  `yes'),  the  mail
                   will be lost (i.e., it will not bounce).

       <b>TRAP</b>        When  procmail terminates of its own accord and not because it received a signal, it will
                   execute the contents of this variable.  A copy of the mail can be read from  stdin.   Any
                   output  produced  by  this  command will be appended to $LOGFILE.  Possible uses for TRAP
                   are: removal of temporary files, logging customised abstracts, etc.   See  also  <b>EXITCODE</b>
                   and <b>LOGABSTRACT</b>.

       <b>EXITCODE</b>    By  default,  procmail returns an exitcode of zero (success) if it successfully delivered
                   the message or if the <b>HOST</b> variable was misset and there were no more rcfiles on the com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
                   mand line; otherwise it returns failure.  Before doing so, procmail examines the value of
                   this variable.  If it is set to a positive numeric value, procmail will instead use  that
                   value  as its exitcode.  If this variable is set but empty and <b>TRAP</b> is set, procmail will
                   set the exitcode to whatever the <b>TRAP</b> program returns.  If  this  variable  is  not  set,
                   procmail will set it shortly before calling up the <b>TRAP</b> program.

       <b>LASTFOLDER</b>  This  variable  is  assigned to by procmail whenever it is delivering to a folder or pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">gram.&nbsp;program.</font>
                   gram.  It always contains the name of the last file (or program) procmail  delivered  to.
                   If the last delivery was to several directory folders together then $LASTFOLDER will con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tain&nbsp;contain</font>
                   tain the hardlinked filenames as a space separated list.

       <b>MATCH</b>       This variable is assigned to by procmail whenever it is  told  to  extract  text  from  a
                   matching  regular  expression.   It will contain all text matching the regular expression
                   past the `<b>\/</b>' token.

       <b>SHIFT</b>       Assigning a positive value to this variable has the same effect as the `shift' command in
                   <a href="../man1/sh.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/sh"><b>sh</b>(1)</a>.   This  command  is most useful to extract extra arguments passed to procmail when
                   acting as a generic mailfilter.

       <b>INCLUDERC</b>   Names an rcfile (relative to the current directory) which will be included here as if  it
                   were  part  of  the  current  rcfile.   Nesting  is permitted and only limited by systems
                   resources (memory and file descriptors).  As no checking is done on  the  permissions  or
                   ownership of the rcfile, users of <b>INCLUDERC</b> should make sure that only trusted users have
                   write access to the included rcfile or the directory it is in.  Command line  assignments
                   to <b>INCLUDERC</b> have no effect.

       <b>SWITCHRC</b>    Names an rcfile (relative to the current directory) to which processing will be switched.
                   If the named rcfile doesn't exist or is not a normal file or /dev/null then an error will
                   be  logged  and processing will continue in the current rcfile.  Otherwise, processing of
                   the current rcfile will be aborted and the  named  rcfile  started.   Unsetting  <b>SWITCHRC</b>
                   aborts  processing  of  the current rcfile as if it had ended at the assignment.  As with
                   <b>INCLUDERC</b>, no checking is done on the permissions or ownership of the rcfile and  command
                   line assignments have no effect.

       <b>PROCMAIL_VERSION</b>
                   The version number of the running procmail binary.

       <b>PROCMAIL_OVERFLOW</b>
                   This  variable  will  be  set to a non-empty value if procmail detects a buffer overflow.
                   See the <b>BUGS</b> section below for other details of operation when overflow occurs.

       <b>COMSAT</b>      <!-- a --><b>Comsat</b>(8)<!-- /a -->/<b>biff</b>(1) notification is on by default, it can be turned  off  by  setting  this
                   variable  to  `no'.   Alternatively  the  biff-service can be customised by setting it to
                   either `service@', `@hostname', or `service@hostname'.  When not specified it defaults to
                   biff@localhost.

       <b>DROPPRIVS</b>   If set to `yes' procmail will drop all privileges it might have had (suid or sgid).  This
                   is only useful if you want to guarantee that the bottom half of the /etc/procmailrc  file
                   is executed on behalf of the recipient.

   <b>Extended</b> <b>regular</b> <b>expressions</b>
       The  following tokens are known to both the procmail internal egrep and the standard <a href="../man1/egrep.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/egrep"><b>egrep</b>(1)</a> (beware
       that some egrep implementations include other non-standard extensions):

       <b>^</b>         Start of a line.

       <b>$</b>         End of a line.

       <b>.</b>         Any character except a newline.

       <b>a*</b>        Any sequence of zero or more a's.

       <b>a+</b>        Any sequence of one or more a's.

       <b>a?</b>        Either zero or one a.

       <b>[^-a-d]</b>   Any character which is <b>not</b> either a dash, a, b, c, d or newline.

       <b>de|abc</b>    Either the sequence `de' or `abc'.

       <b>(abc)*</b>    Zero or more times the sequence `abc'.

       <b>\.</b>        Matches a single dot; use \ to quote any of the magic characters to get rid of  their  spe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cial&nbsp;special</font>
                 cial meaning.  See also $\ variable substitution.

       These were only samples, of course, any more complex combination is valid as well.

       The following token meanings are special procmail extensions:

       <b>^</b> or <b>$</b>    Match a newline (for multiline matches).

       <b>^^</b>        Anchor the expression at the very start of the search area, or if encountered at the end of
                 the expression, anchor it at the very end of the search area.

       <b>\&lt;</b> or <b>\&gt;</b>  Match the character before or after a word.  They  are  merely  a  shorthand  for  `[^a-zA-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">Z0-9_]',&nbsp;`[^a-zAZ0-9_]',</font>
                 Z0-9_]',  but  can  also match newlines.  Since they match actual characters, they are only
                 suitable to delimit words, not to delimit inter-word space.

       <b>\/</b>        Splits the expression in two parts.  Everything matching the right part will be assigned to
                 the MATCH environment variable.

<b>EXAMPLES</b>
       Look in the <a href="procmailex.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/procmailex"><b>procmailex</b>(5)</a> man page.

<b>CAVEATS</b>
       Continued lines in an action line that specifies a program always have to end in a backslash, even if
       the underlying shell would not need or want the backslash to indicate continuation.  This is  due  to
       the  two  pass  parsing  process  needed (first procmail, then the shell (or not, depending on <b>SHELL</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">METAS)).&nbsp;SHELLMETAS)).</font>
       <b>METAS</b>)).

       Don't put comments on the regular expression condition lines in a recipe, these lines are fed to  the
       internal egrep <u>literally</u> (except for continuation backslashes at the end of a line).

       Leading  whitespace  on continued regular expression condition lines is usually ignored (so that they
       can be indented), but <b>not</b> on continued condition lines that are evaluated according to the <a href="../man1/sh.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/sh"><b>sh</b>(1)</a> sub-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">stitution&nbsp;substitution</font>
       stitution rules inside double quotes.

       Watch  out for deadlocks when doing unhealthy things like forwarding mail to your own account.  Dead-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">locks&nbsp;Deadlocks</font>
       locks can be broken by proper use of <b>LOCKTIMEOUT</b>.

       Any default values that procmail has for some environment variables will  <b>always</b>  override  the  ones
       that  were already defined.  If you really want to override the defaults, you either have to put them
       in the <b>rcfile</b> or on the command line as arguments.

       The /etc/procmailrc file cannot change the PATH setting seen by user rcfiles as the  value  is  reset
       when  procmail  finishes  the  /etc/procmailrc  file.  While future enhancements are expected in this
       area, recompiling procmail with the desired value is currently the only correct solution.

       Environment variables set <b>inside</b> the shell-interpreted-`|' action part of a recipe  will  <b>not</b>  retain
       their value after the recipe has finished since they are set in a subshell of procmail.  To make sure
       the value of an environment variable is retained you have to  put  the  assignment  to  the  variable
       before the leading `|' of a recipe, so that it can capture stdout of the program.

       If  you specify only a `h' or a `b' flag on a delivering recipe, and the recipe matches, then, unless
       the `c' flag is present as well, the body respectively the header of the mail will be silently  lost.

<b>BUGS</b>
       The only substitutions of environment variables that can be handled by procmail  itself  are  of  the
       type  $name,  ${name},  ${name:-text}, ${name:+text}, ${name-text}, ${name+text}, $\name, $#, $n, $$,
       $?, $_, $- and $=; whereby $\name will be substituted by the all-magic-regular-expression-characters-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">disarmed&nbsp;all-magic-regular-expression-charactersdisarmed</font>
       disarmed  equivalent  of  $name,  $_ by the name of the current rcfile, $- by $LASTFOLDER and $= will
       contain the score of the last recipe.  Furthermore, the result of $\name substitution will  never  be
       split  on  whitespace.  When the <b>-a</b> or <b>-m</b> options are used, $# will expand to the number of arguments
       so specified and "$@" (the quotes are required) will expand to  the  specified  arguments.   However,
       "$@" will only be expanded when used in the argument list to a program, and then only one such occur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rence&nbsp;occurrence</font>
       rence will be expanded.

       Unquoted variable expansions performed by procmail are always split on space, tab, and newline  char-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">acters;&nbsp;characters;</font>
       acters; the IFS variable is not used internally.

       Procmail does not support the expansion of `~'.

       A  line  buffer  of length $LINEBUF is used when processing the <u>rcfile</u>, any expansions that don't fit
       within this limit will be truncated and PROCMAIL_OVERFLOW will be set.  If the overflowing line is  a
       condition or an action line, then it will be considered failed and procmail will continue processing.
       If it is a variable assignment or recipe start line then procmail will abort the entire rcfile.

       If the global lockfile has a <u>relative</u> path, and the current directory is not the  same  as  when  the
       global  lockfile  was created, then the global lockfile will not be removed if procmail exits at that
       point (remedy: use <u>absolute</u> paths to specify global lockfiles).

       If an rcfile has a <u>relative</u> path and when the rcfile is first  opened  <b>MAILDIR</b>  contains  a  relative
       path,  and  if  at  one  point  procmail  is instructed to clone itself and the current directory has
       changed since the rcfile was opened, then procmail will not be able to clone itself (remedy:  use  an
       <u>absolute</u> path to reference the rcfile or make sure MAILDIR contains an absolute path as the rcfile is
       opened).

       A locallockfile on the recipe that marks the start of a non-forking nested block does not work as ex-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pected.&nbsp;expected.</font>
       pected.

       When  capturing  stdout from a recipe into an environment variable, exactly one trailing newline will
       be stripped.

       Some non-optimal and non-obvious regexps set MATCH to an incorrect value.  The regexp can be made  to
       work by removing one or more unneeded

<b>MISCELLANEOUS</b>
       If the regular expression contains `<b>^TO_</b>' it will be substituted by `<b>(^((Original-)?(Resent-)?(To|Cc</b>
       <b>|Bcc)|(X-Envelope|Apparently(-Resent)?)-To):(.*[^-a-zA-Z0-9_.])?)</b>', which should catch all
       destination specifications containing a specific <u>address</u>.

       If the regular expression contains `<b>^TO</b>' it will be substituted by `<b>(^((Original-)?(Resent-)?(To|Cc</b>
       <b>|Bcc)|(X-Envelope|Apparently(-Resent)?)-To):(.*[^a-zA-Z])?)</b>', which should catch all destination
       specifications containing a specific <u>word</u>.

       If the regular expression contains `<b>^FROM_DAEMON</b>' it will be substituted by `<b>(^(Mailing-List:</b>
       <b>|Precedence:.*(junk|bulk|list)|To:</b> <b>Multiple</b> <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> <b>|(((Resent-)?(From|Sender)|X-Envelope-From)</b>
       <b>:|&gt;?From</b> <b>)([^&gt;]*[^(.%@a-z0-9])?(Post(ma?(st(e?r)?|n)|office)|(send)?Mail(er)?|daemon|m(mdf|ajordomo)</b>
       <b>|n?uucp|LIST(SERV|proc)|NETSERV|o(wner|ps)|r(e(quest|sponse)|oot)|b(ounce|bs\.smtp)|echo|mirror</b>
       <b>|s(erv(ices?|er)|mtp(error)?|ystem)|A(dmin(istrator)?|MMGR|utoanswer))(([^).!:a-z0-9][-_a</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">z0-9]*)?[%@&gt;\t&nbsp;|s(erv(ices?|er)|mtp(error)?|ystem)|A(dmin(istrator)?|MMGR|utoanswer))(([^).!:a-z0-9][-_az0-9]*)?[%@&gt;\t</font>
       <b>z0-9]*)?[%@&gt;\t</b> <b>][^&lt;)]*(\(.*\).*)?)?$([^&gt;]|$)))</b>', which should catch mails coming from most daemons
       (how's that for a regular expression :-).

       If the regular expression contains `<b>^FROM_MAILER</b>' it will be substituted by `<b>(^(((Resent-)?(From</b>
       <b>|Sender)|X-Envelope-From):|&gt;?From</b> <b>)([^&gt;]*[^(.%@a-z0-9])?(Post(ma(st(er)?|n)|office)|(send)?Mail(er)?</b>
       <b>|daemon|mmdf|n?uucp|ops|r(esponse|oot)|(bbs\.)?smtp(error)?|s(erv(ices?|er)|ystem)|A(dmin(istrator)?</b>
       <b>|MMGR))(([^).!:a-z0-9][-_a-z0-9]*)?[%@&gt;\t</b> <b>][^&lt;)]*(\(.*\).*)?)?$([^&gt;]|$))</b>' (a stripped down version of
       `<b>^FROM_DAEMON</b>'), which should catch mails coming from most mailer-daemons.

       When  assigning  boolean  values  to variables like VERBOSE, DELIVERED or COMSAT, procmail accepts as
       true every string starting with: a non-zero value, `on', `y', `t' or  `e'.   False  is  every  string
       starting with: a zero value, `off', `n', `f' or `d'.

       If  the action line of a recipe specifies a program, a sole backslash-newline pair in it on an other-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">wise&nbsp;otherwise</font>
       wise empty line will be converted into a newline.

       The regular expression engine built into procmail does not support named character classes.

<b>NOTES</b>
       Since unquoted leading whitespace is generally ignored in the rcfile you  can  indent  everything  to
       taste.

       The  leading  `|'  on  the action line to specify a program or filter is stripped before checking for
       $SHELLMETAS.

       Files included with the INCLUDERC directive containing only environment variable assignments  can  be
       shared with sh.

       The  current behavior of assignments on the command line to <b>INCLUDERC</b> and <b>SWITCHRC</b> is not guaranteed,
       has been changed once already, and may be changed again or removed in future releases.

       For <u>really</u> complicated processing you can even consider calling <b>procmail</b> recursively.

       In the old days, the `:0' that marks the beginning of a recipe, had to be changed  to  `:n',  whereby
       `n' denotes the number of conditions that follow.
