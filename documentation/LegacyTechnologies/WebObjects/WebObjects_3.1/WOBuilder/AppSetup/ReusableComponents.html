 <H1><CENTER><A NAME="REF37041">Reusable Components</A></CENTER></H1>                                                                        
 <P>One of the strengths of the WebObjects architecture is its support of reusable components. Any component that you define can be reused by any WebObjects application.          
 The most common type of component represents an entire HTML page. However,                 
 WebObjects also supports components that represent a part of a page and can be             
 used within multiple pages of the same application or even multiple sections of the        
 same page.                                                                                 
 <P>Although some pages must be crafted individually for an application, many could be         
 identical across applications. Even pages that aren't identical across applications can    
 share at least some portions (header, footer, navigation bars, and so on) with pages in    
 other applications. With reusable components, you can factor out a portion of a page       
 (or a complete page) that's used throughout one or more applications, define it once,      
 and then use it wherever you want, simply by referring to it by name.

 <P><CENTER><IMG SRC = "Images/reusable.gif"></CENTER>

<P>To reuse an existing component, you must add it to each application that wants to use      
 it.                                                                                        
 <P>When you add one component to the page of another component, WebObjects Builder            
 displays it as a <A HREF="../DynElem/CustomElement.html">custom element</A>. You use this component just like you would use any        
 other dynamic element that you drag from the palette.                                      
 <P>For more information on reusable components, see "<A HREF="../../DevGuide/Reuse/Reuse.book.html">Creating Reusable Components</A>"            
 in the <I>WebObjects Developer's Guide</I>. Also, "<A HREF="../DynElem/ReuseComponents.html">Reusing Components</A>" and "<A HREF="../Advanced/CreateReusableComponent.html">Creating              
 Reusable Components</A>" in this guide describe how to use a component within another          
 component and how to create a reusable component using WebObjects Builder.
