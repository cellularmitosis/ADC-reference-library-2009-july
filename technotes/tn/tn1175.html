Processes and procedures related to the signing of applets are generally complex and sometimes confusing, and users have had issues related to using and signing applets with MRJ. The purpose of this document is to discuss the technology being employed and to clarify the procedures needed to sign jar files, install certificates, and successfully utilize a signed applet. </p><!-- end_intro_text --><!-- begin_date --><h3>&nbsp;Updated: [Oct 16 2000]</h3><!-- end_date --></TD> </TR>    </TABLE> <!-- end_header_box --><BR><BR><hr width=500 align=center><BR><BR><!-- begin_content -->            <H2><A NAME="overview"></A>Overview</H2>            <P>The applet signing process is based on the public key encryption system, which is based on four fundamental concepts. These four pillars of public key encryption are public/private key pairs, digital certificates, certificate authorities, and encryption algorithms. <B>Key pairs</B> provide a means of exchanging messages, <B>digital certificates</B> ensure the authenticity of both the sender and receiver, the <B>certificate authority</B> ensures the validity of the digital certificates, and <B>encryption algorithms</B> "scramble" the message.</p><P>A digital certificate is a software token that serves as a form of identification,similar to the way your driver's license is used to verify identity. Often recognized as a form of electronic signature, the digital certificate is used to authenticate the identity of an individual or corporation. It is the responsibility of the certificate receiver to verify that the sender is legitimate before accepting any risky requests.</p><P>A digital signature is a means of applying a digital certificate to a collection of data, thus guaranteeing the originator of the data. Historically, a message was sealed with wax which was stamped with a unique emblem so the receiver of the message could trust the message was actually from the person supposedly sent it. Conceptually, applet signing is much the same, but considerably more secure and reliable. Signing Javacode means applying your digital signature to your completed applet data, class files, image files, data files, etc., stored in the form of a jar file. This mechanism ensures that the origin of your applet can be verified and that it has not been modified since it was signed. Even if it was intercepted while being transmitted, a modified applet will fail the signature-verification process.</P><P>Signing your Java applet's code is important because the end user is assured that the code they are running is from the signer, and not some other entity with malicious intent. Additionally, it gives you, the developer, access to additional resources outside of the Java security "sandbox." In general, your code would operate unrestricted as if it were an application on the client machine. Specifically, once signed, your applet can gain access the following functionality:</p><UL>    <LI>Issuing an RMI call to a remote object running on a different server than the applet's</li>    <LI>Executing a client-side program</li>    <LI>Reading from and writing to files stored on the client</li>    <LI>Sending a print job to a local printer</li>    <LI>Accessing the system Clipboard</li>    <LI>Reading the client's system properties (e.g., user name)</li>    <LI>Determining the structure of an object (fields, methods, values, etc.) using the <CODE>Reflection</CODE> API</li>    <LI>and more....</li></UL><P>MRJ's implementation of Applet Security uses Sun's standard signed applet mechanism. Sun's javakey tool is used to create certificates, sign jar files, manage the identity database, and perform other related tasks. The javakey tool manages a database containing public/private key pairs and related certificates. In order to sign a jar file with the javakey tool, you need to have a public/private key pair in javakey's database. The javakey tool will look for the database at the location specified by the <CODE>identity.database</CODE> property in the security properties file, <CODE>java.security</CODE>, located in the <b>MRJ Libraries:lib:security</b> folder in the <b>Extensions</b> folder. By default, the database is a file called "identitydb.obj" and is located in the <b>Preferences</b> folder. The database typically holdskey pairs for many different potential signers, each key pair being associated with the username of a signer. In addition to key pairs, javakey's database contains certificates for the public keys. When a certificate is added to the database, javakey assigns it a unique number for identification purposes.</p><BR><H2><A NAME="sign"></A>How To Sign an Applet with Javakey</H2><P><B>Getting Started</B></p><OL TYPE="1">	<LI><A NAME="jar"></A>Package all your applet-related classes into a JDK 1.1.x-created jar file.

Java enforces these limitations, and others, to protect you from code which may try to read private information, write unwanted information, or perform other unexpected actions. A signed applet includes a certificate that assures you that the applet was created by someone you trust, and has not been altered since they created it. When an applet has been signed, it is no longer subject to restrictions. Applet signing is a very useful technology that facilitates the creation of sophisticated applets, and gives them access to client-side resources while also allowing the end user a decent level of security and assuredness when executing an applet's code.</p><a name="References"></a><H2>References</H2><P><A HREF = "http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/docs/tooldocs/solaris/javakey.html">javakey- The Java Security Tool</A></p><p><A HREF = "http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/jar/sign/signing.html#javakey">SigningJAR Files using javakey</A></p><p><A HREF = "http://www.suitable.com/docs/signing.html">Code Signing for JavaApplets</A></p>           <p><A HREF = "#top">Back to top</a></p><BR><A NAME="Downloads"></A> <h2>Downloadables</h2><center><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH="600"> <TR> <td width=50 align=left>   <P ALIGN=center><img src="images/acrobatsmall.gif" align=middle alt="Acrobat" width=22 height=23></P></TD><td align="left">   <p>Acrobat version of this Note (112K).</P></TD><td width=60 align=left>   <p><A HREF="pdf/tn1175.pdf">Download</A></P></TD>  </TR> </table></center>  <BR><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><!-- end_content --><!-- begin_footer_information -->	<table width="680" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
