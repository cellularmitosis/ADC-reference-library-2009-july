JSaver v1.0-----------JSaver is a sample screen saver for Berkeley Systems After Dark.It uses MRJ (Mac OS Runtime for Javaª) to display java applets fromthe web or local disk.You need MRJ to run JSaver: http://applejava.apple.com/JSaver uses the JManager interface to instantiate a Java runtimeand display an applet.  The interesting code that does this workis in JSaver.cp.  Also of note is the CFMModuleLoader.¹ project,which illustrates how to execute a fat CFM code resource from classic68k code resources.Steve ZellersJava Runtimes06/05/97
