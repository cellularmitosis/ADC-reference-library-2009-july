/*	File:		SndForEver.cp	Contains:	This application demonstrates how to play a snd which has a loop in it.				The resource which I am using for the 'snd ' is 128 and this resource has been 				pre-parsed. I took out some of it so that I would be able to make the code for playing 				the sound easier to follow.  The part of the header which I have taken out is the 				format				# of Synths				Synth resource ID				Init option				# of commands				the command				its params				The original un-cut resource is in resource 100.				To use the snippet, just double click on it and when you are sick of listening to it, 				just click the mouse button.  	Written by: 		Copyright:	Copyright © 1984-1999 by Apple Computer, Inc., All Rights Reserved.				You may incorporate this Apple sample source code into your program(s) without				restriction.
