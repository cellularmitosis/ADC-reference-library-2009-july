Open Transport Ping Sample1.0b1This sample is a quick demonstration of how to implement ping on top of the Open Transport native APIs.Implementation DetailsThe code is actually very easy.  The big simplifying assumption, is that everything is run in synchronous mode.  The only remaining problem iscalculating the checksum on outgoing ping packets (see ChecksumBuffer).The code was written with CodeWarrior 9 and tested on multiple machines running a variety of versions of Open Transport.CreditsShare and EnjoyQuinn "The Eskimo!"Apple Developer Technical Support ¥ Networking, Communications, Hardware27 June 1996
