Safe(3pm)                             Perl Programmers Reference Guide                             Safe(3pm)



<b>NAME</b>
       Safe - Compile and execute code in restricted compartments

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
         use Safe;

         $compartment = new Safe;

         $compartment-&gt;permit(qw(time sort :browse));

         $result = $compartment-&gt;reval($unsafe_code);

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The Safe extension module allows the creation of compartments in which perl code can be evaluated.
       Each compartment has

       a new namespace
               The "root" of the namespace (i.e. "main::") is changed to a different package and code evalu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ated&nbsp;evaluated</font>
               ated in the compartment cannot refer to variables outside this namespace, even with run-time
               glob lookups and other tricks.

               Code which is compiled outside the compartment can choose to place variables into (or <u>share</u>
               variables with) the compartment's namespace and only that data will be visible to code evalu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ated&nbsp;evaluated</font>
               ated in the compartment.

               By default, the only variables shared with compartments are the "underscore" variables $_ and
               @_ (and, technically, the less frequently used %_, the _ filehandle and so on). This is
               because otherwise perl operators which default to $_ will not work and neither will the
               assignment of arguments to @_ on subroutine entry.

       an operator mask
               Each compartment has an associated "operator mask". Recall that perl code is compiled into an
               internal format before execution.  Evaluating perl code (e.g. via "eval" or "do 'file'")
               causes the code to be compiled into an internal format and then, provided there was no error
               in the compilation, executed.  Code evaluated in a compartment compiles subject to the com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">partment's&nbsp;compartment's</font>
               partment's operator mask. Attempting to evaluate code in a compartment which contains a
               masked operator will cause the compilation to fail with an error. The code will not be exe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cuted.&nbsp;executed.</font>
               cuted.

               The default operator mask for a newly created compartment is the ':default' optag.

               It is important that you read the <a href="Opcode.3pm.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/Opcode"><u>Opcode</u>(3)</a> module documentation for more information, espe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cially&nbsp;especially</font>
               cially for detailed definitions of opnames, optags and opsets.

               Since it is only at the compilation stage that the operator mask applies, controlled access
               to potentially unsafe operations can be achieved by having a handle to a wrapper subroutine
               (written outside the compartment) placed into the compartment. For example,

                   $cpt = new Safe;
                   sub wrapper {
                       # vet arguments and perform potentially unsafe operations
                   }
                   $cpt-&gt;share('&amp;wrapper');

       <b>RECENT</b> <b>CHANGES</b>

       The interface to the Safe module has changed quite dramatically since version 1 (as supplied with
       Perl5.002). Study these pages carefully if you have code written to use Safe version 1 because you
       will need to makes changes.

       <b>Methods</b> <b>in</b> <b>class</b> <b>Safe</b>

       To create a new compartment, use

           $cpt = new Safe;

       Optional argument is (NAMESPACE), where NAMESPACE is the root namespace to use for the compartment
       (defaults to "Safe::Root0", incremented for each new compartment).

       Note that version 1.00 of the Safe module supported a second optional parameter, MASK.  That func-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tionality&nbsp;functionality</font>
       tionality has been withdrawn pending deeper consideration. Use the permit and deny methods described
       below.

       The following methods can then be used on the compartment object returned by the above constructor.
       The object argument is implicit in each case.

       permit (OP, ...)
               Permit the listed operators to be used when compiling code in the compartment (in <u>addition</u> to
               any operators already permitted).

               You can list opcodes by names, or use a tag name; see "Predefined Opcode Tags" in Opcode.

       permit_only (OP, ...)
               Permit <u>only</u> the listed operators to be used when compiling code in the compartment (<u>no</u> other
               operators are permitted).

       deny (OP, ...)
               Deny the listed operators from being used when compiling code in the compartment (other oper-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ators&nbsp;operators</font>
               ators may still be permitted).

       deny_only (OP, ...)
               Deny <u>only</u> the listed operators from being used when compiling code in the compartment (<u>all</u>
               other operators will be permitted).

       trap (OP, ...)
       untrap (OP, ...)
               The trap and untrap methods are synonyms for deny and permit respectfully.

       share (NAME, ...)
               This shares the <!-- a -->variable(s)<!-- /a --> in the argument list with the compartment.  This is almost iden-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tical&nbsp;identical</font>
               tical to exporting variables using the Exporter module.

               Each NAME must be the <b>name</b> of a non-lexical variable, typically with the leading type identi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fier&nbsp;identifier</font>
               fier included. A bareword is treated as a function name.

               Examples of legal names are '$foo' for a scalar, '@foo' for an array, '%foo' for a hash,
               '&amp;foo' or 'foo' for a subroutine and '*foo' for a glob (i.e.  all symbol table entries asso-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ciated&nbsp;associated</font>
               ciated with "foo", including scalar, array, hash, sub and filehandle).

               Each NAME is assumed to be in the calling package. See share_from for an alternative method
               (which share uses).

       share_from (PACKAGE, ARRAYREF)
               This method is similar to <u>share()</u> but allows you to explicitly name the package that symbols
               should be shared from. The symbol names (including type characters) are supplied as an array
               reference.

                   $safe-&gt;share_from('main', [ '$foo', '%bar', 'func' ]);

       varglob (VARNAME)
               This returns a glob reference for the symbol table entry of VARNAME in the package of the
               compartment. VARNAME must be the <b>name</b> of a variable without any leading type marker. For
               example,

                   $cpt = new Safe 'Root';
                   $Root::foo = "Hello world";
                   # Equivalent version which doesn't need to know $cpt's package name:
                   ${$cpt-&gt;varglob('foo')} = "Hello world";

       reval (STRING)
               This evaluates STRING as perl code inside the compartment.

               The code can only see the compartment's namespace (as returned by the <b>root</b> method). The com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">partment's&nbsp;compartment's</font>
               partment's root package appears to be the "main::" package to the code inside the compart-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment.&nbsp;compartment.</font>
               ment.

               Any attempt by the code in STRING to use an operator which is not permitted by the compart-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment&nbsp;compartment</font>
               ment will cause an error (at run-time of the main program but at compile-time for the code in
               STRING).  The error is of the form "'%s' trapped by operation mask...".

               If an operation is trapped in this way, then the code in STRING will not be executed. If such
               a trapped operation occurs or any other compile-time or return error, then $@ is set to the
               error message, just as with an <u>eval()</u>.

               If there is no error, then the method returns the value of the last expression evaluated, or
               a return statement may be used, just as with subroutines and <u></u><b><u>e</u></b><u></u><b><u>a</u></b><u></u><b><u>(</u></b>. The context (list or
               scalar) is determined by the caller as usual.

               This behaviour differs from the beta distribution of the Safe extension where earlier ver-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sions&nbsp;versions</font>
               sions of perl made it hard to mimic the return behaviour of the <u>eval()</u> command and the con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">text&nbsp;context</font>
               text was always scalar.

               Some points to note:

               If the entereval op is permitted then the code can use eval "..." to 'hide' code which might
               use denied ops. This is not a major problem since when the code tries to execute the eval it
               will fail because the opmask is still in effect. However this technique would allow clever,
               and possibly harmful, code to 'probe' the boundaries of what is possible.

               Any string eval which is executed by code executing in a compartment, or by code called from
               code executing in a compartment, will be eval'd in the namespace of the compartment. This is
               potentially a serious problem.

               Consider a function <u>foo()</u> in package pkg compiled outside a compartment but shared with it.
               Assume the compartment has a root package called 'Root'. If <u>foo()</u> contains an eval statement
               like eval '$foo = 1' then, normally, $pkg::foo will be set to 1.  If <u>foo()</u> is called from the
               compartment (by whatever means) then instead of setting $pkg::foo, the eval will actually set
               $Root::pkg::foo.

               This can easily be demonstrated by using a module, such as the Socket module, which uses eval
               "..." as part of an AUTOLOAD function. You can 'use' the module outside the compartment and
               share an (autoloaded) function with the compartment. If an autoload is triggered by code in
               the compartment, or by any code anywhere that is called by any means from the compartment,
               then the eval in the Socket module's AUTOLOAD function happens in the namespace of the com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">partment.&nbsp;compartment.</font>
               partment. Any variables created or used by the eval'd code are now under the control of the
               code in the compartment.

               A similar effect applies to <u>all</u> runtime symbol lookups in code called from a compartment but
               not compiled within it.

       rdo (FILENAME)
               This evaluates the contents of file FILENAME inside the compartment.  See above documentation
               on the <b>reval</b> method for further details.

       root (NAMESPACE)
               This method returns the name of the package that is the root of the compartment's namespace.

               Note that this behaviour differs from version 1.00 of the Safe module where the root module
               could be used to change the namespace. That functionality has been withdrawn pending deeper
               consideration.

       mask (MASK)
               This is a get-or-set method for the compartment's operator mask.

               With no MASK argument present, it returns the current operator mask of the compartment.

               With the MASK argument present, it sets the operator mask for the compartment (equivalent to
               calling the deny_only method).

       <b>Some</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Issues</b>

       This section is currently just an outline of some of the things code in a compartment might do
       (intentionally or unintentionally) which can have an effect outside the compartment.

       Memory  Consuming all (or nearly all) available memory.

       CPU     Causing infinite loops etc.

       Snooping
               Copying private information out of your system. Even something as simple as your user name is
               of value to others. Much useful information could be gleaned from your environment variables
               for example.

       Signals Causing signals (especially SIGFPE and SIGALARM) to affect your process.

               Setting up a signal handler will need to be carefully considered and controlled.  What mask
               is in effect when a signal handler gets called?  If a user can get an imported function to
               get an exception and call the user's signal handler, does that user's restricted mask get re-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">instated&nbsp;reinstated</font>
               instated before the handler is called?  Does an imported handler get called with its original
               mask or the user's one?

       State Changes
               Ops such as chdir obviously effect the process as a whole and not just the code in the com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">partment.&nbsp;compartment.</font>
               partment. Ops such as rand and srand have a similar but more subtle effect.
