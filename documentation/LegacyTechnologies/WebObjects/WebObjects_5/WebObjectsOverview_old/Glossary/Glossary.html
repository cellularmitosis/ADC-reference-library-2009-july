process (or a part of one) that connects WebObjects applications
to an HTTP server.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><b>application object</b></dt>
<dd>An object (of the WOApplication class) that
represents a single instance of a WebObjects application. The application
object's main role is to coordinate the handling of HTTP requests,
but it can also maintain application-wide state information.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><b>attribute</b></dt>
<dd>In Entity-Relationship modeling, an identifiable
characteristic of an entity. For example, lastName can be an attribute
of an Employee entity. An attribute typically corresponds to a column
in a database table. See also <b>entity</b>; <b>relationship</b>.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><b>business logic</b></dt>
<dd>The rules associated with the data in a database
that typically encode business policies. An example is automatically
adding late fees for overdue items.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><b>CGI</b></dt>
<dd>A standard for interfacing external applications
with information servers, such as HTTP or Web servers. Short for
Common Gateway Interface.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><b>class</b></dt>
<dd>In object-oriented languages such as Java, a
prototype for a particular kind of object. A class definition declares
instance variables and defines methods for all members of the class. Objects
that have the same types of instance variables and have access to
the same methods belong to the same class.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><b>column</b></dt>
<dd>In a relational database, the dimension of
a table that holds values for a particular attribute. For example,
a table that contains employee records might have a column titled "LAST_NAME"
that contains the values for each employee's last name. See also <b>attribute</b>.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><b>component</b></dt>
<dd>An object (of the WOComponent class) that represents
a web page or a reusable portion of one. </dd></dl>
<dl><dt><b>database server</b></dt>

servers typically run on a dedicated computer and are accessed by
client applications over a network.</dd></dl>

<dd>A WebObjects development approach that can
generate a Java Client application from a model.</dd></dl>

that can generate a web page for a particular task (for example,
a list page) for any entity.</dd></dl>

includes a list of dynamic elements with which you can build your
component.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><b>enterprise object</b></dt>
<dd>A Java object that conforms to the key-value

methods for operating on that data. See also <b>key-value
coding</b>; <b>property</b>.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><b>entity</b></dt>
<dd>In Entity-Relationship modeling, a distinguishable
object about which data is kept. For example, you can have an Employee
entity with attributes such as lastName, firstName, address, and
so on. An entity typically corresponds to a table in a relational
database; an entity's attributes, in turn, correspond to a table's
columns. See also <b>attribute</b>; <b>table</b>.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><b>Entity-Relationship modeling</b></dt>
<dd>A Discipline for examining and representing
the components and interrelationships in a database system. Also known
as E-R modeling, this discipline factors a database system into
entities, attributes, and relationships.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><b>EOModeler</b></dt>
<dd>A tool used to create and edit models.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><b>faulting</b></dt>
<dd>A mechanism used by WebObjects to increase
performance whereby destination objects of relationships are not
fetched until they are explicitly accessed.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><b>fetch</b></dt>
<dd>In Enterprise Objects Framework applications,
to retrieve data from the database server into the client application,
usually into enterprise objects.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><b>foreign key</b></dt>
<dd>An attribute in an entity that gives it access
to rows in another entity. This attribute must be the primary key
of the related entity. For example, an Employee entity can contain
the foreign key deptID, which matches the primary key in the entity
Department. You can then use deptID as the source attribute in Employee
and as the destination attribute in Department to form a relationship
between the entities. See also <b>primary key</b>; <b>relationship</b>.</dd></dl>

<dd>A tool used to create and edit graphical user
interfaces like those used in Java Client applications.</dd></dl>

you to create graphical user interface applications that run on
the user's computer and communicate with a WebObjects server.</dd></dl>

enterprise objects to be accessed by name (that is, as key-value
pairs) by other parts of the application.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><b>locking</b></dt>
<dd>A mechanism to ensure that data isn't modified
by more than one user at a time and that data isn't read as it
is being modified.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><b>look</b></dt>
<dd>In Direct to Web applications, one of three user
interface styles. The looks differ in both layout and appearance.</dd></dl>

in Entity-Relationship terms, the mapping between enterprise object
classes and the database schema. This definition is typically stored
in a file created with the EOModeler application. A model also includes
the information needed to connect to a particular database server.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><b>Model-View-Controller </b></dt>
<dd>An object-oriented programming paradigm in
which the functions of an application are separated into the special knowledge
(Model objects), user interface elements (View objects), and the
interface that connects them (the Controller object).</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><b>object</b></dt>
<dd>A programming unit that groups together a data

can use or affect that data. Objects are the principal building blocks
of object-oriented programs.</dd></dl>

rows of that entity. For example, the Employee entity can contain
an EmpID attribute that uniquely identifies each employee.</dd></dl>

<dd>A tool used to manage the development of a
WebObjects application or framework.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><b>property</b></dt>
<dd>In Entity-Relationship modeling, an attribute
or relationship. See also <b>attribute</b>; <b>relationship</b>.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><b>record</b></dt>
<dd>The set of values that describes a single instance
of an entity; in a relational database, a record is equivalent to
a row.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><b>referential integrity</b></dt>
<dd>The rules governing the consistency of relationships.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><b>relational database</b></dt>
<dd>A database designed according to the relational
model, which uses the discipline of Entity-Relationship modeling
and the data design standards called normal forms.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><b>relationship</b></dt>
<dd>A link between two entities that's based
on attributes of the entities. For example, the Department and Employee
entities can have a relationship based on the deptID attribute as
a foreign key in Employee, and as the primary key in Department
(note that although the join attribute deptID is the same for the
source and destination entities in this example, it doesn't have
to be). This relationship would make it possible to find the employees
for a given department. See also <b>to-one</b>; <b>to-many</b>; <b>many-to-many</b>; <b>primary
key</b>; <b>foreign key</b>.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><b>reusable component</b></dt>

(typically a browser). Also an object (of the WOSession class) representing
a session.</dd></dl>

HTML that specifies the overall appearance of a web page generated
from the component.</dd></dl>
