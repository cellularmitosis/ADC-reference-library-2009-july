<TITLE>Setting the Style Preference</TITLE>
<H1><A NAME="REF53053">Setting the Style Preference</A></H1>
<P>WebScript has two different accepted syntax styles. One style is similar to Objective-C. The other style is similar to Java. The default is the Objective-C style syntax, and that is the style WebObjects Builder uses when you create a new method. 
<P>To have WebObjects Builder use Java-style syntax, bring up the Preferences panel, go to the Language tab and choose WebScript - object.method(arg).

<P>After you do this, any method you create look like those shown below. (See "<U><A HREF="../../DevGuide/WebScript/WebScript.mif.book.html">Using WebScript</A></U>" in the <I>WebObjects Developer's Guide</I> for a description of both syntaxes.)
