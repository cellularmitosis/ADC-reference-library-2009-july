Is A10 connected to pin 19 and A11connected to pin 29? Also, can I use either Fast Page Mode or Static Column onSIMMs for the new 72-Pin compatible Macintosh models? Can Macintosh 16 MB or 32MB 72-pin SIMM modules use 4K 4Mx4 refresh DRAM?</p><BR><p>Yes, A10 is connected to pin 19 and A11 is connected to pin 29. Although noneof Apple's current models can make use of SIMMs this large, future machineswill, and the connection of these address lines won't make SIMMs incompatiblewith current machines.</p><p>Fast Page Mode is required of 72-pin SIMMs used in Apple products. You can'tuse Static Column on SIMMs that will be used in Apple Products.</p><p>All 72-pin compatible Macintosh models support 2K refresh parts. Not all modelscan or will support 4K refresh parts. We can't at this time give you a list ofwhich models may support 4K refresh.</p><H2>PowerBook Duo 16MB memory DRAM</h2><p>Date Written:  1/14/93</p><p>Last reviewed:  4/1/93</p><p>Which 16 MB (2M x 8) DRAM is specified for the PowerBook Duo--the 2K refresh(11-row, 10-column addresses) or 4K refresh (12-row, 9-column addresses)?</p><BR><p>The PowerBook Duo supports both 11-row/10-column address <i>and</i>12-row/9-column address RAMs. However, you must use RAM that's compatiblewith the memory controller's refresh rate, which is 1024 refreshes in 128 ms.</p><H2>Use Centris SIMMs that follow Apple design guidelines</h2><P>Date Written:  12/2/92</p><P>Last reviewed:  3/1/93</p><p>We were told that "industry-standard 72-pin SIMMs" work in the Centris systems,but we've tried 512Kx36, 1Mx36, and 2Mx36 industry-standard 72-pin SIMMs, withno luck. All we got were bad memory chimes. Where can I find a table of pinoutsfor Centris SIMMs?</p><BR><p>The pinouts for Centris SIMMs are listed on pages 25-27 of the Developer Note"Macintosh Centris 610, Macintosh Centris 650, and Macintosh Quadra 800Computers" on the latest Developer CD. Use only Apple SIMMs or third-partySIMMs that specifically follow Apple's design guidelines for the MacintoshCentris. "IBM-compatible" 72-pin SIMMs weren't tested for the MacintoshCentris; they may or may not work.</p><h2>256K VRAM but not 512K for Macintosh Quadra SIMMs</h2><P>Date Written:  2/28/92</p><P>Last reviewed:  2/28/92</p><p>Does the Macintosh Quadra support either 256K or 512K VRAM SIMMs, like theMacintosh LC does?</p><BR><p>A full bank of 256K VRAM in the Quadras supports 8-bit video on the 21"monitors, but the video hardware does not support 512K VRAM.</p><H2>Macintosh LC and Quadra VRAM speed requirements </h2><P>Date Written:  2/28/92</p><P>Last reviewed:  2/28/92</p><p>What speed VRAM is required for the Macintosh LC and Quadra SIMMs?</p><BR><p>The VRAM for Macintosh LC and Quadra SIMMs currently is 100 ns.</p><H2>Macintosh LC and Quadra Block-Write VRAM support</h2><P>Date Written:  2/28/92</p><P>Last reviewed:  2/28/92</p><p>Do Macintosh LC and Quadra SIMMs require Block-Write VRAM?</p><BR><p>The SIMMs that Apple uses all support Block-Write VRAM, but the system softwarecurrently does not require Block-Write VRAM. Whether it will in the future isunknown.</p><H2>Try zapping PRAM if Macintosh II won't shut down</h2><P>Date Written:  2/28/92</p><P>Last reviewed:  2/28/92</p><p>My Macintosh IIsi reboots whenever it's shut down, like the power switch is inthe locked position. What could be causing this?</p><BR><p>A DTS engineer here ran into this very same problem with his Macintosh II, andwas able to rectify the problem by zapping the Parameter RAM (PRAM). He'd triedreinstalling the system files as well as a new keyboard, but that didn't solvethe problem. In order to zap the PRAM, hold down Command-Shift-P-R whilestarting up your machine.</p><p>If zapping the PRAM doesn't do the trick, you might consider taking yourmachine to a local service provider (Apple authorized, of course) to see ifthere is a hardware problem/failure with the power switch in the back of theCPU. For more information on service providers, please contact the AppleAssistance Center at (800) 776-2333.</p><H2>Macintosh LC Developer Note VRAM correction</h2><P>Date Written:  9/16/91</p><P>Last reviewed:  6/14/93</p><p>The VRAM memory map information in Table 1-1 on page 10 of the "Macintosh LCDeveloper Note" is incorrect.

On theMacintosh SE/30 and IIci, built-in video takes up 1 MB that was previouslyallocated for an expansion slot. On the Macintosh II, IIx, IIcx and IIfx, avideo card is needed which also takes away 1MB. That means there is 16MB -1MB(I/O) - 1MB (ROM) - 1MB (video on board or on NuBus) =13MB maximum RAM memoryavailable.  On the Macintosh II, the 68851 PMMU chip is needed for VM.</p><p>^ The Macintosh LC uses its own contiguous memory scheme that gives a total of8 MB accessible RAM in 24-bit mode and 10 MB RAM in 32-bit mode.</p><p>^^ The 24-bit memory map on the Macintosh IIsi is the same as for all other MacII systems. It allocates 8 MB for RAM, 1 MB for ROM, 1 MB for I/O and 6 MB forexpansion slots. However, because of the slot table, the on-board video takesup 2 slots rather than 1, which results in 2 MB allocated for on-board video.That means there is 16MB -1MB (I/O) - 1MB (ROM) - 2MB (on-board video) =12 MBmaximum RAM available.</p><p>t - With either a 32-bit software patch (Connectix Mode32) or A/UXreg.. Also,Macintosh II and IIx systems can be upgraded to Macintosh IIfx systems;likewise, Macintosh IIcx systems can be upgraded to Mac IIci systems.</p><p>tt - The Macintosh IIsi has 1 MB soldered on the main logic board (Bank A) and4 SIMMs (Bank B). A maximum of 64MB is addressable in Bank B, which gives atotal of 1+64=65MB RAM.</p><p>~ Under the 32-bit memory map, 1 GB is allocated to RAM, 256 MB to ROM, 256 MBto I/O, and 2.5 GB to NuBus. VM in 32-bit mode only accesses the 1 GB RAM.Again, for the Macintosh SE/30, II, IIx and IIcx, it is necessary to haveeither a 32-bit software patch (Connectix Mode 32) or A/UX. Or, a Macintosh IIor IIx can be upgraded to a Macintosh IIfx; likewise, a Macintosh IIcx can beupgraded to a Macintosh IIci. On the Macintosh II it is also necessary to havethe 68851 PMMU.</p><H2>No 1 MB VRAM SIMM for Macintosh LC</h2><P>Date Written:  3/29/91</p><P>Last reviewed:  5/21/91</p><p>Will there be a 1 MB VRAM SIMM available for the Macintosh LC? In other words,can we get 24-bit video?</p><BR><p>The Macintosh LC video hardware cannot handle 24-bit video. If you put 1 MB VRAM on the board, the upper 512K would be useless.</p><H2>No 32-bit clean Macintosh II ROM upgrade</h2><P>Date Written:  1/22/91</p><P>Last reviewed:  1/30/91</p><p>I have heard that there is a ROM upgrade available for the Macintosh II whichis necessary for it to be fully 32-bit clean or to be compatible with System7.0. Please respond and let us know whether a ROM upgrade is necessary, and ifso how it may be obtained, and if there is any cost for the upgrade.</p><BR><p>We don't have a 32-bit clean ROM upgrade kit for any of our Macintosh systems.All our newer Macintosh systems have 32-bit clean ROMs, but all our computermodels prior to the Macintosh IIci don't. You might be thinking of the PMMUchip upgrade.</p><p>This won't stop you from using System 7, however. It just keeps you from using32-bit addressing. You can still use Virtual Memory if you put a PMMU in yourMacintosh II. Even with a PMMU, however, you won't be able to access more than14 megabytes of RAM (minus 1 megabyte for each NuBus slot you're using). If youdid have 32-bit clean ROMs and used 32-bit addressing, you could address up to128 megabytes of physical RAM, and address over a gigabyte of Virtual Memory!Most people would not need to use even a fraction of that. So even if you didhave 32-bit clean ROMs, it's likely you wouldn't need 32-bit addressing.</p><H2>Macintosh II "32-bit clean" upgrade</h2><P>Date Written:  11/28/90</p><P>Last reviewed:  2/20/91</p><p>I want to upgrade my Macintosh II with new ROMs so that I can be 32-bit cleanand address more than 14 MB of RAM. Will the SuperDrive upgrade with new ROMsprovide the solution I am looking for? If not, then is there any way to be ableto address RAM using 32 bits in the future on a Macintosh II or do I have toupgrade to a Macintosh IIfx? I would prefer to stay with my Macintosh II andwould like an upgrade path of this nature.</p><BR><p>Currently the only way to obtain 32-bit clean ROMs for a Macintosh II is topurchase the Macintosh IIfx logic board upgrade. There are no plans at thistime to provide 32-bit clean ROMs for CPUs prior to the Macintosh IIci thatwould allow the extended 32-bit addressing supported by System 7.0.</p><H2>Macintosh IIci DRAM specifications</h2><P>Date Written:  11/17/89</p><P>Last reviewed:  12/17/90</p><p>What are the required specifications of the Macintosh IIci DRAM?</p><BR><p>Here are the Macintosh IIci memory specifications:</p><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=550><TR>	<td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><pre>    256K (made from 1 MB Fast Page Mode parts), 1 MB, 4 MB, or 16 MB SIMMs    RAS:            80 ns    CAS:            20 ns    Access Type:    Fast Page Mode    Refresh Type:   CAS before RAS    Refresh Period: 15.6 us</pre>	</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><p>The SIMMs can be composed of the following sizes in each bank:</p><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=550><TR>	<td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><pre>    4  256K SIMMs (composed of 1 MB of fast page parts only)    4  1 MB SIMMs    4  4 MB SIMMs</pre>	</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><p>If on-board video is going to be used, RAM must be installed in Bank A, sincethe frame buffer is maintained beginning at physical address $0000 0000.

The layout of thestandard PRAM was detailed, but since then PRAM has changed and extended. PRAMis reserved for the system, and is set by the user via the control panel. Asyou may have noticed, changing the settings of PRAM does not necessarily meanthe system will start using those settings.</p><p>The system examines the contents of PRAM at startup time, and build itslow-memory global information based on it. If you change PRAM during run-time,you would also have to change all of the affected low-memory globals. This isexactly how the Mouse and the rest of the control panel items work. Also, thereis no trap to change the RAM cache setting because it is considered a userfunction. The RAM cache will only go into effect at the next application'slaunch. The only supported documentation regarding the cache is in theMacintosh Technical Note "Caching" and <i>Inside Macintosh.</i></p><p>Parameter RAM is under the control of the user, not the application. We do notcondone, and can't support, applications that attempt to modify the PRAM.</p><p>X-Refs:</p><i>Guide to the Macintosh Family Hardware</i> (Addison-Wesley)<p>"The Operating System Utilities," <i>Inside Macintosh</i> Volume II<BR></p><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><P><A NAME=Downloads></A></P>          <H2>Downloadables</H2>          <TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH="100%">  <TR>   <td width=50 align=left>     <P align=center><img src="images/acrobatsmall.gif" width=22 height=23 align=middle alt="Acrobat gif"></P>   </TD>   <td align="left">     <P>Acrobat version of this Note (52K)</P>   </TD>   <td width=60 align=left>     <P><A HREF="pdf/hw_515.pdf">Download</A></P>   </TD>  </TR></table><BR><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><!-- end_content --><!-- begin_footer_information -->	<table width="680" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
