It is not suitable,however, for use in uncontrolled Internet environments, or for massmarkets. Typically, Java Client applications, when deployed as desktopapplications, are practical only in intranet environments.</p><p>Consider the case of a software company's bug-tracking system.Perhaps the company wants to give premium support customers accessto the system through a Java Client application. These customersare assumed to be knowledgeable users and would have no problemdownloading and installing certain parts of the client application.However, providing the client application as a desktop applicationto a large number of novice end-users would be impractical due tothe support those users would need installing and maintaining acurrent version of the client application</p><p>When deployed as desktop applications, Java Client applicationshave special deployment requirements because part of the applicationruns on the user's machine. Unlike HTML-based applications, it isnot enough to have a browser application to run a Java Client applicationas a desktop application.  You either need to install the client-side applicationon the user's machine, which requires system administration, orthe user needs to download the client-side application.  This makesJava Client applications too complex for the average Internet applicationuser who expects to type a URL in a browser and enter an applicationwithin seconds of hitting the web site.</p><p>However, you can also deploy Java Client applications as appletsthat run in browsers. Deploying as applets alleviates many of theissues encountered when running Java Client applications as desktopapplications since the user doesn't need to download or installthe client application. However, applets introduce other usabilityand deployment issues.</p><p>In WebObjects 5.1, the Java Client Class Loader eases appletdeployment and improves usability. Likewise, future enhancementsto the JDK such as Java Web Start will ease application deploymentand usability by providing caching and other mechanisms to ease client-sideclass management. </p><p>In deciding to use Java Client, you should evaluate the technologywith these criteria in mind: portability, performance, network environment,administration, security, and user experience.</p><ul><li><b>Portability</b> JavaClient applications are 100% Pure Java applications, requiring aJRE 1.3 or higher system. Java Client applications running on MacOS X take advantage of platform-specific interface features suchas the global menu and the dirty window marker.</font></li><li><b>Performance</b> After the initial downloadof Java classes to the client, Java Client applications don'texchange large chunks of data between client and server. Rather, compactbusiness objects are exchanged over the network. Also, the JavaClient architecture separates the user interface layer from thedata exchange layer, so data flows across the network independentof user interface data. This allows Java Client applications toscale well, and a WebObjects application server should scale justas well serving Java Client applications or HTML-based applications.</font></li><li><b>Network environment</b> Java Client applicationscan be deployed across the Internet; they are not inherently constrainedto intranet environments. However, they are not appropriate forhigh-volume, high-visibility applications because of the long initial downloadand other system administration requirements (presence of JRE 1.3or higher).</font></li><li><b>System administration</b> The presenceof JRE 1.3 or higher is not ubiquitous amongst desktop operatingsystems. Mac OS X includes JRE 1.3 out-of-the-box; JRE 1.3 is not availablefor Mac OS 9 or earlier; Sun provides the JRE for all Windows platforms,but it does not ship in the box; JRE 1.3 is available for many UNIXplatforms. So, while the JRE is widely available, it must oftenbe downloaded and installed by the end user. You should evaluateyour target market, keeping in mind that some customers will beput off by the proposition of installing the JRE.</font></li><li><b>Security</b> If you take careful stepsto partition your business logic, Java Client applications offersecurity equal to that of HTML-based applications. By default, Java Clientuses HTTP as the transport protocol between client and server, butit can be replaced with another, more secure protocol such as SSL.</font></li><li><b>Client-side processing</b> Web applicationsdo the majority of their processing on the server, while Java Clientmoves much of an application's processing to the client. This reducesthe amount of client-server communication considerably, making JavaClient applications much snappier than their Web counterparts.</font></li><li><b>User experience</b> These criteria allaffect user experience in some way. If your application demandsa rich user interface, the manipulation of complex data, and long sessions,Java Client is an excellent choice.</font></li></ul><br>    <br><a href="Rapid_Appli_Development.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/previous.gif" border="0"></a><a href="Two_Approac_Java_Client.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/next.gif" border="0"></a>&nbsp;<br><br><p><hr><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">&#169; 2002 Apple Computer, Inc.
