##	Apple Macintosh Developer Technical Support##	CLUTSample##   Loosely based in the sample SAMPLE this program shows#   how to create a window and display on it the colors of the CLUT#	associated with the device the window sits on top of.##	Left to the curious reader are some improvements such as, remembering the#	positions of each open window, so if you use this program to monitor your#	color tables it will position the windows in the last place you opened them.#	The treatment of direct devices is kind of 'casual' a better color display may #	be appropriate. Last, it may be desireable to change the size of the color#	rectangles depending on the depth of the color table.#	Check Sample sources for more detailed documentation.# If ANY changes are made to the include file, you MUST perform# a full build of ALL source files.  The dependencies below will# cause all source file to be assembled if the ASample.inc1.a is updated.AOptions		= -wAObjs			= CLUTSample.a.o 					CLUTSampleMisc.a.o 					"{Libraries}"Runtime.o 					"{Libraries}"Interface.oCLUTSample.a.o		컴 CLUTSample.make CLUTSample.inc1.aCLUTSampleMisc.a.o	컴 CLUTSample.make CLUTSample.inc1.aCLUTSample			컴 {AObjs} CLUTSample.make					Link -o {Targ} {AObjs}					SetFile {Targ} -t APPL -c 'MOOS' -a BCLUTSample			컴 CLUTSample.r CLUTSample.h CLUTSample.make					Rez -rd -o {Targ} CLUTSample.r -append
