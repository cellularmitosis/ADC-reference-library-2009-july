Read Me for LittleArrowsShowcase
--------------------------------
October 12, 2006

The LittleArrows control does not increment or decrement automatically its value when the user clicks on the up or down arrows.The recommended way to deal with the incrementing or decrementing is to install a ControlAction on the control.This sample code shows how to proceed when the control is instantiated from a nib or instantiated programmatically.
