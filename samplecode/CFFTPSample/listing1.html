/* When using file streams, the 32KB buffer is probably not enough.
A good way to establish a buffer size is to increase it over time.
If every read consumes the entire buffer, start increasing the buffer
size, and at some point you would then cap it. 32KB is fine for network
sockets, although using the technique described above is still a good idea.
This sample avoids the technique because of the added complexity it
would introduce. */
