Firstly, the test application uses it// as its creator code.  Secondly, MOSLStringCompare uses it (in the non-Carbon// implementation) as the class ID of events that it sends to the comparison// script.  The second use is hardwired to 'MOSL' (because the script// is compiled that way).  The first use you can change by changing the// constant below.#define kMyCreator 			'MOSL'#define kMyAESuite			kMyCreator// application properties#define pMyDebug			'MDBG'#define pMyNextUniqueID     'MNUI'#define pMyFileValid		'MFLV'	// All of these properties have explanator comments in	// the file "TestMoreOSLTerminology.r".		// custom classes#define cNodeWindow				'NWIN'#define cAboutWindow			'AWIN'	// Both of these are subclasses of window.	#define cNode					'CNDE'	// Elements of a node window.// properties of cDocument#define pMyNodeDisplay			'NDSP'#define pMyLocationOnDisk		'MLOC'// properties of cAboutWindow#define pMyCredits				'CRÉD'
