rsyncd.conf(5)                                                                                rsyncd.conf(5)



<b>NAME</b>
       rsyncd.conf - configuration file for rsync server

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       rsyncd.conf


<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The rsyncd.conf file is the runtime configuration file for rsync when run as an rsync server.

       The rsyncd.conf file controls authentication, access, logging and available modules.


<b>FILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b>
       The  file  consists  of modules and parameters. A module begins with the name of the module in square
       brackets and continues until the next module begins. Modules contain parameters of the form  'name  =
       value'.

       The  file is line-based - that is, each newline-terminated line represents either a comment, a module
       name or a parameter.

       Only the first equals sign in a parameter is significant. Whitespace before or after the first equals
       sign is discarded. Leading, trailing and internal whitespace in module and parameter names is irrele-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">vant.&nbsp;irrelevant.</font>
       vant. Leading and trailing whitespace in a parameter value is discarded. Internal whitespace within a
       parameter value is retained verbatim.

       Any line beginning with a hash (#) is ignored, as are lines containing only whitespace.

       Any line ending in a \ is "continued" on the next line in the customary UNIX fashion.

       The  values  following  the equals sign in parameters are all either a string (no quotes needed) or a
       boolean, which may be given as yes/no, 0/1 or true/false. Case is not significant in boolean  values,
       but is preserved in string values.


<b>LAUNCHING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>RSYNC</b> <b>DAEMON</b>
       The rsync daemon is launched by specifying the --daemon option to rsync.

       The  daemon must run with root privileges if you wish to use chroot, to bind to a port numbered under
       1024 (as is the default 873), or to set file ownership.  Otherwise, it must just have  permission  to
       read and write the appropriate data, log, and lock files.

       You  can  launch  it  either via inetd, as a stand-alone daemon, or from an rsync client via a remote
       shell.  If run as a stand-alone daemon then just run the command "rsync  --daemon"  from  a  suitable
       startup  script.   If  run from an rsync client via a remote shell (by specifying both the "-e/--rsh"
       option and server mode with "::" or "rsync://"), the --daemon option is automatically passed  to  the
       remote side.

       When run via inetd you should add a line like this to /etc/services:

              rsync           873/tcp

       and a single line something like this to /etc/inetd.conf:

              rsync   stream  tcp     nowait  root   /usr/bin/rsync rsyncd --daemon

       Replace  "/usr/bin/rsync"  with  the path to where you have rsync installed on your system.  You will
       then need to send inetd a HUP signal to tell it to reread its config file.

       Note that you should not send the rsync server a HUP signal to force it  to  reread  the  rsyncd.conf
       file. The file is re-read on each client connection.


<b>GLOBAL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       The first parameters in the file (before a [module] header) are the global parameters.

       You  may  also  include any module parameters in the global part of the config file in which case the
       supplied value will override the default for that parameter.


       <b>motd</b> <b>file</b>
              The "motd file" option allows you to specify a "message of the day" to display to  clients  on
              each  connect. This usually contains site information and any legal notices. The default is no
              motd file.


       <b>log</b> <b>file</b>
              The "log file" option tells the rsync daemon to log messages to that file  rather  than  using
              syslog.  This  is particularly useful on systems (such as AIX) where syslog() doesn't work for
              chrooted programs.


       <b>pid</b> <b>file</b>
              The "pid file" option tells the rsync daemon to write its process ID to that file.


       <b>syslog</b> <b>facility</b>
              The "syslog facility" option allows you to specify the syslog facility name to use  when  log-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ging&nbsp;logging</font>
              ging  messages  from  the rsync server. You may use any standard syslog facility name which is
              defined on your system. Common names are auth, authpriv, cron, daemon, ftp, kern,  lpr,  mail,
              news, security, syslog, user, uucp, local0, local1, local2, local3, local4, local5, local6 and
              local7. The default is daemon.


       <b>socket</b> <b>options</b>
              This option can provide endless fun for people who like to tune their systems  to  the  utmost
              degree.  You can set all sorts of socket options which may make transfers faster (or slower!).
              Read the man page for the setsockopt() system call for details on some of the options you  may
              be able to set. By default no special socket options are set.



<b>MODULE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       After  the global options you should define a number of modules, each module exports a directory tree
       as a symbolic name. Modules are exported by specifying a module name in square brackets [module] fol-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lowed&nbsp;followed</font>
       lowed by the options for that module.



       <b>comment</b>
              The  "comment" option specifies a description string that is displayed next to the module name
              when clients obtain a list of available modules. The default is no comment.


       <b>path</b>   The "path" option specifies the directory in the servers filesystem to make available in  this
              module.  You must specify this option for each module in rsyncd.conf.


       <b>use</b> <b>chroot</b>
              If  "use  chroot" is true, the rsync server will chroot to the "path" before starting the file
              transfer with the client.  This has the advantage of extra protection against possible  imple-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mentation&nbsp;implementation</font>
              mentation  security holes, but it has the disadvantages of requiring super-user privileges, of
              not being able to follow symbolic links that are either absolute or outside of  the  new  root
              path,  and  of  complicating  the preservation of usernames and groups (see below).  When "use
              chroot" is false, for security reasons, symlinks may only be relative paths pointing to  other
              files  within the root path, and leading slashes are removed from most absolute paths (options
              such as --backup-dir, --compare-dest, etc. interpret an absolute path as rooted  in  the  mod-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ule's&nbsp;module's</font>
              ule's "path" dir, just as if chroot was specified).  The default for "use chroot" is true.

              In  order  to  preserve  usernames  and groupnames, rsync needs to be able to use the standard
              library functions for looking up names and IDs (i.e.  getpwuid(), getgrgid(), getpwname(), and
              getgrnam()).   This  means  a  process in the chroot namespace will need to have access to the
              resources used by these library functions  (traditionally  /etc/passwd  and  /etc/group).   If
              these  resources  are  not  available, rsync will only be able to copy the IDs, just as if the
              --numeric-ids option had been specified.

              Note that you are free to setup user/group information in the  chroot  area  differently  from
              your  normal  system.   For example, you could abbreviate the list of users and groups.  Also,
              you can protect this information from being downloaded/uploaded by adding an exclude  rule  to
              the  rsync.conf  file (e.g. "exclude = /etc/").  Note that having the exclusion affect uploads
              is a relatively new feature in rsync, so make sure your server is running at  least  2.6.3  to
              effect this.


       <b>max</b> <b>connections</b>
              The  "max connections" option allows you to specify the maximum number of simultaneous connec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tions&nbsp;connections</font>
              tions you will allow.  Any clients connecting when the maximum has been reached will receive a
              message telling them to try later.  The default is 0 which means no limit.  See also the "lock
              file" option.


       <b>lock</b> <b>file</b>
              The "lock file" option specifies the file to use to support the "max connections" option.  The
              rsync  server uses record locking on this file to ensure that the max connections limit is not
              exceeded for the modules sharing the lock file.  The default is /var/run/rsyncd.lock.


       <b>read</b> <b>only</b>
              The "read only" option determines whether clients will be able to  upload  files  or  not.  If
              "read only" is true then any attempted uploads will fail. If "read only" is false then uploads
              will be possible if file permissions on the server allow them. The default is for all  modules
              to be read only.


       <b>write</b> <b>only</b>
              The  "write  only" option determines whether clients will be able to download files or not. If
              "write only" is true then any attempted downloads will fail. If "write  only"  is  false  then
              downloads  will  be possible if file permissions on the server allow them.  The default is for
              this option to be disabled.


       <b>list</b>   The "list" option determines if this module should be listed when the client asks for a  list-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;listing</font>
              ing  of available modules. By setting this to false you can create hidden modules. The default
              is for modules to be listable.


       <b>uid</b>    The "uid" option specifies the user name or user ID that file transfers to and from that  mod-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ule&nbsp;module</font>
              ule should take place as when the daemon was run as root. In combination with the "gid" option
              this determines what file permissions are available. The default is uid -2, which is  normally
              the user "nobody".


       <b>gid</b>    The  "gid"  option  specifies  the group name or group ID that file transfers to and from that
              module should take place as when the daemon was  run  as  root.  This  complements  the  "uid"
              option. The default is gid -2, which is normally the group "nobody".


       <b>exclude</b>
              The  "exclude" option allows you to specify a space-separated list of patterns that the server
              will not allow to be read or written.  This is only superficially  equivalent  to  the  client
              specifying  these patterns with the --exclude option.  Only one "exclude" option may be speci-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fied,&nbsp;specified,</font>
              fied, but you can use "-" and "+" before patterns to specify exclude/include.

              Because this exclude list is not passed to the client it only applies on the server: that  is,
              it  excludes  files  received  by a client when receiving from a server and files deleted on a
              server when sending to a server, but it doesn't exclude files from being deleted on  a  client
              when receiving from a server.


       <b>exclude</b> <b>from</b>
              The  "exclude  from" option specifies a filename on the server that contains exclude patterns,
              one per line.  This is only superficially equivalent to the client specifying  the  --exclude-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">from&nbsp;--excludefrom</font>
              from option with an equivalent file.  See the "exclude" option above.


       <b>include</b>
              The  "include"  option  allows  you  to specify a space-separated list of patterns which rsync
              should not exclude. This is only superficially equivalent to the client specifying these  pat-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">terns&nbsp;patterns</font>
              terns  with  the --include option because it applies only on the server.  This is useful as it
              allows you to build up quite complex exclude/include rules.  Only one "include" option may  be
              specified,  but  you  can  use "+" and "-" before patterns to switch include/exclude.  See the
              "exclude" option above.


       <b>include</b> <b>from</b>
              The "include from" option specifies a filename on the server that contains  include  patterns,
              one  per  line.  This is only superficially equivalent to the client specifying the --include-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">from&nbsp;--includefrom</font>
              from option with a equivalent file.  See the "exclude" option above.


       <b>auth</b> <b>users</b>
              The "auth users" option specifies a comma and space-separated list of usernames that  will  be
              allowed to connect to this module. The usernames do not need to exist on the local system. The
              usernames may also contain shell wildcard characters. If "auth users" is set then  the  client
              will  be  challenged  to  supply a username and password to connect to the module. A challenge
              response authentication protocol is used for this exchange. The plain text usernames are pass-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">words&nbsp;passwords</font>
              words  are  stored  in the file specified by the "secrets file" option. The default is for all
              users to be able to connect without a password (this is called "anonymous rsync").

              See also the <b>CONNECTING</b> <b>TO</b> <b>AN</b> <b>RSYNC</b> <b>SERVER</b> <b>OVER</b> <b>A</b> <b>REMOTE</b> <b>SHELL</b> <b>PROGRAM</b> section in <a href="../man1/rsync.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/rsync">rsync(1)</a> for
              information  on  how  handle an rsyncd.conf-level username that differs from the remote-shell-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">level&nbsp;remote-shelllevel</font>
              level username when using a remote shell to connect to an rsync server.


       <b>secrets</b> <b>file</b>
              The "secrets file" option specifies the name of a file  that  contains  the  username:password
              pairs  used  for  authenticating  this module. This file is only consulted if the "auth users"
              option is specified. The file is line based and contains username:password pairs separated  by
              a  single colon. Any line starting with a hash (#) is considered a comment and is skipped. The
              passwords can contain any characters but be warned  that  many  operating  systems  limit  the
              length of passwords that can be typed at the client end, so you may find that passwords longer
              than 8 characters don't work.

              There is no default  for  the  "secrets  file"  option,  you  must  choose  a  name  (such  as
              /etc/rsyncd.secrets).   The file must normally not be readable by "other"; see "strict modes".


       <b>strict</b> <b>modes</b>
              The "strict modes" option determines whether or not the permissions on the secrets  file  will
              be checked.  If "strict modes" is true, then the secrets file must not be readable by any user
              ID other than the one that the rsync daemon is running under.  If "strict modes" is false, the
              check is not performed.  The default is true.  This option was added to accommodate rsync run-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ning&nbsp;running</font>
              ning on the Windows operating system.


       <b>hosts</b> <b>allow</b>
              The "hosts allow" option allows you to specify a list of patterns that are matched  against  a
              connecting  clients hostname and IP address. If none of the patterns match then the connection
              is rejected.

              Each pattern can be in one of five forms:


       o      a dotted decimal  IPv4  address  of  the  form  a.b.c.d,  or  an  IPv6  address  of  the  form
              a:b:c::d:e:f. In this case the incoming machine's IP address must match exactly.


       o      an address/mask in the form ipaddr/n where ipaddr is the IP address and n is the number of one
              bits in the netmask.  All IP addresses which match the masked IP address will be allowed in.


       o      an address/mask in the form ipaddr/maskaddr where ipaddr is the IP address and maskaddr is the
              netmask  in  dotted decimal notation for IPv4, or similar for IPv6, e.g. ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff::
              instead of /64. All IP addresses which match the masked IP address will be allowed in.


       o      a hostname. The hostname as determined by a reverse lookup will be matched (case  insensitive)
              against the pattern. Only an exact match is allowed in.


       o      a  hostname  pattern  using  wildcards.  These are matched using the same rules as normal unix
              filename matching. If the pattern matches then the client is allowed in.

              Note IPv6 link-local addresses can have a scope in the address specification:

              fe80::1%link1
              fe80::%link1/64
              fe80::%link1/ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff::

              You can also combine "hosts allow" with a separate "hosts deny" option. If  both  options  are
              specified  then  the  "hosts  allow"  option s checked first and a match results in the client
              being able to connect. The "hosts deny" option is then checked and a match means that the host
              is  rejected. If the host does not match either the "hosts allow" or the "hosts deny" patterns
              then it is allowed to connect.

              The default is no "hosts allow" option, which means all hosts can connect.


       <b>hosts</b> <b>deny</b>
              The "hosts deny" option allows you to specify a list of patterns that are  matched  against  a
              connecting  clients  hostname  and  IP  address. If the pattern matches then the connection is
              rejected. See the "hosts allow" option for more information.

              The default is no "hosts deny" option, which means all hosts can connect.


       <b>ignore</b> <b>errors</b>
              The "ignore errors" option tells rsyncd to ignore I/O  errors  on  the  server  when  deciding
              whether to run the delete phase of the transfer. Normally rsync skips the --delete step if any
              I/O errors have occurred in order to prevent disasterous deletion due to a temporary  resource
              shortage or other I/O error. In some cases this test is counter productive so you can use this
              option to turn off this behaviour.


       <b>ignore</b> <b>nonreadable</b>
              This tells the rsync server to completely ignore files that are not readable by the user. This
              is useful for public archives that may have some non-readable files among the directories, and
              the sysadmin doesn't want those files to be seen at all.


       <b>transfer</b> <b>logging</b>
              The "transfer logging" option enables per-file logging of downloads and uploads  in  a  format
              somewhat similar to that used by ftp daemons. If you want to customize the log formats look at
              the log format option.


       <b>log</b> <b>format</b>
              The "log format" option allows you to specify the format used for logging file transfers  when
              transfer  logging is enabled. The format is a text string containing embedded single character
              escape sequences prefixed with a percent (%) character.

              The prefixes that are understood are:


       o      %h for the remote host name

       o      %a for the remote IP address

       o      %l for the length of the file in bytes

       o      %p for the process ID of this rsync session

       o      %o for the operation, which is either "send" or "recv"

       o      %f for the filename

       o      %P for the module path

       o      %m for the module name

       o      %t for the current date time

       o      %u for the authenticated username (or the null string)

       o      %b for the number of bytes actually transferred

       o      %c when sending files this gives the number of checksum bytes received for this file

              The default log format is "%o %h [%a] %m (%u) %f %l", and a "%t [%p] " is always added to  the
              beginning when using the "log file" option.

              A  perl script called rsyncstats to summarize this format is included in the rsync source code
              distribution.


       <b>timeout</b>
              The "timeout" option allows you to override the clients choice for I/O timeout for  this  mod-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ule.&nbsp;module.</font>
              ule.  Using  this  option  you  can ensure that rsync won't wait on a dead client forever. The
              timeout is specified in seconds. A value of zero means no timeout and is the default.  A  good
              choice for anonymous rsync servers may be 600 (giving a 10 minute timeout).


       <b>refuse</b> <b>options</b>
              The "refuse options" option allows you to specify a space-separated list of rsync command line
              options that will be refused by your rsync server.  You may specify the full option name,  its
              one-letter  abbreviation,  or  a wild-card string that matches multiple options.  For example,
              this would refuse --checksum (-c) and all the options that start with "delete":

              refuse options = c delete*

              When an option is refused, the server prints an error message and exits.  To prevent all  com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pression,&nbsp;compression,</font>
              pression,  you  can use "dont compress = *" (see below) instead of "refuse options = compress"
              to avoid returning an error to a client that requests compression.


       <b>dont</b> <b>compress</b>
              The "dont compress" option allows you to select filenames  based  on  wildcard  patterns  that
              should not be compressed during transfer. Compression is expensive in terms of CPU usage so it
              is usually good to not try to compress files that won't compress well, such  as  already  com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pressed&nbsp;compressed</font>
              pressed files.

              The "dont compress" option takes a space-separated list of case-insensitive wildcard patterns.
              Any source filename matching one of the patterns will not be compressed during transfer.

              The default setting is

              *.gz *.tgz *.zip *.z *.rpm *.deb *.iso *.bz2 *.tbz





<b>AUTHENTICATION</b> <b>STRENGTH</b>
       The authentication protocol used in rsync is a 128 bit MD4 based challenge response system.  Although
       I  believe  that  no  one has ever demonstrated a brute-force break of this sort of system you should
       realize that this is not a "military strength" authentication system.  It should be good  enough  for
       most  purposes  but  if you want really top quality security then I recommend that you run rsync over
       ssh.

       Also note that the rsync server protocol does not currently provide any encryption of the  data  that
       is  transferred over the connection. Only authentication is provided. Use ssh as the transport if you
       want encryption.

       Future versions of rsync may support SSL for better authentication and encryption, but that is  still
       being investigated.


<b>RUNNING</b> <b>AN</b> <b>RSYNC</b> <b>SERVER</b> <b>OVER</b> <b>A</b> <b>REMOTE</b> <b>SHELL</b> <b>PROGRAM</b>
       If  rsync is run with both the --daemon and --rsh (-e) options, it will spawn an rsync daemon using a
       remote shell connection.  Several configuration options will not be available unless the remote  user
       is  root (e.g. chroot, setuid/setgid, etc.).  There is no need to configure inetd or the services map
       to include the rsync server port if you run an rsync server only via a remote shell program.

       ADVANCED: To run an rsync server out of a single-use ssh key, use the "command=<u>COMMAND</u>" syntax in the
       remote user's authorized_keys entry, where command would be

              rsync --server --daemon .

       NOTE:  rsync's  argument parsing expects the trailing ".", so make sure that it's there.  If you want
       to use an rsyncd.conf(5)-style configuration file other than the default, you can  added  a  --config
       option to the <u>command</u>:

              rsync --server --daemon --config=<u>file</u> .

       Note  that  the  "--server"  here is the internal option that rsync uses to run the remote version of
       rsync that it communicates with, and thus you should not be using the --server  option  under  normal
       circumstances.


<b>EXAMPLES</b>
       A simple rsyncd.conf file that allow anonymous rsync to a ftp area at /home/ftp would be:




       [ftp]
               path = /home/ftp
               comment = ftp export area




       A more sophisticated example would be:

       uid = nobody
       gid = nobody
       use chroot = no
       max connections = 4
       syslog facility = local5
       pid file = /var/run/rsyncd.pid



       [ftp]
               path = /var/ftp/pub
               comment = whole ftp area (approx 6.1 GB)

       [sambaftp]
               path = /var/ftp/pub/samba
               comment = Samba ftp area (approx 300 MB)

       [rsyncftp]
               path = /var/ftp/pub/rsync
               comment = rsync ftp area (approx 6 MB)

       [sambawww]
               path = /public_html/samba
               comment = Samba WWW pages (approx 240 MB)

       [cvs]
               path = /data/cvs
               comment = CVS repository (requires authentication)
               auth users = tridge, susan
               secrets file = /etc/rsyncd.secrets




       The /etc/rsyncd.secrets file would look something like this:

       tridge:mypass
       susan:herpass

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
<b>BUGS</b>
       The  rsync server does not send all types of error messages to the client. this means a client may be
       mystified as to why a transfer failed. The error will have been logged by syslog on the server.
