This sample project builds a process management application similar to Activity Monitor using AppleScript Studio.  The Processes Complete Outline document describes in detail how to create this application, including all of the script source necessary.  The Processes Hands-on Outline document covers only the steps that will be completed during the WWDC 2006 Hands-on Session 315, including all of the script source necessary.  The script source for steps 8 and 9 is also provided as text clippings in the Script Text Clippings folder.  Each milestone project is a completed version of that step in the outline, e.g. the Processes Step 2 milestone project is a completed version of Step 2 from the outline.
