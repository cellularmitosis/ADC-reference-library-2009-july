<p>Java Client is a great technology for developing and deploying
desktop applications with powerful database access in controlled
network environments where the end users are known and are willing
to install parts of the client application. It is not ideal, however,
for use in uncontrolled Internet environments or for high-traffic
websites. Typically, Java Client applications, when deployed as
desktop applications, are practical only in intranet environments.</p>
<p>Consider the case of a software company's bug-tracking system.
Perhaps the company wants to give premium support customers access
to the system through a Java Client application. These customers
are assumed to be knowledgeable users and would have no problem
downloading and installing certain parts of the client application.
However, providing the client application as a desktop application
from the company's main website to a large number of novice end
users would be impractical due to the support those users would
need installing and maintaining a current version of the client
application.</p>
<p>When deployed as desktop applications, Java Client applications
have special deployment requirements because part of the application
runs on the user's computer. Unlike HTML-based applications, it
is not enough to have a browser application to run a Java Client
application as a desktop application. You either need to install
the client-side application on user computers, which requires system
administration, or users need to download the client-side application
every time they want to use it. This makes Java Client applications
too complex for the average Internet application user who expects
to type a URL in a browser and enter an application within seconds
of hitting the website.</p>
<p>However, you can also deploy Java Client applications as applets
that run in browsers. Deploying as applets alleviates many of the
issues encountered when running Java Client applications as desktop
applications since users don't need to download or install the client
application. However, applets introduce other usability and deployment
issues. See  <a href="../BasicConcepts/iDeploying_a_AJGEBGD.html" target="_top">"Deploying and Using Java Client Applications"</a> for
a comparison of the two deployment methods.</p>
<p>Starting with WebObjects 5.1, the Java Client Class Loader
eases deployment and improves usability, thereby alleviating many
of the issues regarding application distribution and maintenance.
See  <a href="../BasicTutorial/iMore_About__CIHAEDJ.html" target="_top">"More About The Java Client Class Loader"</a> for
more information. </p>
<p>Likewise, new features of the JDK such as Web Start ease application
deployment and usability by providing caching and other mechanisms
to ease client-side class management.</p>
<p>In deciding to use Java Client, you should evaluate the technology
with these criteria in mind: portability, performance, network environment,
administration, security, and user experience.</p>
<ul><li>Portability.
Java Client applications are 100% Pure Java applications, requiring
a JRE (Java Runtime Environment) 1.3 or later system. Java Client
applications running in Mac OS X take advantage of platform-specific
interface features such as the global menu bar and the dirty window
marker without compromising platform independence.</font></li>
<li>Performance. After the initial download of Java classes to
the client, Java Client applications don't exchange large chunks
of data between client and server. Rather, compact business objects
are exchanged over the network. Also, the Java Client architecture
separates the user interface layer from the data exchange layer,
so data flows across the network independent of user interface data.
For instance, in an HTML-based application, switching panes in a
tab view requires a round trip to the server to fetch more data
or user interface information. However, in Java Client, the client
application usually has no need to contact the server for simple
user interface actions such as this. This allows Java Client applications
to scale well, and a WebObjects application server should scale
just as well serving Java Client applications or HTML-based applications.</font></li>
<li>Network environment. Java Client applications can be deployed
across the Internet; they are not inherently constrained to intranet
environments. However, they are not appropriate for high-volume,
high-visibility websites because of the long initial download and
other system administration requirements (including the presence
of JRE 1.3 or later).</font></li>
<li>System administration. The presence of JRE 1.3 or later is
not ubiquitous amongst desktop operating systems. Mac OS X includes
JRE 1.3 out of the box; JRE 1.3 is not available for Mac OS 9 or
earlier versions; Sun provides the JRE for Windows platforms, but
it does not ship in the box; JRE 1.3 is available for many UNIX
platforms. So, while the JRE is widely available, it must often
be downloaded and installed by the end user. You should evaluate
your target market, keeping in mind that some customers will be
put off by the proposition of installing the JRE.</font></li>
<li>Security. If you take careful steps to partition your business
logic and implement the appropriate security mechanisms (delegates),
Java Client applications offer security equal to that of HTML-based
applications. By default, Java Client uses HTTP as the transport
protocol between client and server, but it can be replaced with
another, more secure protocol such as SSL.</font></li>
<li>Client-side processing. Web applications do the majority of
their processing on the server, while Java Client moves much of
an application's processing to the client. This reduces the amount
of client-server communication considerably, making Java Client applications
much snappier than their Web counterparts.</font></li>
<li>User experience. All the preceding criteria affect user experience
in some way. If your application demands a rich user interface,
the manipulation of complex data, and long sessions, Java Client
is an excellent choice.</font></li></ul>
