This is a simple document based application that demonstrates how to mix QuickDraw and Quartz 2d
(CoreGraphics) drawing into the same window so that it images both on screen and during printing.
One reason why QuickDraw applications might wish to add Quartz content is to import PDF files
as a graphic element. This sample shows how to draw arbitrary Quartz 2d drawing as well as a
given page of a PDF file.
