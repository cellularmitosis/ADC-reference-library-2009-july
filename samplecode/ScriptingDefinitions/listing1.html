This sample contains two scripting definition (sdef) files:

- Sketch.sdef: the scripting interface for Sketch (available separately in
/Developer/Examples/AppKit).  In Tiger, this file may be added to the Sketch
application to drive its scriptability, in place of its existing scriptSuite and
scriptTerminology files.


- Skeleton.sdef: a starting point for the scripting interface of an
application.  It contains definitions for the Standard Suite and the Standard
Text Suite that you can include in your application's .sdef file.  Functionality
for these suites is supplied by Cocoa Scripting.



Use XInclude in Mac OS X 10.5 and later for the Standard Suite

In Mac OS X 10.4 it was common practice to include the complete definition for
the Standard Suite in an application's .sdef file.  In Mac OS X 10.5 a new
mechanism is in place that allows you to include the Standard Suite in your
.sdef using a mechanism similar to the #include preprocessor directive in C:
namely, XInclude.  For backwards compatibility with Mac OS X 10.4, you may
continue to include the complete definitions for the Standard Suite in your
.sdef file, but for Mac OS X 10.5 the XInclude technique described below is
recommended.


When adding scripting to an application, the first step is to add a new .sdef
file that includes the Standard Suite to your Xcode project.  Usually, this file
will have the same name as your application.  For example, if your application
is named 'ScriptingExample', then you would call your .sdef file
'ScriptingExample.sdef'.  When you begin, the contents of that file should be an
empty dictionary that includes the standard AppleScript suite as follows:


&lt;dictionary xmlns:xi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2003/XInclude&quot;&gt;

    &lt;xi:include
href=&quot;file:///System/Library/ScriptingDefinitions/CocoaStandard.sdef&quot;
xpointer=&quot;xpointer(/dictionary/suite)&quot;/&gt;

        &lt;!-- add your own suite definitions here --&gt;

&lt;/dictionary&gt;


The important parts of this definition are as follows:

1. The 'xi' namespace declaration in the opening dictionary element declares
that enclosed elements using the 'xi' namespace will follow conventions defined
by the XInclude standard.  This will allow us to include the standard
definitions.

2. The 'xi:include' element includes the Standard Suite in the .sdef.



The Standard Text Suite

Applications using the Standard Text Suite will have to copy the definition for
the Standard Text Suite into their .sdef file.  At the time of this writing,
this definition is not available on the system in a file that you can reference
using an XInclude.  Most applications will not need to use the Standard Text
Suite unless they support scriptable rich text content and they are using
Cocoa's model for rich text handling.

The following samples have been upgraded to use the XInclude technique for
including the Standard Suite.  Please refer to them for an example of how to use
XInclude.
