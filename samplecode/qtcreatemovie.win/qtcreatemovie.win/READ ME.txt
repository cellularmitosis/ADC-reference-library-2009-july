READMECreateMovie sample version 1.06/22/991. ABOUT CREATEMOVIECreateMovie is a sample application that demonstrates how to use the QuickTime APIs to create a very simple QuickTime movie with both a video track and a sound track.2. SPECIFICSCreateMovie is based largely on the sample code included in Inside Macintosh:QuickTime, starting with pg. 2-45. The user is first asked to specify a location on disk to create the new movie. A new movie is then created using CreateMovieFile function. Next, video & sound tracks are added with NewMovieTrack. Media for the sound & video tracks are added with the NewTrackMedia, BeginMediaEdits, EndMediaEdits sequence of calls. The video track media is created by drawing a string and color background into an offscreen GWorld. The sound track media is copied from a standard macintosh 'snd ' resource included in the application file. Because the code relies on the presence of a 'snd ' resource in the application file, under Windows 95/NT we must use the QuickTime 3.0 RezWack utility to embed the 'snd ' resource into the application file .The code contains rather limited error checking. It's up to you to add the appropriate error-handling routines.3. BUILDING CREATEMOVIEMacintosh   - Included is a Metrowerks project file. The application will run on any system with QuickTime 2.5 or better installed.Windows 95/98/NT   - Included is a Microsoft Visual C++ 4.2 makefile. The application will run on any system with QuickTime 3.0 or better installed. Note - once the program is built using the Microsoft Visual C++ 4.2 build environment, we execute a script to embed the 'snd ' resource into the application executable file (xxx.exe) using the QuickTime 3.0 RezWack utility. 4. USING CREATEMOVIELaunch the application, and at the prompt, specify a location to create the new movie file. A new movie file is created, and the application quits. Open the movie with any Quicktime movie-savvy application such as MoviePlayer.Enjoy,Scott KuechleApple Worldwide Developer Technical Support
