/*	TCP Client/Server Queuing Example	Steve Falkenburg, MacDTS, Apple Computer	3/11/92		this client/server sample uses MacTCP to implement a simple "greeting" server.  the server	opens up several listeners on kGreetingPort (1235).  when a client connects, the data entered	in the greeting dialog is sent to the remote connection, and the connection is closed.		connection management is done through the use of Operating System queues to simplify tracking	and usage.*/#ifndef __PROCESSES__#include <Processes.h>#endifextern	Boolean		gDone;extern	short		gTcpDrvrRef;extern	DialogPtr	gMainDialog;extern	short		gFree,gRunning,gCompleted;extern	long		gServiced;extern 	Boolean		gRunningSeven;extern 	ProcessSerialNumber gOurPSN;extern	Str255		gGreetingData;
