/*    File: debugf.c        Description:        debugf is like printf.  Routines implemented herein provide a subset	of the standard C library's sprintf functionality.  The differences	with this implementation include:		it's small (around 2k once compiled)		it doesn't call any toolbox or os routines.  it's entirely self contained	and does not call any toolbox routines or stdclib routines.  The only call	made outside of this library is the DebugStr call inside of the debugf	routine.	it's safe to call at interrupt time (assuming there's the stack	space to do it).		debugf can be called anywhere it is safe to call DebugStr.    Copyright:        © Copyright 2000 Apple Computer, Inc.
