README - QTStreamMsgThis snippet shows a few ways to work with the messages that are displayedin the controller bar of a streaming movie. For instance, when a connectionis first established to the streaming server, you'll typically see a seriesof messages like "Connecting", "Negotiating", "Buffering", and the like.This sample code illustrates:	(1) how to determine the status message that is about to be displayed	(2) how to substitute your own message for a particular streaming message	(3) how to suppress the streaming messages altogether	(4) how to display a message in the controller bar of a streaming movieYou perform task (4) by calling the QTStreamMsg_IssueMessage defined in the fileQTStreamMsg.c. To perform the others, you need to have a movie controller actionfilter procedure installed by your application. The function QTStreamMsg_ActionFilterProcdefined in QTStreamMsg.c shows how to perform (1), (2), and (3).Enjoy,QuickTime Team
