/*To use this sample, build the target in the <Debug> configuration and set a
  breakpoint at the start of the program.  Build and debug the example, and step
  through the code.  Inspect the values of the d and b variables after the last 
  operation - they will be type wchar_t and displaying correctly in the debugger.
