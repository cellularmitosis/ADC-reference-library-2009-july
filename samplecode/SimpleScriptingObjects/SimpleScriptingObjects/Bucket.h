	/* The Bucket class is a container for trinkets and treasures.
	
	Two points of interest in this class are the weight and value
	accessor methods that we use to implement the weight and value
	AppleScript properties.  These accessors implement read only
	properties and they return a calculated result reflecting the sum
	total of the weights of all of the trinkets and treasures
	contained in the bucket.
	
	We take care of most of the 'infrastructure' type operations
	needed for scripting in the Element class (the superclass of the
	Trinket class), so all we have to worry about here is storage management
	and providing accessors for the properties.*/

	than simply returning a value, this method calculates its result by
	summing the weights of all of the trinkets and treasures contained
	in the bucket.
	
	Also note, 'weight' is a declared as a read only property in our scripting
	definition file so we have not defined a 'setWeight:' method here.  */

	/* kvc method for the 'value' AppleScript property.  Here also rather
	than simply returning a value, this method calculates its result by
	summing the values of all of the treasures contained in the bucket.

	only property in our scripting definition file so we have not

	In our scripting definition file we specified that the 'bucket' class contains an
	element of type 'trinket', like so:
		<element type="trinket"/>
	Cocoa will use the plural form of the class name, 'trinkets',  when naming the
	property used by AppleScript to access the list of buckets, and we should use
	the property name when naming our methods.  So, using the property name, we
	name our methods as follows:
		- (NSArray*) trinkets;
		-(void) insertInTrinkets:(id) trinket;
		-(void) insertInTrinkets:(id) trinket atIndex:(unsigned)index;
		-(void) removeFromTrinketsAtIndex:(unsigned)index;

-(void) insertInTrinkets:(id) trinket atIndex:(unsigned)index;

	/* remove a trinket from the list */
-(void) removeFromTrinketsAtIndex:(unsigned)index;
