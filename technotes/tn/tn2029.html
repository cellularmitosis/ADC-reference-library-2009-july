When targeting applications 	running on a Mac OS X machine, you must use TCP/IP networking and addressing; AppleTalk 	is not supported.  (In addition, AppleScript 1.7 now supports encoding the login name and 	password into the "eppc" URL.)  For a Mac OS X machine to respond to Program Linking 	requests, "Allow Remote Apple Events" must be enabled in the Sharing panel of System 	Preferences.<BR><BR></LI>	<LI>AppleScript 1.7 for Mac OS X 10.1 can use Internet applications as targets of 	Tell blocks.

Scripts that use this feature can be 	run on older versions of AppleScript, but if decompiled, the linefeed character 	will not be visible in the decompiled output (but will recompile correctly) (r. 2465565).<BR><BR></LI>		<LI>Made changes to support saving in typeFileURL.  See Technical Note 	<a href="tn2022.html">TN2022, "The Death of typeFSSpec"</A>	for details (r. 2710315,  2708208).<BR><BR></LI>	<LI>In AppleScript 1.5 through 1.6, a script's global variables could be lost under certain rare 	circumstances.  If a script contains a Tell block that targets a variable, and that variable 	specifies an application that does not exist, the "Where is application &lt;name&gt;?" dialog would 	be presented when the script is executed.  After that point, further references to global 	variables in the handler that included the Tell block would fail.  This has been fixed in 	AppleScript 1.7 for Mac OS X and Classic.<BR><BR></LI>	<LI>In AppleScript 1.5 and 1.6 for Mac OS X, scripting additions behaved fundamentally differently 	than in Mac OS 9: they were only installed in certain applications that were AppleScript-aware.  	If a scripting addition command (such as 'display dialog') was sent to an application that was not 	AppleScript-aware, the event would instead be executed in the application running the 	script (e.g. Script Editor); that means the dialog would come up in the Script Editor layer, 	not the Tell target application.  In AppleScript 1.7 in Mac OS 10.1, the scripting additions 	mechanism has been redesigned to behave more like Mac OS 9, and scripting addition commands 	sent to applications will be executed in the process space and window layer of the target application.<BR><BR></LI>	<LI>AppleScript 1.5 through 1.6 often launched applications unnecessarily in order to get their 	terminology, and often used the terminology of the script editing application (such as Script 	Debugger) instead of application terminology.  This has been fixed in AppleScript 1.7.<BR><BR></LI>	<LI>In AppleScript 1.5 through 1.6 for Mac OS X, the version property of AppleScript or an 	application would be displayed as raw data rather than a string (unless the version property 	was explicitly converted to a string).  This has been fixed in AppleScript 1.7 (r. 2569693).<BR><BR></LI>	<LI>In AppleScript 1.5 and 1.6 for Mac OS X, certain operations with 'file' object specifiers 	(e.g. 'file "Mac OS X:Applications:Terminal.app:" as alias) would fail, when similar 	operations would succeed on AppleScript 1.3 through 1.6 for Mac OS 9.  These operations 	now work in AppleScript 1.7 for Mac OS X.  Note that, as always, while you can pass a 	'file' object specifier as a parameter to an event, or perform certain operations on it 	(like assignment and coercion), simply evaluating 'file "pathname"' is itself an 	AppleScript error.<BR><BR></LI>	<LI>AppleScript 1.5 and 1.6 for Mac OS X could not target Mac OS 9 control panels 	running in the Classic environment.  This has been fixed in AppleScript 1.7.  Note 	that the Classic environment only supports a small number of control panels from 	Mac OS 9 (such as the Launcher).<BR><BR></LI>	<LI>Accessing paragraphs of AppleScript strings did not work correctly in AppleScript 1.5 	through 1.6 if the line endings were Windows-style (CRLF).  The result would be only 	the first half of the text paragraphs, interspersed with an equal number of blank strings.  	This has been fixed in AppleScript 1.7 and later.<BR><BR></LI>	<LI>Occasionally with AppleScript 1.5 and 1.6, recompiling a script would get an End of 	File error reading an application's terminology.  This has been fixed in AppleScript 1.7.<BR><BR></LI>	<LI>In AppleScript 1.6, under certain circumstances calling a handler in an applet that 	has not been launched could cause an "Can't continue" error.  This has been fixed in 	AppleScript 1.7 and later.<BR><BR></LI>	<LI>In AppleScript 1.6, Unicode text values stored in script properties of a saved script 	could not be reloaded reliably.  This has been fixed in AppleScript 1.7.<BR><BR></LI>	<LI>In AppleScript 1.6, Unicode text received from certain applications that included a 	Unicode byte-order mark would behave incorrectly; the text would appear to begin 	with the Euro symbol, and some operations would fail.  AppleScript 1.7 handles 	Unicode text with byte-order marks correctly.<BR><BR></LI>	<LI>In somewhat rare circumstances, comparing two references to the same file for 	equality can fail even if both references refer to the same file.  This is true in 	AppleScript 1.0 through 1.6 and has been fixed in AppleScript 1.7.<BR><BR></LI>	<LI>Due to a problem in AppleScript's script parser, the language formations 	"isn't", "doesn't", and possessives ending with "'s" would all accept a 	vertical bar or a double-quote character in place of the "s" or "t" following 	the apostrophe.  In AppleScript 1.7 and later, these constructions (for example, 	"doesn'|" or "AppleScript'" version") are correctly noted as syntax errors.<BR><BR></LI>	<LI>Apple events sent by AppleScript now include an attribute	(enumConsidsAndIgnores) to indicate the current state of	"considering" and "ignoring" (r. 2708130).<BR><BR></LI>		<LI>The script parser now supports Mac, Unix, and Windows line endings (r.	2468789).<BR><BR></LI>		<LI>Extracting a range of paragraphs from text with Windows line endings	now works (r. 2671646)<BR><BR></LI>.		<LI>Miscellaneous performance and stability improvements (rr. 2684555,	2684651, 2700558, 2660044, 2716584, 2719078).<BR><BR></LI>	</UL>	<A NAME=ASADDITIONS x-level=2 x-title="Scripting Additions"></A>	<H3>Scripting Additions</H3>	<P>Scripting additions provide a mechanism for delivery of additional functionality written in other	computer languages that can be used in AppleScripts.</P>	<UL>		<LI>All disks formatted as Enhanced Macintosh File System ("HFS Plus") are able to store files with 		file names greater than 32 characters and stored as Unicode text.  When older software accesses 		such files, those names are represented in an encoded form (with a file ID such as "#28AF" in the 		name).  With AppleScript 1.6 and earlier, the results of many Standard Additions commands (like 		'path to', 'info for', and 'list folder'), as well as creation and display of alias objects, would 		require and return encoded names.  In AppleScript 1.7, long and Unicode file names in aliases 		and for scripting additions are represented by styled or Unicode text.  Encoded file names are 		no longer supported.<BR><BR></LI>				<LI>From AppleScript 1.1, the 'offset' scripting addition command has not worked correctly when 		the direct parameter is styled text.  It also has not worked correctly with the newly-introduced 		Unicode text type.  In Standard Additions 1.7 and later it produces correct results with both 		styled and Unicode text (r. 1197997).<BR><BR></LI>				<LI>In versions of Standard Additions prior to 1.7, the 'choose URL' command's 'using editable URL' 		parameter was present in the Scripting Additions dictionary but was nonfunctional (URLs were		always editable regardless of the setting of the parameter).  It behaves correctly in Standard 		Additions 1.7 and later: if set to false, the user can choose a URL only by browsing, not by 		editing the URL in the text box (r. 2635064).<BR><BR></LI>				<LI>The 'choose from list' command in Scripting Additions 1.4 through 1.6 allowed the scripter		 to create a situation where it would return an empty selection even if the scripter 		 specifically disallowed that case.  (This can be done by supplying a default item that 		 does not appear in the list).  In Scripting Additions 1.7 and later, the "OK" button will 		 not be enabled in such cases (r. 2644023).<BR><BR></LI>		<LI>In Mac OS X, the 'info for' scripting addition in Standard Additions 1.7 now returns 		additional record items that provide information about the file's extensions.  The 		'displayed name' item returns the name of the item as the user sees it in the Finder 		or file dialogs, and the 'name extension' item now returns the file extension (if any) 		that is on the indicated file (without the ".", which is considered a separator, and not 		part of either the name or the extension).  Both of these fields (along with the 'name' 		field itself) are Unicode text values (r. 2716929).<BR><BR></LI>		<LI>In Standard Additions 1.6 and earlier, the 'info for' scripting addition would fail if 		any piece of information in the requested file or directory was unavailable.  On UFS 		(Mac OS X ) disks and mounted NFS volumes, the file creation date is unavailable, and		accessing it causes a -8850 error (in trying to convert it to Universal Time).  Starting 		with Standard Additions 1.7, any missing piece of information in the 'info for' result is		provided as the value 'missing value' without failure.  In AppleScript 1.6 and earlier, 		magnitude comparisons (&lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=) against the 'missing value' would signal a coercion 		error for most types; in 1.7 and later, these comparisons always return 'false' without		error.  These two changes ensure that scripts that use 'info for' against UFS and NFS 		volumes do not fail, though they may not get correct results because any comparison 		to the creation date is always false (r. 2648937).<BR><BR></LI>				<LI>In Standard Additions 1.6 on both Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X, the 'info for' scripting 		addition would return an error -1401 for a nonexistent file, rather than the normal 		-35 returned in previous versions.  In Standard Additions 1.7 trying to get the info 		for a nonexistent file (or a file in a nonexistent directory or inaccessible disk) 		will return the -35 error (r. 2664789).<BR><BR></LI>				<LI>The 'read' command in Scripting Additions 1.6 had specific problems with the 		"using delimiters" parameter: in previous versions, 'read f as list using delimiters {tab}' 		would return a list, but in AppleScript 1.6, it returns a list of one-item lists.  In 		AppleScript 1.7 and later it behaves as it did prior to version 1.6  (rr. 2665233, 2665169).<BR><BR></LI>				<LI>The 'read' command in Scripting Additions 1.6 had specific problems with the 'before' 		and 'until' parameters if used in conjunction with the 'as' parameter.

This 		has been fixed in Scripting Additions 1.7 and later.<BR><BR></LI>				<LI>Mac OS 9  introduced the concept of a "package", that 		is, a file composed of a folder of several files and folders, which is treated as an 		integral file by the Finder and other applications.  The 'info for' scripting addition 		in AppleScript 1.6 and earlier treated such packaged data application files as 		folders, not files, and would not return file- or application-related information 		about them.  In Standard Additions 1.7 and later, getting the information for any 		directory (including package folders) returns an additional record item 		"package folder" (if this Boolean value is true, then the directory is a package), 		and the file's type and creator.  <BR><BR></LI>				<LI>Standard Additions 1.5 through 1.6 changed the way that the random number seed 		worked in the 'random number' scripting addition.  Older versions used the system 		clock as the seed value if no seed value (or a seed value of 0) was provided; 		Scripting Additions 1.5 and 1.6 always use a seed value of 0 in these cases.  In 		Scripting Additions 1.7 the older behavior has been restored.  In addition, the seed 		value is now taken from the 60Hz 'ticks' counter rather than the system clock, 		because the increased speed of new machines makes it more likely that two consecutive 		random number calls may receive the same system clock time as their seed 		value (r. 2675978).<BR><BR></LI>				<LI>In Mac OS X 10.0 through 10.0.4, the 'choose file name' scripting addition in 		Standard Additions 1.6 would crash if given an empty string ("") as the default 		file name.
