<b>NAME</b>
       LWP - The World-Wide Web library for Perl

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
         use LWP;
         print "This is libwww-perl-$LWP::VERSION\n";

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The libwww-perl collection is a set of Perl modules which provides a simple and consistent
       application programming interface (API) to the World-Wide Web.  The main focus of the library is to
       provide classes and functions that allow you to write WWW clients. The library also contain modules
       that are of more general use and even classes that help you implement simple HTTP servers.

       Most modules in this library provide an object oriented API.  The user agent, requests sent and
       responses received from the WWW server are all represented by objects.  This makes a simple and
       powerful interface to these services.  The interface is easy to extend and customize for your own
       needs.

       The main features of the library are:

         Contains various reusable components (modules) that can be used separately or together.

         Provides an object oriented model of HTTP-style communication.  Within this framework we currently
          support access to http, https, gopher, ftp, news, file, and mailto resources.

         Provides a full object oriented interface or a very simple procedural interface.

         Supports the basic and digest authorization schemes.

         Supports transparent redirect handling.

         Supports access through proxy servers.

         Provides parser for <u>robots.txt</u> files and a framework for constructing robots.

         Supports parsing of HTML forms.

         Implements HTTP content negotiation algorithm that can be used both in protocol modules and in
          server scripts (like CGI scripts).

         Supports HTTP cookies.

         Some simple command line clients, for instance "lwp-request" and "lwp-download".

<b>HTTP</b> <b>STYLE</b> <b>COMMUNICATION</b>
       The libwww-perl library is based on HTTP style communication. This section tries to describe what
       that means.

       Let us start with this quote from the HTTP specification document
       URL: &lt;<a href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Protocols/">http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Protocols/</a>:

         The HTTP protocol is based on a request/response paradigm. A client establishes a connection with
          a server and sends a request to the server in the form of a request method, URI, and protocol
          version, followed by a MIME-like message containing request modifiers, client information, and
          possible body content. The server responds with a status line, including the message's protocol
          version and a success or error code, followed by a MIME-like message containing server
          information, entity meta-information, and possible body content.

       What this means to libwww-perl is that communication always take place through these steps: First a
       <u>request</u> object is created and configured. This object is then passed to a server and we get a
       <u>response</u> object in return that we can examine. A request is always independent of any previous
       requests, i.e. the service is stateless.  The same simple model is used for any kind of service we
       want to access.

       For example, if we want to fetch a document from a remote file server, then we send it a request that
       contains a name for that document and the response will contain the document itself.  If we access a
       search engine, then the content of the request will contain the query parameters and the response
       will contain the query result.  If we want to send a mail message to somebody then we send a request
       object which contains our message to the mail server and the response object will contain an
       acknowledgment that tells us that the message has been accepted and will be forwarded to the
       <!-- a -->recipient(s)<!-- /a -->.

       It is as simple as that!

       <b>The</b> <b>Request</b> <b>Object</b>

       The libwww-perl request object has the class name "HTTP::Request".  The fact that the class name uses
       "HTTP::" as a prefix only implies that we use the HTTP model of communication.  It does not limit the
       kind of services we can try to pass this <u>request</u> to.  For instance, we will send "HTTP::Request"s
       both to ftp and gopher servers, as well as to the local file system.

       The main attributes of the request objects are:

         The <b>method</b> is a short string that tells what kind of request this is.  The most common methods are
          <b>GET</b>, <b>PUT</b>, <b>POST</b> and <b>HEAD</b>.

         The <b>uri</b> is a string denoting the protocol, server and the name of the "document" we want to
          access.  The <b>uri</b> might also encode various other parameters.

         The <b>headers</b> contain additional information about the request and can also used to describe the
          content.  The headers are a set of keyword/value pairs.

         The <b>content</b> is an arbitrary amount of data.

       <b>The</b> <b>Response</b> <b>Object</b>

       The libwww-perl response object has the class name "HTTP::Response".  The main attributes of objects
       of this class are:

         The <b>code</b> is a numerical value that indicates the overall outcome of the request.

         The <b>message</b> is a short, human readable string that corresponds to the <u>code</u>.

         The <b>headers</b> contain additional information about the response and describe the content.

         The <b>content</b> is an arbitrary amount of data.

       Since we don't want to handle all possible <u>code</u> values directly in our programs, a libwww-perl
       response object has methods that can be used to query what kind of response this is.  The most
       commonly used response classification methods are:

       <u>is</u><b>_</b><u>success()</u>
          The request was was successfully received, understood or accepted.

       <u>is</u><b>_</b><u>error()</u>
          The request failed.  The server or the resource might not be available, access to the resource
          might be denied or other things might have failed for some reason.

       <b>The</b> <b>User</b> <b>Agent</b>

       Let us assume that we have created a <u>request</u> object. What do we actually do with it in order to
       receive a <u>response</u>?

       The answer is that you pass it to a <u>user</u> <u>agent</u> object and this object takes care of all the things
       that need to be done (like low-level communication and error handling) and returns a <u>response</u> object.
       The user agent represents your application on the network and provides you with an interface that can
       accept <u>requests</u> and return <u>responses</u>.

       The user agent is an interface layer between your application code and the network.  Through this
       interface you are able to access the various servers on the network.

       The class name for the user agent is "LWP::UserAgent".  Every libwww-perl application that wants to
       communicate should create at least one object of this class. The main method provided by this object
       is <u>request()</u>. This method takes an "HTTP::Request" object as argument and (eventually) returns a
       "HTTP::Response" object.

       The user agent has many other attributes that let you configure how it will interact with the network
       and with your application.

         The <b>timeout</b> specifies how much time we give remote servers to respond before the library
          disconnects and creates an internal <u>timeout</u> response.

         The <b>agent</b> specifies the name that your application should use when it presents itself on the
          network.

         The <b>from</b> attribute can be set to the e-mail address of the person responsible for running the
          application.  If this is set, then the address will be sent to the servers with every request.

         The <b>parse_head</b> specifies whether we should initialize response headers from the &lt;head&gt; section of
          HTML documents.

         The <b>proxy</b> and <b>no_proxy</b> attributes specify if and when to go through a proxy server.
          URL: &lt;<a href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Proxies/">http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Proxies/</a>

         The <b>credentials</b> provide a way to set up user names and passwords needed to access certain
          services.

       Many applications want even more control over how they interact with the network and they get this by
       sub-classing "LWP::UserAgent".  The library includes a sub-class, "LWP::RobotUA", for robot
       applications.

       <b>An</b> <b>Example</b>

       This example shows how the user agent, a request and a response are represented in actual perl code:

         # Create a user agent object
         use LWP::UserAgent;
         $ua = LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new;
         $ua-&gt;agent("MyApp/0.1 ");

         # Create a request
         my $req = HTTP::Request-&gt;new(POST =&gt; '<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search">http://search.cpan.org/search</a>');
         $req-&gt;content_type('application/x-www-form-urlencoded');
         $req-&gt;content('query=libwww-perl&amp;mode=dist');

         # Pass request to the user agent and get a response back
         my $res = $ua-&gt;request($req);

         # Check the outcome of the response
         if ($res-&gt;is_success) {
             print $res-&gt;content;
         }
         else {
             print $res-&gt;status_line, "\n";
         }

       The $ua is created once when the application starts up.  New request objects should normally created
       for each request sent.

<b>NETWORK</b> <b>SUPPORT</b>
       This section discusses the various protocol schemes and the HTTP style methods that headers may be
       used for each.

       For all requests, a "User-Agent" header is added and initialized from the $ua-&gt;agent attribute before
       the request is handed to the network layer.  In the same way, a "From" header is initialized from the
       $ua-&gt;from attribute.

       For all responses, the library adds a header called "Client-Date".  This header holds the time when
       the response was received by your application.  The format and semantics of the header are the same
       as the server created "Date" header.  You may also encounter other "Client-XXX" headers.  They are
       all generated by the library internally and are not received from the servers.

       <b>HTTP</b> <b>Requests</b>

       HTTP requests are just handed off to an HTTP server and it decides what happens.  Few servers
       implement methods beside the usual "GET", "HEAD", "POST" and "PUT", but CGI-scripts may implement any
       method they like.

       If the server is not available then the library will generate an internal error response.

       The library automatically adds a "Host" and a "Content-Length" header to the HTTP request before it
       is sent over the network.

       For a GET request you might want to add a "If-Modified-Since" or "If-None-Match" header to make the
       request conditional.

       For a POST request you should add the "Content-Type" header.  When you try to emulate HTML &lt;FORM&gt;
       handling you should usually let the value of the "Content-Type" header be
       "application/x-www-form-urlencoded".  See lwpcook for examples of this.

       The libwww-perl HTTP implementation currently support the HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/1.0 protocol.

       The library allows you to access proxy server through HTTP.  This means that you can set up the
       library to forward all types of request through the HTTP protocol module.  See LWP::UserAgent for
       documentation of this.

       <b>HTTPS</b> <b>Requests</b>

       HTTPS requests are HTTP requests over an encrypted network connection using the SSL protocol
       developed by Netscape.  Everything about HTTP requests above also apply to HTTPS requests.  In
       addition the library will add the headers "Client-SSL-Cipher", "Client-SSL-Cert-Subject" and "Client-
       SSL-Cert-Issuer" to the response.  These headers denote the encryption method used and the name of
       the server owner.

       The request can contain the header "If-SSL-Cert-Subject" in order to make the request conditional on
       the content of the server certificate.  If the certificate subject does not match, no request is sent
       to the server and an internally generated error response is returned.  The value of the "If-SSL-Cert-
       Subject" header is interpreted as a Perl regular expression.

       <b>FTP</b> <b>Requests</b>

       The library currently supports GET, HEAD and PUT requests.  GET retrieves a file or a directory
       listing from an FTP server.  PUT stores a file on a ftp server.

       You can specify a ftp account for servers that want this in addition to user name and password.  This
       is specified by including an "Account" header in the request.

       User name/password can be specified using basic authorization or be encoded in the URL.  Failed
       logins return an UNAUTHORIZED response with "WWW-Authenticate: Basic" and can be treated like basic
       authorization for HTTP.

       The library supports ftp ASCII transfer mode by specifying the "type=a" parameter in the URL. It also
       supports transfer of ranges for FTP transfers using the "Range" header.

       Directory listings are by default returned unprocessed (as returned from the ftp server) with the
       content media type reported to be "text/ftp-dir-listing". The "File::Listing" module provides methods
       for parsing of these directory listing.

       The ftp module is also able to convert directory listings to HTML and this can be requested via the
       standard HTTP content negotiation mechanisms (add an "Accept: text/html" header in the request if you
       want this).

       For normal file retrievals, the "Content-Type" is guessed based on the file name suffix. See
       LWP::MediaTypes.

       The "If-Modified-Since" request header works for servers that implement the MDTM command.  It will
       probably not work for directory listings though.

       Example:

         $req = HTTP::Request-&gt;new(GET =&gt; '<a href="ftp://me:passwd@ftp.some.where.com/">ftp://me:passwd@ftp.some.where.com/</a>');
         $req-&gt;header(Accept =&gt; "text/html, */*;q=0.1");

       <b>News</b> <b>Requests</b>

       Access to the USENET News system is implemented through the NNTP protocol.  The name of the news
       server is obtained from the NNTP_SERVER environment variable and defaults to "news".  It is not
       possible to specify the hostname of the NNTP server in news: URLs.

       The library supports GET and HEAD to retrieve news articles through the NNTP protocol.  You can also
       post articles to newsgroups by using (surprise!) the POST method.

       GET on newsgroups is not implemented yet.

       Examples:

         $req = HTTP::Request-&gt;new(GET =&gt; 'news:abc1234@a.sn.no');

         $req = HTTP::Request-&gt;new(POST =&gt; 'news:comp.lang.perl.test');
         $req-&gt;header(Subject =&gt; 'This is a test',
                      From    =&gt; 'me@some.where.org');
         $req-&gt;content(&lt;&lt;EOT);
         This is the content of the message that we are sending to
         the world.
         EOT

       <b>Gopher</b> <b>Request</b>

       The library supports the GET and HEAD methods for gopher requests.  All request header values are
       ignored.  HEAD cheats and returns a response without even talking to server.

       Gopher menus are always converted to HTML.

       The response "Content-Type" is generated from the document type encoded (as the first letter) in the
       request URL path itself.

       Example:

         $req = HTTP::Request-&gt;new(GET =&gt; 'gopher://gopher.sn.no/');

       <b>File</b> <b>Request</b>

       The library supports GET and HEAD methods for file requests.  The "If-Modified-Since" header is
       supported.  All other headers are ignored.  The <u>host</u> component of the file URL must be empty or set
       to "localhost".  Any other <u>host</u> value will be treated as an error.

       Directories are always converted to an HTML document.  For normal files, the "Content-Type" and
       "Content-Encoding" in the response are guessed based on the file suffix.

       Example:

         $req = HTTP::Request-&gt;new(GET =&gt; 'file:/etc/passwd');

       <b>Mailto</b> <b>Request</b>

       You can send (aka "POST") mail messages using the library.  All headers specified for the request are
       passed on to the mail system.  The "To" header is initialized from the mail address in the URL.

       Example:

         $req = HTTP::Request-&gt;new(POST =&gt; 'mailto:libwww@perl.org');
         $req-&gt;header(Subject =&gt; "subscribe");
         $req-&gt;content("Please subscribe me to the libwww-perl mailing list!\n");

       <b>CPAN</b> <b>Requests</b>

       URLs with scheme "cpan:" are redirected to the a suitable CPAN mirror.  If you have your own local
       mirror of CPAN you might tell LWP to use it for "cpan:" URLs by an assignment like this:

         $LWP::Protocol::cpan::CPAN = "file:/local/CPAN/";

       Suitable CPAN mirrors are also picked up from the configuration for the CPAN.pm, so if you have used
       that module a suitable mirror should be picked automatically.  If neither of these apply, then a
       redirect to the generic CPAN http location is issued.

       Example request to download the newest perl:

         $req = HTTP::Request-&gt;new(GET =&gt; "cpan:src/latest.tar.gz");

       All modules contain detailed information on the interfaces they provide.  The <u>lwpcook</u> manpage is the
       libwww-perl cookbook that contain examples of typical usage of the library.  You might want to take a
       look at how the scripts "lwp-request", "lwp-rget" and "lwp-mirror" are implemented.

<b>ENVIRONMENT</b>
       The following environment variables are used by LWP:

       HOME
           The "LWP::MediaTypes" functions will look for the <u>.media.types</u> and <u>.mime.types</u> files relative to
           you home directory.

       http_proxy
       ftp_proxy
       xxx_proxy
       no_proxy
           These environment variables can be set to enable communication through a proxy server.  See the
           description of the "env_proxy" method in LWP::UserAgent.

       PERL_LWP_USE_HTTP_10
           Enable the old HTTP/1.0 protocol driver instead of the new HTTP/1.1 driver.  You might want to
           set this to a TRUE value if you discover that your old LWP applications fails after you installed
           LWP-5.60 or better.

       PERL_HTTP_URI_CLASS
           Used to decide what URI objects to instantiate.  The default is "URI".  You might want to set it
           to "URI::URL" for compatibility with old times.
