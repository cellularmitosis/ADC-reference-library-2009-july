PERLFAQ(1)                            Perl Programmers Reference Guide                            PERLFAQ(1)



<b>NAME</b>
       perlfaq - frequently asked questions about Perl

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The perlfaq comprises several documents that answer the most commonly asked questions about Perl and
       Perl programming. It's divided by topic into nine major sections outlined in this document.

       <b>Where</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>perlfaq</b>

       The perlfaq comes with the standard Perl distribution, so if you have Perl you should have the perl-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">faq.&nbsp;perlfaq.</font>
       faq. You should also have the "perldoc" tool that let's you read the perlfaq:

               $ perldoc perlfaq

       Besides your local system, you can find the perlfaq on the web, including at <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/">http://perldoc.perl.org/</a>
       .

       The perlfaq is an evolving document and you can read the latest version at <a href="http://faq.perl.org/">http://faq.perl.org/</a> . The
       perlfaq-workers periodically post extracts of the latest perlfaq to comp.lang.perl.misc.

       You can view the source tree at <a href="http://cvs.perl.org/viewcvs/cvs-public/perlfaq/">http://cvs.perl.org/viewcvs/cvs-public/perlfaq/</a> (which is outside of
       the main Perl source tree).  The CVS repository notes all changes to the FAQ and holds the latest
       version of the working documents and may vary significantly from the version distributed with the
       latest version of Perl. Check the repository before sending your corrections.

       <b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>perlfaq</b>

       You can mail corrections, additions, and suggestions to "&lt;perlfaq-workers AT perl DOT org&gt;". The
       perlfaq volunteers use this address to coordinate their efforts and track the perlfaq development.
       They appreciate your contributions to the FAQ but do not have time to provide individual help, so
       don't use this address to ask FAQs.

       The perlfaq server posts extracts of the perlfaq to that newsgroup every 6 hours (or so), and the
       community of volunteers reviews and updates the answers. If you'd like to help review and update the
       answers, check out comp.lang.perl.misc.

       <b>What</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>mail</b> <b>your</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>programming</b> <b>problems</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>authors?</b>

       The perlfaq-workers like to keep all traffic on the perlfaq-workers list so that everyone can see the
       work being done (and the work that needs to be done). The mailing list serves as an official record.
       If you email the authors or maintainers directly, you'll probably get a reply asking you to post to
       the mailing list. If you don't get a reply, it probably means that the person never saw the message
       or didn't have time to deal with it. Posting to the list allows the volunteers with time to deal with
       it when others are busy.

       If you have a question that isn't in the FAQ and you would like help with it, try the resources in
       perlfaq2.

<b>CREDITS</b>
       Tom Christiansen wrote the original perlfaq then expanded it with the help of Nat Torkington.  The
       perlfaq-workers maintain current document and the dezinens of comp.lang.perl.misc regularly review
       and update the FAQ. Several people have contributed answers, corrections, and comments, and the perl-
       faq notes those contributions wherever appropriate.

          Why doesn't glob("*.*") get all the files?

          Why does Perl let me delete read-only files?  Why does "-i" clobber protected files?  Isn't this
           a bug in Perl?

          How do I select a random line from a file?

          Why do I get weird spaces when I print an array of lines?

       <b>perlfaq6:</b> <b>Regular</b> <b>Expressions</b>

       This section is surprisingly small because the rest of the FAQ is littered with answers involving
       regular expressions. For example, decoding a URL and checking whether something is a number are han-
       dled with regular expressions, but those answers are found elsewhere in this document (in perlfaq9:
       "How do I decode or create those %-encodings on the web" and perlfaq4: "How do I determine whether a
       scalar is a number/whole/integer/float", to be precise).

          How can I hope to use regular expressions without creating illegible and unmaintainable code?

          I'm having trouble matching over more than one line.  What's wrong?

          How can I pull out lines between two patterns that are themselves on different lines?

          I put a regular expression into $/ but it didn't work. What's wrong?

          How can I make "\w" match national character sets?

          How can I match a locale-smart version of "/[a-zA-Z]/"?

          How can I quote a variable to use in a regex?

          What is "/o" really for?

          How do I use a regular expression to strip C style comments from a file?

          Can I use Perl regular expressions to match balanced text?

          What does it mean that regexes are greedy?  How can I get around it?

          How do I process each word on each line?

          How can I print out a word-frequency or line-frequency summary?

          How can I do approximate matching?

          How do I efficiently match many regular expressions at once?

          Why don't word-boundary searches with "\b" work for me?

          Why does using $&amp;, $`, or $' slow my program down?

          What good is "\G" in a regular expression?
