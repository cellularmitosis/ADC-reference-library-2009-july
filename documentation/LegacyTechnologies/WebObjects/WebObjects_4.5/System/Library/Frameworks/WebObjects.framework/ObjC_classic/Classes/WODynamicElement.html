Dynamic elementshave a name and one or more <em>properties</em>,instance variables holding such things as user-entered data or user-triggerableactions. The properties of a dynamic element are associated with, or"bound" to, the properties of the  <a frame= "conv" href="WOComponent.html#WOComponent">WOComponent</a> object that representsthe page (or portion of a page) in which the dynamic element appears.</p><p>At runtime, a dynamic element can extract values from therequest, feed those values across the bindings to the owning component,receive back new data, and include that data in the next representationof the page. A dynamic element can also detect if the user has manipulatedit (for instance, clicking a button) to signal some intention andthen trigger the appropriate action method in the owning WOComponent.The bindings between properties of a dynamic element and propertiesof a WOComponent are made possible by <em>associations</em>,objects that know how to "push" and "pull" valuesto and from another object using keys. All objects that inheritfrom NextObject have associative capabilities through NextObjects'simplementation of the KeyValueCoding protocol.</p><p>WODynamicElements must implement the default initializer toinitialize their instance variables with the appropriate associationobjects (passed in). As  <a frame= "conv" href="WOElement.html#WOElement">WOElement</a> objects, they must alsoimplement one or more of the three request-handling methods. Inthe context of request handling, a dynamic element can use its associationsto:</p><ul><li>Push request values into the associated propertiesof their WOComponent ( <a frame= "conv" href="WOComponent.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/WOComponent/takeValuesFromRequest:inContext:">takeValuesFromRequest:inContext:</a>)</li><li>Invoke action methods of the WOComponent ( <a frame= "conv" href="WOComponent.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/WOComponent/invokeActionForRequest:inContext:">invokeActionForRequest:inContext:</a>)</li><li>Extract values from the WOComponent when composing a dynamicHTML response ( <a frame= "conv" href="WOComponent.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/WOComponent/appendToResponse:inContext:">appendToResponse:inContext:</a>)</li></ul><p>All dynamic elements must implement  <a frame= "conv" href="WOComponent.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/WOComponent/appendToResponse:inContext:">appendToResponse:inContext:</a>.If they accept user input or respond to user actions (such as mouseclicks), they should implement  <a frame= "conv" href="WOComponent.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/WOComponent/takeValuesFromRequest:inContext:">takeValuesFromRequest:inContext:</a> and  <a frame= "conv" href="WOComponent.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/WOComponent/invokeActionForRequest:inContext:">invokeActionForRequest:inContext:</a>,respectively.</p><p>If you write a dynamic element that appends content to theresponse (this is typically done by overriding  <a frame= "conv" href="WOComponent.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/WOComponent/appendToResponse:inContext:">appendToResponse:inContext:</a>),be sure to verify that the request is not client-side:</p><blockquote><pre>- (void)appendToResponse:(WOResponse *)response inContext:(WOContext *)context {    if(![[context request]] isFromClientComponent]){        // append content here    }}</pre></blockquote><br><p>Dynamic elements do not know about their WOComponent objectuntil run time. During request-handling, the application storescomponents (representing a page and subcomponents on the page) ona stack maintained by the  <a frame= "conv" href="WOContext.html#WOContext">WOContext</a> object, with the currentlyreferenced WOComponent on top of the stack. A dynamic element's  <a frame= "conv" href="WOAssociation.html#WOAssociation">WOAssociation</a> retrieves the currentWOComponent (through an invocation of WOContext's  <a frame= "conv" href="WOContext.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/WOContext/component">component</a> method) and reads and writesvalues from and to the WOComponent using KeyValueCoding methods.</p><p>A dynamic element can represent a single HTML or PDF element(such as an editable text field) or a compound element, such asthe LoginPanel whose implementation is described below. WebObjects includesa suite of ready-made dynamic elements and the WebObjects Builderapplication makes these objects available on its palettes. The <em>DynamicElements Reference</em> describes WebObjects' dynamic elementsand provides examples showing how to use them.</p><br><BR><BR><h2>Instance Methods</h2><hr><a name = "initWithName_associations_template_"><BR><h3><a name="//apple_ref/occ/instm/WODynamicElement/initWithName:associations:template:">initWithName:associations:template:</a></h3></a><p><code>- (id)<b>initWithName:</b>(NSString*)<em>aName</em><b>associations:</b>(NSDictionary *)<em>someAssociations</em><b>template:</b>(WOElement *)<em>anElement</em></code></p>Returns a dynamic element identified by class <em>aName</em> andinitialized with the objects in dictionary <em>someAssociations</em>.The dictionary contains  <a frame= "conv" href="WOAssociation.html#WOAssociation">WOAssociation</a> objects, which knowhow to take values from, and set values in, an "owning"  <a frame= "conv" href="WOComponent.html#WOComponent">WOComponent</a>. To properly initializea dynamic element, you should use the published keys of the dynamicelement to get the associations that belong to the dynamic element;then assign these objects to instance variables. The <em>anElement</em> argument,if not <b>nil</b>, is the root object of a graphof  <a frame= "conv" href="WOElement.html#WOElement">WOElement</a>s associated with the dynamicelement.<p>Typically, a key in the someAssociations dictionaryis identified with a property of the element, and the value of thiskey is the name of a property of the associated Component. For example,the value of key "userName" might be bound to "employee.name"in the WOComponent; this designation means that WOComponent hasa property called "employee" (possibly referring to an"Employee" object) which in turn has a property called"name". In this case, the binding is two-way; changesin the dynamic element are reflected in the WOComponent property,and changes in the WOComponent property are communicated to thedynamic element. The value of an association can also be a constant,in which case the binding is one-way: WOComponent to dynamic element.</p><hr WIDTH=25% ALIGN=LEFT><BR><br><a href="../WebObjectsTOC.html"><img src="../../../../../../images/up.gif" border="0" alt="Table of Contents"></a> </BODY></HTML>
