<p>The PowerBook G4 computer supports the AirPort Card, an internal
wireless LAN module. The AirPort Card is standard on the 667-MHz
model. </p>
<p>The AirPort Card can be used for local printer sharing, file
exchange, internet access, and e-mail access. </p>
<p>The AirPort Card transmits and receives data at up to 11 Mbps.
It is also interoperable with some older wireless LANs, as specified
in  <a href="#TPXREF113">"Hardware Components"</a>. </p>
<p>Wireless connection to the internet or a wired LAN requires
a base station as the connection to the internet or a bridge between
the wireless signals and a wired LAN. Software included with the
AirPort Card enables a Macintosh computer that has an AirPort Card
installed to act as a base station. The user also has the option
of purchasing an AirPort Base Station that can be connected to the
wired LAN or to a 56 Kbps hardware modem. </p>

<br><a name = "TPXREF112"></a><h3><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Data Security</font></h3>
<p>Three features of the AirPort Card help to maintain the security
of data transmissions: </p>
<ul><li>The system
uses direct-sequence spread-spectrum (DSSS) technology that uses
a multi-bit spreading code that effectively scrambles the data for
any receiver that lacks the corresponding code. </font></li>
<li>The system can use a table of authentic network client ID
values to verify each client's identity before granting access
to the network. </font></li>
<li>When communicating with a base station, the system encrypts
the data using Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) with a 128-bit security
key. </font></li></ul>
<br><a name = "TPXREF113"></a><h3><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Hardware Components</font></h3>
<p>The AirPort Card is a wireless LAN module based on the IEEE
802.11 standard and using direct-sequence spread-spectrum (DSSS)
technology. It is interoperable with PC-compatible wireless LANs
that conform to the 802.11 standard and use DSSS. </p>
<p>The AirPort Card contains a media access controller (MAC),
a digital signal processor (DSP), and a radio-frequency (RF) section.
The antennas are built into the computer's case. </p>
<p>The MAC provides the data communication protocols and the
controls for the physical layer. </p>
<p>The DSP provides the core physical layer functionality and
controls the RF section. The DSP communicates with the MAC for data
exchange, physical layer control, and parameter settings. </p>
<p>The RF section provides modulation and transmission of outgoing
signals and reception and demodulation of incoming signals. Its
power output when transmitting is nominally 31 mW. </p>
<p>When transmitting data, the DSP converts the outgoing data
stream into a DSSS signal and sends it to the RF section. When receiving
data, the DSP accepts incoming DSSS data from the RF section and
converts it to a normal data stream. </p>
<p>Two antennas are connected to the AirPort Card. One antenna
is always used for transmitting. Either of the two antennas may
be used for receiving. Using a diversity technique, the DSP selects
the antenna that gives the best reception. </p>
<br><a name = "TPXREF114"></a><h3><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Software Components</font></h3>
<p>Software that is provided with the AirPort Card includes</p>
<ul><li>AirPort Setup
Assistant, a standalone assistant that takes users through the steps necessary
to set up the AirPort Card, set up an AirPort Base Station, or set
up a software base station.</font></li>
<li>AirPort Application, an application that allows users to switch
between wireless networks and to create and join peer-to-peer networks.</font></li>
<li>AirPort Control Strip Module, which provides a signal strength
indication and most of the functions of the AirPort Application.</font></li>
<li>AirPort Admin, a utility for the advanced user. With it the
user can edit the administrative and advanced settings for a hardware
or software base station. It can also be used to determine the location
for the base station that gives the best reception. </font></li></ul>
