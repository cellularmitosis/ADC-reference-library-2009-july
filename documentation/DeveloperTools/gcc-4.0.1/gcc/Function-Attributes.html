In GNU C, you declare certain things about functions called in your program
which help the compiler optimize function calls and check your code more
carefully.

 <p>The keyword <code>__attribute__</code> allows you to specify special
attributes when making a declaration.  This keyword is followed by an
attribute specification inside double parentheses.  The following
attributes are currently defined for functions on all targets:
<!-- APPLE LOCAL nodebug -->
<code>noreturn</code>, <code>noinline</code>, <code>always_inline</code>, <code>nodebug</code>,
<!-- APPLE LOCAL regparmandstackparm -->
<code>regparmandstackparm</code>,
<code>pure</code>, <code>const</code>, <code>nothrow</code>, <code>sentinel</code>,
<code>format</code>, <code>format_arg</code>, <code>no_instrument_function</code>,
<code>section</code>, <code>constructor</code>, <code>destructor</code>, <code>used</code>,
<code>unused</code>, <code>deprecated</code>, <code>weak</code>, <code>malloc</code>,
<code>alias</code>, <code>warn_unused_result</code> and <code>nonnull</code>.  Several other
attributes are defined for functions on particular target systems.  Other
attributes, including <code>section</code> are supported for variables declarations
(see <a href="Variable-Attributes.html#Variable-Attributes">Variable Attributes</a>) and for types (see <a href="Type-Attributes.html#Type-Attributes">Type Attributes</a>).

 <p>You may also specify attributes with `<samp><span class="samp">__</span></samp>' preceding and following
each keyword.  This allows you to use them in header files without
being concerned about a possible macro of the same name.  For example,
you may use <code>__noreturn__</code> instead of <code>noreturn</code>.

 <p>See <a href="Attribute-Syntax.html#Attribute-Syntax">Attribute Syntax</a>, for details of the exact syntax for using
attributes.

     <dl>
<!-- Keep this table alphabetized by attribute name.  Treat _ as space. -->

     <dt><code>alias ("</code><var>target</var><code>")</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007balias_007d-attribute-1166"></a>The <code>alias</code> attribute causes the declaration to be emitted as an
alias for another symbol, which must be specified.  For instance,

     <pre class="smallexample">          void __f () { /* <span class="roman">Do something.</span> */; }
          void f () __attribute__ ((weak, alias ("__f")));
     </pre>
     <p>declares `<samp><span class="samp">f</span></samp>' to be a weak alias for `<samp><span class="samp">__f</span></samp>'.  In C++, the
mangled name for the target must be used.  It is an error if `<samp><span class="samp">__f</span></samp>'
is not defined in the same translation unit.

     <p>Not all target machines support this attribute.

     <br><dt><code>always_inline</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007balways_005finline_007d-function-attribute-1167"></a>Generally, functions are not inlined unless optimization is specified. 
For functions declared inline, this attribute inlines the function even
if no optimization level was specified.

     <!-- APPLE LOCAL begin nodebug -->
<br><dt><code>nodebug</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bnodebug_007d-function-attribute-1168"></a>This attribute prevents debug information to be generated for the function. 
This is to avoid stepping into the function which is of no interest to the
user how it is implemented. An example is the x86 vector intrinsics. 
This is temporary and will be removed in some future version of the compiler. 
<!-- APPLE LOCAL end nodebug -->

     <br><dt><code>cdecl</code><dd><a name="index-functions-that-do-pop-the-argument-stack-on-the-386-1169"></a><a name="index-mrtd-1170"></a>On the Intel 386, the <code>cdecl</code> attribute causes the compiler to
assume that the calling function will pop off the stack space used to
pass arguments.  This is
useful to override the effects of the <samp><span class="option">-mrtd</span></samp> switch.

     <br><dt><code>const</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bconst_007d-function-attribute-1171"></a>Many functions do not examine any values except their arguments, and
have no effects except the return value.  Basically this is just slightly
more strict class than the <code>pure</code> attribute below, since function is not
allowed to read global memory.

     <p><a name="index-pointer-arguments-1172"></a>Note that a function that has pointer arguments and examines the data
pointed to must <em>not</em> be declared <code>const</code>.  Likewise, a
function that calls a non-<code>const</code> function usually must not be
<code>const</code>.  It does not make sense for a <code>const</code> function to
return <code>void</code>.

     <p>The attribute <code>const</code> is not implemented in GCC versions earlier
than 2.5.  An alternative way to declare that a function has no side
effects, which works in the current version and in some older versions,
is as follows:

     <pre class="smallexample">          typedef int intfn ();
          
          extern const intfn square;
     </pre>
     <p>This approach does not work in GNU C++ from 2.6.0 on, since the language
specifies that the `<samp><span class="samp">const</span></samp>' must be attached to the return value.

     <br><dt><code>constructor</code><dt><code>destructor</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bconstructor_007d-function-attribute-1173"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bdestructor_007d-function-attribute-1174"></a>The <code>constructor</code> attribute causes the function to be called
automatically before execution enters <code>main ()</code>.  Similarly, the
<code>destructor</code> attribute causes the function to be called
automatically after <code>main ()</code> has completed or <code>exit ()</code> has
been called.  Functions with these attributes are useful for
initializing data that will be used implicitly during the execution of
the program.

     <p>These attributes are not currently implemented for Objective-C.

     <br><dt><code>deprecated</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bdeprecated_007d-attribute_002e-1175"></a>The <code>deprecated</code> attribute results in a warning if the function
is used anywhere in the source file.  This is useful when identifying
functions that are expected to be removed in a future version of a
program.  The warning also includes the location of the declaration
of the deprecated function, to enable users to easily find further
information about why the function is deprecated, or what they should
do instead.  Note that the warnings only occurs for uses:

     <pre class="smallexample">          int old_fn () __attribute__ ((deprecated));
          int old_fn ();
          int (*fn_ptr)() = old_fn;
     </pre>
     <p>results in a warning on line 3 but not line 2.

     <p>The <code>deprecated</code> attribute can also be used for variables and
types (see <a href="Variable-Attributes.html#Variable-Attributes">Variable Attributes</a>, see <a href="Type-Attributes.html#Type-Attributes">Type Attributes</a>.)

     <br><dt><code>dllexport</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_005f_005fdeclspec_0028dllexport_0029_007d-1176"></a>On Microsoft Windows targets and Symbian OS targets the
<code>dllexport</code> attribute causes the compiler to provide a global
pointer to a pointer in a DLL, so that it can be referenced with the
<code>dllimport</code> attribute.  On Microsoft Windows targets, the pointer
name is formed by combining <code>_imp__</code> and the function or variable
name.

     <p>You can use <code>__declspec(dllexport)</code> as a synonym for
<code>__attribute__ ((dllexport))</code> for compatibility with other
compilers.

     <p>On systems that support the <code>visibility</code> attribute, this
attribute also implies &ldquo;default&rdquo; visibility, unless a
<code>visibility</code> attribute is explicitly specified.  You should avoid
the use of <code>dllexport</code> with &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; or &ldquo;internal&rdquo;
visibility; in the future GCC may issue an error for those cases.

     <p>Currently, the <code>dllexport</code> attribute is ignored for inlined
functions, unless the <samp><span class="option">-fkeep-inline-functions</span></samp> flag has been
used.  The attribute is also ignored for undefined symbols.

     <p>When applied to C++ classes, the attribute marks defined non-inlined
member functions and static data members as exports.  Static consts
initialized in-class are not marked unless they are also defined
out-of-class.

     <p>For Microsoft Windows targets there are alternative methods for
including the symbol in the DLL's export table such as using a
<samp><span class="file">.def</span></samp> file with an <code>EXPORTS</code> section or, with GNU ld, using
the <samp><span class="option">--export-all</span></samp> linker flag.

     <br><dt><code>dllimport</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_005f_005fdeclspec_0028dllimport_0029_007d-1177"></a>On Microsoft Windows and Symbian OS targets, the <code>dllimport</code>
attribute causes the compiler to reference a function or variable via
a global pointer to a pointer that is set up by the DLL exporting the
symbol.  The attribute implies <code>extern</code> storage.  On Microsoft
Windows targets, the pointer name is formed by combining <code>_imp__</code>
and the function or variable name.

     <p>You can use <code>__declspec(dllimport)</code> as a synonym for
<code>__attribute__ ((dllimport))</code> for compatibility with other
compilers.

     <p>Currently, the attribute is ignored for inlined functions.  If the
attribute is applied to a symbol <em>definition</em>, an error is reported. 
If a symbol previously declared <code>dllimport</code> is later defined, the
attribute is ignored in subsequent references, and a warning is emitted. 
The attribute is also overridden by a subsequent declaration as
<code>dllexport</code>.

     <p>When applied to C++ classes, the attribute marks non-inlined
member functions and static data members as imports.  However, the
attribute is ignored for virtual methods to allow creation of vtables
using thunks.

     <p>On the SH Symbian OS target the <code>dllimport</code> attribute also has
another affect&mdash;it can cause the vtable and run-time type information
for a class to be exported.  This happens when the class has a
dllimport'ed constructor or a non-inline, non-pure virtual function
and, for either of those two conditions, the class also has a inline
constructor or destructor and has a key function that is defined in
the current translation unit.

     <p>For Microsoft Windows based targets the use of the <code>dllimport</code>
attribute on functions is not necessary, but provides a small
performance benefit by eliminating a thunk in the DLL.  The use of the
<code>dllimport</code> attribute on imported variables was required on older
versions of the GNU linker, but can now be avoided by passing the
<samp><span class="option">--enable-auto-import</span></samp> switch to the GNU linker.  As with
functions, using the attribute for a variable eliminates a thunk in
the DLL.

     <p>One drawback to using this attribute is that a pointer to a function
or variable marked as <code>dllimport</code> cannot be used as a constant
address.  On Microsoft Windows targets, the attribute can be disabled
for functions by setting the <samp><span class="option">-mnop-fun-dllimport</span></samp> flag.

     <br><dt><code>eightbit_data</code><dd><a name="index-eight-bit-data-on-the-H8_002f300_002c-H8_002f300H_002c-and-H8S-1178"></a>Use this attribute on the H8/300, H8/300H, and H8S to indicate that the specified
variable should be placed into the eight bit data section. 
The compiler will generate more efficient code for certain operations
on data in the eight bit data area.  Note the eight bit data area is limited to
256 bytes of data.

     <p>You must use GAS and GLD from GNU binutils version 2.7 or later for
this attribute to work correctly.

     <br><dt><code>exception_handler</code><dd><a name="index-exception-handler-functions-on-the-Blackfin-processor-1179"></a>Use this attribute on the Blackfin to indicate that the specified function
is an exception handler.  The compiler will generate function entry and
exit sequences suitable for use in an exception handler when this
attribute is present.

     <br><dt><code>far</code><dd><a name="index-functions-which-handle-memory-bank-switching-1180"></a>On 68HC11 and 68HC12 the <code>far</code> attribute causes the compiler to
use a calling convention that takes care of switching memory banks when
entering and leaving a function.  This calling convention is also the
default when using the <samp><span class="option">-mlong-calls</span></samp> option.

     <p>On 68HC12 the compiler will use the <code>call</code> and <code>rtc</code> instructions
to call and return from a function.

     <p>On 68HC11 the compiler will generate a sequence of instructions
to invoke a board-specific routine to switch the memory bank and call the
real function.  The board-specific routine simulates a <code>call</code>. 
At the end of a function, it will jump to a board-specific routine
instead of using <code>rts</code>.  The board-specific return routine simulates
the <code>rtc</code>.

     <br><dt><code>fastcall</code><dd><a name="index-functions-that-pop-the-argument-stack-on-the-386-1181"></a>On the Intel 386, the <code>fastcall</code> attribute causes the compiler to
pass the first two arguments in the registers ECX and EDX.  Subsequent
arguments are passed on the stack.  The called function will pop the
arguments off the stack.  If the number of arguments is variable all
arguments are pushed on the stack.

     <br><dt><code>format (</code><var>archetype</var><code>, </code><var>string-index</var><code>, </code><var>first-to-check</var><code>)</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bformat_007d-function-attribute-1182"></a><a name="index-Wformat-1183"></a>The <code>format</code> attribute specifies that a function takes <code>printf</code>,
<code>scanf</code>, <code>strftime</code> or <code>strfmon</code> style arguments which
should be type-checked against a format string.  For example, the
declaration:

     <pre class="smallexample">          extern int
          my_printf (void *my_object, const char *my_format, ...)
                __attribute__ ((format (printf, 2, 3)));
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">causes the compiler to check the arguments in calls to <code>my_printf</code>
for consistency with the <code>printf</code> style format string argument
<code>my_format</code>.

     <p>The parameter <var>archetype</var> determines how the format string is
interpreted, and should be <code>printf</code>, <code>scanf</code>, <code>strftime</code>
or <code>strfmon</code>.  (You can also use <code>__printf__</code>,
<code>__scanf__</code>, <code>__strftime__</code> or <code>__strfmon__</code>.)  The
parameter <var>string-index</var> specifies which argument is the format
string argument (starting from 1), while <var>first-to-check</var> is the
number of the first argument to check against the format string.  For
functions where the arguments are not available to be checked (such as
<code>vprintf</code>), specify the third parameter as zero.  In this case the
compiler only checks the format string for consistency.  For
<code>strftime</code> formats, the third parameter is required to be zero. 
Since non-static C++ methods have an implicit <code>this</code> argument, the
arguments of such methods should be counted from two, not one, when
giving values for <var>string-index</var> and <var>first-to-check</var>.

     <p>In the example above, the format string (<code>my_format</code>) is the second
argument of the function <code>my_print</code>, and the arguments to check
start with the third argument, so the correct parameters for the format
attribute are 2 and 3.

     <p><a name="index-ffreestanding-1184"></a><a name="index-fno_002dbuiltin-1185"></a>The <code>format</code> attribute allows you to identify your own functions
which take format strings as arguments, so that GCC can check the
calls to these functions for errors.  The compiler always (unless
<samp><span class="option">-ffreestanding</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-fno-builtin</span></samp> is used) checks formats
for the standard library functions <code>printf</code>, <code>fprintf</code>,
<code>sprintf</code>, <code>scanf</code>, <code>fscanf</code>, <code>sscanf</code>, <code>strftime</code>,
<code>vprintf</code>, <code>vfprintf</code> and <code>vsprintf</code> whenever such
warnings are requested (using <samp><span class="option">-Wformat</span></samp>), so there is no need to
modify the header file <samp><span class="file">stdio.h</span></samp>.  In C99 mode, the functions
<code>snprintf</code>, <code>vsnprintf</code>, <code>vscanf</code>, <code>vfscanf</code> and
<code>vsscanf</code> are also checked.  Except in strictly conforming C
standard modes, the X/Open function <code>strfmon</code> is also checked as
are <code>printf_unlocked</code> and <code>fprintf_unlocked</code>. 
See <a href="C-Dialect-Options.html#C-Dialect-Options">Options Controlling C Dialect</a>.

     <p>The target may provide additional types of format checks. 
See <a href="Target-Format-Checks.html#Target-Format-Checks">Format Checks Specific to Particular Target Machines</a>.

     <br><dt><code>format_arg (</code><var>string-index</var><code>)</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bformat_005farg_007d-function-attribute-1186"></a><a name="index-Wformat_002dnonliteral-1187"></a>The <code>format_arg</code> attribute specifies that a function takes a format
string for a <code>printf</code>, <code>scanf</code>, <code>strftime</code> or
<code>strfmon</code> style function and modifies it (for example, to translate
it into another language), so the result can be passed to a
<code>printf</code>, <code>scanf</code>, <code>strftime</code> or <code>strfmon</code> style
function (with the remaining arguments to the format function the same
as they would have been for the unmodified string).  For example, the
declaration:

     <pre class="smallexample">          extern char *
          my_dgettext (char *my_domain, const char *my_format)
                __attribute__ ((format_arg (2)));
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">causes the compiler to check the arguments in calls to a <code>printf</code>,
<code>scanf</code>, <code>strftime</code> or <code>strfmon</code> type function, whose
format string argument is a call to the <code>my_dgettext</code> function, for
consistency with the format string argument <code>my_format</code>.  If the
<code>format_arg</code> attribute had not been specified, all the compiler
could tell in such calls to format functions would be that the format
string argument is not constant; this would generate a warning when
<samp><span class="option">-Wformat-nonliteral</span></samp> is used, but the calls could not be checked
without the attribute.

     <p>The parameter <var>string-index</var> specifies which argument is the format
string argument (starting from one).  Since non-static C++ methods have
an implicit <code>this</code> argument, the arguments of such methods should
be counted from two.

     <p>The <code>format-arg</code> attribute allows you to identify your own
functions which modify format strings, so that GCC can check the
calls to <code>printf</code>, <code>scanf</code>, <code>strftime</code> or <code>strfmon</code>
type function whose operands are a call to one of your own function. 
The compiler always treats <code>gettext</code>, <code>dgettext</code>, and
<code>dcgettext</code> in this manner except when strict ISO C support is
requested by <samp><span class="option">-ansi</span></samp> or an appropriate <samp><span class="option">-std</span></samp> option, or
<samp><span class="option">-ffreestanding</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-fno-builtin</span></samp>
is used.  See <a href="C-Dialect-Options.html#C-Dialect-Options">Options Controlling C Dialect</a>.

     <br><dt><code>function_vector</code><dd><a name="index-calling-functions-through-the-function-vector-on-the-H8_002f300-processors-1188"></a>Use this attribute on the H8/300, H8/300H, and H8S to indicate that the specified
function should be called through the function vector.  Calling a
function through the function vector will reduce code size, however;
the function vector has a limited size (maximum 128 entries on the H8/300
and 64 entries on the H8/300H and H8S) and shares space with the interrupt vector.

     <p>You must use GAS and GLD from GNU binutils version 2.7 or later for
this attribute to work correctly.

     <br><dt><code>interrupt</code><dd><a name="index-interrupt-handler-functions-1189"></a>Use this attribute on the ARM, AVR, C4x, M32R/D and Xstormy16 ports to indicate
that the specified function is an interrupt handler.  The compiler will
generate function entry and exit sequences suitable for use in an
interrupt handler when this attribute is present.

     <p>Note, interrupt handlers for the Blackfin, m68k, H8/300, H8/300H, H8S, and
SH processors can be specified via the <code>interrupt_handler</code> attribute.

     <p>Note, on the AVR, interrupts will be enabled inside the function.

     <p>Note, for the ARM, you can specify the kind of interrupt to be handled by
adding an optional parameter to the interrupt attribute like this:

     <pre class="smallexample">          void f () __attribute__ ((interrupt ("IRQ")));
     </pre>
     <p>Permissible values for this parameter are: IRQ, FIQ, SWI, ABORT and UNDEF.

     <br><dt><code>interrupt_handler</code><dd><a name="index-interrupt-handler-functions-on-the-Blackfin_002c-m68k_002c-H8_002f300-and-SH-processors-1190"></a>Use this attribute on the Blackfin, m68k, H8/300, H8/300H, H8S, and SH to
indicate that the specified function is an interrupt handler.  The compiler
will generate function entry and exit sequences suitable for use in an
interrupt handler when this attribute is present.

     <br><dt><code>kspisusp</code><dd><a name="index-User-stack-pointer-in-interrupts-on-the-Blackfin-1191"></a>When used together with <code>interrupt_handler</code>, <code>exception_handler</code>
or <code>nmi_handler</code>, code will be generated to load the stack pointer
from the USP register in the function prologue.

     <!-- APPLE LOCAL Apple customers doesn't care about ARM options. -->
<br><dt><code>longcall/shortcall</code><dd><a name="index-functions-called-via-pointer-on-the-RS_002f6000-and-PowerPC-1192"></a>On the RS/6000 and PowerPC, the <code>longcall</code> attribute causes the
compiler to always call this function via a pointer, just as it would if
the <samp><span class="option">-mlongcall</span></samp> option had been specified.  The <code>shortcall</code>
attribute causes the compiler not to do this.  These attributes override
both the <samp><span class="option">-mlongcall</span></samp> switch and the <code>#pragma longcall</code>

     <br><dt><code>malloc</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bmalloc_007d-attribute-1193"></a>The <code>malloc</code> attribute is used to tell the compiler that a function
may be treated as if any non-<code>NULL</code> pointer it returns cannot
alias any other pointer valid when the function returns. 
This will often improve optimization. 
Standard functions with this property include <code>malloc</code> and
<code>calloc</code>.  <code>realloc</code>-like functions have this property as
long as the old pointer is never referred to (including comparing it
to the new pointer) after the function returns a non-<code>NULL</code>
value.

     <br><dt><code>model (</code><var>model-name</var><code>)</code><dd><a name="index-function-addressability-on-the-M32R_002fD-1194"></a><a name="index-variable-addressability-on-the-IA_002d64-1195"></a>
On the M32R/D, use this attribute to set the addressability of an
object, and of the code generated for a function.  The identifier
<var>model-name</var> is one of <code>small</code>, <code>medium</code>, or
<code>large</code>, representing each of the code models.

     <p>Small model objects live in the lower 16MB of memory (so that their
addresses can be loaded with the <code>ld24</code> instruction), and are
callable with the <code>bl</code> instruction.

     <p>Medium model objects may live anywhere in the 32-bit address space (the
compiler will generate <code>seth/add3</code> instructions to load their addresses),
and are callable with the <code>bl</code> instruction.

     <p>Large model objects may live anywhere in the 32-bit address space (the
compiler will generate <code>seth/add3</code> instructions to load their addresses),
and may not be reachable with the <code>bl</code> instruction (the compiler will
generate the much slower <code>seth/add3/jl</code> instruction sequence).

     <p>On IA-64, use this attribute to set the addressability of an object. 
At present, the only supported identifier for <var>model-name</var> is
<code>small</code>, indicating addressability via &ldquo;small&rdquo; (22-bit)
addresses (so that their addresses can be loaded with the <code>addl</code>
instruction).  Caveat: such addressing is by definition not position
independent and hence this attribute must not be used for objects
defined by shared libraries.

     <br><dt><code>naked</code><dd><a name="index-function-without-a-prologue_002fepilogue-code-1196"></a>Use this attribute on the ARM, AVR, C4x and IP2K ports to indicate that the
specified function does not need prologue/epilogue sequences generated by
the compiler.  It is up to the programmer to provide these sequences.

     <br><dt><code>near</code><dd><a name="index-functions-which-do-not-handle-memory-bank-switching-on-68HC11_002f68HC12-1197"></a>On 68HC11 and 68HC12 the <code>near</code> attribute causes the compiler to
use the normal calling convention based on <code>jsr</code> and <code>rts</code>. 
This attribute can be used to cancel the effect of the <samp><span class="option">-mlong-calls</span></samp>
option.

     <br><dt><code>nesting</code><dd><a name="index-Allow-nesting-in-an-interrupt-handler-on-the-Blackfin-processor_002e-1198"></a>Use this attribute together with <code>interrupt_handler</code>,
<code>exception_handler</code> or <code>nmi_handler</code> to indicate that the function
entry code should enable nested interrupts or exceptions.

     <br><dt><code>nmi_handler</code><dd><a name="index-NMI-handler-functions-on-the-Blackfin-processor-1199"></a>Use this attribute on the Blackfin to indicate that the specified function
is an NMI handler.  The compiler will generate function entry and
exit sequences suitable for use in an NMI handler when this
attribute is present.

     <br><dt><code>no_instrument_function</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bno_005finstrument_005ffunction_007d-function-attribute-1200"></a><a name="index-finstrument_002dfunctions-1201"></a>If <samp><span class="option">-finstrument-functions</span></samp> is given, profiling function calls will
be generated at entry and exit of most user-compiled functions. 
Functions with this attribute will not be so instrumented.

     <br><dt><code>noinline</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bnoinline_007d-function-attribute-1202"></a>This function attribute prevents a function from being considered for
inlining.

     <br><dt><code>nonnull (</code><var>arg-index</var><code>, ...)</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bnonnull_007d-function-attribute-1203"></a>The <code>nonnull</code> attribute specifies that some function parameters should
be non-null pointers.  For instance, the declaration:

     <pre class="smallexample">          extern void *
          my_memcpy (void *dest, const void *src, size_t len)
          	__attribute__((nonnull (1, 2)));
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">causes the compiler to check that, in calls to <code>my_memcpy</code>,
arguments <var>dest</var> and <var>src</var> are non-null.  If the compiler
determines that a null pointer is passed in an argument slot marked
as non-null, and the <samp><span class="option">-Wnonnull</span></samp> option is enabled, a warning
is issued.  The compiler may also choose to make optimizations based
on the knowledge that certain function arguments will not be null.

     <p>If no argument index list is given to the <code>nonnull</code> attribute,
all pointer arguments are marked as non-null.  To illustrate, the
following declaration is equivalent to the previous example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          extern void *
          my_memcpy (void *dest, const void *src, size_t len)
          	__attribute__((nonnull));
     </pre>
     <br><dt><code>noreturn</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bnoreturn_007d-function-attribute-1204"></a>A few standard library functions, such as <code>abort</code> and <code>exit</code>,
cannot return.  GCC knows this automatically.  Some programs define
their own functions that never return.  You can declare them
<code>noreturn</code> to tell the compiler this fact.  For example,

     <pre class="smallexample">          void fatal () __attribute__ ((noreturn));
          
          void
          fatal (/* <span class="roman">...</span> */)
          {
            /* <span class="roman">...</span> */ /* <span class="roman">Print error message.</span> */ /* <span class="roman">...</span> */
            exit (1);
          }
     </pre>
     <p>The <code>noreturn</code> keyword tells the compiler to assume that
<code>fatal</code> cannot return.  It can then optimize without regard to what
would happen if <code>fatal</code> ever did return.  This makes slightly
better code.  More importantly, it helps avoid spurious warnings of
uninitialized variables.

     <p>The <code>noreturn</code> keyword does not affect the exceptional path when that
applies: a <code>noreturn</code>-marked function may still return to the caller
by throwing an exception or calling <code>longjmp</code>.

     <p>Do not assume that registers saved by the calling function are
restored before calling the <code>noreturn</code> function.

     <p>It does not make sense for a <code>noreturn</code> function to have a return
type other than <code>void</code>.

     <p>The attribute <code>noreturn</code> is not implemented in GCC versions
earlier than 2.5.  An alternative way to declare that a function does
not return, which works in the current version and in some older
versions, is as follows:

     <pre class="smallexample">          typedef void voidfn ();
          
          volatile voidfn fatal;
     </pre>
     <p>This approach does not work in GNU C++.

     <br><dt><code>nothrow</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bnothrow_007d-function-attribute-1205"></a>The <code>nothrow</code> attribute is used to inform the compiler that a
function cannot throw an exception.  For example, most functions in
the standard C library can be guaranteed not to throw an exception
with the notable exceptions of <code>qsort</code> and <code>bsearch</code> that
take function pointer arguments.  The <code>nothrow</code> attribute is not
implemented in GCC versions earlier than 3.3.

     <br><dt><code>pure</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bpure_007d-function-attribute-1206"></a>Many functions have no effects except the return value and their
return value depends only on the parameters and/or global variables. 
Such a function can be subject
to common subexpression elimination and loop optimization just as an
arithmetic operator would be.  These functions should be declared
with the attribute <code>pure</code>.  For example,

     <pre class="smallexample">          int square (int) __attribute__ ((pure));
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">says that the hypothetical function <code>square</code> is safe to call
fewer times than the program says.

     <p>Some of common examples of pure functions are <code>strlen</code> or <code>memcmp</code>. 
Interesting non-pure functions are functions with infinite loops or those
depending on volatile memory or other system resource, that may change between
two consecutive calls (such as <code>feof</code> in a multithreading environment).

     <p>The attribute <code>pure</code> is not implemented in GCC versions earlier
than 2.96.

     <br><dt><code>regparm (</code><var>number</var><code>)</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bregparm_007d-attribute-1207"></a><a name="index-functions-that-are-passed-arguments-in-registers-on-the-386-1208"></a>On the Intel 386, the <code>regparm</code> attribute causes the compiler to
pass up to <var>number</var> integer arguments in registers EAX,
EDX, and ECX instead of on the stack.  Functions that take a
variable number of arguments will continue to be passed all of their
arguments on the stack.

     <p>Beware that on some ELF systems this attribute is unsuitable for
global functions in shared libraries with lazy binding (which is the
default).  Lazy binding will send the first call via resolving code in
the loader, which might assume EAX, EDX and ECX can be clobbered, as
per the standard calling conventions.  Solaris 8 is affected by this. 
GNU systems with GLIBC 2.1 or higher, and FreeBSD, are believed to be
safe since the loaders there save all registers.  (Lazy binding can be
disabled with the linker or the loader if desired, to avoid the
problem.)

applied to individual function definitions, generating an alternate
prologue and epilogue that realigns the runtime stack.  This supports
mixing legacy codes that run with a 4-byte aligned stack with modern
codes that keep a 16-byte stack for SSE compatibility.  The alternate
prologue/epilogue is slower and bigger than the regular one, and it
requires one dedicated register for the life of the function.  This
also lowers the number of registers available if used in conjunction
with the <code>regparm</code> attribute.  The <code>force_align_arg_pointer</code>
attribute is incompatible with nested functions; this is considered a
hard error.

     <br><dt><code>section ("</code><var>section-name</var><code>")</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bsection_007d-function-attribute-1211"></a>Normally, the compiler places the code it generates in the <code>text</code> section. 
Sometimes, however, you need additional sections, or you need certain
particular functions to appear in special sections.  The <code>section</code>
attribute specifies that a function lives in a particular section. 
For example, the declaration:

     <pre class="smallexample">          extern void foobar (void) __attribute__ ((section ("bar")));
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">puts the function <code>foobar</code> in the <code>bar</code> section.

     <p>Some file formats do not support arbitrary sections so the <code>section</code>
attribute is not available on all platforms. 
If you need to map the entire contents of a module to a particular
section, consider using the facilities of the linker instead.

     <br><dt><code>sentinel</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bsentinel_007d-function-attribute-1212"></a>This function attribute ensures that a parameter in a function call is
an explicit <code>NULL</code>.  The attribute is only valid on variadic
functions.  By default, the sentinel is located at position zero, the
last parameter of the function call.  If an optional integer position
argument P is supplied to the attribute, the sentinel must be located at
position P counting backwards from the end of the argument list.

     <pre class="smallexample">          __attribute__ ((sentinel))
          is equivalent to
          __attribute__ ((sentinel(0)))
     </pre>
     <p>The attribute is automatically set with a position of 0 for the built-in
functions <code>execl</code> and <code>execlp</code>.  The built-in function
<code>execle</code> has the attribute set with a position of 1.

     <p>A valid <code>NULL</code> in this context is defined as zero with any pointer
type.  If your system defines the <code>NULL</code> macro with an integer type
then you need to add an explicit cast.  GCC replaces <code>stddef.h</code>
with a copy that redefines NULL appropriately.

     <p>The warnings for missing or incorrect sentinels are enabled with

function is a signal handler.  The compiler will generate function
entry and exit sequences suitable for use in a signal handler when this
attribute is present.  Interrupts will be disabled inside the function.

     <!-- APPLE LOCAL begin regparmandstackparm -->
<br><dt><code>regparmandstackparm</code><dd>
This is an X86_32-specific attribute.

     <p>Two entry points will be created for this function.  One will have the
traditional calling convention, and the other will have a mangled name
and a register-based calling convention.

     <p>The register-based calling convention will pass up to four float or
double values in XMM registers, and up to two integral values in
integer registers.  Long double values are still passed on the stack,
and functions returning long double will still use the x87 stacktop.

     <p>Other modules linked with this function may use either entry point. 
If a calling module has seen an extern declaration with the
<code>regparmandstackparm</code> attribute, it will call the register-based
entry point; otherwise, it will use the traditional entry point in the
usual way.

     <p>When taking the address of a <code>regparmandstackparm</code> function, the
address of the traditional entry point will be used.  Calls through
function pointers always use the traditional calling convention.

     <p>The mangled name is currently created by appending &ldquo;$3SSE&rdquo; to the
original function name (before any C++ name-mangling), but users
should not rely upon this.

     <p>The current implementation associates the original function body with
the register-based entry point.  The traditional entry point will load
some registers from the stack and call the register-based entry point. 
This means the traditional entry point will be slightly less efficient
than a function without the <code>regparmandstackparm</code> attribute, and the
generated code will be slightly larger.  Depending upon sizes and
optimization levels, the inliner may inline the register-based body
into the traditional entry point; nothing is done to preclude this. 
If the function was declared <code>static</code>, optimization may discard
the original entry point entirely.

slightly under 32kbytes of data.

     <br><dt><code>trap_exit</code><dd>Use this attribute on the SH for an <code>interrupt_handler</code> to return using

This attribute affects the linkage of the declaration to which it is attached. 
There are four supported <var>visibility_type</var> values: default,
hidden, protected or internal visibility.

     <pre class="smallexample">          void __attribute__ ((visibility ("protected")))
          f () { /* <span class="roman">Do something.</span> */; }
          int i __attribute__ ((visibility ("hidden")));
     </pre>
     <p>The possible values of <var>visibility_type</var> correspond to the
visibility settings in the ELF gABI.

          <dl>
<!-- keep this list of visibilities in alphabetical order. -->

          <dt><dfn>default</dfn><dd>Default visibility is the normal case for the object file format. 
This value is available for the visibility attribute to override other
options that may change the assumed visibility of entities.

          <p>On ELF, default visibility means that the declaration is visible to other
modules and, in shared libraries, means that the declared entity may be
overridden.

          <p>On Darwin, default visibility means that the declaration is visible to
other modules.

          <p>Default visibility corresponds to &ldquo;external linkage&rdquo; in the language.

          <br><dt><dfn>hidden</dfn><dd>Hidden visibility indicates that the entity declared will have a new
form of linkage, which we'll call &ldquo;hidden linkage&rdquo;.  Two
declarations of an object with hidden linkage refer to the same object
if they are in the same shared object.

          <br><dt><dfn>internal</dfn><dd>Internal visibility is like hidden visibility, but with additional
processor specific semantics.  Unless otherwise specified by the
psABI, GCC defines internal visibility to mean that a function is
<em>never</em> called from another module.  Compare this with hidden
functions which, while they cannot be referenced directly by other
modules, can be referenced indirectly via function pointers.  By
indicating that a function cannot be called from outside the module,
GCC may for instance omit the load of a PIC register since it is known
that the calling function loaded the correct value.

          <br><dt><dfn>protected</dfn><dd>Protected visibility is like default visibility except that it
indicates that references within the defining module will bind to the
definition in that module.  That is, the declared entity cannot be
overridden by another module.

     </dl>

     <p>All visibilities are supported on many, but not all, ELF targets
(supported when the assembler supports the `<samp><span class="samp">.visibility</span></samp>'
pseudo-op).  Default visibility is supported everywhere.  Hidden
visibility is supported on Darwin targets.

     <p>The visibility attribute should be applied only to declarations which
would otherwise have external linkage.  The attribute should be applied
consistently, so that the same entity should not be declared with
different settings of the attribute.

     <p>In C++, the visibility attribute applies to types as well as functions
and objects, because in C++ types have linkage.  There are some bugs
in the C++ support for this flag, for example a template which has a
hidden type as a parameter is not properly hidden. 
<!-- bugzilla 26612 -->

     <p>In C++, you can mark member functions and static member variables of a
class with the visibility attribute.  This is useful if if you know a
particular method or static member variable should only be used from
one shared object; then you can mark it hidden while the rest of the
class has default visibility.  Care must be taken to avoid breaking
the One Definition Rule; for example, it is not useful to mark a
method which is defined inside a class definition as hidden without
marking the whole class as hidden.

 <p>These two reasons applied to almost any application that might have been
proposed for <code>#pragma</code>.  It was basically a mistake to use
<code>#pragma</code> for <em>anything</em>.

 <p>The ISO C99 standard includes <code>_Pragma</code>, which now allows pragmas
to be generated from macros.  In addition, a <code>#pragma GCC</code>
namespace is now in use for GCC-specific pragmas.  However, it has been
found convenient to use <code>__attribute__</code> to achieve a natural
attachment of attributes to their corresponding declarations, whereas
<code>#pragma GCC</code> is of use for constructs that do not naturally form
part of the grammar.  See <a href="../cpp/Other-Directives.html#Other-Directives">Miscellaneous Preprocessing Directives</a>.
