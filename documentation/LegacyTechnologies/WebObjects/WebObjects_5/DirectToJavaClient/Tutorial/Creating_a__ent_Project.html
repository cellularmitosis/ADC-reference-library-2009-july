For this tutorial, youuse the Movies and Rentals models included in the example JavaBusinessLogicframework that's installed with WebObjects.</font></p><ol><p><li>Launch ProjectBuilder.<p>The Project Builder application is located in the <code>/Developer/Applications </code>directory. Navigateto that directory and launch the application.</p></li></p><p><li>Create a new project.<p>Choose File &gt; New Project.</p></li></p><p><li>Select the kind of project to create.<p>Select WebObjects/Directto Java Client Application.</p><p>Click Next.</p></li></p><p><li>Name the project.<p>Name the project D2JCTutorial.</p><p>ClickSet and choose a location for the project.</p><p>Click Next.</p></li></p><p><li>Select the frameworks to use.<p>The Assistant includesthe frameworks necessary for Direct to Java Client applications. Forthe tutorial, you add the JavaBusinessLogic framework. It providesclient- and server-side business logic implemented in custom enterpriseobjects.</p><p>Click Add.</p><p>Navigate to the <code>/Library/Frameworks</code> directory.</p><p>Select <code>JavaBusinessLogic.framework</code> andclick Choose.</p><p>Click Next.</p></li></p><p><li>Select the model(s) that the project is to based upon.<p>Directto Java Client technology uses model files to generate applications.To make models available to Direct to Java Client, you add themto your project. You can add models directly to your project byadding them to the Resources group, or you can add them indirectlyby adding frameworks that contain your models.</p><p>The JavaBusinessLogicframework that you added in the previous step already includes theappropriate models, <code>Movies.eomodeld</code> and <code>Rentals.eomodeld</code>.</p><p>ClickNext.</p></li></p><p><li>Build the project.<p>At this point the Assistant has allthe information it needs to create the project. It offers to buildand launch the application for you. However, in this tutorial youdo that manually.</p><p>Deselect "Build and launch projectnow" and click Finish.</p></li></p></ol><a name = "TPXREF102"></a><h3><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande">What'sin a Direct to Java Client Project?</font></h3><p><font face="Times">The project that the Project Builder Assistant created foryou is very similar to a normal Java Client project. It has thetypical Application, Session, and Main classes for the Server target.The Client target, however, has no files associated to it. It hasno interface controller class or nib file, because Direct to JavaClient applications generate their user interfaces dynamically.</font></p><p><font face="Times">The project's <code>Main.wo</code> componentcontains a WOJavaClientApplet that is configured in a special way.It's <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> areset to <code>0</code>, and the <code>applicationClassName</code> isset to "com.webobjects.eogeneration.EODynamicApplication". Theapplication class is important because it's responsible for initiatingthe user interface generation process.</font></p><p><font face="Times">The Resources group of the project contains a <code>user.d2wmodel</code> file.The Direct to Java Client Assistant uses this file to store userinterface configuration information.</font></p><br>    <br><a href="Getting_Sta_Java_Client.html" target="_right"><img src="../Images/previous.gif" border="0" alt="Previous"></a><a href="Building_an_Application.html" target="_right"><img src="../Images/next.gif" border="0" alt="Next"></a>&nbsp;<p><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="1">&#169; 2001 Apple Computer, Inc.</font></p></body></html>
