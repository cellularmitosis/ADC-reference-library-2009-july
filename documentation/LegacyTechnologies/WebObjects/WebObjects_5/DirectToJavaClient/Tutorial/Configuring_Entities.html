However, you might need to make some changesto the way Direct to Java Client classifies your application'sentities. For example, this tutorial application doesn't use theUser entity, so you need to remove it from the list of main entities.</font></p><ol><p><li>Specify theUser entity as an "Other" entity.<p>In the Assistant window,ensure that the "Entities" tab is selected. In the Main Entities list,select User. Click the arrow pointing to the left to move the Userentity from the Main Entities list to the Other Entities list.</p></li></p><p><li>Rearrange the entities.<p>By default, the entities areordered alphabetically. For example, in the Query Window, the Customertab is first, then Movie, and so on. In this application, it makesmore sense to group Movie, Talent, and Studio together and groupCustomer, Unit, and Video.</p><p>In the Main Entities list,select Movie. Click the arrow pointing up to move the Movie entityto the top of the list. Move Talent so it's next in the list,then Studio. Customer, Unit, and Video, in that order, should belast in the list.</p></li></p><p><li>Apply the changes.<p>Click Apply. This updates the Assistant'sin-memory set of rules. The new rules don't affect existing windows,but they are applied when Direct to Java Client generates new user-interfacesin the running client application.</p><p>To see that yourchanges have been recorded in the Assistant's set of rules, chooseTools &gt; New Query Window. The new Query Window that opens doesn'thave a tab for User, and the window's tabs are ordered as youspecified in step 2.</p></li></p><p><li>Restart the application.<p>Click Restart. This restartsthe client application using the Assistant's in-memory set of rules.In the new instance of the application, the Query Window immediatelydisplays the changes you specified.</p><p>Since you can'tupdate an application's existing user interface by applying changes, youcan use Restart to reflect your changes throughout the entire application.If you don't like the changes, you can revert them by clickingRevert.</p></li></p><p><li>Save your changes.<p>Click Save. This updates the set ofrules saved in your project. Once you have saved the changes, youcan no longer revert.</p></li></p></ol><br>    <br><a href="The_Assistant.html" target="_right"><img src="../Images/previous.gif" border="0" alt="Previous"></a><a href="Configuring_Properties.html" target="_right"><img src="../Images/next.gif" border="0" alt="Next"></a>&nbsp;<p><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="1">&#169; 2001 Apple Computer, Inc.</font></p></body></html>
