<h1>Introduction </h1>
</a>The EOAccess framework is one of a group of frameworks known collectively as the Enterprise Objects Framework. The classes and interfaces that make up the EOAccess framework allow your applications to interact with database servers at a high level of abstraction. These classes make up what is known as the <em>access layer</em>. The access layer is divided into two main parts:<p>
<ul><li>The <em>database level</em>, which allows applications to treat records as full-fledged enterprise objects.
<li>The <em>adaptor level</em>, which provides server-independent database access.
</ul>Working with the access layer allows you to have a finer level of control over database operations.<p>

<h3> EOAccess Framework Class Hierarchy</h3>
</a>The EOAccess class hierarchy is rooted in the Foundation Framework's NSObject class (see <a href="EOAccess.html#2946">Figure 1</a>). The remainder of the EOAccess Framework consists of several related groups of classes, a few miscellaneous classes, and a number of interfaces.<p>

<h3> The Database Level</h3>
</a>The database level is where enterprise objects are created from the dictionaries retreived by the adaptor level. It's also where snapshotting is performed. The database level is primarily made up of the following classes:<p>
<ul><li><code>EODatabase</code> is a class that represents a single database server.
<li><code>EODatabaseChannel</code> is a class that represents an independent communication channel to the database server.
<li><code>EODatabaseContext</code> is subclass of EOObjectStore for accessing relational databases, creating and saving objects based on EOEntity definitions in an EOModel.
<li><code>EODatabaseOperation</code> is a class that represents an operation-insert, update, or delete-to perform on an enterprise object and all the necessary information required to perform the operation. 
</ul><a name="2528">
<hr width=25% align=left>
<h3> The Adaptor Level</h3>
</a>The adaptor level deals with database rows packaged as dictionaries. The adaptor level is primarily made up of the following classes:<p>
<ul><li><code>EOAdaptor</code> is an abstract class that provides concrete subclasses with a structure for connecting to a database.
<li><code>EOAdaptorChannel</code> is an abstract class that provides its concrete subclasses with a structure for performing database operations.
<li><code>EOAdaptorContext</code> is an abstract class that defines transaction handling in Enterprise Objects Framework applications.
<li><code>EOAdaptorOperation</code> is a class that represents a primitive operation in a database server and all the necessary information required by the operation.
</ul><a name="2561">

<h3> The Modeling Classes</h3>
</a>A model defines, in entity-relationship terms, the mapping between enterprise object classes and a database. The following are the principal modeling classes in the EOAccess framework:<p>
<ul><li><code>EOAttribute</code> is a class that represents a column, field or property in a database, and associates an internal name with an external name or expression by which the property is known to the database.
<li><code>EOEntity</code> is a class that describes a table in a database and associates a name internal to the Framework with an external name by which the table is known to the database.
<li><code>EOJoin</code> is a class that describes one source-destination attribute pair for an EORelationship. 
<li><code>EOModel</code> is a class that represents a mapping between a database schema and a set of classes based on the entity-relationship model.
<li><code>EOModelGroup</code> is a class that represents an aggregation of related models.
<li><code>EORelationship</code> is a class that describes an association between two entities, based on attributes of those two entities.
</ul><a name="2740">
<hr width=25% align=left>
<h3> Faulting</h3>
</a>These classes implement or are used to implement object faulting:<p>
<code>EOAccessArrayFaultHandler</code> is a subclass of EOAccessGenericFaultHandler that implements a fault for an array of enterprise objects. <p>
<code>EOAccessFaultHandler</code> is a subclass of EOAccessGenericFaultHandler that implements an object fault for enterprise objects. <p>
<code>EOAccessGenericFaultHandler</code> is an abstract class that helps an EOAccessFault to fire by fetching data using an EODatabaseContext.<p>
<a name="2741">
<hr width=25% align=left>
<h3> Additions to Other Frameworks</h3>
</a>The EOAccess framework adds methods to a number of classes in different frameworks:<p>
<code>EOGenericRecord Additions</code> adds one method to the control layer's class, for returning a generic record's associated EOEntity.<p>
<code>EOObjectStoreCoordinator Additions</code> adds two methods to the EOControl class for accessing the coordinator's EOModelGroup.<p>
<code>EOQualifier Additions</code> adds one method to the class, for "rerooting" a qualifier to another entity.<p>
<code>NSString Additions</code> adds two methods to the class, to convert modeling object names to database schema names, and database schema names to modeling object names<p>
<a name="2801">
<hr width=25% align=left>
<h3> Miscellaneous Classes</h3>
</a>The EOAccess framework also has a number of other useful classes, including:<p>
<ul><li><code>EODatabaseDataSource</code> is a concrete subclass of EODataSource that fetches objects based on an EOModel, using an EODatabaseContext that services the data source's EOEditingContext. 
<li><code>EOEntityClassDescription</code> is a subclass of the control layer's EOClassDescription and extends the behavior of enterprise objects by deriving information about them from an associated EOModel.
<li><code>EOLoginPanel</code> is an abstract class that defines how users provide database login information.
<li><code>EOSQLExpression</code> is an abstract superclass that defines how to build SQL statements for adaptor channels.
<li><code>EOSQLQualifier</code> is a subclass of EOQualifier that contains unstructured text that can be transformed into an SQL expression.
<li><code>EOStoredProcedure</code> is a class that represents a stored procedure defined in a database, and associates a name internal to EOF with an external name known to the database.
</ul><a name="2799">
<hr width=25% align=left>
<h3> Delegates</h3>
</a>A number of EOAccess classes delegate behavior. The delegate methods are defined in these Java interfaces:<p>
<ul><li>An <code>EOAdaptorChannel </code>delegate receives messages for nearly every operation that would affect data in the database server, and it can preempt, modify, or track these operations.
<li>A <code>EOAdaptorContext </code>delegate receives messages for any transaction begin, commit, or rollback, and it can preempt, modify, or track these operations.
<li>An <code>EOAdaptor</code> delegate implements a method that can perform a database-specific transformations on a value.
<li>An <code>EODatabaseContext</code> delegate can intervene when objects are created and when they're fetched from the database.
<li>An <code>EOModelGroupClass</code> delegate implements a method that returns the default model group. 
<li>An <code>EOModelGroup</code> delegate influences how the model group finds and loads models.
<li><B>Miscellaneous Interfaces </B><code>EOCustomClassArchiving</code> is an informal protocol that defines methods that can write any object that conforms to NSCoding to the database as binary data, as generated by NSArchiver.
<li><code>EOUtilities</code> is a collection of convenience methods intended to make common operations with EOF easier.
<li><code>EOPropertyListEncoding</code> declares methods that read and write objects to property lists.
<li><code>EOQualifierSQLGeneration</code> declares two methods that are adopted by qualifier classes to qualify fetches from a database.
