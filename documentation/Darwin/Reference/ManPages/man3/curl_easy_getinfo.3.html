curl_easy_getinfo(3)                           libcurl Manual                           curl_easy_getinfo(3)



<b>NAME</b>
       curl_easy_getinfo - extract information from a curl handle

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;curl/curl.h&gt;</b>

       <b>CURLcode</b> <b>curl_easy_getinfo(CURL</b> <b>*curl,</b> <b>CURLINFO</b> <b>info,</b> <b>...</b> <b>);</b>


<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       Request  internal information from the curl session with this function.  The third argument <b>MUST</b> be a
       pointer to a long, a pointer to a char *, a pointer to a struct curl_slist * or a pointer to a double
       (as  this  documentation  describes further down).  The data pointed-to will be filled in accordingly
       and can be relied upon only if the function returns CURLE_OK.  Use this function  AFTER  a  performed
       transfer if you want to get transfer- oriented data.

       You should not free the memory returned by this function unless it is explicitly mentioned below.

<b>AVAILABLE</b> <b>INFORMATION</b>
       The following information can be extracted:

       CURLINFO_EFFECTIVE_URL
              Pass a pointer to a 'char *' to receive the last used effective URL.

       CURLINFO_RESPONSE_CODE
              Pass  a pointer to a long to receive the last received HTTP or FTP code. This option was known
              as CURLINFO_HTTP_CODE in libcurl 7.10.7 and earlier. This will be zero if no  server  response
              code   has  been  received.  Note  that  a  proxy's  CONNECT  response  should  be  read  with
              <u>CURLINFO</u><b>_</b><u>HTTP</u><b>_</b><u>CONNECTCODE</u> and not this.

       CURLINFO_HTTP_CONNECTCODE
              Pass a pointer to a long to receive the  last  received  proxy  response  code  to  a  CONNECT
              request.

       CURLINFO_FILETIME
              Pass  a  pointer  to a long to receive the remote time of the retrieved document (in number of
              seconds since 1 jan 1970 in the GMT/UTC time zone). If you get -1, it can be because  of  many
              reasons  (unknown,  the  server  hides it or the server doesn't support the command that tells
              document time etc) and the time of the document is unknown. Note that you must tell the server
              to  collect this information before the transfer is made, by using the CURLOPT_FILETIME option
              to <a href="curl_easy_setopt.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/curl_easy_setopt"><u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>easy</u><b>_</b><u>setopt(3)</u></a><u></u> or you will unconditionally get a -1 back. (Added in 7.5)

       CURLINFO_TOTAL_TIME
              Pass a pointer to a double to receive the total time in seconds  for  the  previous  transfer,
              including name resolving, TCP connect etc.

       CURLINFO_NAMELOOKUP_TIME
              Pass  a  pointer to a double to receive the time, in seconds, it took from the start until the
              name resolving was completed.

       CURLINFO_CONNECT_TIME
              Pass a pointer to a double to receive the time, in seconds, it took from the start  until  the
              connect to the remote host (or proxy) was completed.

       CURLINFO_PRETRANSFER_TIME
              Pass  a  pointer to a double to receive the time, in seconds, it took from the start until the
              file transfer is just about to begin. This includes all pre-transfer commands and negotiations
              that are specific to the particular <!-- a -->protocol(s)<!-- /a --> involved.

       CURLINFO_STARTTRANSFER_TIME
              Pass  a  pointer to a double to receive the time, in seconds, it took from the start until the
              first byte is just about to be transferred. This includes CURLINFO_PRETRANSFER_TIME  and  also
              the time the server needs to calculate the result.

       CURLINFO_REDIRECT_TIME
              Pass  a pointer to a double to receive the total time, in seconds, it took for all redirection
              steps include name lookup, connect, pretransfer and  transfer  before  final  transaction  was
              started.  CURLINFO_REDIRECT_TIME  contains  the  complete execution time for multiple redirec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tions.&nbsp;redirections.</font>
              tions.  (Added in 7.9.7)

       CURLINFO_REDIRECT_COUNT
              Pass a pointer to a long to receive the total number of redirections that were  actually  fol-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lowed.&nbsp;followed.</font>
              lowed.  (Added in 7.9.7)

       CURLINFO_SIZE_UPLOAD
              Pass a pointer to a double to receive the total amount of bytes that were uploaded.

       CURLINFO_SIZE_DOWNLOAD
              Pass  a  pointer  to  a  double to receive the total amount of bytes that were downloaded. The
              amount is only for the latest transfer and will be reset again for each new transfer.

       CURLINFO_SPEED_DOWNLOAD
              Pass a pointer to a double to receive the average download speed that curl  measured  for  the
              complete download. Measured in bytes/second.

       CURLINFO_SPEED_UPLOAD
              Pass a pointer to a double to receive the average upload speed that curl measured for the com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">plete&nbsp;complete</font>
              plete upload. Measured in bytes/second.

       CURLINFO_HEADER_SIZE
              Pass a pointer to a long to receive the total size of all the headers  received.  Measured  in
              number of bytes.

       CURLINFO_REQUEST_SIZE
              Pass a pointer to a long to receive the total size of the issued requests. This is so far only
              for HTTP requests. Note that this may be more than one request if FOLLOWLOCATION is true.

       CURLINFO_SSL_VERIFYRESULT
              Pass a pointer to a long to receive the result of  the  certification  verification  that  was
              requested (using the CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER option to <a href="curl_easy_setopt.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/curl_easy_setopt"><u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>easy</u><b>_</b><u>setopt(3)</u></a><u></u>).

       CURLINFO_SSL_ENGINES
              Pass the address of a 'struct curl_slist *' to receive a linked-list of OpenSSL crypto-engines
              supported. Note that engines are normally implemented in separate dynamic libraries. Hence not
              all   the   returned   engines   may   be   available   at   run-time.  <b>NOTE:</b>  you  must  call
              <a href="curl_slist_free_all.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/curl_slist_free_all"><u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>slist</u><b>_</b><u>free</u><b>_</b><u>all(3)</u></a><u></u> on the list pointer once you're done with it, as libcurl will not  free
              the data for you. (Added in 7.12.3)

       CURLINFO_CONTENT_LENGTH_DOWNLOAD
              Pass  a  pointer  to a double to receive the content-length of the download. This is the value
              read from the Content-Length: field.

       CURLINFO_CONTENT_LENGTH_UPLOAD
              Pass a pointer to a double to receive the specified size of the upload.

       CURLINFO_CONTENT_TYPE
              Pass a pointer to a 'char *' to receive the content-type of the downloaded object. This is the
              value read from the Content-Type: field. If you get NULL, it means that the server didn't send
              a valid Content-Type header or that the protocol used doesn't support this.

       CURLINFO_PRIVATE
              Pass a pointer to a 'char *' to receive the pointer to the private data  associated  with  the
              curl handle (set with the CURLOPT_PRIVATE option to <a href="curl_easy_setopt.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/curl_easy_setopt"><u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>easy</u><b>_</b><u>setopt(3)</u></a><u></u>). (Added in 7.10.3)

       CURLINFO_HTTPAUTH_AVAIL
              Pass  a  pointer to a long to receive a bitmask indicating the authentication <!-- a -->method(s)<!-- /a --> avail-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able.&nbsp;available.</font>
              able.  The  meaning  of  the  bits  is  explained   in   the   CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH   option   for
              <a href="curl_easy_setopt.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/curl_easy_setopt"><u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>easy</u><b>_</b><u>setopt(3)</u></a><u></u>.  (Added in 7.10.8)

       CURLINFO_PROXYAUTH_AVAIL
              Pass  a  pointer to a long to receive a bitmask indicating the authentication <!-- a -->method(s)<!-- /a --> avail-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able&nbsp;available</font>
              able for your proxy authentication.  (Added in 7.10.8)

       CURLINFO_OS_ERRNO
              Pass a pointer to a long to receive the errno variable from  a  connect  failure.   (Added  in
              7.12.2)

       CURLINFO_NUM_CONNECTS
              Pass  a pointer to a long to receive how many new connections libcurl had to create to achieve
              the previous transfer (only the successful connects are counted).  Combined with  <u>CURLINFO</u><b>_</b><u>RE</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">DIRECT_COUNT&nbsp;CURLINFO_REDIRECT_COUNT</font>
              <u>DIRECT</u><b>_</b><u>COUNT</u>  you are able to know how many times libcurl successfully reused existing <!-- a -->connec<!-- /a -->-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion(s)&nbsp;connection(s)</font>
              <!-- a -->tion(s)<!-- /a --> or not.  See the Connection Options of <a href="curl_easy_setopt.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/curl_easy_setopt"><u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>easy</u><b>_</b><u>setopt(3)</u></a><u></u> to see how libcurl tries to
              make persistent connections to save time.  (Added in 7.12.3)

       CURLINFO_COOKIELIST
              Pass  a  pointer to a 'struct curl_slist *' to receive a linked-list of all cookies cURL knows
              (expired ones, too). Don't forget to <a href="curl_slist_free_all.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/curl_slist_free_all"><u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>slist</u><b>_</b><u>free</u><b>_</b><u>all(3)</u></a><u></u> the list after it has  been  used.
              If there are no cookies (cookies for the handle have not been enabled or simply none have been
              received) 'struct curl_slist *' will be set to point to NULL. (Added in 7.14.1)

       CURLINFO_LASTSOCKET
              Pass a pointer to a long to receive the last socket used by this curl session. If  the  socket
              is  no  longer  valid,  -1 is returned. When you finish working with the socket, you must call
              curl_easy_cleanup() as usual and let libcurl close the  socket  and  cleanup  other  resources
              associated  with  the handle. This is typically used in combination with <u>CURLOPT</u><b>_</b><u>CONNECT</u><b>_</b><u>ONLY</u>.
              (Added in 7.15.2)

       CURLINFO_FTP_ENTRY_PATH
              Pass a pointer to a 'char *' to receive a pointer to a string holding the path  of  the  entry
              path.  That  is the initial path libcurl ended up in when logging on to the remote FTP server.
              This stores a NULL as pointer if something is wrong. (Added in 7.15.4)

<b>TIMES</b>
       An overview of the six time values available from curl_easy_getinfo()

       curl_easy_perform()
           |
           |--NT
           |--|--CT
           |--|--|--PT
           |--|--|--|--ST
           |--|--|--|--|--TT
           |--|--|--|--|--RT

       NT     <u>CURLINFO</u><b>_</b><u>NAMELOOKUP</u><b>_</b><u>TIME</u>. The time it took from the start until the name  resolving  was  com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pleted.&nbsp;completed.</font>
              pleted.

       CT     <u>CURLINFO</u><b>_</b><u>CONNECT</u><b>_</b><u>TIME</u>.  The  time  it took from the start until the connect to the remote host
              (or proxy) was completed.

       PT     <u>CURLINFO</u><b>_</b><u>PRETRANSFER</u><b>_</b><u>TIME</u>. The time it took from the start until the  file  transfer  is  just
              about  to begin. This includes all pre-transfer commands and negotiations that are specific to
              the particular <!-- a -->protocol(s)<!-- /a --> involved.

       ST     <u>CURLINFO</u><b>_</b><u>STARTTRANSFER</u><b>_</b><u>TIME</u>. The time it took from the start until  the  first  byte  is  just
              about to be transferred.

       TT     <u>CURLINFO</u><b>_</b><u>TOTAL</u><b>_</b><u>TIME</u>. Total time of the previous request.

       RT     <u>CURLINFO</u><b>_</b><u>REDIRECT</u><b>_</b><u>TIME</u>.  The  time it took for all redirection steps include name lookup, con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nect,&nbsp;connect,</font>
              nect, pretransfer and transfer before final transaction was started. So, this is  zero  if  no
              redirection took place.

<b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b>
       If  the  operation  was successful, CURLE_OK is returned. Otherwise an appropriate error code will be
       returned.
