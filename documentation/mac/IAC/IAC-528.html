 <B>resume dispatch function</B>  An application-defined function called by <CODE>OSADoEvent</CODE> or <CODE>OSAExecuteEvent</CODE> to dispatch an Apple event directly to an application's default handler for that event.<P>
 <B>script</B>  Any collection of data that, when executed by the appropriate program, causes a corresponding action or series of actions. When a scripting component that supports the OSA executes a script, it sends Apple events as necessary to trigger actions in server applications.<P>
 <B>scriptable application</B>  An application that can respond as a server application to Apple events sent to it by scripting components. To be scriptable, an application must respond to the appropriate standard Apple events, and it must provide an <CODE>'aete'</CODE> resource that describes the nature of that support. See also <B>Apple event user terminology resources.</B><P>
 <B>script application</B>  A script file with the file type <CODE>'APPL'</CODE> that contains the script data as a resource of type <CODE>'scpt'</CODE>. If a script application has the creator signature <CODE>'aplt'</CODE>, a user can double-click its icon to trigger the script. If a script application has the creator signature <CODE>'dplt'</CODE>, a user can drag the icon for another file or a folder over the script application's icon to trigger its script. By default, when a user triggers the script in a script application, a splash screen appears that allows the user either to quit or to run the script. Users can also save a script application in a form that bypasses the splash screen, running the script immediately after the user double-clicks its icon.<P>
 <B>script application component</B>  A component registered with the Component Manager at system startup. When a user opens a script application, the script application component loads the script and passes the resulting script ID to the appropriate scripting component for execution.<P>
 <B>script comment</B>  A description, in a script editor window, of what the script displayed in that window does.<P>
 <B>script context</B>  A form of script that maintains context information for the execution of other scripts. A script context can also be used to handle Apple events. Like a compiled script, a script context can be decompiled as source data. In the AppleScript scripting language, a script context is called a <CODE>script object</CODE>.<P>
 <B>script data</B>  A compiled script, script value, script context, or any other representation of a script in memory used internally by a scripting component. See also <B>compiled script, script context, script value.</B><P>
 <B>script editor</B>  An application that allows users to record, edit, save, and execute scripts; for example, the Script Editor application provided with AppleScript.<P>
 <B>script file</B>  A file in which a script is stored. A script file can be a compiled script file, a script application file, or a script text file.<P>
 <B>script ID</B>  A data structure of type <CODE>OSAID</CODE>--that is, a long integer--used by scripting components to keep track of script data.<P>
 <B>scripting</B>  Writing and executing scripts to control the behavior of multiple applications.<P>
 <B>scripting component</B>  A component that responds appropriately to calls made to the standard scripting component routines. Most scripting components implement scripting languages; for example, the AppleScript component implements the AppleScript scripting language.<P>
 <B>script object</B>  AppleScript term for script context. See also <B>script context.</B><P>
 <B>script text file</B>  Uncompiled statements in a scripting language saved by a script editor as a text file. A user must open a script text file in a script editor and successfully compile it before it will execute. See also <B>script editor.</B><P>
 <B>script value</B>  An integer, a string, a Boolean value, a constant, a <CODE>'PICT'</CODE>, or any other fixed data that a scripting component returns or uses in the course of executing a script.<P>
 <B>section</B>  A document or portion of a document that shares its contents with other documents. The Edition Manager supports two types of sections: publishers and subscribers. A publisher makes its data available to share and a subscriber subscribes to available data. See also <B>publisher, subscriber.</B><P>
 <B>send function</B>  A function called by a scripting component whenever it sends an Apple event during script execution. You can provide an alternative send function if you want your application to perform some action instead of or in addition to sending Apple events. If you don't provide an alternative send function, scripting components call the standard Apple Event Manager function <CODE>AESend</CODE> with default parameters.<P>
 <B>server application</B>  An application that responds to Apple events requesting a service or information sent by client applications or scripting components (for example, by printing a list of files, checking the spelling of a list of words, or performing a numeric calculation). Apple event servers and clients can reside on the same local computer or on remote computers connected to a network.<P>
 <B>session</B>  (1) A logical (as opposed to physical) connection between two entities (such as a Macintosh program and a database server) that facilitates the transmission of information between the two entities. (2) In the PPC Toolbox, an exchange of information between one open application with a port and another open application with a port. Sessions can occur between applications that are located on the same computer or across a network. An application has the option to accept or reject a session request. Authentication of the requesting user may be required before a session can commence. See also <B>authentication, message block, port.</B><P>
 <B>session ID</B>  A number that uniquely identifies a <B>session.</B><P>
 <B>source application</B>  The application that sends a particular Apple event to another application or to itself. Typically, an Apple event client sends an Apple event requesting a service from an Apple event server; in this case, the client is the source application for the Apple event. The Apple event server may return a different Apple event as a reply; in this case, the server is the source for the reply Apple event.<P>
 <B>source data</B>  Statements in a scripting language that constitute an uncompiled script.<P>
 <B>special handler dispatch table</B>  A table in either the application heap or the system heap that the Apple Event Manager uses to keep track of various specialized handlers.<P>
 <B>status routine</B>  An application-defined routine that can update windows, check the results of the low-level calls made by the Data Access Manager's <CODE>DBStartQuery</CODE> and <CODE>DBGetQueryResults</CODE> functions, and cancel execution of these functions when appropriate to do so.<P>
 <B>subclass</B>  An object class that inherits properties, element classes, and Apple events from another object class--its superclass. A subclass can also include properties, element classes, or Apple events that are not inherited from its superclass. Every object class, with the exception of <CODE>cObject</CODE>, is a subclass of another object class. See also <B>object class, superclass.</B><P>
 <B>subscribe</B>  To obtain data that a publisher makes available in an edition. A user subscribes to a publisher by choosing Subscribe To from the Edit menu and selecting the desired edition. See also <B>edition, publish.</B><P>
 <B>subscriber</B>  A portion of a document that automatically obtains current data from other documents and applications. A subscriber reads data from an edition. See also <B>edition, section.</B><P>
 <B>suite</B>  In the A<I>pple Event Registry: Standard Suites,</I> a group of definitions for Apple events, object classes, primitive object classes, descriptor types, and constants that are all used for a set of related activities. For example, the Text suite includes definitions of Apple events, object classes, and so on that are used for text processing.<P>
 <B>superclass</B>  The object class from which a subclass inherits properties, elements, and Apple events. See also <B>object class, subclass.</B><P>
 <B>system Apple event dispatch table</B>  See <B>Apple event dispatch table.</B><P>
 <B>system coercion dispatch table</B>  See <B>coercion handler dispatch table.</B><P>
 <B>system object accessor dispatch table</B>  See <B>object accessor dispatch table.</B><P>
 <B>system result handler</B>  A result handler that is available to all applications that use the system. Compare with <B>application result handler.</B><P>
 <B>target address</B>  An application signature, a process serial number, a session ID, a target ID record, or some other application-defined type that identifies the target of an Apple event.<P>
 <B>target application</B>  The application addressed to receive an Apple event. Typically, an Apple event client sends an Apple event requesting a service from a server application; in this case, the server is the target application of the Apple event. The server application may return a different Apple event as a reply; in this case, the client is the target of the reply Apple event.<P>
 <B>token</B>  A descriptor record returned by an object accessor function that identifies a requested Apple event object in a specified container.<P>
 <B>token disposal function</B>  An object callback function that disposes of a token.<P>
 <B>transaction</B>  A sequence of Apple events sent back and forth between the client and server applications, beginning with the client's initial request for a service. All Apple events that are part of one transaction must have the same transaction ID.<P>
 <B>whose descriptor record</B>   A coerced AE record of descriptor type <CODE>typeWhoseDescriptor</CODE>. The Apple Event Manager creates whose descriptor records when it resolves object specifier records that specify <CODE>formTest</CODE>.<P>
 <B>whose range descriptor record</B>  A coerced AE record of type <CODE>typeWhoseRange</CODE>. Under certain conditions, the Apple Event Manager coerces a range descriptor record to a whose range descriptor record when it resolves object specifier records that specify <CODE>formTest</CODE>.<P>
