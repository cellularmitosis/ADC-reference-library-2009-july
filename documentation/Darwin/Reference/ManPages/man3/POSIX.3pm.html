<b>NAME</b>
       POSIX - Perl interface to IEEE Std 1003.1

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
           use POSIX;
           use POSIX qw(setsid);
           use POSIX qw(:errno_h :fcntl_h);

           printf "EINTR is %d\n", EINTR;

           $sess_id = POSIX::setsid();

           $fd = POSIX::open($path, O_CREAT|O_EXCL|O_WRONLY, 0644);
               # note: that's a filedescriptor, *NOT* a filehandle

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The POSIX module permits you to access all (or nearly all) the standard POSIX 1003.1 identifiers.
       Many of these identifiers have been given Perl-ish interfaces.

       <u>Everything</u> <u>is</u> <u>exported</u> <u>by</u> <u>default</u> with the exception of any POSIX functions with the same name as a
       built-in Perl function, such as "abs", "alarm", "rmdir", "write", etc.., which will be exported only
       if you ask for them explicitly.  This is an unfortunate backwards compatibility feature.  You can
       stop the exporting by saying "use POSIX ()" and then use the fully qualified names (ie.
       "POSIX::SEEK_END").

       This document gives a condensed list of the features available in the POSIX module.  Consult your
       operating system's manpages for general information on most features.  Consult perlfunc for functions
       which are noted as being identical to Perl's builtin functions.

       The first section describes POSIX functions from the 1003.1 specification.  The second section
       describes some classes for signal objects, TTY objects, and other miscellaneous objects.  The remain-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;remaining</font>
       ing sections list various constants and macros in an organization which roughly follows IEEE Std
       1003.1b-1993.

<b>NOTE</b>
       The POSIX module is probably the most complex Perl module supplied with the standard distribution.
       It incorporates autoloading, namespace games, and dynamic loading of code that's in Perl, C, or both.
       It's a great source of wisdom.

<b>CAVEATS</b>
       A few functions are not implemented because they are C specific.  If you attempt to call these, they
       will print a message telling you that they aren't implemented, and suggest using the Perl equivalent
       should one exist.  For example, trying to access the <u>setjmp()</u> call will elicit the message "<u>setjmp()</u>
       is C-specific: use eval {} instead".

       Furthermore, some evil vendors will claim 1003.1 compliance, but in fact are not so: they will not
       pass the PCTS (POSIX Compliance Test Suites).  For example, one vendor may not define EDEADLK, or the
       semantics of the errno values set by <a href="../man2/open.2.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/2/open"><u>open</u>(2)</a> might not be quite right.  Perl does not attempt to ver-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ify&nbsp;verify</font>
       ify POSIX compliance.  That means you can currently successfully say "use POSIX",  and then later in
       your program you find that your vendor has been lax and there's no usable ICANON macro after all.
       This could be construed to be a bug.

<b>FUNCTIONS</b>
       _exit   This is identical to the C function "_exit()".  It exits the program immediately which means
               among other things buffered I/O is <b>not</b> flushed.

               Note that when using threads and in Linux this is <b>not</b> a good way to exit a thread because in
               Linux processes and threads are kind of the same thing (Note: while this is the situation in
               early 2003 there are projects under way to have threads with more POSIXly semantics in
               Linux).  If you want not to return from a thread, detach the thread.

       abort   This is identical to the C function "abort()".  It terminates the process with a "SIGABRT"
               signal unless caught by a signal handler or if the handler does not return normally (it e.g.
               does a "longjmp").

       abs     This is identical to Perl's builtin "abs()" function, returning the absolute value of its
               numerical argument.

       access  Determines the accessibility of a file.

                       if( POSIX::access( "/", &amp;POSIX::R_OK ) ){
                               print "have read permission\n";
                       }

               Returns "undef" on failure.  Note: do not use "access()" for security purposes.  Between the
               "access()" call and the operation you are preparing for the permissions might change: a clas-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sic&nbsp;classic</font>
               sic <u>race</u> <u>condition</u>.

       acos    This is identical to the C function "acos()", returning the arcus cosine of its numerical
               argument.  See also Math::Trig.

       alarm   This is identical to Perl's builtin "alarm()" function, either for arming or disarming the
               "SIGARLM" timer.

       asctime This is identical to the C function "asctime()".  It returns a string of the form

                       "Fri Jun  2 18:22:13 2000\n\0"

               and it is called thusly

                       $asctime = asctime($sec, $min, $hour, $mday, $mon, $year,
                                          $wday, $yday, $isdst);

               The $mon is zero-based: January equals 0.  The $year is 1900-based: 2001 equals 101.  The
               $wday, $yday, and $isdst default to zero (and the first two are usually ignored anyway).

       asin    This is identical to the C function "asin()", returning the arcus sine of its numerical argu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment.&nbsp;argument.</font>
               ment.  See also Math::Trig.

       assert  Unimplemented, but you can use "die" in perlfunc and the Carp module to achieve similar
               things.

       atan    This is identical to the C function "atan()", returning the arcus tangent of its numerical
               argument.  See also Math::Trig.

       atan2   This is identical to Perl's builtin "atan2()" function, returning the arcus tangent defined
               by its two numerical arguments, the <u>y</u> coordinate and the <u>x</u> coordinate.  See also Math::Trig.

       atexit  <u>atexit()</u> is C-specific: use "END {}" instead, see perlsub.

       atof    <u>atof()</u> is C-specific.  Perl converts strings to numbers transparently.  If you need to force
               a scalar to a number, add a zero to it.

       atoi    <u>atoi()</u> is C-specific.  Perl converts strings to numbers transparently.  If you need to force
               a scalar to a number, add a zero to it.  If you need to have just the integer part, see "int"
               in perlfunc.

       atol    <u>atol()</u> is C-specific.  Perl converts strings to numbers transparently.  If you need to force
               a scalar to a number, add a zero to it.  If you need to have just the integer part, see "int"
               in perlfunc.

       bsearch <u>bsearch()</u> not supplied.  For doing binary search on wordlists, see Search::Dict.

       calloc  <u>calloc()</u> is C-specific.  Perl does memory management transparently.

       ceil    This is identical to the C function "ceil()", returning the smallest integer value greater
               than or equal to the given numerical argument.

       chdir   This is identical to Perl's builtin "chdir()" function, allowing one to change the working
               (default) directory, see "chdir" in perlfunc.

               directory owners and groups, see "chown" in perlfunc.

       clearerr
               Use the method "IO::Handle::clearerr()" instead, to reset the error state (if any) and EOF
               state (if any) of the given stream.

       clock   This is identical to the C function "clock()", returning the amount of spent processor time
               in microseconds.

       close   Close the file.  This uses file descriptors such as those obtained by calling "POSIX::open".

                       $fd = POSIX::open( "foo", &amp;POSIX::O_RDONLY );
                       POSIX::close( $fd );

               Returns "undef" on failure.

               See also "close" in perlfunc.

       closedir
               This is identical to Perl's builtin "closedir()" function for closing a directory handle, see
               "closedir" in perlfunc.

       cos     This is identical to Perl's builtin "cos()" function, for returning the cosine of its numeri-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cal&nbsp;numerical</font>
               cal argument, see "cos" in perlfunc.  See also Math::Trig.

       cosh    This is identical to the C function "cosh()", for returning the hyperbolic cosine of its
               numeric argument.  See also Math::Trig.

       creat   Create a new file.  This returns a file descriptor like the ones returned by "POSIX::open".
               Use "POSIX::close" to close the file.

                       $fd = POSIX::creat( "foo", 0611 );
                       POSIX::close( $fd );

               See also "sysopen" in perlfunc and its "O_CREAT" flag.

                       $name = POSIX::cuserid();

       difftime
               This is identical to the C function "difftime()", for returning the time difference (in sec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">onds)&nbsp;seconds)</font>
               onds) between two times (as returned by "time()"), see "time".

       div     <u>div()</u> is C-specific, use "int" in perlfunc on the usual "/" division and the modulus "%".

       dup     This is similar to the C function "dup()", for duplicating a file descriptor.

               This uses file descriptors such as those obtained by calling "POSIX::open".

               Returns "undef" on failure.

       dup2    This is similar to the C function "dup2()", for duplicating a file descriptor to an another
               known file descriptor.

               This uses file descriptors such as those obtained by calling "POSIX::open".

               Returns "undef" on failure.

               "readline" in perlfunc.

               <b>NOTE</b>: if you have C programs that still use "gets()", be very afraid.  The "gets()" function
               is a source of endless grief because it has no buffer overrun checks.  It should <b>never</b> be
               used.  The "fgets()" function should be preferred instead.

               not 1; Sunday is 0, not 1; January 1st is 0, not 1.  The year ("year") is given in years
               since 1900.  I.e. The year 1995 is 95; the year 2001 is 101.  Consult your system's

               Returns "undef" on failure.

       offsetof
               <u>offsetof()</u> is C-specific, you probably want to see "pack" in perlfunc instead.

               Use "POSIX::close" to close the file.

               Open a file read-only with mode 0666.

                       $fd = POSIX::open( "foo" );

               Returns "undef" on failure.

       pathconf
               Retrieves the value of a configurable limit on a file or directory.

                       $path_max = POSIX::pathconf( "/var", &amp;POSIX::_PC_PATH_MAX );

               Returns "undef" on failure.

       pause   This is similar to the C function "pause()", which suspends the execution of the current

               Returns "undef" on failure.

       perror  This is identical to the C function "perror()", which outputs to the standard error stream
               the specified message followed by ": " and the current error string.  Use the "warn()" func-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;function</font>
               tion and the $!  variable instead, see "warn" in perlfunc and "$ERRNO" in perlvar.

       pipe    Create an interprocess channel.  This returns file descriptors like those returned by
               "POSIX::open".

               "$PID" in perlvar.

       rand    "rand()" is non-portable, see "rand" in perlfunc instead.

       read    Read from a file.  This uses file descriptors such as those obtained by calling
               "POSIX::open".  If the buffer $buf is not large enough for the read then Perl will extend it
               to make room for the request.

                       $fd = POSIX::open( "foo", &amp;POSIX::O_RDONLY );
                       $bytes = POSIX::read( $fd, $buf, 3 );

       scanf   <u>scanf()</u> is C-specific, use &lt;&gt; and regular expressions instead, see perlre.

       setgid  Sets the real group identifier and the effective group identifier for this process.  Similar
               to assigning a value to the Perl's builtin $) variable, see "$GID" in perlvar, except that
               the latter will change only the real user identifier, and that the <u>setgid()</u> uses only a sin-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">gle&nbsp;single</font>
               gle numeric argument, as opposed to a space-separated list of numbers.

       setjmp  "setjmp()" is C-specific: use "eval {}" instead, see "eval" in perlfunc.

       setlocale
               Modifies and queries program's locale.  The following examples assume

                       use POSIX qw(setlocale LC_ALL LC_CTYPE);

               has been issued.

               The following will set the traditional UNIX system locale behavior (the second argument "C").

                       $loc = setlocale( LC_ALL, "C" );

               The following will query the current LC_CTYPE category.  (No second argument means 'query'.)

                       $loc = setlocale( LC_CTYPE );

               The following will set the LC_CTYPE behaviour according to the locale environment variables
               (the second argument "").  Please see your systems <a href="setlocale.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/setlocale">setlocale(3)</a> documentation for the locale
               environment variables' meaning or consult perllocale.

                       $loc = setlocale( LC_CTYPE, "" );

               The following will set the LC_COLLATE behaviour to Argentinian Spanish. <b>NOTE</b>: The naming and
               availability of locales depends on your operating system. Please consult perllocale for how
               to find out which locales are available in your system.

                       $loc = setlocale( LC_ALL, "es_AR.ISO8859-1" );

       setpgid This is similar to the C function "setpgid()" for setting the process group identifier of the
               current process.

               Returns "undef" on failure.

       setsid  This is identical to the C function "setsid()" for setting the session identifier of the cur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rent&nbsp;current</font>
               rent process.

       setuid  Sets the real user identifier and the effective user identifier for this process.  Similar to
               assigning a value to the Perl's builtin $&lt; variable, see "$UID" in perlvar, except that the
               latter will change only the real user identifier.

       sigaction
               Detailed signal management.  This uses "POSIX::SigAction" objects for the "action" and
               "oldaction" arguments.  Consult your system's "sigaction" manpage for details.

               Synopsis:

                       sigaction(signal, action, oldaction = 0)

               Returns "undef" on failure.  The "signal" must be a number (like SIGHUP), not a string (like
               "SIGHUP"), though Perl does try hard to understand you.

       siglongjmp
               <u>siglongjmp()</u> is C-specific: use "die" in perlfunc instead.

       sigpending
               Examine signals that are blocked and pending.  This uses "POSIX::SigSet" objects for the
               "sigset" argument.  Consult your system's "sigpending" manpage for details.

               Synopsis:

                       sigpending(sigset)

               Returns "undef" on failure.

       sigprocmask
               Change and/or examine calling process's signal mask.  This uses "POSIX::SigSet" objects for
               the "sigset" and "oldsigset" arguments.  Consult your system's "sigprocmask" manpage for
               details.

               Synopsis:

                       sigprocmask(how, sigset, oldsigset = 0)

               Returns "undef" on failure.

       sigsetjmp
               "sigsetjmp()" is C-specific: use "eval {}" instead, see "eval" in perlfunc.

       sigsuspend
               Install a signal mask and suspend process until signal arrives.  This uses "POSIX::SigSet"
               objects for the "signal_mask" argument.  Consult your system's "sigsuspend" manpage for
               details.

               Synopsis:

                       sigsuspend(signal_mask)

               Returns "undef" on failure.

       sin     This is identical to Perl's builtin "sin()" function for returning the sine of the numerical
               argument, see "sin" in perlfunc.  See also Math::Trig.

       sinh    This is identical to the C function "sinh()" for returning the hyperbolic sine of the numeri-
               cal argument.  See also Math::Trig.

       sleep   This is functionally identical to Perl's builtin "sleep()" function for suspending the execu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;execution</font>
               tion of the current for process for certain number of seconds, see "sleep" in perlfunc.
               There is one significant difference, however: "POSIX::sleep()" returns the number of <b>unslept</b>
               seconds, while the "CORE::sleep()" returns the number of slept seconds.

       sprintf This is similar to Perl's builtin "sprintf()" function for returning a string that has the
               arguments formatted as requested, see "sprintf" in perlfunc.

       sqrt    This is identical to Perl's builtin "sqrt()" function.  for returning the square root of the
               numerical argument, see "sqrt" in perlfunc.

       srand   Give a seed the pseudorandom number generator, see "srand" in perlfunc.

       sscanf  <u>sscanf()</u> is C-specific, use regular expressions instead, see perlre.

       stat    This is identical to Perl's builtin "stat()" function for returning information about files
               and directories.

       strcat  <u>strcat()</u> is C-specific, use ".=" instead, see perlop.

       strchr  <u>strchr()</u> is C-specific, see "index" in perlfunc instead.

       strcmp  <u>strcmp()</u> is C-specific, use "eq" or "cmp" instead, see perlop.

       strcoll This is identical to the C function "strcoll()" for collating (comparing) strings transformed
               using the "strxfrm()" function.  Not really needed since Perl can do this transparently, see
               perllocale.

       strcpy  <u>strcpy()</u> is C-specific, use "=" instead, see perlop.

       strcspn <u>strcspn()</u> is C-specific, use regular expressions instead, see perlre.

       strerror
               Returns the error string for the specified errno.  Identical to the string form of the $!,
               see "$ERRNO" in perlvar.

       strftime
               Convert date and time information to string.  Returns the string.

               Synopsis:

                       strftime(fmt, sec, min, hour, mday, mon, year, wday = -1, yday = -1, isdst = -1)

               The month ("mon"), weekday ("wday"), and yearday ("yday") begin at zero.  I.e. January is 0,
               not 1; Sunday is 0, not 1; January 1st is 0, not 1.  The year ("year") is given in years
               since 1900.  I.e., the year 1995 is 95; the year 2001 is 101.  Consult your system's "strf-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">time()"&nbsp;"strftime()"</font>
               time()" manpage for details about these and the other arguments.

               If you want your code to be portable, your format ("fmt") argument should use only the con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">version&nbsp;conversion</font>
               version specifiers defined by the ANSI C standard (C89, to play safe).  These are "aAbBcdHI-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">jmMpSUwWxXyYZ%".&nbsp;"aAbBcdHIjmMpSUwWxXyYZ%".</font>
               jmMpSUwWxXyYZ%".  But even then, the <b>results</b> of some of the conversion specifiers are
               non-portable.  For example, the specifiers "aAbBcpZ" change according to the locale settings
               of the user, and both how to set locales (the locale names) and what output to expect are
               non-standard.  The specifier "c" changes according to the timezone settings of the user and
               the timezone computation rules of the operating system.  The "Z" specifier is notoriously
               unportable since the names of timezones are non-standard. Sticking to the numeric specifiers
               is the safest route.

               The given arguments are made consistent as though by calling "mktime()" before calling your
               system's "strftime()" function, except that the "isdst" value is not affected.

               The string for Tuesday, December 12, 1995.

                       $str = POSIX::strftime( "%A, %B %d, %Y", 0, 0, 0, 12, 11, 95, 2 );
                       print "$str\n";

       strlen  <u>strlen()</u> is C-specific, use "length()" instead, see "length" in perlfunc.

       strncat <u>strncat()</u> is C-specific, use ".=" instead, see perlop.

       strncmp <u>strncmp()</u> is C-specific, use "eq" instead, see perlop.

       strncpy <u>strncpy()</u> is C-specific, use "=" instead, see perlop.

       strpbrk <u>strpbrk()</u> is C-specific, use regular expressions instead, see perlre.

       strrchr <u>strrchr()</u> is C-specific, see "rindex" in perlfunc instead.

       strspn  <u>strspn()</u> is C-specific, use regular expressions instead, see perlre.

       strstr  This is identical to Perl's builtin "index()" function, see "index" in perlfunc.

       strtod  String to double translation. Returns the parsed number and the number of characters in the
               unparsed portion of the string.  Truly POSIX-compliant systems set $! ($ERRNO) to indicate a
               translation error, so clear $! before calling strtod.  However, non-POSIX systems may not
               check for overflow, and therefore will never set $!.

               strtod should respect any POSIX <u>setlocale()</u> settings.

               To parse a string $str as a floating point number use

                   $! = 0;
                   ($num, $n_unparsed) = POSIX::strtod($str);

               The second returned item and $! can be used to check for valid input:

                   if (($str eq '') || ($n_unparsed != 0) || $!) {
                       die "Non-numeric input $str" . ($! ? ": $!\n" : "\n");
                   }

               When called in a scalar context strtod returns the parsed number.

       strtok  <u>strtok()</u> is C-specific, use regular expressions instead, see perlre, or "split" in perlfunc.

       strtol  String to (long) integer translation.  Returns the parsed number and the number of characters
               in the unparsed portion of the string.  Truly POSIX-compliant systems set $! ($ERRNO) to
               indicate a translation error, so clear $! before calling strtol.  However, non-POSIX systems
               may not check for overflow, and therefore will never set $!.

               strtol should respect any POSIX <u>setlocale()</u> settings.

               To parse a string $str as a number in some base $base use

                   $! = 0;
                   ($num, $n_unparsed) = POSIX::strtol($str, $base);

               The base should be zero or between 2 and 36, inclusive.  When the base is zero or omitted
               strtol will use the string itself to determine the base: a leading "0x" or "0X" means hexa-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">decimal;&nbsp;hexadecimal;</font>
               decimal; a leading "0" means octal; any other leading characters mean decimal.  Thus, "1234"
               is parsed as a decimal number, "01234" as an octal number, and "0x1234" as a hexadecimal num-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ber.&nbsp;number.</font>
               ber.

               The second returned item and $! can be used to check for valid input:

                   if (($str eq '') || ($n_unparsed != 0) || !$!) {
                       die "Non-numeric input $str" . $! ? ": $!\n" : "\n";
                   }

               When called in a scalar context strtol returns the parsed number.

       strtoul String to unsigned (long) integer translation.  <u>strtoul()</u> is identical to <u>strtol()</u> except
               that <u>strtoul()</u> only parses unsigned integers.  See "strtol" for details.

               Note: Some vendors supply <u>strtod()</u> and <u>strtol()</u> but not <u>strtoul()</u>.  Other vendors that do
               supply <u>strtoul()</u> parse "-1" as a valid value.

       strxfrm String transformation.  Returns the transformed string.

                       $dst = POSIX::strxfrm( $src );

               Used in conjunction with the "strcoll()" function, see "strcoll".

               Not really needed since Perl can do this transparently, see perllocale.

       sysconf Retrieves values of system configurable variables.

               The following will get the machine's clock speed.

                       $clock_ticks = POSIX::sysconf( &amp;POSIX::_SC_CLK_TCK );

               Returns "undef" on failure.

       system  This is identical to Perl's builtin "system()" function, see "system" in perlfunc.

       tan     This is identical to the C function "tan()", returning the tangent of the numerical argument.
               See also Math::Trig.

       tanh    This is identical to the C function "tanh()", returning the hyperbolic tangent of the numeri-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cal&nbsp;numerical</font>
               cal argument.   See also Math::Trig.

       tcdrain This is similar to the C function "tcdrain()" for draining the output queue of its argument
               stream.

               Returns "undef" on failure.

       tcflow  This is similar to the C function "tcflow()" for controlling the flow of its argument stream.

               Returns "undef" on failure.

       tcflush This is similar to the C function "tcflush()" for flushing the I/O buffers of its argument
               stream.

               Returns "undef" on failure.

       tcgetpgrp
               This is identical to the C function "tcgetpgrp()" for returning the process group identifier
               of the foreground process group of the controlling terminal.

       tcsendbreak
               This is similar to the C function "tcsendbreak()" for sending a break on its argument stream.

               Returns "undef" on failure.

       tcsetpgrp
               This is similar to the C function "tcsetpgrp()" for setting the process group identifier of
               the foreground process group of the controlling terminal.

               Returns "undef" on failure.

       time    This is identical to Perl's builtin "time()" function for returning the number of seconds
               since the epoch (whatever it is for the system), see "time" in perlfunc.

       times   The <u>times()</u> function returns elapsed realtime since some point in the past (such as system
               startup), user and system times for this process, and user and system times used by child
               processes.  All times are returned in clock ticks.

                   ($realtime, $user, $system, $cuser, $csystem) = POSIX::times();

               Note: Perl's builtin "times()" function returns four values, measured in seconds.

       tmpfile Use method "IO::File::new_tmpfile()" instead, or see File::Temp.

       tmpnam  Returns a name for a temporary file.

                       $tmpfile = POSIX::tmpnam();

               For security reasons, which are probably detailed in your system's documentation for the C
               library <u>tmpnam()</u> function, this interface should not be used; instead see File::Temp.

       tolower This is identical to the C function, except that it can apply to a single character or to a
               whole string.  Consider using the "lc()" function, see "lc" in perlfunc, or the equivalent
               "\L" operator inside doublequotish strings.

       toupper This is identical to the C function, except that it can apply to a single character or to a
               whole string.  Consider using the "uc()" function, see "uc" in perlfunc, or the equivalent
               "\U" operator inside doublequotish strings.

       ttyname This is identical to the C function "ttyname()" for returning the name of the current termi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nal.&nbsp;terminal.</font>
               nal.

       tzname  Retrieves the time conversion information from the "tzname" variable.

                       POSIX::tzset();
                       ($std, $dst) = POSIX::tzname();

       tzset   This is identical to the C function "tzset()" for setting the current timezone based on the
               environment variable "TZ", to be used by "ctime()", "localtime()", "mktime()", and "strf-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">time()"&nbsp;"strftime()"</font>
               time()" functions.

       umask   This is identical to Perl's builtin "umask()" function for setting (and querying) the file
               creation permission mask, see "umask" in perlfunc.

       uname   Get name of current operating system.

                       ($sysname, $nodename, $release, $version, $machine) = POSIX::uname();

               Note that the actual meanings of the various fields are not that well standardized, do not
               expect any great portability.  The $sysname might be the name of the operating system, the
               $nodename might be the name of the host, the $release might be the (major) release number of
               the operating system, the $version might be the (minor) release number of the operating sys-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tem,&nbsp;system,</font>
               tem, and the $machine might be a hardware identifier.  Maybe.

       ungetc  Use method "IO::Handle::ungetc()" instead.

       unlink  This is identical to Perl's builtin "unlink()" function for removing files, see "unlink" in
               perlfunc.

       utime   This is identical to Perl's builtin "utime()" function for changing the time stamps of files
               and directories, see "utime" in perlfunc.

       vfprintf
               <u>vfprintf()</u> is C-specific, see "printf" in perlfunc instead.

       vprintf <u>vprintf()</u> is C-specific, see "printf" in perlfunc instead.

       vsprintf
               <u>vsprintf()</u> is C-specific, see "sprintf" in perlfunc instead.

       wait    This is identical to Perl's builtin "wait()" function, see "wait" in perlfunc.

       waitpid Wait for a child process to change state.  This is identical to Perl's builtin "waitpid()"
               function, see "waitpid" in perlfunc.

                       $pid = POSIX::waitpid( -1, POSIX::WNOHANG );
                       print "status = ", ($? / 256), "\n";

       wcstombs
               This is identical to the C function "wcstombs()".  Perl does not have any support for the
               wide and multibyte characters of the C standards, so this might be a rather useless function.

       wctomb  This is identical to the C function "wctomb()".  Perl does not have any support for the wide
               and multibyte characters of the C standards, so this might be a rather useless function.

       write   Write to a file.  This uses file descriptors such as those obtained by calling "POSIX::open".

                       $fd = POSIX::open( "foo", &amp;POSIX::O_WRONLY );
                       $buf = "hello";
                       $bytes = POSIX::write( $b, $buf, 5 );

               Returns "undef" on failure.

               See also "syswrite" in perlfunc.

<b>CLASSES</b>
       <b>POSIX::SigAction</b>


       new     Creates a new "POSIX::SigAction" object which corresponds to the C "struct sigaction".  This
               object will be destroyed automatically when it is no longer needed.  The first parameter is
               the fully-qualified name of a sub which is a signal-handler.  The second parameter is a
               "POSIX::SigSet" object, it defaults to the empty set.  The third parameter contains the
               "sa_flags", it defaults to 0.

       flags   accessor functions to get/set the values of a SigAction object.

                       $sigset = $sigaction-&gt;mask;
                       $sigaction-&gt;flags(&amp;POSIX::SA_RESTART);

       safe    accessor function for the "safe signals" flag of a SigAction object; see perlipc for general
               information on safe (a.k.a. "deferred") signals.  If you wish to handle a signal safely, use
               this accessor to set the "safe" flag in the "POSIX::SigAction" object:

                       $sigaction-&gt;safe(1);

               You may also examine the "safe" flag on the output action object which is filled in when
               given as the third parameter to "POSIX::sigaction()":

                       sigaction(SIGINT, $new_action, $old_action);
                       if ($old_action-&gt;safe) {
                           # previous SIGINT handler used safe signals
                       }

       <b>POSIX::SigSet</b>


       new     Create a new SigSet object.  This object will be destroyed automatically when it is no longer
               needed.  Arguments may be supplied to initialize the set.

               Create an empty set.

                       $sigset = POSIX::SigSet-&gt;new;

               Create a set with SIGUSR1.

                       $sigset = POSIX::SigSet-&gt;new( &amp;POSIX::SIGUSR1 );

       addset  Add a signal to a SigSet object.

                       $sigset-&gt;addset( &amp;POSIX::SIGUSR2 );

               Returns "undef" on failure.

       delset  Remove a signal from the SigSet object.

                       $sigset-&gt;delset( &amp;POSIX::SIGUSR2 );

               Returns "undef" on failure.

       emptyset
               Initialize the SigSet object to be empty.

                       $sigset-&gt;emptyset();

               Returns "undef" on failure.

       fillset Initialize the SigSet object to include all signals.

                       $sigset-&gt;fillset();

               Returns "undef" on failure.

       ismember
               Tests the SigSet object to see if it contains a specific signal.

                       if( $sigset-&gt;ismember( &amp;POSIX::SIGUSR1 ) ){
                               print "contains SIGUSR1\n";
                       }

       <b>POSIX::Termios</b>


       new     Create a new Termios object.  This object will be destroyed automatically when it is no
               longer needed.  A Termios object corresponds to the termios C struct.  <u>new()</u> mallocs a new
               one, <u>getattr()</u> fills it from a file descriptor, and <u>setattr()</u> sets a file descriptor's param-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">eters&nbsp;parameters</font>
               eters to match Termios' contents.

                       $termios = POSIX::Termios-&gt;new;

       getattr Get terminal control attributes.
