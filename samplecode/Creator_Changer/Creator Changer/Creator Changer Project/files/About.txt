CreatorChanger 1.011/6/1998This drag and drop Macintosh application contains many examples of varioustechnologies presented in MRJ EA3 and later.When files and/or folders are dropped on this application, it will recursivelyscan folder hierarchies and change the creator of all files of a certain typeto a predetermined value, using the MRJToolkit APIs.Taking advantage of AppleScript for Java, this application provides the potentialto script its functionality.  In its scriptability it presents the option tospecify search file type and target creator information for jobs spawed fromAppleScript.Each drop, or AppleScript command spawns a new job, with a new progress bar, etc.During its progress it displays and updates a progress bar for each batch, andallows user interaction.  This is a polished Macintosh application, demonstratingthat good looking, speedy, and useful applications can be written for theMacintosh in Java.Designed and implemented by,Levi Brownlevi@apple.comApple Computer
