We're using AppleGlot and most of the languages are fine. However,we're having a problem with the Japanese driver. Everything looks fine exceptfor our Panel icon names. We have a driver-specific Options panel, and itcontains a bunch of garbage characters. We're using a localized system to testand to view the driver's UI. Does the string being defined as a <code>pstring[31]</code> inthe <code>gxPrintPanelType</code> have anything to do with our problem, such as possiblyhaving two byte characters get messed up?</p><p id=p4>A:  Both the font and the character data have to be set properly to displayJapanese data. AppleGlot substitutes Japanese for English text, but it doesn'tlet you specify the fonts. Most resources only have text, with no associatedfont/script info, so the system has to guess what font to use. QuickDrawGX letsyou specifically set the script code to match the text data.</p> <p id=p4>Usually, the system uses the System or Application font, which in your case wasJapanese, so this should have worked correctly. Since other icons in the listwere displaying Japanese names, the code was obviously supporting Japanesetext, but something was mistakenly telling it that your garbage text was Romaninstead of Japanese. We looked at the data structure that included the text,and the following field was the <code>ScriptID</code> field, which was, in fact, set tosmRoman. Changing this to <code>smJapanese</code> (1) and then rebuilding the resource filesolves the problem.</p> <p id=p4>In general, GX is good about associating a script ID with all-text data. Thisallows multiple scripts to be supported at once (which is good). It does mean,however, that you have to watch for this problem when localizing your product.There may also be other  places in your product where this is an issue. To findthese, search the resource files for <code>'smRoman'</code> and scrutinize those areas whereit's found. Be aware that <code>smRoman</code> may also be represented by the constant 0, ifit was not defined properly.</p></td></tr></table></center><!-- end_content --><!-- begin_date --><H4 ALIGN=center>[May 01 1995]</H4><!-- end_date --><!-- begin_footer_information -->	<table width="680" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
