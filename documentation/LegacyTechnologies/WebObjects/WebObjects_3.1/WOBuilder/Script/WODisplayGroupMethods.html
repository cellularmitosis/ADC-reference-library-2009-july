<H1><CENTER><A NAME="REF70199">Common WODisplayGroup Methods</A></CENTER></H1>                                                    
<P>The WODisplayGroup performs all database accesses for your application. The          
 more commonly used methods are listed below, sorted by the type of operation         
 they perform.                                                                        
<H3>Displaying Results</H3>                                                           
<P>These methods give you access to database objects and allow you to display them.     
<DL><DT><b>allObjects</b>                                                                           
<DD>All of the records to be displayed. For example, if your application has a           
 query that results in one hundred records being fetched but you have set             
 up the display group to only display ten at a time, <b>allObjects</b> contains all          
 one hundred records.                                                                 
<DT><b>displayedObjects</b>                                                                     
<DD>The records actually being displayed. For example, if your application has a         
 query that results in one hundred records being fetched but you have set             
 up the display group to only display ten at a time, <b>displayedObjects</b> contains those ten records.                                                             
<DT><b>selectedObjects</b>                                                                      
<DD>The records in the current selection.                                                
<DT><b>selectedObject</b>                                                                       
<DD>A single selected record. Usually, this returns the first record in the <b>selectedObjects</b> array.        
</DL>                                                             
<H3>Managing Batches</H3>                                                                     
<P>These methods control the grouping of records into manageable batches to display.    
 (You set the batch size on the WODisplayGroup options panel.)                        
<DL>
<DT><b>displayPreviousBatch</b>                                                                 
<DD>Select the previously-displayed batch of records and then reloads the                
 page.                                                                                
<DT><b>displayNextBatch</b>                                                                     
<DD>Selects the next batch of records and then reloads the page.                         
<DT><b>batchCount</b>                                                                           
<DD>The number of batches to display. For example, if you're fetching two hundred records and the batch size is ten, <b>batchCount</b> returns twenty (twenty            
 batches of ten records each).                                                        
<DT><b>batchIndex</b>                                                                           
<DD>The number of the batch currently displayed, where 1 is the first batch displayed. For example, if the batch size is ten records and <b>displayedObjects</b>           
 is showing records 11 through 20, the <b>batchIndex</b> is 2.   
</DL>                            
<H3>Querying</H3>                                                                           
<P>These methods are used in applications that perform queries.                         
<DL>
<DT><b>executeQuery</b>                                                                         
<DD>Builds a qualifier using <b>inputObjectForQualifier</b> and the pattern matching            
 you set on the display group options panel, and then fetches the records             
 that match that qualifier. The qualifier is not preserved.                           
<DT><b>inputObjectForQualifier</b>                                                              
<DD>Returns an entity object that is used to create the qualifier. For example, if       
 you wanted the application to search on movie titles, you would bind a text          
 field to <b>inputObjectForQualifier.title</b>. (<b>title</b> comes from the entity that created the WODisplayGroup.)                                                            
<DT><b>secondObjectForQualifier</b>                                                             
<DD>Used for from-to queries to specify the "to" value. This method must use             
 the same property as <b>inputObjectForQualifier</b>. For example, if you                    
 wanted to query all movies released between two dates, you would bind                
 the first field <b>inputObjectForQualifier.dateReleased</b> and the second field            
 to <b>secondObjectForQualifier.dateReleased</b>. The resulting qualifier would              
 fetch all movies release after the date specified in <b>inputObjectForQualifier</b> but before the date specified in <b>secondObjectForQualifier</b>.
</DL>                      
<H3>Modifying the Database </H3>                                                              
<P>These methods modify the database.                                                   
<DL>
<DT><b>insert</b>                                                                               
<DD>Adds a new empty record. You should provide a dictionary containing                  
 default values for the record and use the <b>setInsertedObjectDefaultValues:</b> to specify that the WODisplayGroup should use that dictionary to create all new values. For example, these statements ensure that all new records contain a value for movie title:                                             
<PRE>[dictionary setObject:@"New title"] 
            forKey:@"title"];
[movies setInsertedObjectDefaultValues:dictionary];</PRE>                    
 <DT><b>delete</b>                                                                              
<DD>Deletes the selected records.  
</DL>                                                      
<P>If you're modifying a database, you must explicitly save the changes. Write a        
 method that uses the session's EOEditingContext to save the changes. For example:                                                                                 
<PRE>[self.session.defaultEditingContext saveChanges]; </PRE>                                   
<P>See the EOEditingContext class description in the <i>Enterprise Objects Framework       
 Reference</I>.
