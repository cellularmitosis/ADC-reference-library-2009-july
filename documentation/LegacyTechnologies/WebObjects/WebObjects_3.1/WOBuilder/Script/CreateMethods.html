<P>Methods perform the action of a component. Components usually define several methods. The <U><A HREF="ScriptWindow.html">script window</A></U> shows the implementation of all of the component's methods. 
<P>After you add a method to the script file, the component window displays that method in the object browser so that it's possible to <U><A HREF="../DynElem/BindElements.html">bind a dynamic element</A></U> on the page to the method.
<P>If you're unsure of the method syntax, you can use the <U><A HREF="ObjectBrowser.html">object browser's</A></U> add method button (the button with an M+) to create the method. This creates a method named <B>action</B>, lists it in the object browser, and creates its declaration in the script file. You can then open the script window, change the name, and type its implementation. 
<P>WebScript supports two different syntax styles. Set your style preference in the Preferences panel. See "<U><A HREF="SetStylePreference.html#REF53053">Setting the Style Preference</A></U>."
