The major part of these solutionsare enterprise beans. Enterprise beans are business objects thatcontain logic used to perform specific tasks. They are similar toenterprise objects in WebObjects, but can be used in applicationservers by multiple vendors.</p><p>When an application uses enterprise beans, it's said thatthe application is a <em>client</em> of the bean. (Beanscan themselves be clients of other beans.) Client applications don'taccess enterprise-bean instances directly. Instead, they interactwith bean <em>stubs</em>. These stubs contain only thebean's methods that are to be accessed by client applications.Other implementation-specific methods are hidden from the client,facilitating changes and updates to the bean's business logic.</p><p>Enterprise beans are deployed in an <b>EJB container</b> (orbean container). The EJB container manages the lifecycle of enterprise-beaninstances. In addition, the bean container can perform any databasework required by the bean, allowing the bean developer to concentrateon business problems. When necessary, however, enterprise beanscan execute database transactions themselves. Because client applicationsinteract with bean stubs, not the bean instances themselves, beancontainers are free to implement the EJB specification in a waythat maximizes efficiency and performance, without affecting thefunctionality of client applications or the enterprise beans theycontain.</p><p>To make enterprise beans available to WebObjects applications,you need to create a bean framework. Project Builder can assistyou in creating such frameworks. You can create a bean frameworkusing third-party enterprise beans, either from source code or JAR(Java archive) files, or you can write your beans from scratch.</p><p>For more information on Enterprise JavaBeans in WebObjects,see <i>Developing EJB Applications</i>.</p><br>    <br><a href="J2EE_Integration.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/previous.gif" border="0"></a><a href="JSP_and_Servlets.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/next.gif" border="0"></a>&nbsp;<br><br><p><hr><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">&#169; 2002 Apple Computer, Inc.
