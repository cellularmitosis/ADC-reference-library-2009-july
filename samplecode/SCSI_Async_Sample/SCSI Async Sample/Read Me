SCSI Asynch Sample - a SCSI sample illustrating asynchronous I/O Copyright © 1994, Apple Computer Inc. All Rights Reserved.This is a simple sample that illustrates asynchronous I/Ousing SCSI Manager 4.3. It allows you to create independentI/O "threads" that use the asynchronous capabilities of SCSIManager 4.3 to carry out asynchronous device read operations.It compiles on the following environments:Think C 7.0MPW 3.3.1MetroWerks DR3¥¥ÊThis sample requires SCSI Manager 4.3.¥¥ÊWarning: this sometimes hangs my system.¥¥  Another warning: this is barely functional and has      the worst human interface I've ever written.Usage: enter test parameters, hit "Test" to use them. When youare finished, hit Finished and the test will run. For example,to run three asychronous tests on the device at host bus 1,SCSI target 3, click on the checkboxes, click on Test three times,then click Finish.At this time, this program cannot be compiled in native mode forPower Macintosh because the "scsi.h" file has not been completelyconverted to the Universal Header format. However, the programdoes run in compatibility mode on Power Macintosh.Note that, if you are compiling for MetroWerks, you must buildthe resources (in file "SCSIAsyncSample.µ.rsrc") by calling Rez- you can either build the MPW version first or make theMetroWerks option in the MakeFile.Because these sources build a half-dozen version of the sample,(three compilers, 68000 native, 68000 on Power Mac, PowerMac native someday), some notes on compatibility are in order:1. The program was originally written and debugged using    Think C on a Quadra 950.2. It was then compiled and tested using MPW 3.3.1.3. It was then compiled and tested using MetroWerks DR3.Each additional compiler found a different set of errors andwarnings. In all cases, optional warnings were turned on.Written by Martin Minow, MACDTS.minow@apple.comAppleLink: MINOW
