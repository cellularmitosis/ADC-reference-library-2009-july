ð QuickDraw 3D Ð MarkerPickThis is code to demonstrate window point picking with markers, specifically how the pick is not considered successful unless the pick point hits one of the "on" bits of the marker bitmap. The app itself is just about all code stolen from the "Box" app; it's slightly modified to remove extraneous code and to dispatch clicks in the window content region to the picking routine.Julian G—mezQD3D Wanker (that's Doctor to you, bub)AppleLink: JULIAN.G
