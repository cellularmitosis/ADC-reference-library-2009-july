<p>The PowerBook G4 computer comes with both Mac OS 9.2.1 and
Mac OS X version 10.1 installed. Mac OS 9.2 is the default startup
system. For the latest information, see the references listed in  <a sector="mod" href="../aReferences/iMac_OS_9.html" target="_top">"Mac OS 9"</a> and  <a sector="mod" href="../aReferences/iMac_OS_X.html" target="_top">"Mac OS X"</a>.</p>
<p>Here are a few items of interest about the system software
on the PowerBook G4 computer. </p>

<br><a name = "TPXREF107"></a><h3><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Open Firmware</font></h3>
<p>System software on all current Macintosh models uses a design
based on Open Firmware. With this approach, the ROM on the main
logic board contains only the Open Firmware code needed to initialize
the hardware and load an operating system. The rest of the system
code is loaded into RAM from disk or from the network. For more
information, see the references listed in  <a sector="mod" href="../aReferences/iOpen_Firmware.html" target="_top">"Open Firmware"</a>. </p>
<br><a name = "TPXREF108"></a><h3><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Machine Identification</font></h3>
<p>Instead of reading the box flag or the model string and then
making assumptions about the computer's features, applications
that need to find out the features of the machine should use the
Name Registry and Gestalt calls (Mac OS 9) or IORegistry Explorer
(Mac OS X) to test for the features they require. </p>
<p>Asset management software that reports the kind of machine
it is run on can obtain the value of the property at <code>Devices:device-tree:compatible</code> in
the Name Registry (in Mac OS 9) or in the device-tree node of the
IODeviceTree plane of the IORegistry (in Mac OS X). The model string
is the first program-useable string in the array of C strings in
the <code>compatible</code> field.
For the PowerBook G4 computer, the value of the model property is <code>PowerBook3,3.</code> </p>
<p>The string obtained from the <code>compatible</code> property
cannot be displayed to the computer user. If it is available, you
can use the result from calling <code>Gestalt ('mnam',
&amp;result)</code> where <code>result</code> is
a string pointer. This call returns a Pascal style string that can
be displayed to the user. </p>
<br><a name = "TPXREF109"></a><h3><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Power Saving Modes</font></h3>
<p>The power management protocols on the PowerBook G4 computer
support two power-saving modes: Idle and Sleep. </p>
<ul><li>Idle: The
system is idling with the main processor stopped in Nap mode. All
clocks are running; the system can return to running code within
a few nanoseconds. Cache coherency is maintained in this level of
idle. </font></li>
<li>Sleep: The system is completely shut down, with only the DRAM
state preserved for quick recovery. All processors are powered off
with their state preserved in DRAM. All clocks in the system are
suspended except for the 32.768 kHz timebase crystal on the PMU99
IC. </font></li></ul>
<p>The computer automatically enters Idle mode after several
seconds of inactivity. If the computer is attached to a network,
it is able to respond to service requests and other events directed
to the computer while it is in Idle mode. </p>
<p>While it is connected to an AC power supply, the computer
can also respond to network activity when it is in Sleep mode. The
user can enable this feature by selecting Wake-on-LAN in the Energy
Saver control panel. </p>
<p>In Sleep mode, the computer consumes less than 1 watt of power.
That allows it to meet the Energy Star power-saving standard. </p>
<blockquote>
<b>Important</b>
<p>Peripherals such as PCMCIA cards and USB devices that
do not conform to the computer's power management protocols prevent the
computer from switching to Sleep mode and so deny the user the benefits
of this energy-saving mode. When such peripherals are attached to
the computer, the operating system displays a dialog box to inform
the user that the computer no longer meets the Energy Star requirements. </p></blockquote>
