</DL>
<P>
WODynamicElement is an abstract superclass for classes that generate
dynamic elements: objects representing HTML or PDF elements whose
values can programmatically change at run time. Dynamic elements have
a name and one or more <I>properties</I>, instance variables holding
such things as user-entered data or user-triggerable actions. The
properties of a dynamic element are associated with, or "bound" to,
the properties of the WOComponent object that represents the page (or
portion of a page) in which the dynamic element appears.</P>

<P>At runtime, a dynamic element can extract values from the page,
feed those values across the bindings to the owning component,
receive back new data, and include that data in the next
representation of the page. A dynamic element can also detect if the
user has manipulated it (for instance, clicking a button) to signal
some intention and then trigger the appropriate action method in the
owning WOComponent. The bindings between properties of a dynamic
element and properties of a WOComponent are made possible by
WOAssociation objects, objects that know how to "push" and "pull"
values to and from another object using keys. </P>

<P>WODynamicElements must implement the default initializer to
initialize their instance variables with the appropriate association
objects (passed in). As WOElement objects, they must also implement one
or more of the three request-handling methods. In the context of
request handling, a dynamic element can use its associations to:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Push request values into the associated properties of their
   WOComponent (<B>takeValuesFromRequest:inContext:</B>)<BR>
   
   <BR>
   
   
   
   <LI>Invoke action methods of the Component
   (<B>invokeActionForRequest:inContext:</B>)<BR>
   
   <BR>
   
   
   
   <LI>Extract values from the Component when composing a dynamic
   HTML response (<B>appendToResponse:inContext:</B>)<BR>
   

</UL>

<P>All dynamic elements must implement <B>appendToResponse:inContext:</B>. If
they accept user input or respond to user actions (such as mouse
clicks), they should implement <B>takeValuesFromRequest:inContext:</B> and
<B>invokeActionForRequest:inContext:</B>, respectively.</P>

<P>Dynamic elements do not know about their WOComponent object until run
time. During request-handling, the application stores components
(representing a page and subcomponents on the page) on a stack
maintained by the WOContext object, with the currently referenced
WOComponent on top of the stack. A dynamic element's WOAssociation
retrieves the current WOComponent (through an invocation of WOContext's
<B>component</B> method) and reads and writes values from and to the
WOComponent. 
</P>

<P>A dynamic element can represent a single HTML or PDF element (such
as an editable text field) or a compound element, such as the
LoginPanel whose implementation is described below. WebObjects
includes a suite of ready-made dynamic elements and the WebObjects
Builder application makes these objects available on its palettes.
The <a href="../../../../../DynamicElements/DynamicElementsTOC.html" target="_top"><I>Dynamic Elements Reference</I></a> describes WebObjects' dynamic elements
and provides examples showing how to use them.<BR>

</P>

<H2>Creating Custom Dynamic Elements: An Example</H2>

<P>LoginPanel is a dynamic element that consists of a form containing
a name field, a password field, and the standard Submit and Reset
buttons (renamed Login and Clear). Users type their user name in the
first field and a non-echoed password in the second field, and then
click the Login (Submit) button. An action method in the associated
WOComponent is then invoked, and the WOComponent is responsible for any
verification and page navigation.</P>

<B>Figure 1:</B> Example of LoginPanel</P>

<P>Before we get into the nitty-gritty of LoginPanel, here's a quick
overview on what happens in the life of a dynamic element. When the
application parses the declarations file (".wod") in a component
directory, it identifies the name of each declared dynamic element
(which is its class name) and the properties of that dynamic element.
With this information packaged as arguments, it then invokes the
dynamic element's initializer. In the initializer, the dynamic
element sets its instance variables to the values of its passed-in
properties and invokes its superclass's initializer; the message
travels up the inheritance chain until it reaches WODynamicElement.
</P>

<P>During a cycle of the request-response loop, request-handling
messages are propagated <I>down</I> the object graph of elements
representing the request or response page. When it's their turn, all
elements, static and dynamic, respond to <B>appendToResponse:inContext:</B> by
adding the HTML or PDF code they represent to the response page.
Dynamic elements, depending on their attributes, can also extract
values from the request page (<B>takeValuesFromRequest:inContext:</B>) and
trigger action methods in the request Component
(<B>invokeActionForRequest:inContext:</B>).<BR>

<BR>

</P>

<H3>1. Initialize the dynamic element</H3>

<P>A dynamic element must declare instance variables to hold the
association objects that represent its properties. These instance
variables must be of type NSObject (in Objective-C, they must be
declared as WOAssociation objects). Other (optional) instance
variables can contain string constants used as keys for these
properties. You should publish these string constants to users of
your dynamic element, for they form the variables on the left side of
assignments made in the declarations file (or in WebObjects Builder's
Inspector panel). For example, LoginPanel's keys are "name,",
"password," and "loginAction"; a typical component declaration might
therefore be:</P>

<PRE>    Login : LoginPanel {
        name = theName;
        password = thePassword;
        loginAction = verifyUser;
    }</PRE>

<P>The NSDictionary that is passed in as an
argument contains WOAssociations, objects that know how to "push
and pull" values to and from a WOComponent object. The associations in this dictionary define
initial constant values or bindings between properties of the dynamic
element and the WOComponent. Get these associations using the keys
you've defined and assign the returned objects to their instance
variables.</P>

<P><B>Code Example</B>:<BR>

</P>

<PRE>- (id)initWithName:(NSString *)aName associations:(NSDictionary *)someAssociations template:(WOElement *)anElement
{
    nameKey = @"name";
    passwordKey = @"password";
    actionKey = @"loginAction";
    if ([someAssociations objectForKey:nameKey] != nil) {
        userNameAssociation = [someAssociations objectForKey:nameKey];
    }
    if ([someAssociations objectForKey:passwordKey] != nil) {
        userPasswordAssociation = [someAssociations objectForKey:passwordKey];
    }
    if ([someAssociations objectForKey:actionKey] != nil) {
        action = [someAssociations objectForKey:actionKey];
    }
    [super initWithName:aName associations:someAssociations template:anElement];
    return self;

}
</PRE>

<H3>2. Generate the HTML response</H3>

<P>Implement the <B>appendToResponse:inContext:</B> method by appending the HTML
code that represents the dynamic element to the body of HTML code
that already exists for the response page. The
<A HREF="../WOResponse/WOResponse.html"
TARGET="_top">WOResponse</A> class has several methods that you can
invoke for this purpose.</P>

<P>One technique illustrated in the example code below particularly
merits explanation. Several WOContext methods are invoked to generate
element IDs which are used as identifiers for "child" elements. On a
particular "node" of the object graph, objects with the same parent
have their parent's element ID plus a dot-separated digit appended to
it. This digit begins at zero and is incremented according to a
"sibling" element's position within the parent. (See the
<A HREF="../WOContext/WOContext.html"
TARGET="_top">WOContext</A> class for more on element ID manipulation.)
</P>

<P><B>appendZeroElementIDComponent</B> appends a ".0" to the parent's
element ID to create the element ID for the User Name field. The code
then assigns the element ID as the HTML name of the input field,
"pulls" the required value from the Component property via
"userNameAssociation", and assigns this value as the HTML value of
the field. Next it increments the last digit of the element ID for
the password field and assigns this element ID as the HTML name of
the field. When you are finished with the child elements, delete the
appended digit, thus restoring the parent's element ID.</P>

<P>Note that no element ID is assigned to the Submit or Request
buttons. In HTML, form actions emanate from a form itself and not
from the buttons the form contains.</P>

<P><B>Code Example</B>:</P>

<PRE>- (void)appendToResponse:(WOResponse *)aResponse inContext:(WOContext *)aContext
{
    NSString *uname;

    //1. Generate form.
    [aResponse appendContentString:@"&lt;form method=\"POST\" action=\""];
    [aResponse appendContentHTMLAttributeValue:[aContext url]];
    [aResponse appendContentCharacter:'"'];
    [aResponse appendContentString:@"&gt;"];

    //2. Generate input fields
    [aResponse appendContentHTMLString:@"User Name: "];
    [aResponse appendContentString:@"&lt;input type=\"text\" size=10 name=\""];

    //3. Set HTML name of first field to new elementID
    [aContext appendZeroElementIDComponent];
    [aResponse appendContentHTMLAttributeValue:[aContext elementID]];
    [aResponse appendContentString:@"\""];

    //4. Get user name, make it HTML value.
    uname = [userNameAssociation value];
    if (uname != nil) {
        [aResponse appendContentString:@" value=\""];
        [aResponse appendContentHTMLAttributeValue:uname];
        [aResponse appendContentCharacter:'"'];
    }
    [aResponse appendContentString:@"&gt;"];
    [aResponse appendContentString:@"&lt;br&gt;"];
    [aResponse appendContentHTMLString:@"Password: "];
    [aResponse appendContentString:@"&lt;input type=\"password\" size=10 name=\""];

    //5. Set HTML name of second field to incremented elementID.
    [aContext incrementLastElementIDComponent];
    [aResponse appendContentHTMLAttributeValue:[aContext elementID]];
    [aResponse appendContentString:@"\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"];

    [aContext deleteLastElementIDComponent];

    //6. Generate buttons.
    [aResponse appendContentString:@"&lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"Login\"&gt; "];
    [aResponse appendContentString:@"&lt;input type=\"reset\" 
        value=\"Clear\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/form&gt; "];
}
</PRE>

<H3>3. Take values from the request</H3>

<P>If a dynamic element is associated with a text field, check box,
or similar UI element used for gathering user data or reflecting
choices, it should implement the <B>takeValuesFromRequest:inContext:</B> method.
In this method, it should extract the new or changed value and assign
it to the appropriate association. Most user data is entered on
forms; you can obtain these form values by invoking WORequest's
<B>formValueForKey:</B> or <B>formValuesForKey:</B> with the element ID
as key. Then "push" the value (or values) into the associated
Component property (or properties) with WOAssociation's
<B>setValue:</B> method.</P>

<P>As in <B>appendToResponse:inContext:</B>, manipulate the element ID (with
Request's <B>...ElementIDComponent</B> methods) before getting form
values. <I>Important</I>: The element IDs assigned to elements should
exactly mirror the element IDs assigned to those same elements in
<B>appendToResponse:inContext:</B>.</P>

<P><B>Code Example</B>:<BR>

</P>

<PRE>- (void)takeValuesFromRequest:(WORequest *)aRequest inContext:(WOContext *)aContext
{
    NSString *uname;
    NSString *password;

    [aContext appendZeroElementIDComponent];
    uname = [aRequest formValueForKey:[aContext elementID]];
    [aContext incrementLastElementIDComponent];
    password = [aRequest formValueForKey:[aContext elementID]];
    [aContext deleteLastElementIDComponent];

    [userNameAssociation setValue:uname];
    [userPasswordAssociation setValue:password];
        
}</PRE>

<P><BR>

<BR>

</P>

<H3>4. Invoke an action</H3>

<P>If your dynamic element represents an HTML or PDF
control--something capable of triggering an action--then it should
implement the <B>invokeActionForRequest:inContext:</B> method. When the client generates a
request, it embeds in the URL the <I>sender ID</I> , which is the
HTML name of the element originating the request. (This name is the
element ID you assigned in <B>appendToResponse:inContext:</B>.) In this method,
the dynamic element determines whether it was the activated control
by comparing its element ID with the sender ID. You can obtain the
sender ID from the Request object passed in as the first argument.
</P>

<P>Once a dynamic element establishes that it was the activated
control, it invokes the action method in the WOComponent that is bound
to the "action" property of the dynamic element. Invocation takes
place by getting the value of the "action" property. The action
method typically returns the response WOComponent (typed as WOElement),
which <B>invokeActionForRequest:inContext:</B> then returns to its invoker.</P>

<P>As is the case with LoginPanel, a form is responsible for
triggering an action, not the form's child elements. Since the
element ID assigned to LoginPanel by its parent element is the same
as the form's, there is no need to manipulate the element ID before
invoking the action method.</P>

<P><B>Code Example</B>:<BR>

</P>

<PRE>- (WOElement *)invokeActionForRequest:(WORequest *)aRequest inContext:(WOContext *)aContext
{
    if ([[aContext elementID] isEqualToString:[aRequest senderID]]) {
        if (action != nil) {
            return (WOElement *)[action value];
        } else {
            NSLog(@"Couldn't trigger LoginPanel action.");
            return nil;
        }
    } else {
        return [super invokeActionForRequest:aRequest inContext:aContext];
    }
}</PRE>

<P>
Returns a dynamic element identified by class <I> aName </I> and
initialized with the objects in dictionary <I> someAssociations </I>. The
dictionary contains WOAssociation objects, which know how to take values
from, and set values in, an "owning" WOComponent. To properly
initialize a dynamic element, you should use the published keys of
the dynamic element to get the associations that belong to the
dynamic element; then assign these objects to instance variables. The
<I> anElement </I> argument, if not <B>nil</B>, is the root object of a
graph of WOElements associated with the dynamic element.</P>

<P>Typically, a key in the <I> someAssociations </I> dictionary is
identified with a property of the element, and the value of this key
is the name of a property of the associated Component. For example,
the value of key "userName" might be bound to "employee.name" in the
WOComponent; this designation means that WOComponent has a property
called "employee" (possibly referring to an "Employee" object) which
in turn has a property called "name". In this case, the binding is
two-way; changes in the dynamic element are reflected in the
WOComponent property, and changes in the WOComponent property are
communicated to the dynamic element. The value of an association can
also be a constant, in which case the binding is one-way: WOComponent
to dynamic element.
