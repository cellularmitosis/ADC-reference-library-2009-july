 Abstract: Demonstrates dynamically resolved properties. Uses a new
 feature of the Objective C 2.0 runtime:  dynamically resolved methods.
 To support dynamically resolved methods, a class may define two new methods:
 
 + (BOOL)resolveInstanceMethod:(SEL)name;
 + (BOOL)resolveClassMethod:(SEL)name;
 
 The first time an unrecognized message is sent to an object, the runtime
 checks to see if the class implements +resolveInstanceMethod:, and if so
 calls it. +resolveInstanceMethod: should examine the selector and if it
 should be resolved, call class_addMethod() with an appropriate method
 implementation, and return YES. If the method returns NO, the method will
 be handled by standard method forwarding, as before. +resolveClassMethod:
 resolves unrecognized messages sent to a class in a similar way, except
 that the method should be added to the metaclass.
 
 Possible uses of dynamic method resolution:  faulting in method implementations
 that reside in dynamically loaded libraries;  runtime environment specialization,
 such as choosing between different method implementations based on the
 capabilities of the OS or underlying processor; lastly language bridges could
 use dynamic method resolution to lazily bind their object wrapper methods.

/*
 This category provides a generic dynamic property resolver service for all NSMutableDictionary
 subclasses. It handles unresolved messages by examining the property metadata of the class,
 searching for a property with a name derived from the accessor method name. The properties system
 uses a subset of the naming scheme Key-Value Coding (KVC) uses; i.e. the following property
 
 @property id myExcellentProperty;
 
 will have accessor methods named "myExcellentProperty" and "setMyExcellentProperty:" regardless
 of the type of the property.
 
 The resolver examines the type of the property that corresponds to the method selector, and
 supports property types of id, double, and NSRect. Other types are easy to add.
