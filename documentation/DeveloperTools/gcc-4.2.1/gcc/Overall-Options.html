<h3 class="section">3.2 Options Controlling the Kind of Output</h3>

<p>Compilation can involve up to four stages: preprocessing, compilation
proper, assembly and linking, always in that order.  GCC is capable of
preprocessing and compiling several files either into several
assembler input files, or into one assembler input file; then each
assembler input file produces an object file, and linking combines all
the object files (those newly compiled, and those specified as input)
into an executable file.

 <p><a name="index-file-name-suffix-71"></a>For any given input file, the file name suffix determines what kind of
compilation is done:

     <dl>
<dt><var>file</var><code>.c</code><dd>C source code which must be preprocessed.

     <br><dt><var>file</var><code>.i</code><dd>C source code which should not be preprocessed.

     <br><dt><var>file</var><code>.ii</code><dd>C++ source code which should not be preprocessed.

     <br><dt><var>file</var><code>.m</code><dd>Objective-C source code.  Note that you must link with the <samp><span class="file">libobjc</span></samp>
library to make an Objective-C program work.

     <br><dt><var>file</var><code>.mi</code><dd>Objective-C source code which should not be preprocessed.

     <br><dt><var>file</var><code>.mm</code><dt><var>file</var><code>.M</code><dd>Objective-C++ source code.  Note that you must link with the <samp><span class="file">libobjc</span></samp>
library to make an Objective-C++ program work.  Note that `<samp><span class="samp">.M</span></samp>' refers
to a literal capital M.

     <br><dt><var>file</var><code>.mii</code><dd>Objective-C++ source code which should not be preprocessed.

     <br><dt><var>file</var><code>.h</code><dd>C, C++, Objective-C or Objective-C++ header file to be turned into a
precompiled header.

Note that in `<samp><span class="samp">.cxx</span></samp>',
the last two letters must both be literally `<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>'.  Likewise,
`<samp><span class="samp">.C</span></samp>' refers to a literal capital C.

     <br><dt><var>file</var><code>.mm</code><dt><var>file</var><code>.M</code><dd>Objective-C++ source code which must be preprocessed.

     <!-- FIXME: Descriptions of Java file types. -->
<!-- @var{file}.java -->
<!-- @var{file}.class -->
<!-- @var{file}.zip -->
<!-- @var{file}.jar -->
<br><dt><var>file</var><code>.ads</code><dd>Ada source code file which contains a library unit declaration (a
declaration of a package, subprogram, or generic, or a generic
instantiation), or a library unit renaming declaration (a package,
generic, or subprogram renaming declaration).  Such files are also
called <dfn>specs</dfn>.

     <dt><var>file</var><code>.adb</code><dd>Ada source code file containing a library unit body (a subprogram or
package body).  Such files are also called <dfn>bodies</dfn>.

     <!-- GCC also knows about some suffixes for languages not yet included: -->
<!-- Pascal: -->
<!-- @var{file}.p -->
<!-- @var{file}.pas -->
<!-- Ratfor: -->
<!-- @var{file}.r -->
<br><dt><var>file</var><code>.s</code><dd><!-- APPLE LOCAL begin preprocess .s files -->
Assembler code.  Apple's version of GCC runs the preprocessor
on these files as well as those ending in `<samp><span class="samp">.S</span></samp>'. 
<!-- APPLE LOCAL end preprocess .s files -->

     <br><dt><var>file</var><code>.S</code><dd>Assembler code which must be preprocessed.

     <br><dt><var>other</var><dd>An object file to be fed straight into linking. 
Any file name with no recognized suffix is treated this way. 
</dl>

 <p><a name="index-x-72"></a>You can specify the input language explicitly with the <samp><span class="option">-x</span></samp> option:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-x </code><var>language</var><dd>Specify explicitly the <var>language</var> for the following input files
(rather than letting the compiler choose a default based on the file
name suffix).  This option applies to all following input files until
the next <samp><span class="option">-x</span></samp> option.  Possible values for <var>language</var> are:
     <pre class="smallexample">          c  c-header  c-cpp-output
          c++  c++-header  c++-cpp-output
          objective-c  objective-c-header  objective-c-cpp-output
          objective-c++ objective-c++-header objective-c++-cpp-output
          assembler  assembler-with-cpp
          ada
          f95  f95-cpp-input
          java
          treelang
     </pre>
     <br><dt><code>-x none</code><dd>Turn off any specification of a language, so that subsequent files are
handled according to their file name suffixes (as they are if <samp><span class="option">-x</span></samp>
has not been used at all).

     <!-- APPLE LOCAL begin -ObjC 2001-08-03 -sts ** -->
<br><dt><code>-ObjC</code><dt><code>-ObjC++</code><dd><a name="index-ObjC-73"></a><a name="index-ObjC_002b_002b-74"></a>These are similar in effect to <samp><span class="option">-x objective-c</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-x
objective-c++</span></samp>, but affect only the choice of compiler for files already
identified as source files.  (APPLE ONLY)
<!-- APPLE LOCAL end -ObjC 2001-08-03 -sts ** -->

     <!-- APPLE LOCAL begin fat builds -->
<br><dt><code>-arch </code><var>arch</var><dd><a name="index-arch-75"></a>Compile for the specified target architecture <var>arch</var>.  The
allowable values are `<samp><span class="samp">i386</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">x86_64</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">ppc</span></samp>' and
`<samp><span class="samp">ppc64</span></samp>'.  Multiple options work, and direct the compiler to
produce &ldquo;universal&rdquo; binaries including object code for each
architecture specified with <samp><span class="option">-arch</span></samp>.  This option only works if
assembler and libraries are available for each architecture specified. 
(APPLE ONLY)

     <br><dt><code>-Xarch_</code><var>arch</var> <var>option</var><dd><a name="index-Xarch-76"></a>Apply <var>option</var> to the command line for architecture <var>arch</var>. 
This is useful for specifying an option that should only apply to
one architecture when building a &ldquo;universal&rdquo; binary.  (APPLE ONLY)
<!-- APPLE LOCAL end fat builds -->

     <!-- APPLE LOCAL begin ss2 -->
<br><dt><code>-fsave-repository=</code><var>file</var><dd><a name="index-fsave_002drepository-77"></a>Save debug info in separate object file. 
This is available only while building PCH in -gfull mode. 
<!-- APPLE LOCAL end ss2 -->

     <br><dt><code>-pass-exit-codes</code><dd><a name="index-pass_002dexit_002dcodes-78"></a>Normally the <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp> program will exit with the code of 1 if any
phase of the compiler returns a non-success return code.  If you specify
<samp><span class="option">-pass-exit-codes</span></samp>, the <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp> program will instead return with
numerically highest error produced by any phase that returned an error
indication.  The C, C++, and Fortran frontends return 4, if an internal
compiler error is encountered. 
</dl>

 <p>If you only want some of the stages of compilation, you can use
<samp><span class="option">-x</span></samp> (or filename suffixes) to tell <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp> where to start, and
one of the options <samp><span class="option">-c</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-S</span></samp>, or <samp><span class="option">-E</span></samp> to say where
<samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp> is to stop.  Note that some combinations (for example,
`<samp><span class="samp">-x cpp-output -E</span></samp>') instruct <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp> to do nothing at all.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-c</code><dd><a name="index-c-79"></a>Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link.  The linking
stage simply is not done.  The ultimate output is in the form of an
object file for each source file.

     <p>By default, the object file name for a source file is made by replacing
the suffix `<samp><span class="samp">.c</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">.i</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">.s</span></samp>', etc., with `<samp><span class="samp">.o</span></samp>'.

     <p>Unrecognized input files, not requiring compilation or assembly, are
ignored.

     <br><dt><code>-S</code><dd><a name="index-S-80"></a>Stop after the stage of compilation proper; do not assemble.  The output
is in the form of an assembler code file for each non-assembler input
file specified.

     <p>By default, the assembler file name for a source file is made by
replacing the suffix `<samp><span class="samp">.c</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">.i</span></samp>', etc., with `<samp><span class="samp">.s</span></samp>'.

     <p>Input files that don't require compilation are ignored.

     <br><dt><code>-E</code><dd><a name="index-E-81"></a>Stop after the preprocessing stage; do not run the compiler proper.  The
output is in the form of preprocessed source code, which is sent to the
standard output.

     <p>Input files which don't require preprocessing are ignored.

     <p><a name="index-output-file-option-82"></a><br><dt><code>-o </code><var>file</var><dd><a name="index-o-83"></a>Place output in file <var>file</var>.  This applies regardless to whatever
sort of output is being produced, whether it be an executable file,
an object file, an assembler file or preprocessed C code.

     <p>If <samp><span class="option">-o</span></samp> is not specified, the default is to put an executable
file in <samp><span class="file">a.out</span></samp>, the object file for
<samp><var>source</var><span class="file">.</span><var>suffix</var></samp> in <samp><var>source</var><span class="file">.o</span></samp>, its
assembler file in <samp><var>source</var><span class="file">.s</span></samp>, a precompiled header file in
<samp><var>source</var><span class="file">.</span><var>suffix</var><span class="file">.gch</span></samp>, and all preprocessed C source on
standard output.

     <br><dt><code>-v</code><dd><a name="index-v-84"></a>Print (on standard error output) the commands executed to run the stages
of compilation.  Also print the version number of the compiler driver
program and of the preprocessor and the compiler proper.

     <br><dt><code>-###</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0023_0023_0023-85"></a>Like <samp><span class="option">-v</span></samp> except the commands are not executed and all command
arguments are quoted.  This is useful for shell scripts to capture the
driver-generated command lines.

     <br><dt><code>-pipe</code><dd><a name="index-pipe-86"></a>Use pipes rather than temporary files for communication between the
various stages of compilation.  This fails to work on some systems where
the assembler is unable to read from a pipe; but the GNU assembler has
no trouble.

     <br><dt><code>-combine</code><dd><a name="index-combine-87"></a>If you are compiling multiple source files, this option tells the driver
to pass all the source files to the compiler at once (for those
languages for which the compiler can handle this).  This will allow
intermodule analysis (IMA) to be performed by the compiler.  Currently the only
language for which this is supported is C.  If you pass source files for
multiple languages to the driver, using this option, the driver will invoke
the compiler(s) that support IMA once each, passing each compiler all the
source files appropriate for it.  For those languages that do not support
IMA this option will be ignored, and the compiler will be invoked once for
each source file in that language.  If you use this option in conjunction
with <samp><span class="option">-save-temps</span></samp>, the compiler will generate multiple
pre-processed files
(one for each source file), but only one (combined) <samp><span class="file">.o</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="file">.s</span></samp> file.

     <br><dt><code>--help</code><dd><a name="index-help-88"></a>Print (on the standard output) a description of the command line options
understood by <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp>.  If the <samp><span class="option">-v</span></samp> option is also specified
then <samp><span class="option">--help</span></samp> will also be passed on to the various processes
invoked by <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp>, so that they can display the command line options
they accept.  If the <samp><span class="option">-Wextra</span></samp> option is also specified then command
line options which have no documentation associated with them will also
be displayed.

     <br><dt><code>--target-help</code><dd><a name="index-target_002dhelp-89"></a>Print (on the standard output) a description of target specific command
line options for each tool.

     <br><dt><code>--version</code><dd><a name="index-version-90"></a>Display the version number and copyrights of the invoked GCC.

     <!-- This file is designed to be included in manuals that use -->
<!-- expandargv. -->
<br><dt><code>@</code><var>file</var><dd>Read command-line options from <var>file</var>.  The options read are
inserted in place of the original @<var>file</var> option.  If <var>file</var>
does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
literally, and not removed.

     <p>Options in <var>file</var> are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a
backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included
with a backslash.  The <var>file</var> may itself contain additional
@<var>file</var> options; any such options will be processed recursively.
