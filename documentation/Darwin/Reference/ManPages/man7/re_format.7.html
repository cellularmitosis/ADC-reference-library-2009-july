RE_FORMAT(7)         BSD Miscellaneous Information Manual         RE_FORMAT(7)

<b>NAME</b>
     <b>re_format</b> -- POSIX 1003.2 regular expressions

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
     Regular expressions (``REs''), as defined in IEEE Std 1003.2 (``POSIX.2''), come in two forms: modern
     REs (roughly those of <a href="../man1/egrep.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/egrep">egrep(1)</a>; 1003.2 calls these ``extended'' REs) and obsolete REs (roughly those of
     <a href="../man1/ed.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ed">ed(1)</a>; 1003.2 ``basic'' REs).  Obsolete REs mostly exist for backward compatibility in some old pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">grams;&nbsp;programs;</font>
     grams; they will be discussed at the end.  IEEE Std 1003.2 (``POSIX.2'') leaves some aspects of RE syn-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tax&nbsp;syntax</font>
     tax and semantics open; `' marks decisions on these aspects that may not be fully portable to other
     IEEE Std 1003.2 (``POSIX.2'') implementations.

     A (modern) RE is one or more non-empty <u>branches</u>, separated by `|'.  It matches anything that matches
     one of the branches.

     A branch is one or more <u>pieces</u>, concatenated.  It matches a match for the first, followed by a match
     for the second, etc.

     A piece is an <u>atom</u> possibly followed by a single `*', `+', `?', or <u>bound</u>.  An atom followed by `*'
     matches a sequence of 0 or more matches of the atom.  An atom followed by `+' matches a sequence of 1
     or more matches of the atom.  An atom followed by `?' matches a sequence of 0 or 1 matches of the atom.

     A <u>bound</u> is `{' followed by an unsigned decimal integer, possibly followed by `,' possibly followed by
     another unsigned decimal integer, always followed by `}'.  The integers must lie between 0 and
     RE_DUP_MAX (255) inclusive, and if there are two of them, the first may not exceed the second.  An
     atom followed by a bound containing one integer <u>i</u> and no comma matches a sequence of exactly <u>i</u> matches
     of the atom.  An atom followed by a bound containing one integer <u>i</u> and a comma matches a sequence of <u>i</u>
     or more matches of the atom.  An atom followed by a bound containing two integers <u>i</u> and <u>j</u> matches a
     sequence of <u>i</u> through <u>j</u> (inclusive) matches of the atom.

     An atom is a regular expression enclosed in `()' (matching a match for the regular expression), an
     empty set of `()' (matching the null string), a <u>bracket</u> <u>expression</u> (see below), `.' (matching any sin-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">gle&nbsp;single</font>
     gle character), `^' (matching the null string at the beginning of a line), `$' (matching the null
     string at the end of a line), a `\' followed by one of the characters `^.[$()|*+?{\' (matching that
     character taken as an ordinary character), a `\' followed by any other character (matching that char-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">acter&nbsp;character</font>
     acter taken as an ordinary character, as if the `\' had not been present), or a single character with
     no other significance (matching that character).  A `{' followed by a character other than a digit is
     an ordinary character, not the beginning of a bound.  It is illegal to end an RE with `\'.

     A <u>bracket</u> <u>expression</u> is a list of characters enclosed in `[]'.  It normally matches any single charac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ter&nbsp;character</font>
     ter from the list (but see below).  If the list begins with `^', it matches any single character (but
     see below) <u>not</u> from the rest of the list.  If two characters in the list are separated by `-', this is
     shorthand for the full <u>range</u> of characters between those two (inclusive) in the collating sequence,
     e.g. `[0-9]' in ASCII matches any decimal digit.  It is illegal for two ranges to share an endpoint,
     e.g. `a-c-e'.  Ranges are very collating-sequence-dependent, and portable programs should avoid relying
     on them.

     To include a literal `]' in the list, make it the first character (following a possible `^').  To
     include a literal `-', make it the first or last character, or the second endpoint of a range.  To use
     a literal `-' as the first endpoint of a range, enclose it in `[.' and `.]' to make it a collating ele-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment&nbsp;element</font>
     ment (see below).  With the exception of these and some combinations using `[' (see next paragraphs),
     all other special characters, including `\', lose their special significance within a bracket expres-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion.&nbsp;expression.</font>
     sion.

     Within a bracket expression, a collating element (a character, a multi-character sequence that collates
     as if it were a single character, or a collating-sequence name for either) enclosed in `[.' and `.]'
     stands for the sequence of characters of that collating element.  The sequence is a single element of
     the bracket expression's list.  A bracket expression containing a multi-character collating element can
     thus match more than one character, e.g. if the collating sequence includes a `ch' collating element,
     then the RE `[[.ch.]]*c' matches the first five characters of `chchcc'.

     Within a bracket expression, a collating element enclosed in `[=' and `=]' is an equivalence class,
     standing for the sequences of characters of all collating elements equivalent to that one, including
     itself.  (If there are no other equivalent collating elements, the treatment is as if the enclosing
     delimiters were `[.' and `.]'.)  For example, if `x' and `y' are the members of an equivalence class,
     then `[[=x=]]', `[[=y=]]', and `[xy]' are all synonymous.  An equivalence class may not be an endpoint
     of a range.

     Within a bracket expression, the name of a <u>character</u> <u>class</u> enclosed in `[:' and `:]' stands for the
     list of all characters belonging to that class.  Standard character class names are:

           <u>alnum</u>    <u>digit</u>    <u>punct</u>
           <u>alpha</u>    <u>graph</u>    <u>space</u>
           <u>blank</u>    <u>lower</u>    <u>upper</u>
           <u>cntrl</u>    <u>print</u>    <u>xdigit</u>

     These stand for the character classes defined in <a href="../man3/ctype.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/ctype">ctype(3)</a>.  A locale may provide others.  A character
     class may not be used as an endpoint of a range.

     There are two special cases of bracket expressions: the bracket expressions `[[:&lt;:]]' and `[[:&gt;:]]'
     match the null string at the beginning and end of a word respectively.  A word is defined as a sequence
     of word characters which is neither preceded nor followed by word characters.  A word character is an
     <u>alnum</u> character (as defined by <a href="../man3/ctype.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/ctype">ctype(3)</a>) or an underscore.  This is an extension, compatible with but
     not specified by IEEE Std 1003.2 (``POSIX.2''), and should be used with caution in software intended to
     be portable to other systems.

     In the event that an RE could match more than one substring of a given string, the RE matches the one
     starting earliest in the string.  If the RE could match more than one substring starting at that point,
     it matches the longest.  Subexpressions also match the longest possible substrings, subject to the con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">straint&nbsp;constraint</font>
     straint that the whole match be as long as possible, with subexpressions starting earlier in the RE
     taking priority over ones starting later.  Note that higher-level subexpressions thus take priority
     over their lower-level component subexpressions.

     Match lengths are measured in characters, not collating elements.  A null string is considered longer
     than no match at all.  For example, `bb*' matches the three middle characters of `abbbc',
     `(wee|week)(knights|nights)' matches all ten characters of `weeknights', when `(.*).*' is matched
     against `abc' the parenthesized subexpression matches all three characters, and when `(a*)*' is matched
     against `bc' both the whole RE and the parenthesized subexpression match the null string.

     If case-independent matching is specified, the effect is much as if all case distinctions had vanished
     from the alphabet.  When an alphabetic that exists in multiple cases appears as an ordinary character
     outside a bracket expression, it is effectively transformed into a bracket expression containing both
     cases, e.g. `x' becomes `[xX]'.  When it appears inside a bracket expression, all case counterparts of
     it are added to the bracket expression, so that (e.g.)  `[x]' becomes `[xX]' and `[^x]' becomes
     `[^xX]'.

     No particular limit is imposed on the length of REs.  Programs intended to be portable should not
     employ REs longer than 256 bytes, as an implementation can refuse to accept such REs and remain POSIX-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">compliant.&nbsp;POSIXcompliant.</font>
     compliant.

     Obsolete (``basic'') regular expressions differ in several respects.  `|' is an ordinary character and
     there is no equivalent for its functionality.  `+' and `?' are ordinary characters, and their function-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ality&nbsp;functionality</font>
     ality can be expressed using bounds (`{1,}' or `{0,1}' respectively).  Also note that `x+' in modern
     REs is equivalent to `xx*'.  The delimiters for bounds are `\{' and `\}', with `{' and `}' by them-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">selves&nbsp;themselves</font>
     selves ordinary characters.  The parentheses for nested subexpressions are `\(' and `\)', with `(' and
     `)' by themselves ordinary characters.  `^' is an ordinary character except at the beginning of the RE
     or the beginning of a parenthesized subexpression, `$' is an ordinary character except at the end of
     the RE or the end of a parenthesized subexpression, and `*' is an ordinary character if it appears at
     the beginning of the RE or the beginning of a parenthesized subexpression (after a possible leading
     `^').  Finally, there is one new type of atom, a <u>back</u> <u>reference</u>: `\' followed by a non-zero decimal
     digit <u>d</u> matches the same sequence of characters matched by the <u>d</u>th parenthesized subexpression (number-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;(numbering</font>
     ing subexpressions by the positions of their opening parentheses, left to right), so that (e.g.)
     `\([bc]\)\1' matches `bb' or `cc' but not `bc'.

<b>BUGS</b>
     Having two kinds of REs is a botch.

     The current IEEE Std 1003.2 (``POSIX.2'') spec says that `)' is an ordinary character in the absence of
     an unmatched `('; this was an unintentional result of a wording error, and change is likely.  Avoid
     relying on it.

     Back references are a dreadful botch, posing major problems for efficient implementations.  They are
     also somewhat vaguely defined (does `a\(\(b\)*\2\)*d' match `abbbd'?).  Avoid using them.

     IEEE Std 1003.2 (``POSIX.2'') specification of case-independent matching is vague.  The ``one case
     implies all cases'' definition given above is current consensus among implementors as to the right
     interpretation.

     The syntax for word boundaries is incredibly ugly.
