ZIPINFO(1L)                                                                                      ZIPINFO(1L)



<b>NAME</b>
       zipinfo - list detailed information about a ZIP archive

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>zipinfo</b> [<b>-12smlvhMtTz</b>] <u>file</u>[<u>.zip</u>] <!-- a -->[<u>file(s)</u><!-- /a --><u></u> ...] [<b>-x</b> <!-- a --><u>xfile(s)</u><!-- /a --><u></u> ...]

       <b>unzip</b> <b>-Z</b> [<b>-12smlvhMtTz</b>] <u>file</u>[<u>.zip</u>] <!-- a -->[<u>file(s)</u><!-- /a --><u></u> ...] [<b>-x</b> <!-- a --><u>xfile(s)</u><!-- /a --><u></u> ...]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       <u>zipinfo</u>  lists technical information about files in a ZIP archive, most commonly found on MS-DOS sys-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tems.&nbsp;systems.</font>
       tems.  Such information includes file access permissions, encryption  status,  type  of  compression,
       version and operating system or file system of compressing program, and the like.  The default behav-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ior&nbsp;behavior</font>
       ior (with no options) is to list single-line entries for each file in the archive,  with  header  and
       trailer  lines  providing  summary information for the entire archive.  The format is a cross between
       Unix ``ls -l'' and ``unzip -v'' output.  See <b>DETAILED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b> below.  Note that  <u>zipinfo</u>  is  the
       same  program as <u>unzip</u> (under Unix, a link to it); on some systems, however, <u>zipinfo</u> support may have
       been omitted when <u>unzip</u> was compiled.

<b>ARGUMENTS</b>
       <u>file</u>[<u>.zip</u>]
              Path of the ZIP <!-- a -->archive(s)<!-- /a -->.  If the file specification is a wildcard, each  matching  file  is
              processed  in an order determined by the operating system (or file system).  Only the filename
              can be a wildcard; the path itself cannot.  Wildcard expressions are similar to Unix  <a href="egrep.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/egrep"><u>egrep</u>(1)</a>
              (regular) expressions and may contain:

              *      matches a sequence of 0 or more characters

              ?      matches exactly 1 character

              [...]  matches  any  single  character  found  inside  the brackets; ranges are specified by a
                     beginning character, a hyphen, and an ending character.  If an exclamation point  or  a
                     caret  (`!'  or  `^') follows the left bracket, then the range of characters within the
                     brackets is complemented (that is, anything <u>except</u> the characters inside  the  brackets
                     is  considered  a  match).   To  specify  a  verbatim left bracket, the three-character
                     sequence ``[[]'' has to be used.

              (Be sure to quote any character that might otherwise be interpreted or modified by the operat-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;operating</font>
              ing  system,  particularly under Unix and VMS.)  If no matches are found, the specification is
              assumed to be a literal filename; and if that also fails, the suffix .zip is  appended.   Note
              that  self-extracting ZIP files are supported, as with any other ZIP archive; just specify the
              .exe suffix (if any) explicitly.

       <!-- a -->[<u>file(s)</u><!-- /a --><u></u>]
              An optional list of archive members to be processed, separated by spaces.  (VMS versions  com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">piled&nbsp;compiled</font>
              piled with VMSCLI defined must delimit files with commas instead.)  Regular expressions (wild-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cards)&nbsp;(wildcards)</font>
              cards) may be used to match multiple members; see above.  Again, be sure to quote  expressions
              that would otherwise be expanded or modified by the operating system.

       [<b>-x</b> <!-- a --><u>xfile(s)</u><!-- /a --><u></u>]
              An optional list of archive members to be excluded from processing.

<b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-1</b>     list  filenames  only,  one  per line.  This option excludes all others; headers, trailers and
              zipfile comments are never printed.  It is intended for use in Unix shell scripts.

       <b>-2</b>     list filenames only, one per line, but allow headers (<b>-h</b>), trailers (<b>-t</b>) and zipfile  comments
              (<b>-z</b>), as well.  This option may be useful in cases where the stored filenames are particularly
              long.

       <b>-s</b>     list zipfile info in short Unix ``ls -l'' format.  This is the default behavior; see below.

       <b>-m</b>     list zipfile info in medium Unix ``ls -l'' format.  Identical to the <b>-s</b>  output,  except  that
              the compression factor, expressed as a percentage, is also listed.

       <b>-l</b>     list  zipfile  info in long Unix ``ls -l'' format.  As with <b>-m</b> except that the compressed size
              (in bytes) is printed instead of the compression ratio.

       <b>-v</b>     list zipfile information in verbose, multi-page format.

       <b>-h</b>     list header line.  The archive name, actual size (in bytes)  and  total  number  of  files  is
              printed.

       <b>-M</b>     pipe  all output through an internal pager similar to the Unix <a href="more.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/more"><u>more</u>(1)</a> command.  At the end of
              a screenful of output, <u>zipinfo</u> pauses with a ``--More--'' prompt; the next  screenful  may  be
              viewed  by  pressing  the  Enter  (Return) key or the space bar.  <u>zipinfo</u> can be terminated by
              pressing the ``q'' key and, on some systems, the Enter/Return key.  Unlike Unix <a href="more.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/more"><u>more</u>(1)</a>, there
              is  no  forward-searching  or  editing capability.  Also, <u>zipinfo</u> doesn't notice if long lines
              wrap at the edge of the screen, effectively resulting in the printing of two or more lines and
              the  likelihood  that some text will scroll off the top of the screen before being viewed.  On
              some systems the number of available lines on the screen is not detected, in which  case  <u>zip</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">info&nbsp;zipinfo</font>
              <u>info</u> assumes the height is 24 lines.

       <b>-t</b>     list totals for files listed or for all files.  The number of files listed, their uncompressed
              and compressed total sizes , and their overall compression factor is printed; or, if only  the
              totals  line  is  being  printed, the values for the entire archive are given.  The compressed
              total size does not include the 12 additional header bytes of each encrypted entry. Note  that
              the  total  compressed  (data) size will never match the actual zipfile size, since the latter
              includes all of the internal zipfile headers in addition to the compressed data.

       <b>-T</b>     print the file dates and times in a sortable decimal format (yymmdd.hhmmss).  The default date
              format  is  a more standard, human-readable version with abbreviated month names (see examples
              below).

       <b>-z</b>     include the archive comment (if any) in the listing.

<b>DETAILED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       <u>zipinfo</u> has a number of modes, and its behavior can be rather difficult to fathom if one isn't famil-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">iar&nbsp;familiar</font>
       iar with Unix <a href="ls.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ls"><u>ls</u>(1)</a> (or even if one is).  The default behavior is to list files in the following for-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mat:&nbsp;format:</font>
       mat:

  -rw-rws---  1.9 unx    2802 t- defX 11-Aug-91 13:48 perms.2660

       The last three fields are the modification date and time of the file, and its name.  The case of  the
       filename  is  respected;  thus files that come from MS-DOS PKZIP are always capitalized.  If the file
       was zipped with a stored directory name, that is also displayed as part of the filename.

       The second and third fields indicate that the file was zipped under Unix with  version  1.9  of  <u>zip</u>.
       Since  it comes from Unix, the file permissions at the beginning of the line are printed in Unix for-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mat.&nbsp;format.</font>
       mat.  The uncompressed file-size (2802 in this example) is the fourth field.

       The fifth field consists of two characters, either of which may take on several  values.   The  first
       character  may  be  either  `t'  or  `b', indicating that <u>zip</u> believes the file to be text or binary,
       respectively; but if the file is encrypted, <u>zipinfo</u> notes this fact  by  capitalizing  the  character
       (`T'  or  `B').   The second character may also take on four values, depending on whether there is an
       extended local header and/or an ``extra field'' associated with the file (fully explained in PKWare's
       APPNOTE.TXT,  but  basically  analogous  to  pragmas  in ANSI C--i.e., they provide a standard way to
       include non-standard information in the archive).  If neither exists, the character will be a  hyphen
       (`-'); if there is an extended local header but no extra field, `l'; if the reverse, `x'; and if both
       exist, `X'.  Thus the file in this example is (probably) a text file, is not encrypted, and has  nei-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ther&nbsp;neither</font>
       ther an extra field nor an extended local header associated with it.  The example below, on the other
       hand, is an encrypted binary file with an extra field:

  RWD,R,R     0.9 vms     168 Bx shrk  9-Aug-91 19:15 perms.0644

       Extra fields are used for various purposes (see discussion of the  <b>-v</b>  option  below)  including  the
       storage of VMS file attributes, which is presumably the case here.  Note that the file attributes are
       listed in VMS format.  Some other possibilities for the host operating system (which  is  actually  a
       misnomer--host  file  system  is  more  correct) include OS/2 or NT with High Performance File System
       (HPFS), MS-DOS, OS/2 or NT with File Allocation Table (FAT) file system, and  Macintosh.   These  are
       denoted as follows:

  -rw-a--     1.0 hpf    5358 Tl i4:3  4-Dec-91 11:33 longfilename.hpfs
  -r--ahs     1.1 fat    4096 b- i4:2 14-Jul-91 12:58 EA DATA. SF
  --w-------  1.0 mac   17357 bx i8:2  4-May-92 04:02 unzip.macr

       File attributes in the first two cases are indicated in a Unix-like format, where the seven subfields
       indicate whether the file:  (1) is a directory, (2) is readable (always true), (3) is  writable,  (4)
       is  executable  (guessed  on  the  basis  of the extension--<u>.exe</u>, <u>.com</u>, <u>.bat</u>, <u>.cmd</u> and <u>.btm</u> files are
       assumed to be so), (5) has its archive bit set, (6) is hidden, and (7) is a system file.  Interpreta-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;Interpretation</font>
       tion  of  Macintosh  file  attributes  is unreliable because some Macintosh archivers don't store any
       attributes in the archive.

       Finally, the sixth field indicates the compression method and possible sub-method  used.   There  are
       six  methods  known at present:  storing (no compression), reducing, shrinking, imploding, tokenizing
       (never publicly released), and deflating.  In addition, there are four levels of reducing (1  through
       4);  four  types  of imploding (4K or 8K sliding dictionary, and 2 or 3 Shannon-Fano trees); and four
       levels of deflating (superfast, fast, normal, maximum compression).  <u>zipinfo</u> represents these methods
       and  their  sub-methods  as follows:  <u>stor</u>; <u>re:1</u>, <u>re:2</u>, etc.; <u>shrk</u>; <u>i4:2</u>, <u>i8:3</u>, etc.; <u>tokn</u>; and <u>defS</u>,
       <u>defF</u>, <u>defN</u>, and <u>defX</u>.

       The medium and long listings are almost identical to the short format except that they  add  informa-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;information</font>
       tion  on the file's compression.  The medium format lists the file's compression factor as a percent-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">age&nbsp;percentage</font>
       age indicating the amount of space that has been ``removed'':

  -rw-rws---  1.5 unx    2802 t- 81% defX 11-Aug-91 13:48 perms.2660

       In this example, the file has been compressed by more than a factor of five; the compressed data  are
       only 19% of the original size.  The long format gives the compressed file's size in bytes, instead:

  -rw-rws---  1.5 unx    2802 t-     538 defX 11-Aug-91 13:48 perms.2660

       In contrast to the <u>unzip</u> listings, the compressed size figures in this listing format denote the com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">plete&nbsp;complete</font>
       plete size of compressed data, including the 12 extra header bytes in case of encrypted entries.

       Adding the <b>-T</b> option changes the file date and time to decimal format:

  -rw-rws---  1.5 unx    2802 t-     538 defX 910811.134804 perms.2660

       Note that because of limitations in the MS-DOS format used to store file times, the seconds field  is
       always  rounded  to  the  nearest even second.  For Unix files this is expected to change in the next
       major releases of <a href="zip.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/zip"><u>zip</u>(1L)</a> and <u>unzip</u>.

       In addition to individual file information, a  default  zipfile  listing  also  includes  header  and
       trailer lines:

  Archive:  OS2.zip   5453 bytes   5 files
  ,,rw,       1.0 hpf     730 b- i4:3 26-Jun-92 23:40 Contents
  ,,rw,       1.0 hpf    3710 b- i4:3 26-Jun-92 23:33 makefile.os2
  ,,rw,       1.0 hpf    8753 b- i8:3 26-Jun-92 15:29 os2unzip.c
  ,,rw,       1.0 hpf      98 b- stor 21-Aug-91 15:34 unzip.def
  ,,rw,       1.0 hpf      95 b- stor 21-Aug-91 17:51 zipinfo.def
  5 files, 13386 bytes uncompressed, 4951 bytes compressed:  63.0%

       The  header  line  gives  the name of the archive, its total size, and the total number of files; the
       trailer gives the number of files listed, their total uncompressed size, and their  total  compressed
       size  (not including any of <u>zip</u>'s internal overhead).  If, however, one or more <!-- a --><u>file(s)</u><!-- /a --><u></u> are provided,
       the header and trailer lines are not listed.  This behavior is also similar to that  of  Unix's  ``ls
       -l'';  it may be overridden by specifying the <b>-h</b> and <b>-t</b> options explicitly.  In such a case the list-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;listing</font>
       ing format must also be specified explicitly, since <b>-h</b> or <b>-t</b>  (or  both)  in  the  absence  of  other
       options  implies  that ONLY the header or trailer line (or both) is listed.  See the <b>EXAMPLES</b> section
       below for a semi-intelligible translation of this nonsense.

       The verbose listing is mostly self-explanatory.  It also lists file comments and the zipfile comment,
       if  any, and the type and number of bytes in any stored extra fields.  Currently known types of extra
       fields include PKWARE's authentication (``AV'') info; OS/2 extended attributes; VMS filesystem  info,
       both  PKWARE  and  Info-ZIP versions; Macintosh resource forks; Acorn/Archimedes SparkFS info; and so
       on.  (Note that in the case of OS/2 extended attributes--perhaps the most common use of zipfile extra
       fields--the  size  of  the stored EAs as reported by <u>zipinfo</u> may not match the number given by OS/2's
       <u>dir</u> command: OS/2 always reports the number of bytes  required  in  16-bit  format,  whereas  <u>zipinfo</u>
       always reports the 32-bit storage.)

       Again,  the  compressed  size figures of the individual entries include the 12 extra header bytes for
       encrypted entries.  In contrast, the archive total compressed size and the average compression  ratio
       shown  in  the  summary  bottom  line  are  calculated <b>without</b> the extra 12 header bytes of encrypted
       entries.

<b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       Modifying <u>zipinfo</u>'s default behavior via options placed in an environment variable can be a bit  com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">plicated&nbsp;complicated</font>
       plicated  to explain, due to <u>zipinfo</u>'s attempts to handle various defaults in an intuitive, yet Unix-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">like,&nbsp;Unixlike,</font>
       like, manner.  (Try not to laugh.)  Nevertheless, there is some underlying logic.   In  brief,  there
       are  three ``priority levels'' of options:  the default options; environment options, which can over-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ride&nbsp;override</font>
       ride or add to the defaults; and explicit options given by the user, which can  override  or  add  to
       either of the above.

       The default listing format, as noted above, corresponds roughly to the "zipinfo -hst" command (except
       when individual zipfile members are specified).  A user who prefers the long-listing format (<b>-l</b>)  can
       make use of the <u>zipinfo</u>'s environment variable to change this default:

       Unix Bourne shell:
              ZIPINFO=-l; export ZIPINFO

       Unix C shell:
              setenv ZIPINFO -l

       OS/2 or MS-DOS:
              set ZIPINFO=-l

       VMS (quotes for <u>lowercase</u>):
              define ZIPINFO_OPTS "-l"

       If, in addition, the user dislikes the trailer line, <u>zipinfo</u>'s concept of ``negative options'' may be
       used to override the default inclusion of the line.  This is accomplished by preceding the  undesired
       option  with  one or more minuses:  e.g., ``-l-t'' or ``--tl'', in this example.  The first hyphen is
       the regular switch character, but the one before the `t' is a minus sign.  The dual  use  of  hyphens
       may seem a little awkward, but it's reasonably intuitive nonetheless:  simply ignore the first hyphen
       and go from there.  It is also consistent with the behavior of the Unix command <a href="nice.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/nice"><u>nice</u>(1)</a>.

       As suggested above, the default variable names are ZIPINFO_OPTS for VMS (where  the  symbol  used  to
       install  <u>zipinfo</u> as a foreign command would otherwise be confused with the environment variable), and
       ZIPINFO for all other operating systems.  For compatibility with <a href="zip.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/zip"><u>zip</u>(1L)</a>, ZIPINFOOPT is also accepted
       (don't ask).  If both ZIPINFO and ZIPINFOOPT are defined, however, ZIPINFO takes precedence.  <u>unzip</u>'s
       diagnostic option (<b>-v</b> with no zipfile name) can be used to check the  values  of  all  four  possible
       <u>unzip</u> and <u>zipinfo</u> environment variables.

<b>EXAMPLES</b>
       To get a basic, short-format listing of the complete contents of a ZIP archive <u>storage.zip</u>, with both
       header and totals lines, use only the archive name as an argument to zipinfo:

           zipinfo storage

       To produce a basic, long-format listing (not verbose), including header and totals lines, use <b>-l</b>:

           zipinfo -l storage

       To list the complete contents of the archive without header and totals lines, either  negate  the  <b>-h</b>
       and <b>-t</b> options or else specify the contents explicitly:

           zipinfo --h-t storage
           zipinfo storage \*

       (where  the  backslash  is  required only if the shell would otherwise expand the `*' wildcard, as in
       Unix when globbing is turned on--double quotes around the asterisk would have worked  as  well).   To
       turn off the totals line by default, use the environment variable (C shell is assumed here):

           setenv ZIPINFO --t
           zipinfo storage

       To get the full, short-format listing of the first example again, given that the environment variable
       is set as in the previous example, it is necessary to specify the <b>-s</b> option explicitly, since the  <b>-t</b>
       option by itself implies that ONLY the footer line is to be printed:

           setenv ZIPINFO --t
           zipinfo -t storage            [only totals line]
           zipinfo -st storage           [full listing]

       The  <b>-s</b>  option, like <b>-m</b> and <b>-l</b>, includes headers and footers by default, unless otherwise specified.
       Since the environment variable specified no footers and that has a higher precedence than the default
       behavior  of  <b>-s</b>, an explicit <b>-t</b> option was necessary to produce the full listing.  Nothing was indi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cated&nbsp;indicated</font>
       cated about the header, however, so the <b>-s</b> option was sufficient.  Note  that  both  the  <b>-h</b>  and  <b>-t</b>
       options,  when  used  by themselves or with each other, override any default listing of member files;
       only the header and/or footer are printed.  This behavior is useful when <u>zipinfo</u> is used with a wild-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">card&nbsp;wildcard</font>
       card zipfile specification; the contents of all zipfiles are then summarized with a single command.

       To  list  information  on  a  single  file within the archive, in medium format, specify the filename
       explicitly:

           zipinfo -m storage unshrink.c

       The specification of any member file, as in this example, will override the default header and totals
       lines;  only  the single line of information about the requested file will be printed.  This is intu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">itively&nbsp;intuitively</font>
       itively what one would expect when requesting information about a single file.  For  multiple  files,
       it is often useful to know the total compressed and uncompressed size; in such cases <b>-t</b> may be speci-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fied&nbsp;specified</font>
       fied explicitly:

           zipinfo -mt storage "*.[ch]" Mak\*

       To get maximal information about the ZIP archive, use the verbose option.  It is usually wise to pipe
       the output into a filter such as Unix <a href="more.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/more"><u>more</u>(1)</a> if the operating system allows it:

           zipinfo -v storage | more

       Finally,  to  see  the  most recently modified files in the archive, use the <b>-T</b> option in conjunction
       with an external sorting utility such as Unix <a href="sort.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/sort"><u>sort</u>(1)</a> (and <a href="sed.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/sed"><u>sed</u>(1)</a> as well, in this example):

           zipinfo -T storage | sort -nr -k 7 | sed 15q

       The <b>-nr</b> option to <a href="sort.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/sort"><u>sort</u>(1)</a> tells it to sort numerically in reverse order rather than in textual order,
       and  the  <b>-k</b> <b>7</b>  option tells it to sort on the seventh field.  This assumes the default short-listing
       format; if <b>-m</b> or <b>-l</b> is used, the proper <a href="sort.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/sort"><u>sort</u>(1)</a> option would be <b>-k</b> <b>8</b>.  Older versions of  <a href="sort.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/sort"><u>sort</u>(1)</a>  do
       not  support  the  <b>-k</b>  option,  but you can use the traditional <b>+</b> option instead, e.g., <b>+6</b> instead of
       <b>-k</b> <b>7</b>.  The <a href="sed.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/sed"><u>sed</u>(1)</a> command filters out all but the first 15 lines of the listing.  Future releases  of
       <u>zipinfo</u> may incorporate date/time and filename sorting as built-in options.

<b>TIPS</b>
       The  author  finds it convenient to define an alias <u>ii</u> for <u>zipinfo</u> on systems that allow aliases (or,
       on other systems, copy/rename the executable, create a link or create a command file  with  the  name
       <u>ii</u>).   The  <u>ii</u>  usage  parallels  the  common  <u>ll</u> alias for long listings in Unix, and the similarity
       between the outputs of the two commands was intentional.

<b>BUGS</b>
       As with <u>unzip</u>, <u>zipinfo</u>'s <b>-M</b> (``more'') option is overly simplistic in its handling of screen  output;
       as  noted above, it fails to detect the wrapping of long lines and may thereby cause lines at the top
       of the screen to be scrolled off before being read.  <u>zipinfo</u> should detect and treat each  occurrence
       of  line-wrap  as one additional line printed.  This requires knowledge of the screen's width as well
       as its height.  In addition, <u>zipinfo</u> should detect the true screen geometry on all systems.

       <u>zipinfo</u>'s listing-format behavior is unnecessarily complex and should be simplified.  (This is not to
       say that it will be.)
