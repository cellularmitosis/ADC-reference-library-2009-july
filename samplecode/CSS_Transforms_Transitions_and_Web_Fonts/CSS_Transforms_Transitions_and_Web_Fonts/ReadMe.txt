== Overview ==
"PhotoToss" demonstrates how to use CSS transforms and transitions to position and animate elements of a web page. This sample also illustrates how to use CSS3 Web fonts (in this case, with text shadow). CSS3 Web fonts enable site authors to link to and retrieve fonts for display in their web content.

For more information about Web Fonts, see:
http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-webfonts/



== Using the Sample ==
Open index.html in Safari 3.1 or later. Click on photos in the "stack" to transition/animate them to the corner. Refresh the page to reset the "stack".  

Notice that the text on this page, "Life in Maui" can be selected, copied, and pasted.  This text is drawn using CSS3 Web fonts, not an image.
