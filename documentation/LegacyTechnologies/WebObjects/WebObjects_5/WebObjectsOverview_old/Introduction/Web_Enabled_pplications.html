Client-Server Applications</font></h2><!-- apple_doc: pageHeadingEnd -->

<p><font face="Times">Although the majority of websites primarily publish static
data, the number of sites that publish dynamic content is growing
rapidly. Many corporations use intranets, the Internet, or both
to provide easy access to internal applications and data. An online
store selling books, music, or even computers is one example of
a Web-enabled client-server application.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Web-enabled applications can have huge advantages over traditional
applications. Clients don't have to install the application, which
not only saves client disk space but ensures that the user always
has the most up-to-date version of the application. As well, the
client computers can be Macintosh computers, PCs, or workstations-anything
that can run a Web browser with the necessary capabilities.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">WebObjects allows you to develop two different flavors of
Web-enabled application: HTML-based applications and Java Client
applications. HTML-based applications are analogous to Common Gateway
Interface (CGI) applications and consist of dynamically-generated
HTML pages accessed through a Web browser. Java Client moves part
of your application to the client-side computer and enlists Sun's
Java Foundation Classes (JFC) to give it the rich user interface
found in a more traditional desktop application.</font></p>
<a name = "TPXREF104"></a><h3><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande">HTML-Based
WebObjects Applications</font></h3>
<p><font face="Times">When you need to develop a HTML-based application like a shopping
cart, you can create it quickly and easily with the WebObjects development
tools. WebObjects supplies a large number of prebuilt components-Web
pages, or portions of Web pages, from which you can build your Web
application's interface. These components range from simple user interface
widgets (for example, submit buttons, checkboxes, and tables) to
complex ones (for example, toolbars). The set of components that
you can use with WebObjects is extensible, so you can create components
that can be reused across all of your Web applications. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Your application isn't entirely built of components. You
create WebObjects applications from a combination of components
and Java classes. You put your application-specific business logic
in some of these classes. WebObjects provides the rest of them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">The basic structure of an HTML-based Web application matches
that of a dynamic publishing site that uses WebObjects. Thus,  <a href="Dynamic_HTML_Publishing.html#BABCAEDC" target = "_right">Figure 2-2</a> applies
to HTML-based Web applications as well.</font></p>
<a name = "TPXREF105"></a><h3><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande">Java
Client Applications</font></h3>
<p><font face="Times">When you need the fast and rich user interface of desktop
client-server applications, you can partition your application so
that a portion of it-including all or part of the user interface-runs
in Java directly on the client. Client-server communication is handled
by WebObjects. WebObjects applications that are partitioned in this
way are known as <b>Java Client</b> applications.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Java Client distributes the objects of your WebObjects application
between the application server and one or more clients-typically
Java applications. It is based on a distributed multi-tier client-server
architecture where processing duties are divided between a client, an
application server, a database server, and a Web server. With a
Java Client application, you can partition business objects containing
business logic and data into a client side and a server side. This
partitioning can improve performance and at the same time help to secure
legacy data and business rules.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times"> <a href="#BABFHFGG">Figure 2-3</a> illustrates a Java Client application in which the
client portion is running as an application installed on the user's
computer. As with an HTML-based WebObjects application, the application
can communicate with the server side using HTTP. In addition, Java
Client passes objects between a portion of your application residing
on the user's computer and the portion of your application that
remains on the application server.</font></p>
