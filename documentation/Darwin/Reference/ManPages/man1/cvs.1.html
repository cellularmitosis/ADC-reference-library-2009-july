<b>NAME</b>
       cvs - Concurrent Versions System

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>cvs</b> [ <u>cvs</u><b>_</b><u>options</u> ]
              <u>cvs</u><b>_</b><u>command</u> [ <u>command</u><b>_</b><u>options</u> ] [ <u>command</u><b>_</b><u>args</u> ]

<b>NOTE</b>
       This  manpage  is a summary of some of the features of <b>cvs</b>.  It is auto-generated from an appendix of
       the CVS manual.  For more in-depth documentation, please consult the Cederqvist manual (via the  <b>info</b>
       <b>CVS</b> command or otherwise, as described in the SEE ALSO section of this manpage).  Cross-references in
       this man page refer to nodes in the same.

<b>CVS</b> <b>commands</b>
   <b>Guide</b> <b>to</b> <b>CVS</b> <b>commands</b>
       This appendix describes the overall structure of <b>cvs</b> commands, and describes some commands in  detail
       (others  are  described  elsewhere; for a quick reference to <b>cvs</b> commands, see node `Invoking CVS' in
       the CVS manual).


<b>Structure</b>
   <b>Overall</b> <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>CVS</b> <b>commands</b>
       The overall format of all <b>cvs</b> commands is:


         cvs [ cvs_options ] cvs_command [ command_options ] [ command_args ]






       <b>cvs</b>

         The name of the <b>cvs</b> program.



       <b>cvs_options</b>

         Some options that affect all sub-commands of <b>cvs</b>.  These are described below.



       <b>cvs_command</b>

         One of several different sub-commands.  Some of the commands have aliases that can be used instead;
         those  aliases  are  noted in the reference manual for that command.  There are only two situations
         where you may omit <b>cvs_command</b>: <b>cvs</b> <b>-H</b> elicits a list of available commands, and  <b>cvs</b>  <b>-v</b>  displays
         version information on <b>cvs</b> itself.



       <b>command_options</b>

         Options that are specific for the command.



       <b>command_args</b>

         Arguments to the commands.

         There  is  unfortunately  some  confusion between <b>cvs_options</b> and <b>command_options</b>.  When given as a
         <b>cvs_option</b>, some options only affect some of the commands.  When given as a <b>command_option</b>  it  may
         have  a different meaning, and be accepted by more commands.  In other words, do not take the above
         categorization too seriously.  Look at the documentation instead.


<b>Exit</b> <b>status</b>
   <b>CVS's</b> <b>exit</b> <b>status</b>
       <b>cvs</b> can indicate to the calling environment whether it succeeded or failed by setting its  <u>exit</u>  <u>sta</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tus.&nbsp;status.</font>
       <u>tus</u>.   The  exact way of testing the exit status will vary from one operating system to another.  For
       example in a unix shell script the <b>$?</b> variable will be 0 if the last command  returned  a  successful
       exit status, or greater than 0 if the exit status indicated failure.

       If  <b>cvs</b>  is successful, it returns a successful status; if there is an error, it prints an error mes-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sage&nbsp;message</font>
       sage and returns a failure status.  The one exception to this is  the  <b>cvs</b>  <b>diff</b>  command.   It  will
       return  a successful status if it found no differences, or a failure status if there were differences
       or if there was an error.  Because this behavior provides no good way to detect errors, in the future
       it is possible that <b>cvs</b> <b>diff</b> will be changed to behave like the other <b>cvs</b> commands.


<b>~/.cvsrc</b>
   <b>Default</b> <b>options</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>~/.cvsrc</b> <b>file</b>
       There  are  some  <b>command_options</b>  that are used so often that you might have set up an alias or some
       other means to make sure you always specify that option.  One example (the one that drove the  imple-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mentation&nbsp;implementation</font>
       mentation  of  the  <b>.cvsrc</b> support, actually) is that many people find the default output of the <b>diff</b>
       command to be very hard to read, and that either context diffs or unidiffs are much easier to  under-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">stand.&nbsp;understand.</font>
       stand.

       The  <b>~/.cvsrc</b>  file  is a way that you can add default options to <b>cvs_commands</b> within cvs, instead of
       relying on aliases or other shell scripts.

       The format of the <b>~/.cvsrc</b> file is simple.  The file is searched for a line that begins with the same
       name as the <b>cvs_command</b> being executed.  If a match is found, then the remainder of the line is split
       up (at whitespace characters) into separate options and added to the  command  arguments  <u>before</u>  any
       options from the command line.

       If  a  command has two names (e.g., <b>checkout</b> and <b>co</b>), the official name, not necessarily the one used
       on the command line, will be used to match against the file.  So if  this  is  the  contents  of  the
       user's <b>~/.cvsrc</b> file:


         log -N
         diff -uN
         rdiff -u
         update -Pd
         checkout -P
         release -d




       the  command <b>cvs</b> <b>checkout</b> <b>foo</b> would have the <b>-P</b> option added to the arguments, as well as <b>cvs</b> <b>co</b> <b>foo</b>.

       With the example file above, the output from <b>cvs</b> <b>diff</b> <b>foobar</b> will be in unidiff format.  <b>cvs</b> <b>diff</b>  <b>-c</b>
       <b>foobar</b>  will provide context diffs, as usual.  Getting "old" format diffs would be slightly more com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">plicated,&nbsp;complicated,</font>
       plicated, because <b>diff</b> doesn't have an option to specify use of the "old" format, so you  would  need
       <b>cvs</b> <b>-f</b> <b>diff</b> <b>foobar</b>.

       In  place of the command name you can use <b>cvs</b> to specify global options (see node `Global options' in
       the CVS manual).  For example the following line in <b>.cvsrc</b>


         cvs -z6




       causes <b>cvs</b> to use compression level 6.


<b>Global</b> <b>options</b>
       The available <b>cvs_options</b> (that are given to the left of <b>cvs_command</b>) are:



       <b>--allow-root=</b><u>rootdir</u>

         May be invoked multiple times to specify one legal <b>cvsroot</b> directory with  each  invocation.   Also
         causes  CVS  to  preparse  the configuration file for each specified root, which can be useful when
         configuring write proxies,  See see node `Password authentication server' in the CVS manual  &amp;  see
         node `Write proxies' in the CVS manual.



       <b>-a</b>

         Authenticate  all  communication  between the client and the server.  Only has an effect on the <b>cvs</b>
         client.  As of this writing, this is only implemented when using  a  GSSAPI  connection  (see  node
         `GSSAPI  authenticated'  in  the  CVS  manual).   Authentication  prevents certain sorts of attacks
         involving hijacking the active <b>tcp</b> connection.  Enabling authentication does not enable encryption.



       <b>-b</b> <u>bindir</u>

         In  <b>cvs</b>  1.9.18  and  older, this specified that <b>rcs</b> programs are in the <u>bindir</u> directory.  Current
         versions of <b>cvs</b> do not run <b>rcs</b> programs; for compatibility this option is  accepted,  but  it  does
         nothing.



       <b>-T</b> <u>tempdir</u>

         Use <u>tempdir</u> as the directory where temporary files are located.

         The  <b>cvs</b> client and server store temporary files in a temporary directory.  The path to this tempo-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rary&nbsp;temporary</font>
         rary directory is set via, in order of precedence:


          The argument to the global <b>-T</b> option.


          The value set for <b>TmpDir</b> in the config file (server only - see node `config' in the CVS  manual).


          The  contents  of  the  <b>$TMPDIR</b> environment variable (<b>%TMPDIR%</b> on Windows - see node `Environment
           variables' in the CVS manual).


          /tmp


           Temporary directories should always be specified as an absolute pathname.   When  running  a  CVS
           client,  <b>-T</b>  affects  only  the  local process; specifying <b>-T</b> for the client has no effect on the
           server and vice versa.



       <b>-d</b> <u>cvs</u><b>_</b><u>root</u><b>_</b><u>directory</u>

         Use <u>cvs</u><b>_</b><u>root</u><b>_</b><u>directory</u> as the root directory pathname of the repository.  Overrides the setting  of
         the <b>$CVSROOT</b> environment variable.  see node `Repository' in the CVS manual.



       <b>-e</b> <u>editor</u>

         Use  <u>editor</u> to enter revision log information.  Overrides the setting of the <b>$CVSEDITOR</b> and <b>$EDITOR</b>
         environment variables.  For more information, see see node `Committing your  changes'  in  the  CVS
         manual.



       <b>-f</b>

         Do  not read the <b>~/.cvsrc</b> file.  This option is most often used because of the non-orthogonality of
         the <b>cvs</b> option set.  For example, the <b>cvs</b> <b>log</b> option <b>-N</b> (turn off display of tag  names)  does  not
         have  a  corresponding  option to turn the display on.  So if you have <b>-N</b> in the <b>~/.cvsrc</b> entry for
         <b>log</b>, you may need to use <b>-f</b> to show the tag names.



       <b>-H</b>




       <b>--help</b>

         Display usage information about the specified <b>cvs_command</b> (but do not  actually  execute  the  com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand).&nbsp;command).</font>
         mand).  If you don't specify a command name, <b>cvs</b> <b>-H</b> displays overall help for <b>cvs</b>, including a list
         of other help options.



       <b>-R</b>

         Turns on read-only repository mode.  This allows one to check out from a read-only repository, such
         as within an anoncvs server, or from a <b>cd-rom</b> repository.

         Same  effect  as  if  the <b>CVSREADONLYFS</b> environment variable is set. Using <b>-R</b> can also considerably
         speed up checkouts over NFS.



       <b>-n</b>

         Do not change any files.  Attempt to execute the <b>cvs_command</b>, but only to  issue  reports;  do  not
         remove, update, or merge any existing files, or create any new files.

         Note  that  <b>cvs</b>  will not necessarily produce exactly the same output as without <b>-n</b>.  In some cases
         the output will be the same, but in other cases <b>cvs</b> will skip some of  the  processing  that  would
         have been required to produce the exact same output.



       <b>-Q</b>

         Cause the command to be really quiet; the command will only generate output for serious problems.



       <b>-q</b>

         Cause  the  command  to  be  somewhat  quiet;  informational messages, such as reports of recursion
         through subdirectories, are suppressed.



       <b>-r</b>

         Make new working files read-only.  Same effect as if the <b>$CVSREAD</b> environment variable is set  (see
         node  `Environment  variables'  in the CVS manual).  The default is to make working files writable,
         unless watches are on (see node `Watches' in the CVS manual).



       <b>-s</b> <u>variable</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>

         Set a user variable (see node `Variables' in the CVS manual).



       <b>-t</b>

         Trace program execution; display messages showing the steps of <b>cvs</b> activity.   Particularly  useful
         with <b>-n</b> to explore the potential impact of an unfamiliar command.



       <b>-v</b>




       <b>--version</b>

         Display version and copyright information for <b>cvs</b>.



       <b>-w</b>

         Make  new  working  files  read-write.  Overrides the setting of the <b>$CVSREAD</b> environment variable.
         Files are created read-write by default, unless <b>$CVSREAD</b> is set or <b>-r</b> is given.



       <b>-x</b>

         Encrypt all communication between the client and the server.  Only has an effect on the <b>cvs</b> client.
         As  of  this  writing,  this  is  only implemented when using a GSSAPI connection (see node `GSSAPI
         authenticated' in the CVS manual) or a Kerberos connection (see node  `Kerberos  authenticated'  in
         the  CVS manual).  Enabling encryption implies that message traffic is also authenticated.  Encryp-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;Encryption</font>
         tion support is not available by default; it must be enabled  using  a  special  configure  option,
         <b>--enable-encryption</b>, when you build <b>cvs</b>.



       <b>-z</b> <u>level</u>

         Request  compression  <u>level</u> for network traffic.  <b>cvs</b> interprets <u>level</u> identically to the <b>gzip</b> pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">gram.&nbsp;program.</font>
         gram.  Valid levels are 1 (high speed, low compression) to 9 (low speed, high compression), or 0 to
         disable  compression  (the  default).   Data sent to the server will be compressed at the requested
         level and the client will request the server use the same compression level for data returned.  The
         server  will  use  the closest level allowed by the server administrator to compress returned data.
         This option only has an effect when passed to the <b>cvs</b> client.


<b>Common</b> <b>options</b>
   <b>Common</b> <b>command</b> <b>options</b>
       This section describes the <b>command_options</b> that are available across  several  <b>cvs</b>  commands.   These
       options  are always given to the right of <b>cvs_command</b>. Not all commands support all of these options;
       each option is only supported for commands where it makes sense.  However, when a command has one  of
       these  options  you  can almost always count on the same behavior of the option as in other commands.
       (Other command options, which are listed with the individual commands, may  have  different  behavior
       from one <b>cvs</b> command to the other).

       <b>Note:</b>  <b>the</b>  <b>history</b>  <b>command</b>  <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exception;</b> <b>it</b> <b>supports</b> <b>many</b> <b>options</b> <b>that</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>these</b>
       <b>standard</b> <b>options.</b>



       <b>-D</b> <u>date</u><b>_</b><u>spec</u>

         Use the most recent revision no later than <u>date</u><b>_</b><u>spec</u>.  <u>date</u><b>_</b><u>spec</u>  is  a  single  argument,  a  date
         description specifying a date in the past.

         The  specification is <u>sticky</u> when you use it to make a private copy of a source file; that is, when
         you get a working file using <b>-D</b>, <b>cvs</b> records the date you specified, so that further updates in the
         same  directory will use the same date (for more information on sticky tags/dates, see node `Sticky
         tags' in the CVS manual).

         <b>-D</b> is available with the <b>annotate</b>, <b>checkout</b>, <b>diff</b>, <b>export</b>, <b>history</b>, <b>ls</b>, <b>rdiff</b>, <b>rls</b>, <b>rtag</b>, <b>tag</b>,  and
         <b>update</b> commands.  (The <b>history</b> command uses this option in a slightly different way; see node `his-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tory&nbsp;`history</font>
         tory options' in the CVS manual).

         For a complete description of the date formats accepted by <b>cvs</b>, see node `Date  input  formats'  in
         the CVS manual.

         Remember  to quote the argument to the <b>-D</b> flag so that your shell doesn't interpret spaces as argu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment&nbsp;argument</font>
         ment separators.  A command using the <b>-D</b> flag can look like this:


           $ cvs diff -D "1 hour ago" cvs.texinfo






       <b>-f</b>

         When you specify a particular date or tag to <b>cvs</b> commands, they normally ignore files that  do  not
         contain  the tag (or did not exist prior to the date) that you specified.  Use the <b>-f</b> option if you
         want files retrieved even when there is no match for the tag or date.  (The most recent revision of
         the file will be used).

         Note  that even with <b>-f</b>, a tag that you specify must exist (that is, in some file, not necessary in
         every file).  This is so that <b>cvs</b> will continue to give an error if you mistype a tag name.

         <b>-f</b> is available with these commands: <b>annotate</b>, <b>checkout</b>, <b>export</b>, <b>rdiff</b>, <b>rtag</b>, and <b>update</b>.

         <b>WARNING:</b>  <b>The</b> <b>commit</b> <b>and</b> <b>remove</b> <b>commands</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>-f</b> <b>option,</b> <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>behavior</b> <b>for</b>
         <b>those</b>  <b>commands.</b>  <b>See</b> <b>see</b> <b>node</b> <b>`commit</b> <b>options'</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>CVS</b> <b>manual,</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>node</b> <b>`Removing</b> <b>files'</b> <b>in</b>
         <b>the</b> <b>CVS</b> <b>manual.</b>



       <b>-k</b> <u>kflag</u>

         Override the default processing of RCS keywords other than <b>-kb</b>.  see node `Keyword substitution' in
         the  CVS  manual, for the meaning of <u>kflag</u>.  Used with the <b>checkout</b> and <b>update</b> commands, your <u>kflag</u>
         specification is <u>sticky</u>; that is, when you use this option with a <b>checkout</b> or <b>update</b>  command,  <b>cvs</b>
         associates  your selected <u>kflag</u> with any files it operates on, and continues to use that <u>kflag</u> with
         future commands on the same files until you specify otherwise.

         The <b>-k</b> option is available with the <b>add</b>, <b>checkout</b>, <b>diff</b>, <b>export</b>, <b>import</b>,  <b>rdiff</b>,  and  <b>update</b>  com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mands.&nbsp;commands.</font>
         mands.

         <b>WARNING:</b>  <b>Prior</b>  <b>to</b>  <b>CVS</b> <b>version</b> <b>1.12.2,</b> <b>the</b> <b>-k</b> <b>flag</b> <b>overrode</b> <b>the</b> <b>-kb</b> <b>indication</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>binary</b> <b>file.</b>
         <b>This</b> <b>could</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>corrupt</b> <b>binary</b> <b>files.</b>  <b>see</b> <b>node</b> <b>`Merging</b> <b>and</b> <b>keywords'</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>CVS</b> <b>manual,</b>  <b>for</b>
         <b>more.</b>



       <b>-l</b>

         Local; run only in current working directory, rather than recursing through subdirectories.

         Available  with  the  following  commands: <b>annotate</b>, <b>checkout</b>, <b>commit</b>, <b>diff</b>, <b>edit</b>, <b>editors</b>, <b>export</b>,
         <b>log</b>, <b>rdiff</b>, <b>remove</b>, <b>rtag</b>, <b>status</b>, <b>tag</b>, <b>unedit</b>, <b>update</b>, <b>watch</b>, and <b>watchers</b>.



       <b>-m</b> <u>message</u>

         Use <u>message</u> as log information, instead of invoking an editor.

         Available with the following commands: <b>add</b>, <b>commit</b> and <b>import</b>.



       <b>-n</b>

         Do not run any tag program.  (A program can be specified to run in the modules database  (see  node
         `modules' in the CVS manual); this option bypasses it).

         <b>Note:</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>cvs</b> <b>-n</b> <b>program</b> <b>option,</b> <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>specify</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cvs</b>
         <b>command!</b>

         Available with the <b>checkout</b>, <b>commit</b>, <b>export</b>, and <b>rtag</b> commands.



       <b>-P</b>

         Prune empty directories.  See see node `Removing directories' in the CVS manual.



       <b>-p</b>

         Pipe the files retrieved from the repository to standard output, rather than writing  them  in  the
         current directory.  Available with the <b>checkout</b> and <b>update</b> commands.



       <b>-R</b>

         Process  directories  recursively.  This is the default for all <b>cvs</b> commands, with the exception of
         <b>ls</b> &amp; <b>rls</b>.

         Available with the following commands: <b>annotate</b>, <b>checkout</b>, <b>commit</b>, <b>diff</b>, <b>edit</b>, <b>editors</b>, <b>export</b>, <b>ls</b>,
         <b>rdiff</b>, <b>remove</b>, <b>rls</b>, <b>rtag</b>, <b>status</b>, <b>tag</b>, <b>unedit</b>, <b>update</b>, <b>watch</b>, and <b>watchers</b>.



       <b>-r</b> <u>tag</u>




       <b>-r</b> <u>tag</u><b>[:</b><u>date</u><b>]</b>

         Use the revision specified by the <u>tag</u> argument (and the <u>date</u> argument for the commands which accept
         it) instead of the default <u>head</u> revision.  As well as arbitrary tags defined with the <b>tag</b>  or  <b>rtag</b>
         command, two special tags are always available: <b>HEAD</b> refers to the most recent version available in
         the repository, and <b>BASE</b> refers to the revision you last  checked  out  into  the  current  working
         directory.

         The  tag specification is sticky when you use this with <b>checkout</b> or <b>update</b> to make your own copy of
         a file: <b>cvs</b> remembers the tag and continues to use it on future update commands, until you  specify
         otherwise (for more information on sticky tags/dates, see node `Sticky tags' in the CVS manual).

         The tag can be either a symbolic or numeric tag, as described in see node `Tags' in the CVS manual,
         or the name of a branch, as described in see node `Branching and merging' in the CVS manual.   When
         <u>tag</u>  is  the name of a branch, some commands accept the optional <u>date</u> argument to specify the revi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion&nbsp;revision</font>
         sion as of the given date on the branch.  When a command expects a specific revision, the name of a
         branch is interpreted as the most recent revision on that branch.

         Specifying  the  <b>-q</b> global option along with the <b>-r</b> command option is often useful, to suppress the
         warning messages when the <b>rcs</b> file does not contain the specified tag.

         <b>Note:</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> <b>cvs</b> <b>-r</b> <b>option,</b> <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>specify</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cvs</b>
         <b>command!</b>

         <b>-r</b> <u>tag</u> is available with the <b>commit</b> and <b>history</b> commands.

         <b>-r</b>  <u>tag</u><b>[:</b><u>date</u><b>]</b> is available with the <b>annotate</b>, <b>checkout</b>, <b>diff</b>, <b>export</b>, <b>rdiff</b>, <b>rtag</b>, and <b>update</b> com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mands.&nbsp;commands.</font>
         mands.



       <b>-W</b>

         Specify file names that should be filtered.  You can use this option repeatedly.  The spec can be a
         file  name  pattern of the same type that you can specify in the <b>.cvswrappers</b> file.  Available with
         the following commands: <b>import</b>, and <b>update</b>.



<b>admin</b>
   <b>Administration</b>
        Requires: repository, working directory.

        Changes: repository.

        Synonym: rcs

         This is the <b>cvs</b> interface to assorted administrative facilities.  Some of  them  have  questionable
         usefulness  for <b>cvs</b> but exist for historical purposes.  Some of the questionable options are likely
         to disappear in the future.  This command <u>does</u> work recursively, so extreme care should be used.

         On unix, if there is a group named <b>cvsadmin</b>, only members of that group can run <b>cvs</b> <b>admin</b> commands,
         except  for  those  specified using the <b>UserAdminOptions</b> configuration option in the <b>CVSROOT/config</b>
         file.  Options specified using <b>UserAdminOptions</b> can be run by any user.  See see node  `config'  in
         the CVS manual for more on <b>UserAdminOptions</b>.

         The <b>cvsadmin</b> group should exist on the server, or any system running the non-client/server <b>cvs</b>.  To
         disallow <b>cvs</b> <b>admin</b> for all users, create a group with no users in it.  On NT, the <b>cvsadmin</b>  feature
         does not exist and all users can run <b>cvs</b> <b>admin</b>.


<b>admin</b> <b>options</b>
       Some  of  these options have questionable usefulness for <b>cvs</b> but exist for historical purposes.  Some
       even make it impossible to use <b>cvs</b> until you undo the effect!



       <b>-A</b><u>oldfile</u>

         Might not work together with <b>cvs</b>.  Append the access list of <u>oldfile</u> to the access list of the  <b>rcs</b>
         file.



       <b>-a</b><u>logins</u>

         Might  not  work  together  with <b>cvs</b>.  Append the login names appearing in the comma-separated list
         <u>logins</u> to the access list of the <b>rcs</b> file.



       <b>-b[</b><u>rev</u><b>]</b>

         Set the default branch to <u>rev</u>.  In <b>cvs</b>, you normally do not  manipulate  default  branches;  sticky
         tags (see node `Sticky tags' in the CVS manual) are a better way to decide which branch you want to
         work on.  There is one reason to run <b>cvs</b> <b>admin</b> <b>-b</b>: to revert to the  vendor's  version  when  using
         vendor  branches  (see  node  `Reverting  local changes' in the CVS manual).  There can be no space
         between <b>-b</b> and its argument.



       <b>-c</b><u>string</u>

         Sets the comment leader to <u>string</u>.  The comment leader is not used by current versions  of  <b>cvs</b>  or
         <b>rcs</b>  5.7.  Therefore, you can almost surely not worry about it.  see node `Keyword substitution' in
         the CVS manual.



       <b>-e[</b><u>logins</u><b>]</b>

         Might not work together with <b>cvs</b>.  Erase the login names  appearing  in  the  comma-separated  list
         <u>logins</u>  from  the access list of the RCS file.  If <u>logins</u> is omitted, erase the entire access list.
         There can be no space between <b>-e</b> and its argument.



       <b>-I</b>

         Run interactively, even if the standard input is not a terminal.  This option does  not  work  with
         the client/server <b>cvs</b> and is likely to disappear in a future release of <b>cvs</b>.



       <b>-i</b>

         Useless  with  <b>cvs</b>.   This  creates  and initializes a new <b>rcs</b> file, without depositing a revision.
         With <b>cvs</b>, add files with the <b>cvs</b> <b>add</b> command (see node `Adding files' in the CVS manual).



       <b>-k</b><u>subst</u>

         Set the default keyword substitution to <u>subst</u>.  see node `Keyword substitution' in the CVS  manual.
         Giving an explicit <b>-k</b> option to <b>cvs</b> <b>update</b>, <b>cvs</b> <b>export</b>, or <b>cvs</b> <b>checkout</b> overrides this default.



       <b>-l[</b><u>rev</u><b>]</b>

         Lock  the revision with number <u>rev</u>.  If a branch is given, lock the latest revision on that branch.
         If <u>rev</u> is omitted, lock the latest revision on the default branch.  There can be no  space  between
         <b>-l</b> and its argument.

         This  can  be  used  in  conjunction with the <b>rcslock.pl</b> script in the <b>contrib</b> directory of the <b>cvs</b>
         source distribution to provide reserved checkouts (where only one user can be editing a given  file
         at  a  time).  See the comments in that file for details (and see the <b>README</b> file in that directory
         for disclaimers about the unsupported nature of contrib).  According  to  comments  in  that  file,
         locking must set to strict (which is the default).



       <b>-L</b>

         Set locking to strict.  Strict locking means that the owner of an RCS file is not exempt from lock-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;locking</font>
         ing for checkin.  For use with <b>cvs</b>, strict locking must be set; see the  discussion  under  the  <b>-l</b>
         option above.



       <b>-m</b><u>rev</u><b>:</b><u>msg</u>

         Replace the log message of revision <u>rev</u> with <u>msg</u>.



       <b>-N</b><u>name</u><b>[:[</b><u>rev</u><b>]]</b>

         Act like <b>-n</b>, except override any previous assignment of <u>name</u>.  For use with magic branches, see see
         node `Magic branch numbers' in the CVS manual.



       <b>-n</b><u>name</u><b>[:[</b><u>rev</u><b>]]</b>

         Associate the symbolic name <u>name</u> with the branch or revision <u>rev</u>.  It is normally better to use <b>cvs</b>
         <b>tag</b>  or <b>cvs</b> <b>rtag</b> instead.  Delete the symbolic name if both <b>:</b> and <u>rev</u> are omitted; otherwise, print
         an error message if <u>name</u> is already associated with another number.  If  <u>rev</u>  is  symbolic,  it  is
         expanded  before  association.   A <u>rev</u> consisting of a branch number followed by a <b>.</b> stands for the
         current latest revision in the branch.  A <b>:</b> with an empty <u>rev</u> stands for the current  latest  revi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion&nbsp;revision</font>
         sion  on  the  default  branch, normally the trunk.  For example, <b>cvs</b> <b>admin</b> <b>-n</b><u>name</u><b>:</b> associates <u>name</u>
         with the current latest revision of all the RCS files; this contrasts with <b>cvs</b> <b>admin</b> <b>-n</b><u>name</u><b>:$</b> which
         associates <u>name</u> with the revision numbers extracted from keyword strings in the corresponding work-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;working</font>
         ing files.



       <b>-o</b><u>range</u>

         Deletes (<u>outdates</u>) the revisions given by <u>range</u>.

         Note that this command can be quite dangerous unless you know <u>exactly</u> what you are doing (for exam-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ple&nbsp;example</font>
         ple see the warnings below about how the <u>rev1</u>:<u>rev2</u> syntax is confusing).

         If  you are short on disc this option might help you.  But think twice before using it--there is no
         way short of restoring the latest backup to undo this command!  If you delete  different  revisions
         than  you planned, either due to carelessness or (heaven forbid) a <b>cvs</b> bug, there is no opportunity
         to correct the error before the revisions are deleted.  It probably would be a good idea to experi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment&nbsp;experiment</font>
         ment on a copy of the repository first.

         Specify <u>range</u> in one of the following ways:


         <u>rev1</u><b>::</b><u>rev2</u>

           Collapse  all revisions between rev1 and rev2, so that <b>cvs</b> only stores the differences associated
           with going from rev1 to rev2, not intermediate steps.  For example, after  <b>-o</b>  <b>1.3::1.5</b>  one  can
           retrieve revision 1.3, revision 1.5, or the differences to get from 1.3 to 1.5, but not the revi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion&nbsp;revision</font>
           sion 1.4, or the differences between 1.3 and 1.4.  Other examples: <b>-o</b> <b>1.3::1.4</b>  and  <b>-o</b>  <b>1.3::1.3</b>
           have no effect, because there are no intermediate revisions to remove.


         <b>::</b><u>rev</u>

           Collapse  revisions  between  the  beginning  of  the  branch containing <u>rev</u> and <u>rev</u> itself.  The
           branchpoint and <u>rev</u> are left intact.  For example, <b>-o</b> <b>::1.3.2.6</b> deletes revision  1.3.2.1,  revi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion&nbsp;revision</font>
           sion 1.3.2.5, and everything in between, but leaves 1.3 and 1.3.2.6 intact.


         <u>rev</u><b>::</b>

           Collapse  revisions  between  <u>rev</u> and the end of the branch containing <u>rev</u>.  Revision <u>rev</u> is left
           intact but the head revision is deleted.


         <u>rev</u>

           Delete the revision <u>rev</u>.  For example, <b>-o</b> <b>1.3</b> is equivalent to <b>-o</b> <b>1.2::1.4</b>.


         <u>rev1</u><b>:</b><u>rev2</u>

           Delete the revisions from <u>rev1</u> to <u>rev2</u>, inclusive, on the same branch.  One will not be  able  to
           retrieve  <u>rev1</u>  or  <u>rev2</u>  or any of the revisions in between.  For example, the command <b>cvs</b> <b>admin</b>
           <b>-oR_1_01:R_1_02</b> <b>.</b> is rarely useful.  It means to delete revisions up to, and including,  the  tag
           R_1_02.  But beware!  If there are files that have not changed between R_1_02 and R_1_03 the file
           will have <u>the</u> <u>same</u> numerical revision number assigned to the tags R_1_02 and R_1_03.  So not only
           will  it  be  impossible to retrieve R_1_02; R_1_03 will also have to be restored from the tapes!
           In most cases you want to specify <u>rev1</u>::<u>rev2</u> instead.


         <b>:</b><u>rev</u>

           Delete revisions from the beginning of the branch containing <u>rev</u> up to and including <u>rev</u>.


         <u>rev</u><b>:</b>

           Delete revisions from revision <u>rev</u>, including <u>rev</u> itself, to the end  of  the  branch  containing
           <u>rev</u>.

           None of the revisions to be deleted may have branches or locks.

           If  any  of the revisions to be deleted have symbolic names, and one specifies one of the <b>::</b> syn-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">taxes,&nbsp;syntaxes,</font>
           taxes, then <b>cvs</b> will give an error and not delete any revisions.  If you really  want  to  delete
           both  the symbolic names and the revisions, first delete the symbolic names with <b>cvs</b> <b>tag</b> <b>-d</b>, then
           run <b>cvs</b> <b>admin</b> <b>-o</b>.  If one specifies the non-<b>::</b> syntaxes, then <b>cvs</b> will delete the  revisions  but
           leave  the symbolic names pointing to nonexistent revisions.  This behavior is preserved for com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">patibility&nbsp;compatibility</font>
           patibility with previous versions of <b>cvs</b>, but because it isn't very useful, in the future it  may
           change to be like the <b>::</b> case.

           Due  to the way <b>cvs</b> handles branches <u>rev</u> cannot be specified symbolically if it is a branch.  see
           node `Magic branch numbers' in the CVS manual, for an explanation.

           Make sure that no-one has checked out a copy of the revision you outdate.   Strange  things  will
           happen  if  he  starts to edit it and tries to check it back in.  For this reason, this option is
           not a good way to take back a bogus commit; commit  a  new  revision  undoing  the  bogus  change
           instead (see node `Merging two revisions' in the CVS manual).



       <b>-q</b>

         Run quietly; do not print diagnostics.



       <b>-s</b><u>state</u><b>[:</b><u>rev</u><b>]</b>

         Useful with <b>cvs</b>.  Set the state attribute of the revision <u>rev</u> to <u>state</u>.  If <u>rev</u> is a branch number,
         assume the latest revision on that branch.  If <u>rev</u> is omitted, assume the latest  revision  on  the
         default branch.  Any identifier is acceptable for <u>state</u>.  A useful set of states is <b>Exp</b> (for exper-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">imental),&nbsp;experimental),</font>
         imental), <b>Stab</b> (for stable), and <b>Rel</b> (for released).  By default, the state of a  new  revision  is
         set  to <b>Exp</b> when it is created.  The state is visible in the output from <u>cvs</u> <u>log</u> (see node `log' in
         the CVS manual), and in the <b>$Log$</b> and <b>$State$</b> keywords (see node `Keyword substitution' in the  CVS
         manual).   Note that <b>cvs</b> uses the <b>dead</b> state for its own purposes (see node `Attic' in the CVS man-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ual);&nbsp;manual);</font>
         ual); to take a file to or from the <b>dead</b> state use commands like <b>cvs</b> <b>remove</b> and <b>cvs</b> <b>add</b>  (see  node
         `Adding and removing' in the CVS manual), not <b>cvs</b> <b>admin</b> <b>-s</b>.



       <b>-t[</b><u>file</u><b>]</b>

         Useful  with  <b>cvs</b>.   Write  descriptive text from the contents of the named <u>file</u> into the RCS file,
         deleting the existing text.  The <u>file</u> pathname may not begin with <b>-</b>.  The descriptive text  can  be
         seen  in the output from <b>cvs</b> <b>log</b> (see node `log' in the CVS manual).  There can be no space between
         <b>-t</b> and its argument.

         If <u>file</u> is omitted, obtain the text from standard input, terminated by end-of-file  or  by  a  line
         containing <b>.</b> by itself.  Prompt for the text if interaction is possible; see <b>-I</b>.



       <b>-t-</b><u>string</u>

         Similar  to <b>-t</b><u>file</u>. Write descriptive text from the <u>string</u> into the <b>rcs</b> file, deleting the existing
         text.  There can be no space between <b>-t</b> and its argument.



       <b>-U</b>

         Set locking to non-strict.  Non-strict locking means that the owner of a file need not lock a revi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion&nbsp;revision</font>
         sion  for  checkin.   For use with <b>cvs</b>, strict locking must be set; see the discussion under the <b>-l</b>
         option above.



       <b>-u[</b><u>rev</u><b>]</b>

         See the option <b>-l</b> above, for a discussion of using this option with <b>cvs</b>.  Unlock the revision  with
         number  <u>rev</u>.   If a branch is given, unlock the latest revision on that branch.  If <u>rev</u> is omitted,
         remove the latest lock held by the caller.  Normally, only the locker of a revision may unlock  it;
         somebody  else  unlocking a revision breaks the lock.  This causes the original locker to be sent a
         <b>commit</b> notification (see node `Getting Notified' in the CVS manual).  There can be no space between
         <b>-u</b> and its argument.



       <b>-V</b><u>n</u>

         In  previous  versions  of <b>cvs</b>, this option meant to write an <b>rcs</b> file which would be acceptable to
         <b>rcs</b> version <u>n</u>, but it is now obsolete and specifying it will produce an error.



       <b>-x</b><u>suffixes</u>

         In previous versions of <b>cvs</b>, this was documented as a way of specifying the names of the <b>rcs</b> files.
         However, <b>cvs</b> has always required that the <b>rcs</b> files used by <b>cvs</b> end in <b>,v</b>, so this option has never
         done anything useful.



<b>annotate</b>
   <b>What</b> <b>revision</b> <b>modified</b> <b>each</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>file?</b>
        Synopsis: annotate [options] files...

        Requires: repository.

        Changes: nothing.

         For each file in <u>files</u>, print the head revision of the trunk, together with information on the last
         modification for each line.


<b>annotate</b> <b>options</b>
       These  standard options are supported by <b>annotate</b> (see node `Common options' in the CVS manual, for a
       complete description of them):



       <b>-l</b>

         Local directory only, no recursion.



       <b>-R</b>

         Process directories recursively.



       <b>-f</b>

         Use head revision if tag/date not found.



       <b>-F</b>

         Annotate binary files.



       <b>-r</b> <u>tag</u><b>[:</b><u>date</u><b>]</b>

         Annotate file as of specified revision/tag or, when <u>date</u> is specified and <u>tag</u> is a branch tag,  the
         version  from  the branch <u>tag</u> as it existed on <u>date</u>.  See see node `Common options' in the CVS man-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ual.&nbsp;manual.</font>
         ual.



       <b>-D</b> <u>date</u>

         Annotate file as of specified date.


<b>annotate</b> <b>example</b>
       For example:


         $ cvs annotate ssfile
         Annotations for ssfile
         ***************
         1.1          (mary     27-Mar-96): ssfile line 1
         1.2          (joe      28-Mar-96): ssfile line 2




       The file <b>ssfile</b> currently contains two lines.  The <b>ssfile</b> <b>line</b> <b>1</b> line was checked in by <b>mary</b> on March
       27.   Then,  on  March  28, <b>joe</b> added a line <b>ssfile</b> <b>line</b> <b>2</b>, without modifying the <b>ssfile</b> <b>line</b> <b>1</b> line.
       This report doesn't tell you anything about lines which have been deleted or replaced;  you  need  to
       use <b>cvs</b> <b>diff</b> for that (see node `diff' in the CVS manual).

       The  options to <b>cvs</b> <b>annotate</b> are listed in see node `Invoking CVS' in the CVS manual, and can be used
       to select the files and revisions to annotate.  The options are described in more detail there and in
       see node `Common options' in the CVS manual.


<b>checkout</b>
   <b>Check</b> <b>out</b> <b>sources</b> <b>for</b> <b>editing</b>
        Synopsis: checkout [options] modules...

        Requires: repository.

        Changes: working directory.

        Synonyms: co, get

         Create  or  update  a working directory containing copies of the source files specified by <u>modules</u>.
         You must execute <b>checkout</b> before using most of the other <b>cvs</b> commands, since most of  them  operate
         on your working directory.

         The <u>modules</u> are either symbolic names for some collection of source directories and files, or paths
         to directories or files in the repository.  The symbolic names are defined  in  the  <b>modules</b>  file.
         see node `modules' in the CVS manual.

         Depending on the modules you specify, <b>checkout</b> may recursively create directories and populate them
         with the appropriate source files.  You can then edit these source files at any time (regardless of
         whether  other  software  developers  are  editing their own copies of the sources); update them to
         include new changes applied by others to the source repository; or commit your work as a  permanent
         change to the source repository.

         Note  that <b>checkout</b> is used to create directories.  The top-level directory created is always added
         to the directory where <b>checkout</b> is invoked, and usually has the same name as the specified  module.
         In  the case of a module alias, the created sub-directory may have a different name, but you can be
         sure that it will be a sub-directory, and that <b>checkout</b> will show the relative path leading to each
         file as it is extracted into your private work area (unless you specify the <b>-Q</b> global option).

         The files created by <b>checkout</b> are created read-write, unless the <b>-r</b> option to <b>cvs</b> (see node `Global
         options' in the CVS manual) is specified, the <b>CVSREAD</b> environment variable is specified  (see  node
         `Environment  variables'  in  the  CVS  manual),  or  a  watch is in effect for that file (see node
         `Watches' in the CVS manual).

         Note that running <b>checkout</b> on a directory that was already built by a prior <b>checkout</b> is  also  per-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mitted.&nbsp;permitted.</font>
         mitted.   This  is  similar to specifying the <b>-d</b> option to the <b>update</b> command in the sense that new
         directories that have been created in the repository will  appear  in  your  work  area.   However,
         <b>checkout</b>  takes a module name whereas <b>update</b> takes a directory name.  Also to use <b>checkout</b> this way
         it must be run from the top level directory (where you originally ran <b>checkout</b> from), so before you
         run  <b>checkout</b>  to  update  an  existing directory, don't forget to change your directory to the top
         level directory.

         For the output produced by the <b>checkout</b> command see see node `update output' in the CVS manual.


<b>checkout</b> <b>options</b>
       These standard options are supported by <b>checkout</b> (see node `Common options' in the CVS manual, for  a
       complete description of them):



       <b>-D</b> <u>date</u>

         Use  the  most recent revision no later than <u>date</u>.  This option is sticky, and implies <b>-P</b>.  See see
         node `Sticky tags' in the CVS manual, for more information on sticky tags/dates.



       <b>-f</b>

         Only useful with the <b>-D</b> or <b>-r</b> flags.  If no matching revision is found, retrieve  the  most  recent
         revision (instead of ignoring the file).



       <b>-k</b> <u>kflag</u>

         Process  keywords according to <u>kflag</u>.  See see node `Keyword substitution' in the CVS manual.  This
         option is sticky; future updates of this file in this working directory will use  the  same  <u>kflag</u>.
         The <b>status</b> command can be viewed to see the sticky options.  See see node `Invoking CVS' in the CVS
         manual, for more information on the <b>status</b> command.



       <b>-l</b>

         Local; run only in current working directory.



       <b>-n</b>

         Do not run any checkout program (as specified with the <b>-o</b> option in  the  modules  file;  see  node
         `modules' in the CVS manual).



       <b>-P</b>

         Prune empty directories.  See see node `Moving directories' in the CVS manual.



       <b>-p</b>

         Pipe files to the standard output.



       <b>-R</b>

         Checkout directories recursively.  This option is on by default.



       <b>-r</b> <u>tag</u><b>[:</b><u>date</u><b>]</b>

         Checkout the revision specified by <u>tag</u> or, when <u>date</u> is specified and <u>tag</u> is a branch tag, the ver-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion&nbsp;version</font>
         sion from the branch <u>tag</u> as it existed on <u>date</u>.  This option is sticky, and implies  <b>-P</b>.   See  see
         node  `Sticky  tags'  in  the CVS manual, for more information on sticky tags/dates.  Also, see see
         node `Common options' in the CVS manual.

         In addition to those, you can use these special command options with <b>checkout</b>:



       <b>-A</b>

         Reset any sticky tags, dates, or <b>-k</b> options.  See see node `Sticky tags' in  the  CVS  manual,  for
         more information on sticky tags/dates.



       <b>-c</b>

         Copy the module file, sorted, to the standard output, instead of creating or modifying any files or
         directories in your working directory.



       <b>-d</b> <u>dir</u>

         Create a directory called <u>dir</u> for the working files, instead of using the module name.  In general,
         using  this  flag is equivalent to using <b>mkdir</b> <u>dir</u><b>;</b> <b>cd</b> <u>dir</u> followed by the checkout command without
         the <b>-d</b> flag.

         There is an important exception, however.  It is very convenient when checking out a single item to
         have the output appear in a directory that doesn't contain empty intermediate directories.  In this
         case <u>only</u>, <b>cvs</b> tries to ``shorten'' pathnames to avoid those empty directories.

         For example, given a module <b>foo</b> that contains the file <b>bar.c</b>, the command <b>cvs</b> <b>co</b> <b>-d</b>  <b>dir</b>  <b>foo</b>  will
         create  directory <b>dir</b> and place <b>bar.c</b> inside.  Similarly, given a module <b>bar</b> which has subdirectory
         <b>baz</b> wherein there is a file <b>quux.c</b>, the command <b>cvs</b> <b>co</b> <b>-d</b> <b>dir</b> <b>bar/baz</b> will create directory <b>dir</b> and
         place <b>quux.c</b> inside.

         Using the <b>-N</b> flag will defeat this behavior.  Given the same module definitions above, <b>cvs</b> <b>co</b> <b>-N</b> <b>-d</b>
         <b>dir</b> <b>foo</b> will create directories <b>dir/foo</b> and place <b>bar.c</b> inside, while <b>cvs</b> <b>co</b> <b>-N</b> <b>-d</b> <b>dir</b> <b>bar/baz</b> will
         create directories <b>dir/bar/baz</b> and place <b>quux.c</b> inside.



       <b>-j</b> <u>tag</u>

         With  two  <b>-j</b>  options,  merge  changes from the revision specified with the first <b>-j</b> option to the
         revision specified with the second <b>j</b> option, into the working directory.

         With one <b>-j</b> option, merge changes from the ancestor revision to the revision specified with the  <b>-j</b>
         option,  into  the working directory.  The ancestor revision is the common ancestor of the revision
         which the working directory is based on, and the revision specified in the <b>-j</b> option.

         In addition, each -j option can contain an  optional  date  specification  which,  when  used  with
         branches,  can limit the chosen revision to one within a specific date.  An optional date is speci-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fied&nbsp;specified</font>
         fied by adding a colon (:) to the tag: <b>-j</b><u>Symbolic</u><b>_</b><u>Tag</u><b>:</b><u>Date</u><b>_</b><u>Specifier</u>.

         see node `Branching and merging' in the CVS manual.



       <b>-N</b>

         Only useful together with <b>-d</b> <u>dir</u>.  With this option, <b>cvs</b> will not ``shorten'' module paths in  your
         working  directory  when you check out a single module.  See the <b>-d</b> flag for examples and a discus-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion.&nbsp;discussion.</font>
         sion.



       <b>-s</b>

         Like <b>-c</b>, but include the status of all modules, and sort it by the status string.  see  node  `mod-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ules'&nbsp;`modules'</font>
         ules'  in  the CVS manual, for info about the <b>-s</b> option that is used inside the modules file to set
         the module status.


<b>checkout</b> <b>examples</b>
       Get a copy of the module <b>tc</b>:


         $ cvs checkout tc




       Get a copy of the module <b>tc</b> as it looked one day ago:


         $ cvs checkout -D yesterday tc





<b>commit</b>
   <b>Check</b> <b>files</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>repository</b>
        Synopsis: commit [-lnRf] [-m 'log_message' | -F file] [-r revision] [files...]

        Requires: working directory, repository.

        Changes: repository.

        Synonym: ci

         Use <b>commit</b> when you want to incorporate changes from your working  source  files  into  the  source
         repository.

         If you don't specify particular files to commit, all of the files in your working current directory
         are examined.  <b>commit</b> is careful to change in the repository only those files that you have  really
         changed.  By default (or if you explicitly specify the <b>-R</b> option), files in subdirectories are also
         examined and committed if they have changed; you can use the <b>-l</b> option to limit <b>commit</b> to the  cur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rent&nbsp;current</font>
         rent directory only.

         <b>commit</b>  verifies  that  the  selected files are up to date with the current revisions in the source
         repository; it will notify you, and exit without committing, if any of the specified files must  be
         made  current  first  with  <b>update</b> (see node `update' in the CVS manual).  <b>commit</b> does not call the
         <b>update</b> command for you, but rather leaves that for you to do when the time is right.

         When all is well, an editor is invoked to allow you to enter a log message that will be written  to
         one  or  more logging programs (see node `modules' in the CVS manual, and see node `loginfo' in the
         CVS manual) and placed in the <b>rcs</b> file inside the repository.  This log message  can  be  retrieved
         with the <b>log</b> command; see see node `log' in the CVS manual.  You can specify the log message on the
         command line with the <b>-m</b> <u>message</u> option, and thus avoid the editor invocation, or use the  <b>-F</b>  <u>file</u>
         option to specify that the argument file contains the log message.

         At  <b>commit</b>,  a unique commitid is placed in the <b>rcs</b> file inside the repository. All files committed
         at once get the same commitid. The commitid can be retrieved with the <b>log</b> and <b>status</b>  command;  see
         see node `log' in the CVS manual, see node `File status' in the CVS manual.


<b>commit</b> <b>options</b>
       These  standard  options  are supported by <b>commit</b> (see node `Common options' in the CVS manual, for a
       complete description of them):



       <b>-l</b>

         Local; run only in current working directory.



       <b>-R</b>

         Commit directories recursively.  This is on by default.



       <b>-r</b> <u>revision</u>

         Commit to <u>revision</u>.  <u>revision</u> must be either a branch, or a revision on  the  main  trunk  that  is
         higher  than  any existing revision number (see node `Assigning revisions' in the CVS manual).  You
         cannot commit to a specific revision on a branch.

         <b>commit</b> also supports these options:



       <b>-c</b>

         Refuse to commit files unless the user has registered a valid edit on the file via <b>cvs</b> <b>edit</b>.   This
         is  most  useful  when <b>commit</b> <b>-c</b> and <b>edit</b> <b>-c</b> have been placed in all <b>.cvsrc</b> files.  A commit can be
         forced anyways by either regestering an edit retroactively via <b>cvs</b> <b>edit</b> (no  changes  to  the  file
         will  be  lost) or using the <b>-f</b> option to commit.  Support for <b>commit</b> <b>-c</b> requires both client and a
         server versions 1.12.10 or greater.



       <b>-F</b> <u>file</u>

         Read the log message from <u>file</u>, instead of invoking an editor.



       <b>-f</b>

         Note that this is not the standard behavior of the  <b>-f</b>  option  as  defined  in  see  node  `Common
         options' in the CVS manual.

         Force  <b>cvs</b>  to  commit  a new revision even if you haven't made any changes to the file.  As of <b>cvs</b>
         version 1.12.10, it also causes the <b>-c</b> option to be ignored.  If the current revision  of  <u>file</u>  is
         1.7, then the following two commands are equivalent:


           $ cvs commit -f <u>file</u>
           $ cvs commit -r 1.8 <u>file</u>




         The  <b>-f</b> option disables recursion (i.e., it implies <b>-l</b>).  To force <b>cvs</b> to commit a new revision for
         all files in all subdirectories, you must use <b>-f</b> <b>-R</b>.



       <b>-m</b> <u>message</u>

         Use <u>message</u> as the log message, instead of invoking an editor.


<b>commit</b> <b>examples</b>
   <b>Committing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>branch</b>
       You can commit to a branch revision (one that has an even number of dots) with  the  <b>-r</b>  option.   To
       create  a  branch  revision,  use  the <b>-b</b> option of the <b>rtag</b> or <b>tag</b> commands (see node `Branching and
       merging' in the CVS manual).  Then, either <b>checkout</b> or <b>update</b> can be used to base your sources on the
       newly  created branch.  From that point on, all <b>commit</b> changes made within these working sources will
       be automatically added to a branch revision, thereby not disturbing main-line development in any way.
       For example, if you had to create a patch to the 1.2 version of the product, even though the 2.0 ver-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion&nbsp;version</font>
       sion is already under development, you might do:


         $ cvs rtag -b -r FCS1_2 FCS1_2_Patch product_module
         $ cvs checkout -r FCS1_2_Patch product_module
         $ cd product_module
         [[ hack away ]]
         $ cvs commit




       This works automatically since the <b>-r</b> option is sticky.


   <b>Creating</b> <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> <b>after</b> <b>editing</b>
       Say you have been working on some extremely experimental software, based  on  whatever  revision  you
       happened  to  checkout  last  week.  If others in your group would like to work on this software with
       you, but without disturbing main-line development, you could commit your  change  to  a  new  branch.
       Others can then checkout your experimental stuff and utilize the full benefit of <b>cvs</b> conflict resolu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion.&nbsp;resolution.</font>
       tion.  The scenario might look like:


         [[ hacked sources are present ]]
         $ cvs tag -b EXPR1
         $ cvs update -r EXPR1
         $ cvs commit




       The <b>update</b> command will make the <b>-r</b> <b>EXPR1</b> option sticky on all files.  Note that your changes to  the
       files  will never be removed by the <b>update</b> command.  The <b>commit</b> will automatically commit to the cor-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rect&nbsp;correct</font>
       rect branch, because the <b>-r</b> is sticky.  You could also do like this:


         [[ hacked sources are present ]]
         $ cvs tag -b EXPR1
         $ cvs commit -r EXPR1




       but then, only those files that were changed by you will have the <b>-r</b> <b>EXPR1</b> sticky flag.  If you  hack
       away, and commit without specifying the <b>-r</b> <b>EXPR1</b> flag, some files may accidentally end up on the main
       trunk.

       To work with you on the experimental change, others would simply do


         $ cvs checkout -r EXPR1 whatever_module





<b>diff</b>
   <b>Show</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>revisions</b>
        Synopsis: diff [-lR] [-k kflag] [format_options] [(-r rev1[:date1] | -D date1) [-r  rev2[:date2]  |
         -D date2]] [files...]

        Requires: working directory, repository.

        Changes: nothing.

         The <b>diff</b> command is used to compare different revisions of files.  The default action is to compare
         your working files with the revisions they were based on,  and  report  any  differences  that  are
         found.

         If  any  file  names  are  given, only those files are compared.  If any directories are given, all
         files under them will be compared.

         The exit status for diff is different than for other <b>cvs</b> commands; for details see node `Exit  sta-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tus'&nbsp;status'</font>
         tus' in the CVS manual.


<b>diff</b> <b>options</b>
       These standard options are supported by <b>diff</b> (see node `Common options' in the CVS manual, for a com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">plete&nbsp;complete</font>
       plete description of them):



       <b>-D</b> <u>date</u>

         Use the most recent revision no later than <u>date</u>.  See <b>-r</b> for how this affects the comparison.



       <b>-k</b> <u>kflag</u>

         Process keywords according to <u>kflag</u>.  See see node `Keyword substitution' in the CVS manual.



       <b>-l</b>

         Local; run only in current working directory.



       <b>-R</b>

         Examine directories recursively.  This option is on by default.



       <b>-r</b> <u>tag</u><b>[:</b><u>date</u><b>]</b>

         Compare with revision specified by <u>tag</u> or, when <u>date</u> is specified and <u>tag</u> is a branch tag, the ver-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion&nbsp;version</font>
         sion  from the branch <u>tag</u> as it existed on <u>date</u>.  Zero, one or two <b>-r</b> options can be present.  With
         no <b>-r</b> option, the working file will be compared with the revision it was based on.   With  one  <b>-r</b>,
         that  revision  will be compared to your current working file.  With two <b>-r</b> options those two revi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sions&nbsp;revisions</font>
         sions will be compared (and your working file will not affect the outcome in any way).

         One or both <b>-r</b> options can be replaced by a <b>-D</b> <u>date</u> option, described above.

         The following options specify the format of the output.  They have the same meaning as in GNU diff.
         Most  options  have  two  equivalent  names, one of which is a single letter preceded by <b>-</b>, and the
         other of which is a long name preceded by <b>--</b>.



       <b>-</b><u>lines</u>

         Show <u>lines</u> (an integer) lines of context.  This option does not specify an output format by itself;
         it  has no effect unless it is combined with <b>-c</b> or <b>-u</b>.  This option is obsolete.  For proper opera-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion,&nbsp;operation,</font>
         tion, <b>patch</b> typically needs at least two lines of context.



       <b>-a</b>

         Treat all files as text and compare them line-by-line, even if they do not seem to be text.



       <b>-b</b>

         Ignore trailing white space and consider all other sequences of one or more white space  characters
         to be equivalent.



       <b>-B</b>

         Ignore changes that just insert or delete blank lines.



       <b>--binary</b>

         Read and write data in binary mode.



       <b>--brief</b>

         Report only whether the files differ, not the details of the differences.



       <b>-c</b>

         Use the context output format.



       <b>-C</b> <u>lines</u>




       <b>--context</b>[<b>=</b><u>lines</u>]

         Use  the  context  output format, showing <u>lines</u> (an integer) lines of context, or three if <u>lines</u> is
         not given.  For proper operation, <b>patch</b> typically needs at least two lines of context.



       <b>--changed-group-format=</b><u>format</u>

         Use <u>format</u> to output a line group containing differing lines from both files in  if-then-else  for-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mat.&nbsp;format.</font>
         mat.  see node `Line group formats' in the CVS manual.



       <b>-d</b>

         Change  the  algorithm to perhaps find a smaller set of changes.  This makes <b>diff</b> slower (sometimes
         much slower).



       <b>-e</b>




       <b>--ed</b>

         Make output that is a valid <b>ed</b> script.



       <b>--expand-tabs</b>

         Expand tabs to spaces in the output, to preserve the alignment of tabs in the input files.



       <b>-f</b>

         Make output that looks vaguely like an <b>ed</b> script but has changes in the order they  appear  in  the
         file.



       <b>-F</b> <u>regexp</u>

         In  context  and unified format, for each hunk of differences, show some of the last preceding line
         that matches <u>regexp</u>.



       <b>--forward-ed</b>

         Make output that looks vaguely like an <b>ed</b> script but has changes in the order they  appear  in  the
         file.



       <b>-H</b>

         Use heuristics to speed handling of large files that have numerous scattered small changes.



       <b>--horizon-lines=</b><u>lines</u>

         Do  not  discard  the last <u>lines</u> lines of the common prefix and the first <u>lines</u> lines of the common
         suffix.



       <b>-i</b>

         Ignore changes in case; consider upper- and lower-case letters equivalent.



       <b>-I</b> <u>regexp</u>

         Ignore changes that just insert or delete lines that match <u>regexp</u>.



       <b>--ifdef=</b><u>name</u>

         Make merged if-then-else output using <u>name</u>.



       <b>--ignore-all-space</b>

         Ignore white space when comparing lines.



       <b>--ignore-blank-lines</b>

         Ignore changes that just insert or delete blank lines.



       <b>--ignore-case</b>

         Ignore changes in case; consider upper- and lower-case to be the same.



       <b>--ignore-matching-lines=</b><u>regexp</u>

         Ignore changes that just insert or delete lines that match <u>regexp</u>.



       <b>--ignore-space-change</b>

         Ignore trailing white space and consider all other sequences of one or more white space  characters
         to be equivalent.



       <b>--initial-tab</b>

         Output  a  tab  rather  than  a  space before the text of a line in normal or context format.  This
         causes the alignment of tabs in the line to look normal.



       <b>-L</b> <u>label</u>

         Use <u>label</u> instead of the file name in the context format and unified format headers.



       <b>--label=</b><u>label</u>

         Use <u>label</u> instead of the file name in the context format and unified format headers.



       <b>--left-column</b>

         Print only the left column of two common lines in side by side format.



       <b>--line-format=</b><u>format</u>

         Use <u>format</u> to output all input lines in if-then-else format.  see node `Line formats'  in  the  CVS
         manual.



       <b>--minimal</b>

         Change  the  algorithm to perhaps find a smaller set of changes.  This makes <b>diff</b> slower (sometimes
         much slower).



       <b>-n</b>

         Output RCS-format diffs; like <b>-f</b> except that each command specifies the number of lines affected.



       <b>-N</b>




       <b>--new-file</b>

         In directory comparison, if a file is found in only one directory, treat it as present but empty in
         the other directory.



       <b>--new-group-format=</b><u>format</u>

         Use  <u>format</u> to output a group of lines taken from just the second file in if-then-else format.  see
         node `Line group formats' in the CVS manual.



       <b>--new-line-format=</b><u>format</u>

         Use <u>format</u> to output a line taken from just the second file in if-then-else format.  see node `Line
         formats' in the CVS manual.



       <b>--old-group-format=</b><u>format</u>

         Use  <u>format</u>  to output a group of lines taken from just the first file in if-then-else format.  see
         node `Line group formats' in the CVS manual.



       <b>--old-line-format=</b><u>format</u>

         Use <u>format</u> to output a line taken from just the first file in if-then-else format.  see node  `Line
         formats' in the CVS manual.



       <b>-p</b>

         Show which C function each change is in.



       <b>--rcs</b>

         Output RCS-format diffs; like <b>-f</b> except that each command specifies the number of lines affected.



       <b>--report-identical-files</b>




       <b>-s</b>

         Report when two files are the same.



       <b>--show-c-function</b>

         Show which C function each change is in.



       <b>--show-function-line=</b><u>regexp</u>

         In  context  and unified format, for each hunk of differences, show some of the last preceding line
         that matches <u>regexp</u>.



       <b>--side-by-side</b>

         Use the side by side output format.



       <b>--speed-large-files</b>

         Use heuristics to speed handling of large files that have numerous scattered small changes.



       <b>--suppress-common-lines</b>

         Do not print common lines in side by side format.



       <b>-t</b>

         Expand tabs to spaces in the output, to preserve the alignment of tabs in the input files.



       <b>-T</b>

         Output a tab rather than a space before the text of a line  in  normal  or  context  format.   This
         causes the alignment of tabs in the line to look normal.



       <b>--text</b>

         Treat all files as text and compare them line-by-line, even if they do not appear to be text.



       <b>-u</b>

         Use the unified output format.



       <b>--unchanged-group-format=</b><u>format</u>

         Use  <u>format</u>  to  output  a group of common lines taken from both files in if-then-else format.  see
         node `Line group formats' in the CVS manual.



       <b>--unchanged-line-format=</b><u>format</u>

         Use <u>format</u> to output a line common to both files in if-then-else format.  see node  `Line  formats'
         in the CVS manual.



       <b>-U</b> <u>lines</u>




       <b>--unified</b>[<b>=</b><u>lines</u>]

         Use  the  unified  output format, showing <u>lines</u> (an integer) lines of context, or three if <u>lines</u> is
         not given.  For proper operation, <b>patch</b> typically needs at least two lines of context.



       <b>-w</b>

         Ignore white space when comparing lines.



       <b>-W</b> <u>columns</u>




       <b>--width=</b><u>columns</u>

         Use an output width of <u>columns</u> in side by side format.



       <b>-y</b>

         Use the side by side output format.


<b>Line</b> <b>group</b> <b>formats</b>
       Line group formats let you specify formats suitable for many  applications  that  allow  if-then-else
       input,  including programming languages and text formatting languages.  A line group format specifies
       the output format for a contiguous group of similar lines.

       For example, the following command compares the TeX file <b>myfile</b> with the original  version  from  the
       repository,  and  outputs  a  merged  file in which old regions are surrounded by <b>\begin{em}</b>-<b>\end{em}</b>
       lines, and new regions are surrounded by <b>\begin{bf}</b>-<b>\end{bf}</b> lines.


         cvs diff \
            --old-group-format='\begin{em}
         %&lt;\end{em}
         ' \
            --new-group-format='\begin{bf}
         %&gt;\end{bf}
         ' \
            myfile




       The following command is equivalent to the above example, but it is a little more verbose, because it
       spells out the default line group formats.


         cvs diff \
            --old-group-format='\begin{em}
         %&lt;\end{em}
         ' \
            --new-group-format='\begin{bf}
         %&gt;\end{bf}
         ' \
            --unchanged-group-format='%=' \
            --changed-group-format='\begin{em}
         %&lt;\end{em}
         \begin{bf}
         %&gt;\end{bf}
         ' \
            myfile




       Here is a more advanced example, which outputs a diff listing with headers containing line numbers in
       a ``plain English'' style.


         cvs diff \
            --unchanged-group-format='' \
            --old-group-format='-------- %dn line%(n=1?:s) deleted at %df:
         %&lt;' \
            --new-group-format='-------- %dN line%(N=1?:s) added after %de:
         %&gt;' \
            --changed-group-format='-------- %dn line%(n=1?:s) changed at %df:
         %&lt;-------- to:
         %&gt;' \
            myfile




       To specify a line group format, use one of the options listed below.  You can specify up to four line
       group  formats,  one for each kind of line group.  You should quote <u>format</u>, because it typically con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tains&nbsp;contains</font>
       tains shell metacharacters.



       <b>--old-group-format=</b><u>format</u>

         These line groups are hunks containing only lines from the first file.  The default old group  for-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mat&nbsp;format</font>
         mat  is the same as the changed group format if it is specified; otherwise it is a format that out-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">puts&nbsp;outputs</font>
         puts the line group as-is.



       <b>--new-group-format=</b><u>format</u>

         These line groups are hunks containing only lines from the second file.  The default new group for-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mat&nbsp;format</font>
         mat  is  same as the changed group format if it is specified; otherwise it is a format that outputs
         the line group as-is.



       <b>--changed-group-format=</b><u>format</u>

         These line groups are hunks containing lines from both files.  The default changed group format  is
         the concatenation of the old and new group formats.



       <b>--unchanged-group-format=</b><u>format</u>

         These line groups contain lines common to both files.  The default unchanged group format is a for-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mat&nbsp;format</font>
         mat that outputs the line group as-is.

         In a line group format, ordinary characters represent themselves; conversion  specifications  start
         with <b>%</b> and have one of the following forms.



       <b>%&lt;</b>

         stands  for  the lines from the first file, including the trailing newline.  Each line is formatted
         according to the old line format (see node `Line formats' in the CVS manual).



       <b>%&gt;</b>

         stands for the lines from the second file, including the trailing newline.  Each line is  formatted
         according to the new line format.



       <b>%=</b>

         stands  for the lines common to both files, including the trailing newline.  Each line is formatted
         according to the unchanged line format.



       <b>%%</b>

         stands for <b>%</b>.



       <b>%c'</b><u>C</u><b>'</b>

         where <u>C</u> is a single character, stands for <u>C</u>.  <u>C</u> may not be a backslash or an apostrophe.  For exam-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ple,&nbsp;example,</font>
         ple,  <b>%c':'</b>  stands for a colon, even inside the then-part of an if-then-else format, which a colon
         would normally terminate.



       <b>%c'\</b><u>O</u><b>'</b>

         where <u>O</u> is a string of 1, 2, or 3 octal digits, stands for the character with octal  code  <u>O</u>.   For
         example, <b>%c'\0'</b> stands for a null character.



       <u>Fn</u>

         where  <u>F</u> is a <b>printf</b> conversion specification and <u>n</u> is one of the following letters, stands for <u>n</u>'s
         value formatted with <u>F</u>.


         <b>e</b>

           The line number of the line just before the group in the old file.


         <b>f</b>

           The line number of the first line in the group in the old file; equals <u>e</u> + 1.


         <b>l</b>

           The line number of the last line in the group in the old file.


         <b>m</b>

           The line number of the line just after the group in the old file; equals <u>l</u> + 1.


         <b>n</b>

           The number of lines in the group in the old file; equals <u>l</u> - <u>f</u> + 1.


         <b>E,</b> <b>F,</b> <b>L,</b> <b>M,</b> <b>N</b>

           Likewise, for lines in the new file.


           The <b>printf</b> conversion specification can be <b>%d</b>, <b>%o</b>, <b>%x</b>, or <b>%X</b>, specifying  decimal,  octal,  lower
           case  hexadecimal,  or  upper  case  hexadecimal  output respectively.  After the <b>%</b> the following
           options can appear in sequence: a <b>-</b> specifying left-justification; an integer specifying the min-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">imum&nbsp;minimum</font>
           imum  field  width; and a period followed by an optional integer specifying the minimum number of
           digits.  For example, <b>%5dN</b> prints the number of new lines in the group in  a  field  of  width  5
           characters, using the <b>printf</b> format <b>"%5d"</b>.



       <b>(</b><u>A</u><b>=</b><u>B</u><b>?</b><u>T</u><b>:</b><u>E</u><b>)</b>

         If  <u>A</u> equals <u>B</u> then <u>T</u> else <u>E</u>.  <u>A</u> and <u>B</u> are each either a decimal constant or a single letter inter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">preted&nbsp;interpreted</font>
         preted as above.  This format spec is equivalent to <u>T</u> if <u>A</u>'s value  equals  <u>B</u>'s;  otherwise  it  is
         equivalent to <u>E</u>.

         For example, <b>%(N=0?no:%dN)</b> <b>line%(N=1?:s)</b> is equivalent to <b>no</b> <b>lines</b> if <u>N</u> (the number of lines in the
         group in the new file) is 0, to <b>1</b> <b>line</b> if <u>N</u> is 1, and to <b>%dN</b> <b>lines</b> otherwise.


<b>Line</b> <b>formats</b>
       Line formats control how each line taken from an input file is output as part of a line group in  if-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">then-else&nbsp;ifthen-else</font>
       then-else format.

       For example, the following command outputs text with a one-column change indicator to the left of the
       text.  The first column of output is <b>-</b> for deleted  lines,  <b>|</b>  for  added  lines,  and  a  space  for
       unchanged lines.  The formats contain newline characters where newlines are desired on output.


         cvs diff \
            --old-line-format='-%l
         ' \
            --new-line-format='|%l
         ' \
            --unchanged-line-format=' %l
         ' \
            myfile




       To  specify a line format, use one of the following options.  You should quote <u>format</u>, since it often
       contains shell metacharacters.



       <b>--old-line-format=</b><u>format</u>

         formats lines just from the first file.



       <b>--new-line-format=</b><u>format</u>

         formats lines just from the second file.



       <b>--unchanged-line-format=</b><u>format</u>

         formats lines common to both files.



       <b>--line-format=</b><u>format</u>

         formats all lines; in effect, it sets all three above options simultaneously.

         In a line format, ordinary characters represent themselves; conversion specifications start with  <b>%</b>
         and have one of the following forms.



       <b>%l</b>

         stands  for  the  contents  of  the  line, not counting its trailing newline (if any).  This format
         ignores whether the line is incomplete.



       <b>%L</b>

         stands for the contents of the line, including its trailing newline (if any).  If a line is  incom-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">plete,&nbsp;incomplete,</font>
         plete, this format preserves its incompleteness.



       <b>%%</b>

         stands for <b>%</b>.



       <b>%c'</b><u>C</u><b>'</b>

         where <u>C</u> is a single character, stands for <u>C</u>.  <u>C</u> may not be a backslash or an apostrophe.  For exam-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ple,&nbsp;example,</font>
         ple, <b>%c':'</b> stands for a colon.



       <b>%c'\</b><u>O</u><b>'</b>

         where <u>O</u> is a string of 1, 2, or 3 octal digits, stands for the character with octal  code  <u>O</u>.   For
         example, <b>%c'\0'</b> stands for a null character.



       <u>F</u><b>n</b>

         where  <u>F</u>  is  a  <b>printf</b> conversion specification, stands for the line number formatted with <u>F</u>.  For
         example, <b>%.5dn</b> prints the line number using the <b>printf</b> format <b>"%.5d"</b>.  see node  `Line  group  for-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mats'&nbsp;formats'</font>
         mats' in the CVS manual, for more about printf conversion specifications.


         The default line format is <b>%l</b> followed by a newline character.

         If  the  input  contains tab characters and it is important that they line up on output, you should
         ensure that <b>%l</b> or <b>%L</b> in a line format is just after a tab stop (e.g. by preceding <b>%l</b> or <b>%L</b>  with  a
         tab character), or you should use the <b>-t</b> or <b>--expand-tabs</b> option.

         Taken  together, the line and line group formats let you specify many different formats.  For exam-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ple,&nbsp;example,</font>
         ple, the following command uses a format similar to <b>diff</b>'s normal format.  You can tailor this com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
         mand to get fine control over <b>diff</b>'s output.


         cvs diff \
            --old-line-format='&lt; %l
         ' \
            --new-line-format='&gt; %l

<b>diff</b> <b>examples</b>
       The  following line produces a Unidiff (<b>-u</b> flag) between revision 1.14 and 1.19 of <b>backend.c</b>.  Due to
       the <b>-kk</b> flag no keywords are substituted, so differences that only depend on keyword substitution are
       ignored.


         $ cvs diff -kk -u -r 1.14 -r 1.19 backend.c




       Suppose  the  experimental  branch EXPR1 was based on a set of files tagged RELEASE_1_0.  To see what
       has happened on that branch, the following can be used:


         $ cvs diff -r RELEASE_1_0 -r EXPR1




       A command like this can be used to produce a context diff between two releases:


         $ cvs diff -c -r RELEASE_1_0 -r RELEASE_1_1 &gt; diffs




       If you are maintaining ChangeLogs, a command like the following just before you commit  your  changes
       may  help  you  write  the ChangeLog entry.  All local modifications that have not yet been committed
       will be printed.


         $ cvs diff -u | less





<b>export</b>
   <b>Export</b> <b>sources</b> <b>from</b> <b>CVS,</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>checkout</b>
        Synopsis: export [-flNnR] (-r rev[:date] | -D date) [-k subst] [-d dir] module...

        Requires: repository.

        Changes: current directory.

         This command is a variant of <b>checkout</b>; use it when you want a copy of the source for module without
         the  <b>cvs</b> administrative directories.  For example, you might use <b>export</b> to prepare source for ship-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment&nbsp;shipment</font>
         ment off-site.  This command requires that you specify a date or tag (with <b>-D</b> or <b>-r</b>), so  that  you
         can  count  on  reproducing the source you ship to others (and thus it always prunes empty directo-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ries).&nbsp;directories).</font>
         ries).

         One often would like to use <b>-kv</b> with <b>cvs</b> <b>export</b>.  This causes any keywords to be expanded such that
         an  import  done  at  some other site will not lose the keyword revision information.  But be aware
         that doesn't handle an export containing binary files correctly.  Also be aware that  after  having
         used  <b>-kv</b>,  one  can no longer use the <b>ident</b> command (which is part of the <b>rcs</b> suite--see <a href="ident.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ident">ident(1)</a>)
         which looks for keyword strings.  If you want to be able to use <b>ident</b> you must not use <b>-kv</b>.


<b>export</b> <b>options</b>
       These standard options are supported by <b>export</b> (see node `Common options' in the CVS  manual,  for  a
       complete description of them):



       <b>-D</b> <u>date</u>

         Use the most recent revision no later than <u>date</u>.



       <b>-f</b>

         If no matching revision is found, retrieve the most recent revision (instead of ignoring the file).



       <b>-l</b>

         Local; run only in current working directory.



       <b>-n</b>

         Do not run any checkout program.



       <b>-R</b>

         Export directories recursively.  This is on by default.



       <b>-r</b> <u>tag</u><b>[:</b><u>date</u><b>]</b>

         Export the revision specified by <u>tag</u> or, when <u>date</u> is specified and <u>tag</u> is a branch tag,  the  ver-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion&nbsp;version</font>
         sion from the branch <u>tag</u> as it existed on <u>date</u>.  See see node `Common options' in the CVS manual.

         In addition, these options (that are common to <b>checkout</b> and <b>export</b>) are also supported:



       <b>-d</b> <u>dir</u>

         Create  a  directory  called <u>dir</u> for the working files, instead of using the module name.  see node
         `checkout options' in the CVS manual, for complete details on how <b>cvs</b> handles this flag.



       <b>-k</b> <u>subst</u>

         Set keyword expansion mode (see node `Substitution modes' in the CVS manual).



       <b>-N</b>

         Only useful together with <b>-d</b> <u>dir</u>.  see node `checkout options' in  the  CVS  manual,  for  complete
         details on how <b>cvs</b> handles this flag.

         <b>cvs</b>  can keep a history log that tracks each use of most <b>cvs</b> commands.  You can use <b>history</b> to dis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">play&nbsp;display</font>
         play this information in various formats.

         To enable logging, the <b>LogHistory</b> config option must be set to some  value  other  than  the  empty
         string  and  the  history file specified by the <b>HistoryLogPath</b> option must be writable by all users
         who may run the <b>cvs</b> executable (see node `config' in the CVS manual).

         To enable the <b>history</b> command, logging must be enabled as above and  the  <b>HistorySearchPath</b>  config
         option (see node `config' in the CVS manual) must be set to specify some number of the history logs
         created thereby and these files must be readable by each user who might run the <b>history</b> command.

         Creating a repository via the <b>cvs</b> <b>init</b> command will enable logging of all possible events to a sin-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">gle&nbsp;single</font>
         gle  history log file (<b>$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/history</b>) with read and write permissions for all users (see
         node `Creating a repository' in the CVS manual).

         <b>Note:</b> <b>history</b> <b>uses</b> <b>-f,</b> <b>-l,</b> <b>-n,</b> <b>and</b> <b>-p</b> <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>normal</b>  <b>use</b>  <b>inside</b>  <b>cvs</b>  <b>(see</b>
         <b>node</b> <b>`Common</b> <b>options'</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>CVS</b> <b>manual).</b>


<b>history</b> <b>options</b>
       Several options (shown above as <b>-report</b>)  control  what kind of report is generated:



       <b>-c</b>

         Report on each time commit was used (i.e., each time the repository was modified).



       <b>-e</b>

         Everything  (all  record types).  Equivalent to specifying <b>-x</b> with all record types.  Of course, <b>-e</b>
         will also include record types which are added in a future version of <b>cvs</b>; if  you  are  writing  a
         script which can only handle certain record types, you'll want to specify <b>-x</b>.



       <b>-m</b> <u>module</u>

         Report on a particular module.  (You can meaningfully use <b>-m</b> more than once on the command line.)



       <b>-o</b>

         Report on checked-out modules.  This is the default report type.



       <b>-T</b>

         Report on all tags.



       <b>-x</b> <u>type</u>

         Extract  a  particular  set  of record types <u>type</u> from the <b>cvs</b> history.  The types are indicated by
         single letters, which you may specify in combination.

         Certain commands have a single record type:


         <b>F</b>

           release

         <b>O</b>

           checkout

         <b>E</b>

           export

         <b>T</b>

           rtag

           One of five record types may result from an update:


         <b>C</b>

           A merge was necessary but collisions were detected (requiring manual merging).

         <b>G</b>

           A merge was necessary and it succeeded.

         <b>U</b>

           A working file was copied from the repository.

         <b>P</b>

           A working file was patched to match the repository.

         <b>W</b>

           The working copy of a file was deleted during update (because it was gone from the repository).

           One of three record types results from commit:


         <b>A</b>

           A file was added for the first time.

         <b>M</b>

           A file was modified.

         <b>R</b>

           A file was removed.

           The options shown as <b>-flags</b> constrain or expand the report without requiring option arguments:



       <b>-a</b>

         Show data for all users (the default is to show data only for the user executing <b>history</b>).



       <b>-l</b>

         Show last modification only.



       <b>-w</b>

         Show only the records for modifications done from the same working directory where <b>history</b> is  exe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cuting.&nbsp;executing.</font>
         cuting.

         The options shown as <b>-options</b> <u>args</u> constrain the report based on an argument:



       <b>-b</b> <u>str</u>

         Show  data back to a record containing  the  string <u>str</u>  in  either the module name, the file name,
         or the repository path.



       <b>-D</b> <u>date</u>

         Show data since <u>date</u>.  This is slightly different from the normal use of <b>-D</b> <u>date</u>, which selects the
         newest revision older than <u>date</u>.



       <b>-f</b> <u>file</u>

         Show  data  for  a  particular  file (you can specify several <b>-f</b> options on the same command line).
         This is equivalent to specifying the file on the command line.



       <b>-n</b> <u>module</u>

         Show data for a particular module (you can specify several <b>-n</b> options on the same command line).



       <b>-p</b> <u>repository</u>

         Show data for a particular source repository  (you can specify several <b>-p</b> options on the same  com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
         mand line).



       <b>-r</b> <u>rev</u>

         Show  records  referring to revisions since the revision or tag named <u>rev</u> appears in individual <b>rcs</b>
         files.  Each <b>rcs</b> file is searched for the revision or tag.



       <b>-t</b> <u>tag</u>

         Show records since tag <u>tag</u> was last added to the history file.  This differs from the <b>-r</b> flag above
         in that it reads only the history file, not the <b>rcs</b> files, and is much faster.



       <b>-u</b> <u>name</u>

         Show records for user <u>name</u>.



       <b>-z</b> <u>timezone</u>

         Show times in the selected records using the specified time zone instead of UTC.


<b>import</b>
   <b>Import</b> <b>sources</b> <b>into</b> <b>CVS,</b> <b>using</b> <b>vendor</b> <b>branches</b>
        Synopsis: import [-options] repository vendortag releasetag...

        Requires: Repository, source distribution directory.

        Changes: repository.

         Use <b>import</b> to incorporate an entire source distribution from an outside source (e.g., a source ven-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dor)&nbsp;vendor)</font>
         dor) into your source repository directory.  You can use this command both for initial creation  of
         a  repository, and for wholesale updates to the module from the outside source.  see node `Tracking
         sources' in the CVS manual, for a discussion on this subject.

         The <u>repository</u> argument gives a directory name (or a path to a directory) under the <b>cvs</b> root direc-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tory&nbsp;directory</font>
         tory for repositories; if the directory did not exist, import creates it.

         When you use import for updates to source that has been modified in your source repository (since a
         prior import), it will notify you of any files that conflict in the two  branches  of  development;
         use <b>checkout</b> <b>-j</b> to reconcile the differences, as import instructs you to do.

         If  <b>cvs</b>  decides  a  file  should  be ignored (see node `cvsignore' in the CVS manual), it does not
         import it and prints <b>I</b>  followed by the filename (see node `import output' in the CVS manual, for a
         complete description of the output).

         If  the  file <b>$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/cvswrappers</b> exists, any file whose names match the specifications in
         that file will be treated as packages and the  appropriate  filtering  will  be  performed  on  the
         file/directory before being imported.  see node `Wrappers' in the CVS manual.

         The  outside source is saved in a first-level branch, by default 1.1.1.  Updates are leaves of this
         branch; for example, files from the first imported collection of source will be  revision  1.1.1.1,
         then files from the first imported update will be revision 1.1.1.2, and so on.

         At  least three arguments are required.  <u>repository</u> is needed to identify the collection of source.
         <u>vendortag</u> is a tag for the entire branch (e.g., for 1.1.1).  You must also  specify  at  least  one
         <u>releasetag</u>  to uniquely identify the files at the leaves created each time you execute <b>import</b>.  The
         <u>releasetag</u> should be new, not previously existing in the repository file, and uniquely identify the
         imported release,

         Note  that <b>import</b> does <u>not</u> change the directory in which you invoke it.  In particular, it does not
         set up that directory as a <b>cvs</b> working directory; if you want to work with the sources import  them
         first  and then check them out into a different directory (see node `Getting the source' in the CVS
         manual).


<b>import</b> <b>options</b>
       This standard option is supported by <b>import</b> (see node `Common options' in the CVS manual, for a  com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">plete&nbsp;complete</font>
       plete description):



       <b>-m</b> <u>message</u>

         Use <u>message</u> as log information, instead of invoking an editor.

         There are the following additional special options.



       <b>-b</b> <u>branch</u>

         See see node `Multiple vendor branches' in the CVS manual.



       <b>-k</b> <u>subst</u>

         Indicate  the  keyword expansion mode desired.  This setting will apply to all files created during
         the import, but not to any files that previously existed in the repository.  See see node  `Substi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tution&nbsp;`Substitution</font>
         tution modes' in the CVS manual, for a list of valid <b>-k</b> settings.



       <b>-I</b> <u>name</u>

         Specify  file  names that should be ignored during import.  You can use this option repeatedly.  To
         avoid ignoring any files at all (even those ignored by default), specify `-I !'.

         <u>name</u> can be a file name pattern of the same type that you can specify in the <b>.cvsignore</b> file.   see
         node `cvsignore' in the CVS manual.



       <b>-W</b> <u>spec</u>

         Specify file names that should be filtered during import.  You can use this option repeatedly.

         <u>spec</u> can be a file name pattern of the same type that you can specify in the <b>.cvswrappers</b> file. see
         node `Wrappers' in the CVS manual.



       <b>-X</b>

         Modify the algorithm used by <b>cvs</b> when importing new files so that  new  files  do  not  immediately
         appear on the main trunk.

         Specifically,  this flag causes <b>cvs</b> to mark new files as if they were deleted on the main trunk, by
         taking the following steps for each file in addition to those normally taken on import: creating  a
         new  revision  on  the  main  trunk  indicating that the new file is <b>dead</b>, resetting the new file's
         default branch, and placing the file in the Attic (see node `Attic' in the CVS manual) directory.

         Use of this option can be forced on a repository-wide basis by setting the  <b>ImportNewFilesToVendor</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">BranchOnly&nbsp;ImportNewFilesToVendorBranchOnly</font>
         <b>BranchOnly</b> option in CVSROOT/config (see node `config' in the CVS manual).


<b>import</b> <b>output</b>
       <b>import</b> keeps you informed of its progress by printing a line for each file, preceded by one character
       indicating the status of the file:



       <b>U</b> <u>file</u>

         The file already exists in the repository and has not been locally modified;  a  new  revision  has
         been created (if necessary).



       <b>N</b> <u>file</u>

         The file is a new file which has been added to the repository.



       <b>C</b> <u>file</u>

         The file already exists in the repository but has been locally modified; you will have to merge the
         changes.



       <b>I</b> <u>file</u>

         The file is being ignored (see node `cvsignore' in the CVS manual).



       <b>L</b> <u>file</u>

         The file is a symbolic link; <b>cvs</b> <b>import</b> ignores symbolic links.  People periodically  suggest  that
         this behavior should be changed, but if there is a consensus on what it should be changed to, it is
         not apparent.  (Various options in the <b>modules</b> file can be  used  to  recreate  symbolic  links  on
         checkout, update, etc.; see node `modules' in the CVS manual.)


<b>import</b> <b>examples</b>
       See see node `Tracking sources' in the CVS manual, and see node `From files' in the CVS manual.


<b>log</b>
   <b>Print</b> <b>out</b> <b>log</b> <b>information</b> <b>for</b> <b>files</b>
        Synopsis: log [options] [files...]

        Requires: repository, working directory.

        Changes: nothing.

         Display  log  information  for  files.  <b>log</b> used to call the <b>rcs</b> utility <b>rlog</b>.  Although this is no
         longer true in the current sources, this history determines  the  format  of  the  output  and  the
         options, which are not quite in the style of the other <b>cvs</b> commands.

         The  output  includes  the  location of the <b>rcs</b> file, the <u>head</u> revision (the latest revision on the
         trunk), all symbolic names (tags) and some other things.  For each revision, the  revision  number,
         the  date,  the  author,  the  number  of lines added/deleted, the commitid and the log message are
         printed.  All dates are displayed in local time at the client. This is typically specified  in  the
         <b>$TZ</b> environment variable, which can be set to govern how <b>log</b> displays dates.

         <b>Note:</b> <b>log</b> <b>uses</b> <b>-R</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>conflicts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>normal</b> <b>use</b> <b>inside</b> <b>cvs</b> <b>(see</b> <b>node</b> <b>`Common</b> <b>options'</b>
         <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>CVS</b> <b>manual).</b>


<b>log</b> <b>options</b>
       By default, <b>log</b> prints all information that is available.  All other  options  restrict  the  output.
       Note  that  the  revision  selection options (<b>-d</b>, <b>-r</b>, <b>-s</b>, and <b>-w</b>) have no effect, other than possibly
       causing a search for files in Attic directories, when used  in  conjunction  with  the  options  that
       restrict the output to only <b>log</b> header fields (<b>-b</b>, <b>-h</b>, <b>-R</b>, and <b>-t</b>) unless the <b>-S</b> option is also spec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ified.&nbsp;specified.</font>
       ified.



       <b>-b</b>

         Print information about the revisions on the default branch, normally the  highest  branch  on  the
         trunk.



       <b>-d</b> <u>dates</u>

         Print information about revisions with a checkin date/time in the range given by the semicolon-sep-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">arated&nbsp;semicolon-separated</font>
         arated list of dates.  The date formats accepted are those accepted by the <b>-D</b> option to many  other
         <b>cvs</b>  commands  (see node `Common options' in the CVS manual).  Dates can be combined into ranges as
         follows:


         <u>d1</u><b>&lt;</b><u>d2</u>



         <u>d2</u><b>&gt;</b><u>d1</u>

           Select the revisions that were deposited between <u>d1</u> and <u>d2</u>.


         <b>&lt;</b><u>d</u>



         <u>d</u><b>&gt;</b>

           Select all revisions dated <u>d</u> or earlier.


         <u>d</u><b>&lt;</b>



         <b>&gt;</b><u>d</u>

           Select all revisions dated <u>d</u> or later.


         <u>d</u>

           Select the single, latest revision dated <u>d</u> or earlier.

           The <b>&gt;</b> or <b>&lt;</b> characters may be followed by <b>=</b> to indicate an inclusive range rather than  an  exclu-
           sive one.

           Note that the separator is a semicolon (;).



       <b>-h</b>

         Print  only  the  name  of  the  <b>rcs</b> file, name of the file in the working directory, head, default
         branch, access list, locks, symbolic names, and suffix.



       <b>-l</b>

         Local; run only in current working directory.  (Default is to run recursively).



       <b>-N</b>

         Do not print the list of tags for this file.  This option can be very useful when your site uses  a
         lot of tags, so rather than "more"'ing over 3 pages of tag information, the log information is pre-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sented&nbsp;presented</font>
         sented without tags at all.



       <b>-R</b>

         Print only the name of the <b>rcs</b> file.



       <b>-r</b><u>revisions</u>

         Print information about revisions given in the comma-separated  list  <u>revisions</u>  of  revisions  and
         ranges.  The following table explains the available range formats:


         <u>rev1</u><b>:</b><u>rev2</u>

           Revisions <u>rev1</u> to <u>rev2</u> (which must be on the same branch).


         <u>rev1</u><b>::</b><u>rev2</u>

           The same, but excluding <u>rev1</u>.


         <b>:</b><u>rev</u>



         <b>::</b><u>rev</u>

           Revisions from the beginning of the branch up to and including <u>rev</u>.


         <u>rev</u><b>:</b>

           Revisions starting with <u>rev</u> to the end of the branch containing <u>rev</u>.


         <u>rev</u><b>::</b>

           Revisions starting just after <u>rev</u> to the end of the branch containing <u>rev</u>.


         <u>branch</u>

           An argument that is a branch means all revisions on that branch.


         <u>branch1</u><b>:</b><u>branch2</u>



         <u>branch1</u><b>::</b><u>branch2</u>

           A range of branches means all revisions on the branches in that range.


         <u>branch</u><b>.</b>

           The latest revision in <u>branch</u>.

           A  bare <b>-r</b> with no revisions means the latest revision on the default branch, normally the trunk.
           There can be no space between the <b>-r</b> option and its argument.



       <b>-S</b>

         Suppress the header if no revisions are selected.



       <b>-s</b> <u>states</u>

         Print information about revisions whose state attributes match one  of  the  states  given  in  the
         comma-separated  list  <u>states</u>.   Individual states may be any text string, though <b>cvs</b> commonly only
         uses two states, <b>Exp</b> and <b>dead</b>.  See see node `admin options' in the CVS manual  for  more  informa-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion.&nbsp;information.</font>
         tion.



       <b>-t</b>

         Print the same as <b>-h</b>, plus the descriptive text.



       <b>-w</b><u>logins</u>

         Print information about revisions checked in by users with login names appearing in the comma-sepa-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rated&nbsp;comma-separated</font>
         rated list <u>logins</u>.  If <u>logins</u> is omitted, the user's login is  assumed.   There  can  be  no  space
         between the <b>-w</b> option and its argument.

         <b>log</b>  prints the intersection of the revisions selected with the options <b>-d</b>, <b>-s</b>, and <b>-w</b>, intersected
         with the union of the revisions selected by <b>-b</b> and <b>-r</b>.


<b>log</b> <b>examples</b>
       Since <b>log</b> shows dates in local time, you might want to see them in Coordinated Universal  Time  (UTC)
       or some other timezone.  To do this you can set your <b>$TZ</b> environment variable before invoking <b>cvs</b>:


         $ TZ=UTC cvs log foo.c
         $ TZ=EST cvs log bar.c




       (If  you  are  using  a  <b>csh</b>-style shell, like <b>tcsh</b>, you would need to prefix the examples above with
       <b>env</b>.)


<b>ls</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>rls</b>
        ls [-e | -l] [-RP] [-r tag[:date]] [-D date] [path...]

        Requires: repository for <b>rls</b>, repository &amp; working directory for <b>ls</b>.

        Changes: nothing.

        Synonym: <b>dir</b> &amp; <b>list</b> are synonyms for <b>ls</b> and <b>rdir</b> &amp; <b>rlist</b> are synonyms for <b>rls</b>.

         The <b>ls</b> and <b>rls</b> commands are used to list files and directories in the repository.

         By default <b>ls</b> lists the files and directories that belong in your working directory, what would  be
         there after an <b>update</b>.

         By  default <b>rls</b> lists the files and directories on the tip of the trunk in the topmost directory of
         the repository.

         Both commands accept an optional list of file and directory names, relative to the  working  direc-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tory&nbsp;directory</font>
         tory  for <b>ls</b> and the topmost directory of the repository for <b>rls</b>.  Neither is recursive by default.


<b>ls</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>rls</b> <b>options</b>
       These standard options are supported by <b>ls</b> &amp; <b>rls</b>:



       <b>-d</b>

         Show dead revisions (with tag when specified).



       <b>-e</b>

         Display in CVS/Entries format.  This format is meant to remain easily parsable by automation.



       <b>-l</b>

         Display all details.



       <b>-P</b>

         Don't list contents of empty directories when recursing.



       <b>-R</b>

         List recursively.



       <b>-r</b> <u>tag</u><b>[:</b><u>date</u><b>]</b>

         Show files specified by <u>tag</u> or, when <u>date</u> is specified and <u>tag</u> is a branch tag,  the  version  from
         the branch <u>tag</u> as it existed on <u>date</u>.  See see node `Common options' in the CVS manual.



       <b>-D</b> <u>date</u>

         Show files from date.

        Requires: repository.

        Changes: nothing.

        Synonym: patch

         Builds  a  Larry  Wall format <a href="patch.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/patch">patch(1)</a> file between two releases, that can be fed directly into the
         <b>patch</b> program to bring an old release up-to-date with the new release.  (This is one of the few <b>cvs</b>
         commands  that  operates  directly  from the repository, and doesn't require a prior checkout.) The
         diff output is sent to the standard output device.

         You can specify (using the standard <b>-r</b> and <b>-D</b> options) any combination of one or two  revisions  or
         dates.  If only one revision or date is specified, the patch file reflects differences between that
         revision or date and the current head revisions in the <b>rcs</b> file.

         Note that if the software release affected is contained in more than one directory, then it may  be
         necessary  to  specify  the  <b>-p</b>  option to the <b>patch</b> command when patching the old sources, so that
         <b>patch</b> is able to find the files that are located in other directories.


<b>rdiff</b> <b>options</b>
       These standard options are supported by <b>rdiff</b> (see node `Common options' in the  CVS  manual,  for  a
       complete description of them):



       <b>-D</b> <u>date</u>

         Use the most recent revision no later than <u>date</u>.



       <b>-f</b>

         If no matching revision is found, retrieve the most recent revision (instead of ignoring the file).



       <b>-k</b> <u>kflag</u>

         Process keywords according to <u>kflag</u>.  See see node `Keyword substitution' in the CVS manual.



       <b>-l</b>

         Local; don't descend subdirectories.



       <b>-R</b>

         Examine directories recursively.  This option is on by default.



       <b>-r</b> <u>tag</u>

         Use the revision specified by <u>tag</u>, or when <u>date</u> is specified and <u>tag</u> is a branch tag,  the  version
         from the branch <u>tag</u> as it existed on <u>date</u>.  See see node `Common options' in the CVS manual.

         In addition to the above, these options are available:



       <b>-c</b>

         Use the context diff format.  This is the default format.



       <b>-s</b>

         Create  a  summary  change report instead of a patch.  The summary includes information about files
         that were changed or added between the releases.  It is sent to the standard output  device.   This
         is useful for finding out, for example, which files have changed between two dates or revisions.



       <b>-t</b>

         A  diff  of  the  top two revisions is sent to the standard output device.  This is most useful for
         seeing what the last change to a file was.



       <b>-u</b>

         Use the unidiff format for the context diffs.  Remember that old  versions  of  the  <b>patch</b>  program
         can't  handle  the unidiff format, so if you plan to post this patch to the net you should probably
         not use <b>-u</b>.



       <b>-V</b> <u>vn</u>

         Expand keywords according to the rules current in <b>rcs</b> version <u>vn</u> (the expansion format changed with
         <b>rcs</b>  version 5).  Note that this option is no longer accepted.  <b>cvs</b> will always expand keywords the
         way that <b>rcs</b> version 5 does.


<b>rdiff</b> <b>examples</b>
       Suppose you receive mail from foo@example.net asking for an update from release 1.2 to 1.4 of the  tc
       compiler.   You  have  no  such patches on hand, but with <b>cvs</b> that can easily be fixed with a command
       such as this:


         $ cvs rdiff -c -r FOO1_2 -r FOO1_4 tc | \
         $$ Mail -s 'The patches you asked for' foo@example.net




       Suppose you have made release 1.3, and forked a branch called <b>R_1_3fix</b> for bug fixes.  <b>R_1_3_1</b> corre-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sponds&nbsp;corresponds</font>
       sponds to release 1.3.1, which was made some time ago.  Now, you want to see how much development has
       been done on the branch.  This command can be used:


         $ cvs patch -s -r R_1_3_1 -r R_1_3fix module-name
         cvs rdiff: Diffing module-name
         File ChangeLog,v changed from revision 1.52.2.5 to 1.52.2.6
         File foo.c,v changed from revision 1.52.2.3 to 1.52.2.4
         File bar.h,v changed from revision 1.29.2.1 to 1.2





<b>release</b>
   <b>Indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>Module</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>in</b> <b>use</b>
        release [-d] directories...

        Requires: Working directory.

        Changes: Working directory, history log.

         This command is meant to safely cancel the effect of <b>cvs</b> <b>checkout</b>.  Since <b>cvs</b> doesn't  lock  files,
         it  isn't strictly necessary to use this command.  You can always simply delete your working direc-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tory,&nbsp;directory,</font>
         tory, if you like; but you risk losing changes you may have forgotten, and you leave  no  trace  in
         the  <b>cvs</b> history file (see node `history file' in the CVS manual) that you've abandoned your check-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">out.&nbsp;checkout.</font>
         out.

         Use <b>cvs</b> <b>release</b> to avoid these problems.  This command  checks  that  no  uncommitted  changes  are
         present;  that  you  are  executing it from immediately above a <b>cvs</b> working directory; and that the
         repository recorded for your files is the same as the repository defined in the module database.

         If all these conditions are true, <b>cvs</b> <b>release</b> leaves a record of its execution (attesting  to  your
         intentionally abandoning your checkout) in the <b>cvs</b> history log.


<b>release</b> <b>options</b>
       The <b>release</b> command supports one command option:



       <b>-d</b>

         Delete your working copy of the file if the release succeeds.  If this flag is not given your files
         will remain in your working directory.

         <b>WARNING:</b>  <b>The</b> <b>release</b> <b>command</b> <b>deletes</b> <b>all</b> <b>directories</b> <b>and</b> <b>files</b> <b>recursively.</b>   <b>This</b>  <b>has</b>  <b>the</b>  <b>very</b>
         <b>serious</b>  <b>side-effect</b>  <b>that</b> <b>any</b> <b>directory</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>created</b> <b>inside</b> <b>your</b> <b>checked-out</b> <b>sources,</b> <b>and</b>
         <b>not</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>repository</b> <b>(using</b> <b>the</b> <b>add</b> <b>command;</b> <b>see</b> <b>node</b> <b>`Adding</b> <b>files'</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>CVS</b> <b>manual)</b> <b>will</b>
         <b>be</b> <b>silently</b> <b>deleted--even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>non-empty!</b>


<b>release</b> <b>output</b>
       Before <b>release</b> releases your sources it will print a one-line message for any file that is not up-to-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">date.&nbsp;up-todate.</font>
       date.



       <b>U</b> <u>file</u>




       <b>P</b> <u>file</u>

         There exists a newer revision of this file in the repository, and you have not modified your  local
         copy of the file (<b>U</b> and <b>P</b> mean the same thing).



       <b>A</b> <u>file</u>

         The  file has been added to your private copy of the sources, but has not yet been committed to the
         repository.  If you delete your copy of the sources this file will be lost.



       <b>R</b> <u>file</u>

         The file has been removed from your private copy of the sources, but has not yet been removed  from
         the repository, since you have not yet committed the removal.  see node `commit' in the CVS manual.



       <b>M</b> <u>file</u>

         The file is modified in your working directory.  There might also be a newer  revision  inside  the
         repository.



       <b>?</b> <u>file</u>

         <u>file</u>  is  in  your working directory, but does not correspond to anything in the source repository,
         and is not in the list of files for <b>cvs</b> to ignore (see the description of the <b>-I</b>  option,  and  see
         node `cvsignore' in the CVS manual).  If you remove your working sources, this file will be lost.


<b>release</b> <b>examples</b>
       Release the <b>tc</b> directory, and delete your local working copy of the files.


         $ cd ..         # You must stand immediately above the
                         # sources when you issue <b>cvs</b> <b>release</b>.
         $ cvs release -d tc
         You have [0] altered files in this repository.

<b>server</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>pserver</b>
   <b>Act</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>server</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>client</b> <b>on</b> <b>stdin/stdout</b>
        pserver [-c path]

         server [-c path]

        Requires: repository, client conversation on stdin/stdout

        Changes: Repository or, indirectly, client working directory.

         The  <b>cvs</b>  <b>server</b>  and  <b>pserver</b> commands are used to provide repository access to remote clients and
         expect a client conversation on stdin &amp; stdout.  Typically these commands are launched  from  <b>inetd</b>
         or via <b>ssh</b> (see node `Remote repositories' in the CVS manual).

         <b>server</b>  expects  that  the  client  has  already been authenticated somehow, typically via <b>ssh</b>, and
         <b>pserver</b> attempts to authenticate the client itself.

         Only one option is available with the <b>server</b> and <b>pserver</b> commands:



       <b>-c</b> <b>path</b>

         Load configuration from <u>path</u> rather than the default  location  <b>$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/config</b>  (see  node
         `config'  in the CVS manual).  <u>path</u> must be <b>/etc/cvs.conf</b> or prefixed by <b>/etc/cvs/</b>.  This option is
         supported beginning with <b>cvs</b> release 1.12.13.


<b>tag</b>
   <b>Add</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbolic</b> <b>tag</b> <b>to</b> <b>checked</b> <b>out</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>RCS</b> <b>file</b>
        tag [-lQqR] [-b] [-d] symbolic_tag [files...]

        Requires: repository, working directory.

        Changes: repository.

        Synonym: freeze.

         Use this command to assign symbolic tags  to  the  nearest  repository  versions  to  your  working
         sources.   The  tags  are applied immediately to the repository, as with <b>rtag</b>, but the versions are
         supplied implicitly by the CVS records of your working files' history rather than  applied  explic-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">itly.&nbsp;explicitly.</font>
         itly.

         One  use for tags is to record a snapshot of the current sources when the software freeze date of a
         project arrives.  As bugs are fixed after the freeze date, only those changed sources that  are  to
         be part of the release need be re-tagged.

         The  symbolic tags are meant to permanently record which revisions of which files were used in cre-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ating&nbsp;creating</font>
         ating a software distribution.  The <b>checkout</b> and <b>update</b> commands allow you to extract an exact copy
         of  a  tagged  release  at  any  time in the future, regardless of whether files have been changed,
         added, or removed since the release was tagged.

         This command can also be used to delete a symbolic tag, or to create a  branch.   See  the  options
         section below.


<b>tag</b> <b>options</b>
       These  standard options are supported by <b>tag</b> (see node `Common options' in the CVS manual, for a com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">plete&nbsp;complete</font>
       plete description of them):



       <b>-l</b>

         Local; run only in current working directory.



       <b>-R</b>

         Commit directories recursively.  This is on by default.



       <b>-Q</b>

         Really quiet.



       <b>-q</b>

         Somewhat quiet.



       Two special options are available:



       <b>-b</b>

         The <b>-b</b> option makes the tag a branch tag (see node `Branches' in the CVS manual), allowing  concur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rent,&nbsp;concurrent,</font>
         rent,  isolated  development.   This  is  most useful for creating a patch to a previously released
         software distribution.



       <b>-d</b>

         Delete a tag.

         If you use <b>cvs</b> <b>tag</b> <b>-d</b> <b>symbolic_tag</b>, the symbolic tag you specify is deleted instead of being added.
         Warning:  Be  very  certain of your ground before you delete a tag; doing this effectively discards
         some historical information, which may later turn out to have been valuable.


<b>update</b>
   <b>Bring</b> <b>work</b> <b>tree</b> <b>in</b> <b>sync</b> <b>with</b> <b>repository</b>
        update [-ACdflPpR] [-I name] [-j rev [-j rev]] [-k kflag] [-r  tag[:date]  |  -D  date]  [-W  spec]
         files...

        Requires: repository, working directory.

        Changes: working directory.

         After  you've  run checkout to create your private copy of source from the common repository, other
         developers will continue changing the central source.  From time to time, when it is convenient  in
         your development process, you can use the <b>update</b> command from within your working directory to rec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">oncile&nbsp;reconcile</font>
         oncile your work with any revisions applied to the source repository since your  last  checkout  or
         update.   Without  the  <b>-C</b> option, <b>update</b> will also merge any differences between the local copy of
         files and their base revisions into any destination revisions specified with <b>-r</b>, <b>-D</b>, or <b>-A</b>.


<b>update</b> <b>options</b>
       These standard options are available with <b>update</b> (see node `Common options' in the CVS manual, for  a
       complete description of them):



       <b>-D</b> <b>date</b>

         Use  the  most recent revision no later than <u>date</u>.  This option is sticky, and implies <b>-P</b>.  See see
         node `Sticky tags' in the CVS manual, for more information on sticky tags/dates.



       <b>-f</b>

         Only useful with the <b>-D</b> or <b>-r</b> flags.  If no matching revision is found, retrieve  the  most  recent
         revision (instead of ignoring the file).



       <b>-k</b> <u>kflag</u>

         Process  keywords according to <u>kflag</u>.  See see node `Keyword substitution' in the CVS manual.  This
         option is sticky; future updates of this file in this working directory will use  the  same  <u>kflag</u>.
         The <b>status</b> command can be viewed to see the sticky options.  See see node `Invoking CVS' in the CVS
         manual, for more information on the <b>status</b> command.



       <b>-l</b>

         Local; run only in current working directory.  see node `Recursive behavior' in the CVS manual.



       <b>-P</b>

         Prune empty directories.  See see node `Moving directories' in the CVS manual.



       <b>-p</b>

         Pipe files to the standard output.



       <b>-R</b>

         Update directories recursively (default).  see node `Recursive behavior' in the CVS manual.



       <b>-r</b> <u>tag</u><b>[:</b><u>date</u><b>]</b>

         Retrieve the revisions specified by <u>tag</u> or, when <u>date</u> is specified and <u>tag</u> is  a  branch  tag,  the
         version from the branch <u>tag</u> as it existed on <u>date</u>.  This option is sticky, and implies <b>-P</b>.  See see
         node `Sticky tags' in the CVS manual, for more information on sticky tags/dates. Also see see  node
         `Common options' in the CVS manual.

         These special options are also available with <b>update</b>.



       <b>-A</b>

         Reset  any  sticky  tags,  dates, or <b>-k</b> options.  See see node `Sticky tags' in the CVS manual, for
         more information on sticky tags/dates.



       <b>-C</b>

         Overwrite locally modified files with clean copies from the repository (the modified file is  saved
         in <b>.#</b><u>file</u><b>.</b><u>revision</u>, however).



       <b>-d</b>

         Create  any directories that exist in the repository if they're missing from the working directory.
         Normally, <b>update</b> acts only on directories and files that were  already  enrolled  in  your  working
         directory.

         This  is  useful  for  updating  directories  that were created in the repository since the initial
         checkout; but it has an unfortunate side effect.  If you deliberately avoided  certain  directories
         in  the  repository when you created your working directory (either through use of a module name or
         by listing explicitly the files and directories you wanted on the command line), then updating with
         <b>-d</b> will create those directories, which may not be what you want.



       <b>-I</b> <u>name</u>

         Ignore files whose names match <u>name</u> (in your working directory) during the update.  You can specify
         <b>-I</b> more than once on the command line to specify several files to ignore.  Use <b>-I</b> <b>!</b> to avoid ignor-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;ignoring</font>
         ing  any  files  at all.  see node `cvsignore' in the CVS manual, for other ways to make <b>cvs</b> ignore
         some files.



       <b>-W</b><u>spec</u>

         Specify file names that should be filtered during update.  You can use this option repeatedly.

         <u>spec</u> can be a file name pattern of the same type that you can specify in the <b>.cvswrappers</b> file. see
         node `Wrappers' in the CVS manual.



       <b>-j</b><u>revision</u>

         With  two  <b>-j</b>  options,  merge  changes from the revision specified with the first <b>-j</b> option to the
         revision specified with the second <b>j</b> option, into the working directory.

         With one <b>-j</b> option, merge changes from the ancestor revision to the revision specified with the  <b>-j</b>
         option,  into  the working directory.  The ancestor revision is the common ancestor of the revision
         which the working directory is based on, and the revision specified in the <b>-j</b> option.

         Note that using a single <b>-j</b> <u>tagname</u> option rather than <b>-j</b> <u>branchname</u> to merge changes from a branch
         will often not remove files which were removed on the branch.  see node `Merging adds and removals'
         in the CVS manual, for more.

         In addition, each <b>-j</b> option can contain an  optional  date  specification  which,  when  used  with
         branches,  can limit the chosen revision to one within a specific date.  An optional date is speci-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fied&nbsp;specified</font>
         fied by adding a colon (:) to the tag: <b>-j</b><u>Symbolic</u><b>_</b><u>Tag</u><b>:</b><u>Date</u><b>_</b><u>Specifier</u>.

         see node `Branching and merging' in the CVS manual.



<b>update</b> <b>output</b>
       <b>update</b> and <b>checkout</b> keep you informed of their progress by printing a line for each file, preceded by
       one character indicating the status of the file:



       <b>U</b> <u>file</u>

         The  file  was  brought  up to date with respect to the repository.  This is done for any file that
         exists in the repository but not in your working directory, and for files that you haven't  changed
         but are not the most recent versions available in the repository.



       <b>P</b> <u>file</u>

         Like  <b>U</b>,  but  the  <b>cvs</b> server sends a patch instead of an entire file.  This accomplishes the same
         thing as <b>U</b> using less bandwidth.



       <b>A</b> <u>file</u>

         The file has been added to your private copy of the sources, and will be added to the source repos-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">itory&nbsp;repository</font>
         itory when you run <b>commit</b> on the file.  This is a reminder to you that the file needs to be commit-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ted.&nbsp;committed.</font>
         ted.



       <b>R</b> <u>file</u>

         The file has been removed from your private copy of the sources,  and  will  be  removed  from  the
         source  repository  when you run <b>commit</b> on the file.  This is a reminder to you that the file needs
         to be committed.



       <b>M</b> <u>file</u>

         The file is modified in  your  working  directory.

         <b>M</b> can indicate one of two states for a file you're working on: either there were  no  modifications
         to  the  same  file  in the repository, so that your file remains as you last saw it; or there were
         modifications in the repository as well as in your copy, but they were merged successfully, without
         conflict, in your working directory.

         <b>cvs</b>  will print some messages if it merges your work, and a backup copy of your working file (as it
         looked before you ran <b>update</b>) will be made.  The exact name of that file is  printed  while  <b>update</b>
         runs.



       <b>C</b> <u>file</u>

         A  conflict  was  detected  while trying to merge your changes to <u>file</u> with changes from the source
         repository.  <u>file</u> (the copy in your working directory) is now the result of attempting to merge the
         two  revisions;  an  unmodified  copy of your file is also in your working directory, with the name
         <b>.#</b><u>file</u><b>.</b><u>revision</u> where <u>revision</u> is the revision that your modified file started from.   Resolve  the
         conflict  as  described in see node `Conflicts example' in the CVS manual.  (Note that some systems
         automatically purge files that begin with <b>.#</b> if they have not been accessed for a few days.  If you
         intend  to keep a copy of your original file, it is a very good idea to rename it.)  Under <b>vms</b>, the
         file name starts with <b>__</b> rather than <b>.#</b>.



       <b>?</b> <u>file</u>

         <u>file</u> is in your working directory, but does not correspond to anything in  the  source  repository,
         and  is  not  in the list of files for <b>cvs</b> to ignore (see the description of the <b>-I</b> option, and see
         node `cvsignore' in the CVS manual).
