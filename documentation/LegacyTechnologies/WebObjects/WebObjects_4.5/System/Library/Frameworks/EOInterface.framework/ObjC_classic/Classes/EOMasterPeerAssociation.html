Detail objects are fetched independentlyfrom the detail's data source, which means that changes to onedisplay group aren't automatically reflected in the other. Toupdate the other display group, it's necessary to save the changesmade and then have the other display group fetch its objects anew.</p><p>Contrast this with a master-detail setup using an EOMasterDetailAssociation.With an EOMasterDetailAssociation, the display groups' data sourcesalso operate in a master-detail arrangement, meaning changes toone are immediately reflected in the other. The detail objects are takendirectly from the selected object in the master display group, sothat changes to the objects in one display group are instantly reflectedin the other. Master-peer setups display these advantages over master-detailsetups:</p><ul><li>You can use them to display the destination objectsfor relationships that are defined in the model but not declaredas class properties. This is typically done for rarely accessedinformation-or information that's costly to access. By not definingthe relationship as a class property, the destination objects aren'tstored as instance variables in the source objects, which savesmemory and the cost of constructing faults for the relationship.</li><li>Because the detail display group fetches objects with itsown data source, you can configure the detail data source with anauxiliary EOQualifier to limit the objects fetched. This furtherreduces the cost of fetching data.</li><li>You can use an EOMasterPeerAssociation to fetch detail informationthat may be updated in another editing context or even in anotherapplication; thus this association helps you to remain "up todate" with the database.</li></ul><p>Generally, master-peer setups are only appropriate when noinsertions or deletions will be made in the detail display group.For a master-detail relationship that reflects changes between twodisplay groups, including insertions and deletions, use an EOMasterDetailAssociation.</p><br><table border = "1"><tr><td scope="row"><b>Usable With</b></td></tr><tr><td scope="row">EODisplayGroups whose data sources are not EODetailDataSources</td></tr></table><br><br><table border = "1"><tr><td scope="row"><b>Aspects</b></td></tr><tr><td scope="row">parent</td><td>A relationship from the master EODisplayGroup.</td></tr></table><br><br><table border = "1"><tr><td scope="row"><b>Object Keys Taken</b></td></tr><tr><td scope="row">None</td></tr></table><br><br><h2>Example</h2><p>Suppose you have a database of salesmen and their associatedsales. Each salesman has a city ID. The sales are related to thesalesmen by salesman ID, but also have a city ID. You want a listof all the sales in a salesman's city so you could evaluate itagainst other salesmen. For this, you create a relationship betweensalesman and sales based on city ID (the relationship is not a classproperty). You can then display that information using an EOMasterPeerAssociation.</p><br><BR><br><a href="../EOInterfaceTOC.html"><img src="../../../../../../images/up.gif" border="0" alt="Table of Contents"></a> </BODY></HTML>
