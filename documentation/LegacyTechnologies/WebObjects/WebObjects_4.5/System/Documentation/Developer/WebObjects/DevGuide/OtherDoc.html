It contains tutorials that teach the mechanics of creating a WebObjects application as well as the basic concepts behind WebObjects. <p></a><a name="4670">If you want to write an application that accesses a database, you'll need to use Enterprise Objects in conjunction with WebObjects. And although database access is covered in the tutorials in <em>Getting Started With WebObjects</em>, you'll probably also want to read the <em>Enterprise Objects Framework Developer's Guide</em> for more in-depth information. <p></a><a name="4593">Other valuable information can be found online.
