<h3> Starting Applications Using Monitor</h3>
</a><a name="4906">
To start up a WebObjects application in the Monitor, do the following:<p>
</a><ol>
<a name="4907">
<P><li>Locate the application in the list in the left frame of the browser window. 
</a><a name="4908">
<P><li>Click the inspector button to the left of the application name. 
</a><a name="4918">
<p><center><img src="ServingWebObjects2.anc9.gif"></center><p>
</a><a name="4919">
<P><li>Click the On/Off button located in the Instance Status field.
</a><a name="4932">

Monitor starts an instance of your application by creating a new task with the executable and any arguments you have set Monitor to use for that instance. Monitor starts your application in one of two ways, depending on whether the application is on a different host. <p>
</a><ul><a name="4934">
<p><li>If the application is on a different host, it tries to locate a running <strong>MonitorProxy</strong> on that host. If it finds a <strong>MonitorProxy</strong>, it passes the application arguments to it. If it can't find a <strong>MonitorProxy</strong>, it will fail to start the application.
</a><a name="4935">
<p><li>If the application is to run on the same host as the Monitor, Monitor looks for a <strong>MonitorProxy</strong> on its own machine. If a <strong>MonitorProxy</strong> is found, it passes any arguments to the <strong>MonitorProxy</strong> and uses it to start the application. If no <strong>MonitorProxy</strong> is found, Monitor starts your application itself. 
</a></ul><a name="4936">
<strong>Note:</strong> On Solaris and HP-UX platforms, Monitor cannot start applications itself. It must use the <strong>MonitorProxy</strong>, even if the application is on the local machine. <p>
</a><a name="4937">
To learn whether the application startup was successful, you must click the Refresh button at the top of the window. If the startup was successful, the On/Off button is set to On, and the application's name in the left frame has become a hyperlink. Why do you have to click the Refresh button? As soon as a WebObjects application starts up, it notifies the Monitor immediately, but the Monitor cannot refresh the web browser itself without a request from the web browser. <p>
</a><a name="4938">
If the button is not set to On, either the application did not get a chance to start before you refreshed the page display, or the application did not start because of an error. If the application has a very involved initialization, you may have to wait several seconds before clicking Refresh shows the application as running.<p>
</a><a name="4939">
This procedure starts an instance of the application but does not display it in the web browser. You can access an application instance by clicking the hyperlink in the left frame, but you are not guaranteed to get the instance that just started; if multiple instances are running, the adaptor performs load balancing to process your request. <p>
