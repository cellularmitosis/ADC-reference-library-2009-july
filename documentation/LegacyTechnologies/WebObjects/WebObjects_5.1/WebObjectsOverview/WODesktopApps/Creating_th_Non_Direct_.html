Ideally you providean application's entire user interface in a single Java applicationthat runs on the client. But you can also combine Java Client applets andstatic and dynamic (WebObjects) HTML elements in various ways. Youcan have pages with or without Java Client applets or pages withmultiple Java Client applets. For example, you could have a loginpage that takes the user to one of many Java Client pages basedon some piece of account data. In addition, Java Client appletsare not limited to the downloaded JFC components; as with any applet,they can create dialogs and secondary windows on the fly.</p><p>If your application's user interface uses static and dynamicallygenerated HTML, you create those parts of the user interface inthe normal way with WebObjects Builder (as described in  <a href="../WOHTML/HTML_Based_Applications.html#BGFCFBFE">"HTML-Based Applications"</a>).The process is different for creating a Java Client applicationor applet. Instead of using WebObjects Builder to create the user interface,you use an application called Interface Builder.</p><br><table border = "0" BGCOLOR="#E6E6E6"><tr><td scope="row"><b>Note: </b>Ifyou're familiar with Cocoa development, the process for creatinga Java Client user interface is nearly the same as the one for creatinga Cocoa user interface for Mac OS X applications.</td></tr></table><br><p>In Interface Builder, you typically construct a user interfaceby dragging widgets from a palette and dropping them into a window,as shown in  <a href="#BAJJFJDF">Figure 6-8</a>. It does more, however, than simple user interfacelayout. Interface Builder also lets you create, edit, and connect objectsso they can communicate with one another at runtime.</p><br><a name = "BAJJFJDF"></a><p><b><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">Figure6-8 Composing a user interface with InterfaceBuilder</font></b></p> <img src = "../Art/ibenvironment.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/ibenvironment.gif]"><br>    <br><a href="Designing_E_Java_Client.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/previous.gif" border="0"></a><a href="Customizing_t_Approach_.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/next.gif" border="0"></a>&nbsp;<br><br><p><hr><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">&#169; 2002 Apple Computer, Inc.
