/*
*	File:		SampleUSBAudioPlugin.cpp
*
*	Contains:	com_MySoftwareCompany_driver_SampleUSBAudioPlugin Implementation
*
*			A simple USB audio plug-in that performs a lowpass filtering operation on audio streamed
*			through the Griffin iMic. The target SampleUSBAudioPlugin.kext must be copied to the 
*			/System/Library/Extensions folder of the boot volume by an administrator using a 
*			command like (from the project folder):
*
*			sudo cp -rf ./build/SampleUSBAudioPlugin.kext /System/Library/Extensions
*
*           Then you must notify the operating system that the contents of the kernel extension directory has 
*           changed by "touching the directory":
*
*			sudo touch /System/Library/Extensions
*
*			Restart the system.
* 
*			After restarting the system, the plug-in should automatically load when the device
*			specified in the Info.plist is plugged in. Plug-in logging can be observed by viewing 
*			the system log using Console in /Applications/Utilities.
