<H1><CENTER><A NAME="REF95764">Standard Methods You May Want to Implement</A></CENTER></H1>                                                   
                                                                                       
 <P>Applications, sessions, and components define some common methods that you                
 may want to implement. These methods are invoked during initialization, deallocation, and the request-response loop. (The request-response loop is a WebObjects           
 application's main loop. It begins when the user generates a request by typing an         
 URL or clicking a button on the page. It ends when the application has processed          
 the request and generated a response page. One request-response loop cycle is             
 called a <I>transaction</I>.) The list below provides a brief description of when you want to implement these methods.                                                                  
<P><B>Important:</B> The chapter "<A HREF="../../DevGuide/RunLoop/RunLoop.book.html">Integrating Your Code Into the Request-Response Loop</A>"             
 in the <I>WebObjects Developer's Guide</I> provides full details on how to implement             
 these methods. Read it before you write any code.                                         
<DL>
<P><DT><B>init</B>                                                                                      
<DD>Initializes application variables, session variables, and any component variables that should persist as long as the component persists.                              
<P><DT><B>dealloc</B>                                                                                   
<DD>Deallocates all variables initialized in the <B>init</B> method.                                 
<P><DT><B>awake</B>                                                                                     
<DD>Initializes variables that need to be reinitialized at the top of the request-            
 response loop.                                                                            
<P><DT><B>sleep</B>                                                                                     
<DD>Sets to nil all variables that were initialized in the <B>awake</B> method.                      
<P><DT><B>takeValuesFromRequest:inContext:</B>                                                          
<DD>Invoked at the beginning of the request-response loop, right after the                    
 <B>awake</B> method. Use this method to perform any tasks that need to be performed before the action of the page but after the bindings have been synchronized. (Bindings are synchronized by calling the superclass,                          
 WOComponent, implementation of t<B>takeValuesFromRequest:inContext:</B> .)                         
<P><DT><B>invokeActionForRequest:inContext:</B>                                                         
<DD>Invoked when the component is about to perform an action based on user                    
 input. Use this method if you want to generate a different object for the                 
 response page than would normally be created.                                             
<P><DT><B>appendToResponse:inContext:</B>                                                               
<DD>Invoked right after the request page has generated the response page. Use                 
 this method if you want to append text to the response page.
