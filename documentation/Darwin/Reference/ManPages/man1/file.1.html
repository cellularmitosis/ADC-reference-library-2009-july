<b>NAME</b>
       file - determine file type

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>file</b>  [  <b>-bcdhikLnNprsvz</b>  ] [ <b>-f</b> <u>namefile</u> ] [ <b>-F</b> <u>separator</u> ] [ <b>-M</b> <u>magicfiles</u> ] [ <b>-m</b> <u>magicfiles</u> ] <u>file</u>
       ...
       <b>file</b> <b>-C</b> [ <b>-m</b> magicfile ]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       This manual page documents version 4.17 of the <b>file</b> command.

       <b>File</b> tests each argument in an attempt to classify it.  There are three sets of tests,  performed  in
       this  order:  filesystem tests, magic number tests, and language tests.  The <u>first</u> test that succeeds
       causes the file type to be printed.

       The type printed will usually contain one of the words <b>text</b> (the file contains only printing  charac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ters&nbsp;characters</font>
       ters  and  a  few  common control characters and is probably safe to read on an ASCII terminal), <b>exe</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cutable&nbsp;executable</font>
       <b>cutable</b> (the file contains the result of compiling a program in a form understandable  to  some  UNIX
       kernel  or  another),  or  <b>data</b>  meaning  anything  else (data is usually `binary' or non-printable).
       Exceptions are well-known file formats (core files, tar archives) that are known  to  contain  binary
       data.  When modifying the file <u>/usr/share/file/magic</u> or the program itself, <b>preserve</b> <b>these</b> <b>keywords</b> <b>.</b>
       People depend on knowing that all the readable files in a directory have the word  ``text''  printed.
       Don't  do as Berkeley did and change ``shell commands text'' to ``shell script''.  Note that the file
       <u>/usr/share/file/magic</u> is built mechanically from a large number of small files  in  the  subdirectory
       <u>Magdir</u> in the source distribution of this program.

       The  filesystem  tests  are  based  on  examining the return from a <a href="../man2/stat.2.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/2/stat"><b>stat</b>(2)</a> system call.  The program
       checks to see if the file is empty, or if it's some sort of  special  file.   Any  known  file  types
       appropriate  to  the  system  you  are running on (sockets, symbolic links, or named pipes (FIFOs) on
       those systems that implement them) are intuited if  they  are  defined  in  the  system  header  file
       <u>&lt;sys/stat.h&gt;</u>.

       The magic number tests are used to check for files with data in particular fixed formats.  The canon-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ical&nbsp;canonical</font>
       ical example of this is a binary executable (compiled program) <u>a.out</u> file, whose format is defined in
       <u>a.out.h</u>  and  possibly  <u>exec.h</u>  in the standard include directory.  These files have a `magic number'
       stored in a particular place near the beginning of the file that tells the UNIX operating system that
       the  file  is a binary executable, and which of several types thereof.  The concept of `magic number'
       has been applied by extension to data files.  Any file with some  invariant  identifier  at  a  small
       fixed  offset  into the file can usually be described in this way.  The information identifying these
       files is read from the compiled magic file <u>/usr/share/file/magic.mgc</u> <u>,</u>  or  <u>/usr/share/file/magic</u>  if
       the compile file does not exist. In addition <b>file</b> will look in <u>$HOME/.magic.mgc</u> <u>,</u> or <u>$HOME/.magic</u> for
       magic entries.

       If a file does not match any of the entries in the magic file, it is examined to see if it  seems  to
       be  a  text file.  ASCII, ISO-8859-x, non-ISO 8-bit extended-ASCII character sets (such as those used
       on Macintosh and IBM PC systems), UTF-8-encoded Unicode, UTF-16-encoded Unicode, and EBCDIC character
       sets  can  be  distinguished by the different ranges and sequences of bytes that constitute printable
       text in each set.  If a file passes any of these  tests,  its  character  set  is  reported.   ASCII,
       ISO-8859-x,  UTF-8,  and  extended-ASCII files are identified as ``text'' because they will be mostly
       readable on nearly any terminal; UTF-16 and EBCDIC are only ``character data''  because,  while  they
       contain text, it is text that will require translation before it can be read.  In addition, <b>file</b> will
       attempt to determine other characteristics of text-type files.  If the lines of a file are terminated
       by  CR,  CRLF,  or  NEL,  instead of the Unix-standard LF, this will be reported.  Files that contain
       embedded escape sequences or overstriking will also be identified.

       Once <b>file</b> has determined the character set used in a text-type file, it will attempt to determine  in
       what  language the file is written.  The language tests look for particular strings (cf <u>names.h</u>) that
       can appear anywhere in the first few blocks of a file.  For example, the keyword <b>.br</b>  indicates  that
       the  file  is  most  likely  a <a href="troff.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/troff"><b>troff</b>(1)</a> input file, just as the keyword <b>struct</b> indicates a C program.
       These tests are less reliable than the previous two groups, so they are performed last.  The language
       test routines also test for some miscellany (such as <a href="tar.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/tar"><b>tar</b>(1)</a> archives).

       Any  file  that cannot be identified as having been written in any of the character sets listed above
       is simply said to be ``data''.

<b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-b,</b> <b>--brief</b>
               Do not prepend filenames to output lines (brief mode).

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--checking-printout</b>
               Cause a checking printout of the parsed form of the magic file.  This is usually used in con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">junction&nbsp;conjunction</font>
               junction with <b>-m</b> to debug a new magic file before installing it.

       <b>-C,</b> <b>--compile</b>
               Write a magic.mgc output file that contains a pre-parsed version of file.

       <b>-f,</b> <b>--files-from</b> <u>namefile</u>
               Read  the  names of the files to be examined from <u>namefile</u> (one per line) before the argument
               list.  Either <u>namefile</u> or at least one filename argument must be present; to test  the  stan-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dard&nbsp;standard</font>
               dard input, use ``-'' as a filename argument.

       <b>-F,</b> <b>--separator</b> <u>separator</u>
               Use  the specified string as the separator between the filename and the file result returned.
               Defaults to ``:''.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--no-dereference</b>
               option causes symlinks not to be followed (on systems that support symbolic links).  This  is
               the default if the environment variable <u>POSIXLY</u><b>_</b><u>CORRECT</u> is not defined.

       <b>-I,</b> <b>--mime</b>
               Causes  the  file  command to output mime type strings rather than the more traditional human
               readable ones. Thus it may say ``text/plain; charset=us-ascii'' rather than  ``ASCII  text''.
               In  order  for  this  option to work, file changes the way it handles files recognised by the
               command itself (such as many of the text file types, directories etc), and makes  use  of  an
               alternative ``magic'' file.  (See ``FILES'' section, below).

       <b>-i</b>      If the file is a regular file do not classify its contents.

       <b>-k,</b> <b>--keep-going</b>
               Don't stop at the first match, keep going.

       <b>-L,</b> <b>--dereference</b>
               option  causes  symlinks  to  be followed, as the like-named option in <a href="ls.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ls"><b>ls</b>(1)</a> (on systems that
               support symbolic links).  This is the default if the environment variable <u>POSIXLY</u><b>_</b><u>CORRECT</u>  is
               defined.

       <b>-m,</b> <b>--magic-file</b> <u>list</u>
               Specify an alternate list of files containing magic numbers.  This can be a single file, or a
               colon-separated list of files.  If a compiled magic file is found alongside, it will be  used
               instead.  With the -I or --mime option, the program adds ".mime" to each file name.

       <b>-m</b> <u>list</u> Like -m, except the default rules are not applied.

       <b>-n,</b> <b>--no-buffer</b>
               Force  stdout to be flushed after checking each file.  This is only useful if checking a list
               of files.  It is intended to be used by programs that want filetype output from a pipe.

       <b>-d</b>      Apply default system tests, this is the default if neither -m nor -M are supplied.

       <b>-N,</b> <b>--no-pad</b>
               Don't pad filenames so that they align in the output.

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--preserve-date</b>
               On systems that support <!-- a --><b>utime</b>(2)<!-- /a --> or <a href="../man2/utimes.2.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/2/utimes"><b>utimes(2)</b></a><b>,</b> attempt to preserve the access time  of  files
               analyzed, to pretend that <!-- a --><b>file</b>(2)<!-- /a --> never read them.

       <b>-r,</b> <b>--raw</b>
               No operation, included for historical compatability.  <b>-s,</b> <b>--special-files</b> Normally, <b>file</b> only
               attempts to read and determine the type of argument files which <a href="../man2/stat.2.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/2/stat"><b>stat</b>(2)</a> reports are  ordinary
               files.  This prevents problems, because reading special files may have peculiar consequences.
               Specifying the <b>-s</b> option causes <b>file</b> to also read argument files which are block or character
               special  files.   This is useful for determining the filesystem types of the data in raw disk
               partitions, which are block special files.  This option also causes  <b>file</b>  to  disregard  the
               file  size  as  reported by <a href="../man2/stat.2.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/2/stat"><b>stat</b>(2)</a> since on some systems it reports a zero size for raw disk
               partitions.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--version</b>
               Print the version of the program and exit.

       <b>-z,</b> <b>--uncompress</b>
               Try to look inside compressed files.

       <b>--help</b>  Print a help message and exit.

<b>FILES</b>
       <u>/usr/share/file/magic.mgc</u>
              Default compiled list of magic numbers

       <u>/usr/share/file/magic</u>
              Default list of magic numbers

       <u>/usr/share/file/magic.mime.mgc</u>
              Default compiled list of magic numbers, used to output mime types when the -i option is speci-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fied.&nbsp;specified.</font>
              fied.

       <u>/usr/share/file/magic.mime</u>
              Default list of magic numbers, used to output mime types when the -i option is specified.


<b>ENVIRONMENT</b>
       The  environment variable <b>MAGIC</b> can be used to set the default magic number file name.  If that vari-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able&nbsp;variable</font>
       able is set, then <b>file</b> will not attempt to open <b>$HOME/.magic</b> <b>.</b>  <b>file</b> adds ".mime"  and/or  ".mgc"  to
       the  value  of  this  variable as appropriate.  The environment variable <b>POSIXLY_CORRECT</b> controls (on
       systems that support symbolic links), if <b>file</b> will attempt to follow symlinks or not.  If  set,  then
       <b>file</b> follows symlink, otherwise it does not. This is also controlled by the <b>L</b> and <b>h</b> options.

<b>LEGACY</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>file</b> [ <b>-bchikLnNprsvz</b> ] [ <b>-f</b> <u>namefile</u> ] [ <b>-F</b> <u>separator</u> ] [ <b>-m</b> <u>magicfiles</u> ] <u>file</u> ...
       <b>file</b> <b>-C</b> [ <b>-m</b> magicfile ]

<b>LEGACY</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       As above, except:

       <b>-i,</b> <b>--mime</b>
               Causes  the  file  command to output mime type strings rather than the more traditional human
               readable ones. Thus it may say ``text/plain; charset=us-ascii'' rather than  ``ASCII  text''.
               In  order  for  this  option to work, file changes the way it handles files recognised by the
               command itself (such as many of the text file types, directories etc), and makes  use  of  an
               alternative ``magic'' file.  (See ``FILES'' section, below).

       <b>-r,</b> <b>--raw</b>
               Don't translate unprintable characters to \ooo.  Normally <b>file</b> translates unprintable charac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ters&nbsp;characters</font>
               ters to their octal representation.

<b>STANDARDS</b> <b>CONFORMANCE</b>
       This  program  conforms  to  Its behaviour is mostly compatible with the System V program of the same
       name.  This version knows more magic, however, so it will produce different  (albeit  more  accurate)
       output in many cases.

       The  one  significant  difference  between  this version and System V is that this version treats any
       white space as a delimiter, so that spaces in pattern strings must be escaped.  For example,
       &gt;10  string    language impress    (imPRESS data)
       in an existing magic file would have to be changed to
       &gt;10  string    language\ impress   (imPRESS data)
       In addition, in this version, if a pattern string contains a backslash,  it  must  be  escaped.   For
       example
       0    string         \begindata     Andrew Toolkit document
       in an existing magic file would have to be changed to
       0    string         \\begindata    Andrew Toolkit document

       SunOS  releases 3.2 and later from Sun Microsystems include a <b>file</b>(1) command derived from the System
       V one, but with some extensions.  My version differs from Sun's only in minor ways.  It includes  the
       extension of the `&amp;' operator, used as, for example,
       &gt;16  long&amp;0x7fffffff     &gt;0        not stripped

<b>MAGIC</b> <b>DIRECTORY</b>
       The  magic  file  entries have been collected from various sources, mainly USENET, and contributed by
       various authors.  Christos Zoulas (address below) will collect additional  or  corrected  magic  file
       entries.  A consolidation of magic file entries will be distributed periodically.

       The  order  of entries in the magic file is significant.  Depending on what system you are using, the
       order that they are put together may be incorrect.  If your old <b>file</b> command uses a magic file,  keep
       the old magic file around for comparison purposes (rename it to <u>/usr/share/file/magic.orig</u>).

<b>EXAMPLES</b>
       $ file file.c file /dev/{wd0a,hda}
       file.c:   C program text
       file:     ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV),

<b>HISTORY</b>
       There  has been a <b>file</b> command in every UNIX since at least Research Version 4 (man page dated Novem-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ber,&nbsp;November,</font>
       ber, 1973).  The System V version introduced one significant major change: the external list of magic
       number types.  This slowed the program down slightly but made it a lot more flexible.

       This  program,  based  on the System V version, was written by Ian Darwin &lt;ian@darwinsys.com&gt; without
       looking at anybody else's source code.

       John Gilmore revised the code extensively, making it better than the first  version.   Geoff  Collyer

<b>BUGS</b>
       There must be a better way to automate the construction of the  Magic  file  from  all  the  glop  in
       magdir.   What  is  it?   Better yet, the magic file should be compiled into binary (say, <!-- a --><b>ndbm</b>(3)<!-- /a --> or,
       better yet, fixed-length ASCII strings for use  in  heterogenous  network  environments)  for  faster
       startup.   Then  the  program  would  run as fast as the Version 7 program of the same name, with the
       flexibility of the System V version.

       <b>File</b> uses several algorithms that favor speed over accuracy, thus it can be misled about the contents
       of text files.

       The  support  for  text  files  (primarily  for programming languages) is simplistic, inefficient and
       requires recompilation to update.

       There should be an ``else'' clause to follow a series of continuation lines.

       The magic file and keywords should have regular expression support.  Their use  of  ASCII  TAB  as  a
       field delimiter is ugly and makes it hard to edit the files, but is entrenched.

       It might be advisable to allow upper-case letters in keywords for e.g., <a href="troff.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/troff"><b>troff</b>(1)</a> commands vs man page
       macros.  Regular expression support would make this easy.

       The program doesn't grok FORTRAN.  It should be able to figure FORTRAN by seeing some keywords  which
       appear indented at the start of line.  Regular expression support would make this easy.

       The  list  of  keywords  in <u>ascmagic</u> probably belongs in the Magic file.  This could be done by using
       some keyword like `*' for the offset value.

       Another optimisation would be to sort the magic file so that we can just run down all the  tests  for
       the  first  byte,  first word, first long, etc, once we have fetched it.  Complain about conflicts in
       the magic file entries.  Make a rule that the magic entries sort based on  file  offset  rather  than
       position within the magic file?

       The  program should provide a way to give an estimate of ``how good'' a guess is.  We end up removing
       guesses (e.g. ``From '' as first 5 chars of file) because they are not as good as other guesses (e.g.
       ``Newsgroups:''  versus ``Return-Path:'').  Still, if the others don't pan out, it should be possible
       to use the first guess.

       This program is slower than some vendors' file commands.  The  new  support  for  multiple  character
       codes makes it even slower.

       This manual page, and particularly this section, is too long.
