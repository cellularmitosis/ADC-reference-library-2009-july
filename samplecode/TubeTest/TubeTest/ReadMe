Read Me About...TubeTestdate 08/2000The TubeTest program is a simple demonstration of how to use the Palette Manager in a color program.  It has a special color palette that is associated with the main window.  The colors are animated using the Palette Manager to give a flowing tube effect.  The program is very simple, and the Palette Manager and drawing parts are put in separate subroutines to make it easier to figure out what is happening.Best run in 256 color mode.Building the CodeThis project was built and tested on CodeWarrior 2.1 using CarbonLib 1.1a3.  Since this is a Carbon app, the "Carbon Support" folder of the CarbonSDK should be in the same folder as the CodeWarrior IDE.  If this is not the case, the CarbonLib library will have to be re-added to the project.  In addition, the CarbonLib extension needs to be in the extension folder.  The CarbonSDK (which contains the library and the extension) can be found on Apple's website:  http://developer.apple.com/sdk/RestrictionsNearly every sample requires more memory than the 384KB CodeWarrior sets as the default heap size.  If for some reason the memory has been reset to the default (either through converting the project or whatever) the memory should be reset to 1000 - 2000KB (depending on the application).  This can be achieved by going to the projects settings (Edit Menu->C-PPC Settings... under CodeWarrior 2.1) and selecting the "PPC Target" under the "Target" tab.Other Code NotesThis sample used to be a "non-Carbon" sample, but has been carbonized for demonstration purposes.  The "old" code has been left in (commented out) in order to compare and contrast the Carbon versus non-Carbon APIs.Known BugsNo known bugs.Possible Future EnhancementsNone at present.Other Sources of ReferenceAdditional sample code can be found at:http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/in addition, the Carbon API can be found at:http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/carbon/carbon.htmlVersion HistorySee source for version history.AuthorJM - Apple Developer Technical Support - dts@apple.com
