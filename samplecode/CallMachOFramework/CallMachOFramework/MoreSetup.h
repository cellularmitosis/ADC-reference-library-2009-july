Normally 	//	you would define this in terms of the various TARGET_xxx	//	variables defined in <ConditionalMacros.h>.  However, you 	//	can't include <ConditionalMacros.h> until you know 	//	whether you're supposed to be using framework includes or 	//	not.  So, we have to pull this conditional out of thin 	//	air.  Right now the best way to do this is with the 	//	__MACH__ compiler variable.	//#if defined(__MACH__)	#define MORE_FRAMEWORK_INCLUDES 1#else	#define MORE_FRAMEWORK_INCLUDES 0#endif	//	//	The next statement sets up the various TARGET_xxx 	//	variables needed later in this file.  In the framework 	//	include case we just include <Carbon/Carbon.h>, which 	//	brings everything in, including <ConditionalMacros.h>.	//	In the non-framework include case we just bring in the 	//	specific file.	//	#if MORE_FRAMEWORK_INCLUDES	//	//	This define works around a problem in <CoreFoundation/CFBase.h>	//	in Mac OS X 10.1.  CF is assuming that the CW Mach-O compiler 	//	would not use framework includes, which is not the case for the 	//	CWPro7 compiler.  We only do this for the CW build because     //	otherwise the presence of the define prevents Project Builder     //	from using Carbon's precompiled header.	//		#if defined(__MWERKS__)	    #define __CF_USE_FRAMEWORK_INCLUDES__ 1	#endif	#include <Carbon/Carbon.h>#else	#include <ConditionalMacros.h>#endif		// 	//	Previouly we would bring in <MacErrors.h> at this point.	//	However, that's somewhat counter to the idea behind flat 	//	includes, so I've eliminated it.	//	//	//	Now that we've included a Mac OS interface file,	//	we know that the Universal Interfaces environment	//	is set up.
