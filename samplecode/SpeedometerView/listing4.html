This sample illustrates how to make a custom NSView that does some drawing and
responds to mouse clicks.  The SpeedometerView class is a subclass of NSView and
it is defined in the files SpeedometerView.h and SpeedomenterView.m.  The files
SpeedyCategories.h and SpeedyCategories.m define some helper categories that are
used by the view.  



To use this custom NSView in a project of your own, follow these steps:


1. Add the files defining the custom view to your project in Xcode.  In this
case, we add the files SpeedometerView.h, SpeedomenterView.m,
SpeedyCategories.h, SpeedyCategories.m to our project.


2. Open the nib file in interface builder where you would like to use the
custom view.


3. Next, register the custom view with Interface Builder.  To do that, drag and
drop the .h file containing the custom view into the nib file's window in
Interface builder.  In this case, we drag the file SpeedometerView.h in Xcode
into the MainMenu.nib file's window in Interface Builder.


4. Drag a CustomView from the Cocoa-Containers palette into a window.  


5. Select the CustomView in the window and open the inspector to display the
Custom Class panel.


6. In the Custom Class panel in the inspector, select the name of your custom
NSView class.  In this case, we have selected 'SpeedometerView' as our custom
class.


These same steps can be used to add your own custom NSViews into your
application's windows.


This sample uses bindings to manage most of its user interface.  As such, there
is no code in the project for maintaining these items.  Here is a summary of the
bindings that are in place:


1. The ticks slider's value has a binding to the custom view's ticks value. 
The slider's attributes are set to continually update as the value is changed.  

2. The curve slider is bound the custom view's curvature value.  The slider's
attributes are set to continually update as the value is changed.

3. The speed slider is bound to the custom view's speed value.  The slider's
attributes are set to continually update as the value is changed. 

4. The little progress indicator is bound to the draggingIndicator value on the
custom view.  The little indicator shows up while the speedometer pointer is
being dragged.
