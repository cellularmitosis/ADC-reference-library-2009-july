<b>NAME</b>
       wm - Communicate with window manager

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>wm</b> <u>option</u> <u>window</u> ?<u>args</u>?
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________


<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  <b>wm</b> command is used to interact with window managers in order to control such things as the title
       for a window, its geometry, or the increments in terms of which it may be resized.   The  <b>wm</b>  command
       can  take  any  of  a  number of different forms, depending on the <u>option</u> argument.  All of the forms
       expect at least one additional argument, <u>window</u>, which must be the path name of a top-level window.

       The legal forms for the <b>wm</b> command are:

       <b>wm</b> <b>aspect</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>minNumer</u> <u>minDenom</u> <u>maxNumer</u> <u>maxDenom</u>?
              If <u>minNumer</u>, <u>minDenom</u>, <u>maxNumer</u>, and <u>maxDenom</u> are all specified, then they will be  passed  to
              the  window  manager  and  the window manager should use them to enforce a range of acceptable
              aspect ratios for <u>window</u>.  The aspect ratio of <u>window</u> (width/length) will  be  constrained  to
              lie  between  <u>minNumer</u>/<u>minDenom</u>  and <u>maxNumer</u>/<u>maxDenom</u>.  If <u>minNumer</u> etc. are all specified as
              empty strings, then any existing aspect ratio restrictions are removed.  If <u>minNumer</u> etc.  are
              specified,  then  the  command returns an empty string.  Otherwise, it returns a Tcl list con-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">taining&nbsp;containing</font>
              taining four elements, which are the current values of <u>minNumer</u>, <u>minDenom</u>, <u>maxNumer</u>, and  <u>max</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">Denom&nbsp;maxDenom</font>
              <u>Denom</u> (if no aspect restrictions are in effect, then an empty string is returned).             |

       <b>wm</b> <b>attributes</b> <u>win-</u>                                                                                    |
       <u>dow</u>                                                                                  |                |

       <b>wm</b> <b>attributes</b> <u>window</u>                                                                                  |
       ?<b>option</b>?                                                                         |                    |

       <b>wm</b> <b>attributes</b> <u>window</u> ?<b>option</b> <b>value</b> <b>option</b>                                                             |
       <b>value...</b>?                                                   |                                         |
              This subcommand returns or sets platform specific attributes associated  with  a  window.  The |
              first  form  returns  a  list of the platform specific flags and their values. The second form |
              returns the value for the specific option. The third form sets one or more of the values.  The |
              values are as follows:                                                                         |

              On Windows, <b>-disabled</b> gets or sets whether the window is in a disabled state. <b>-toolwindow</b> gets |
              or sets the style of the window to toolwindow (as defined in the MSDN). <b>-topmost</b> gets or  sets |
              whether this is a topmost window (displays above all other windows).                           |

              On Macintosh,                                                                                  |

              On Unix, there are currently no special attribute values.                                      |

       <b>wm</b> <b>client</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>name</u>?
              If  <u>name</u> is specified, this command stores <u>name</u> (which should be the name of the host on which
              the application is executing) in <u>window</u>'s <b>WM_CLIENT_MACHINE</b> property for  use  by  the  window
              manager  or session manager.  The command returns an empty string in this case.  If <u>name</u> isn't
              specified, the command returns the last name set in a <b>wm</b> <b>client</b> command for <u>window</u>.   If  <u>name</u>
              is  specified as an empty string, the command deletes the <b>WM_CLIENT_MACHINE</b> property from <u>win</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dow.&nbsp;window.</font>
              <u>dow</u>.

       <b>wm</b> <b>colormapwindows</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>windowList</u>?
              This command is used to manipulate the <b>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</b> property, which  provides  informa-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;information</font>
              tion  to  the  window managers about windows that have private colormaps.  If <u>windowList</u> isn't
              specified, the command returns a list whose elements are the  names  of  the  windows  in  the
              <b>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</b>  property.   If  <u>windowList</u>  is specified, it consists of a list of window
              path names;  the command overwrites the <b>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</b> property with  the  given  windows
              and  returns an empty string.  The <b>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</b> property should normally contain a list
              of the internal windows within <u>window</u> whose colormaps differ from their parents.  The order of
              the  windows  in  the  property indicates a priority order: the window manager will attempt to
              install as many colormaps as possible from the head of this list when <u>window</u> gets the colormap
              focus.   If  <u>window</u>  is not included among the windows in <u>windowList</u>, Tk implicitly adds it at
              the end of the <b>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</b> property, so that its colormap is lowest in  priority.   If
              <b>wm</b>  <b>colormapwindows</b>  is not invoked, Tk will automatically set the property for each top-level
              window to all the internal windows whose colormaps differ from their parents, followed by  the
              top-level  itself;   the order of the internal windows is undefined.  See the ICCCM documenta-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;documentation</font>
              tion for more information on the <b>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</b> property.

       <b>wm</b> <b>command</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>value</u>?
              If <u>value</u> is specified, this command stores <u>value</u> in <u>window</u>'s <b>WM_COMMAND</b> property  for  use  by
              the  window  manager  or  session manager and returns an empty string.  <u>Value</u> must have proper
              list structure;  the elements should contain the words of  the  command  used  to  invoke  the
              application.   If  <u>value</u>  isn't  specified then the command returns the last value set in a <b>wm</b>
              <b>command</b> command for <u>window</u>.  If <u>value</u> is specified as an empty string, the command deletes the
              <b>WM_COMMAND</b> property from <u>window</u>.

       <b>wm</b> <b>deiconify</b> <u>window</u>
              Arrange  for  <u>window</u>  to be displayed in normal (non-iconified) form.  This is done by mapping
              the window.  If the window has never been mapped then this command will not  map  the  window,
              but  it  will ensure that when the window is first mapped it will be displayed in de-iconified
              form.  On Windows, a deiconified window will also be raised and be given the focus  (made  the
              active window).  Returns an empty string.

       <b>wm</b> <b>focusmodel</b> <u>window</u> ?<b>active</b>|<b>passive</b>?
              If <b>active</b> or <b>passive</b> is supplied as an optional argument to the command, then it specifies the
              focus model for <u>window</u>.  In this case the command returns an empty string.  If  no  additional
              argument  is supplied, then the command returns the current focus model for <u>window</u>.  An <b>active</b>
              focus model means that <u>window</u> will claim the input focus for itself or its  descendants,  even
              at  times  when  the  focus is currently in some other application.  <b>Passive</b> means that <u>window</u>
              will never claim the focus for itself:  the window manager should give the focus to <u>window</u>  at
              appropriate  times.   However,  once  the focus has been given to <u>window</u> or one of its descen-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dants,&nbsp;descendants,</font>
              dants, the application may re-assign the focus among <u>window</u>'s descendants.   The  focus  model
              defaults to <b>passive</b>, and Tk's <b>focus</b> command assumes a passive model of focusing.

       <b>wm</b> <b>frame</b> <u>window</u>
              If  <u>window</u>  has  been  reparented  by  the window manager into a decorative frame, the command |
              returns the platform specific window identifier for the outermost frame that  contains  <u>window</u> |
              (the  window  whose  parent is the root or virtual root).  If <u>window</u> hasn't been reparented by |
              the window manager then the command returns the platform specific window identifier  for  <u>win-</u> |
              <u>dow</u>.

       <b>wm</b> <b>geometry</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>newGeometry</u>?
              If  <u>newGeometry</u>  is  specified,  then the geometry of <u>window</u> is changed and an empty string is
              returned.  Otherwise the current geometry for <u>window</u> is returned  (this  is  the  most  recent
              geometry  specified  either  by manual resizing or in a <b>wm</b> <b>geometry</b> command).  <u>NewGeometry</u> has
              the form <b>=</b><u>width</u><b>x</b><u>height</u><b>+-</b><u>x</u><b>+-</b><u>y</u>, where any of <b>=</b>, <u>width</u><b>x</b><u>height</u>, or <b>+-</b><u>x</u><b>+-</b><u>y</u> may be  omitted.   <u>Width</u>
              and  <u>height</u>  are  positive integers specifying the desired dimensions of <u>window</u>.  If <u>window</u> is
              gridded (see GRIDDED GEOMETRY MANAGEMENT below) then the  dimensions  are  specified  in  grid
              units;   otherwise they are specified in pixel units.  <u>X</u> and <u>y</u> specify the desired location of
              <u>window</u> on the screen, in pixels.  If <u>x</u> is preceded by <b>+</b>, it specifies  the  number  of  pixels
              between  the  left  edge of the screen and the left edge of <u>window</u>'s border;  if preceded by <b></b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">then&nbsp;bythen</font>
              then <u>x</u> specifies the number of pixels between the right edge of the screen and the right  edge
              of  <u>window</u>'s border.  If <u>y</u> is preceded by <b>+</b> then it specifies the number of pixels between the
              top of the screen and the top of <u>window</u>'s border;  if <u>y</u> is preceded by <b>-</b> then it specifies the
              number  of pixels between the bottom of <u>window</u>'s border and the bottom of the screen.  If <u>new</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">Geometry&nbsp;newGeometry</font>
              <u>Geometry</u> is specified as an empty string then any existing user-specified geometry for  <u>window</u>
              is cancelled, and the window will revert to the size requested internally by its widgets.

       <b>wm</b> <b>grid</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>baseWidth</u> <u>baseHeight</u> <u>widthInc</u> <u>heightInc</u>?
              This  command  indicates  that <u>window</u> is to be managed as a gridded window.  It also specifies
              the relationship between grid units and pixel units.  <u>BaseWidth</u>  and  <u>baseHeight</u>  specify  the
              number  of  grid  units  corresponding  to the pixel dimensions requested internally by <u>window</u>
              using <b>Tk_GeometryRequest</b>.  <u>WidthInc</u> and <u>heightInc</u> specify the number of pixels in  each  hori-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">zontal&nbsp;horizontal</font>
              zontal  and  vertical  grid unit.  These four values determine a range of acceptable sizes for
              <u>window</u>, corresponding to grid-based widths and heights that  are  non-negative  integers.   Tk
              will  pass this information to the window manager;  during manual resizing, the window manager
              will restrict the window's size to one of these acceptable sizes.  Furthermore, during  manual
              resizing  the  window  manager  will  display the window's current size in terms of grid units
              rather than pixels.  If <u>baseWidth</u> etc. are all specified as empty strings, then <u>window</u> will no
              longer  be managed as a gridded window.  If <u>baseWidth</u> etc. are specified then the return value
              is an empty string.  Otherwise the return value is a Tcl list containing four elements  corre-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sponding&nbsp;corresponding</font>
              sponding to the current <u>baseWidth</u>, <u>baseHeight</u>, <u>widthInc</u>, and <u>heightInc</u>;  if <u>window</u> is not cur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rently&nbsp;currently</font>
              rently gridded, then an empty string is returned.  Note: this command  should  not  be  needed
              very  often,  since  the  <b>Tk_SetGrid</b>  library  procedure and the <b>setGrid</b> option provide easier
              access to the same functionality.

       <b>wm</b> <b>group</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>pathName</u>?
              If <u>pathName</u> is specified, it gives the path name for the leader of a group of related windows.
              The  window  manager  may  use this information, for example, to unmap all of the windows in a
              group when the group's leader is iconified.  <u>PathName</u> may be specified as an empty  string  to
              remove  <u>window</u>  from any group association.  If <u>pathName</u> is specified then the command returns
              an empty string;  otherwise it returns the path name of <u>window</u>'s current group leader,  or  an
              empty string if <u>window</u> isn't part of any group.

       <b>wm</b> <b>iconbitmap</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>bitmap</u>?
              If  <u>bitmap</u>  is specified, then it names a bitmap in the standard forms accepted by Tk (see the
              <b>Tk_GetBitmap</b> manual entry for details).  This bitmap is passed to the  window  manager  to  be
              displayed  in  <u>window</u>'s  icon, and the command returns an empty string.  If an empty string is
              specified for <u>bitmap</u>, then any current icon bitmap is cancelled  for  <u>window</u>.   If  <u>bitmap</u>  is
              specified then the command returns an empty string.  Otherwise it returns the name of the cur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rent&nbsp;current</font>
              rent icon bitmap associated with <u>window</u>, or an empty string if <u>window</u> has no icon bitmap.   On
              the Windows operating system, an additional flag is supported: <b>wm</b> <b>iconbitmap</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>-default</u>?
              ?<u>image</u>?.  If the <u>-default</u> flag is given, the icon is applied to all toplevel windows (existing
              and future) to which no other specific icon has yet been applied.  In addition to bitmap image
              types, a full path specification to any file which contains  a  valid  Windows  icon  is  also
              accepted  (usually  .ico or .icr files), or any file for which the shell has assigned an icon.
              Tcl will first test if the file contains an icon,  then  if  it  has  an  assigned  icon,  and
              finally, if that fails, test for a bitmap.

       <b>wm</b> <b>iconify</b> <u>window</u>
              Arrange for <u>window</u> to be iconified.  It <u>window</u> hasn't yet been mapped for the first time, this
              command will arrange for it to appear in the iconified state when it is eventually mapped.

       <b>wm</b> <b>iconmask</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>bitmap</u>?
              If <u>bitmap</u> is specified, then it names a bitmap in the standard forms accepted by Tk  (see  the
              <b>Tk_GetBitmap</b>  manual  entry  for  details).  This bitmap is passed to the window manager to be
              used as a mask in conjunction with the <b>iconbitmap</b> option:  where the mask has zeroes  no  icon
              will be displayed;  where it has ones, the bits from the icon bitmap will be displayed.  If an
              empty string is specified for <u>bitmap</u> then any current icon mask is cancelled for <u>window</u>  (this
              is  equivalent  to  specifying a bitmap of all ones).  If <u>bitmap</u> is specified then the command
              returns an empty string.  Otherwise it returns the name of the current  icon  mask  associated
              with <u>window</u>, or an empty string if no mask is in effect.

       <b>wm</b> <b>iconname</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>newName</u>?
              If  <u>newName</u>  is specified, then it is passed to the window manager;  the window manager should
              display <u>newName</u> inside the icon associated with <u>window</u>.  In  this  case  an  empty  string  is
              returned as result.  If <u>newName</u> isn't specified then the command returns the current icon name
              for <u>window</u>, or an empty string if no icon name has been specified (in  this  case  the  window
              manager will normally display the window's title, as specified with the <b>wm</b> <b>title</b> command).

       <b>wm</b> <b>iconposition</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>x</u> <u>y</u>?
              If <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> are specified, they are passed to the window manager as a hint about where to posi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;position</font>
              tion the icon for <u>window</u>.  In this case an empty string is returned.  If <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> are specified
              as  empty  strings  then  any existing icon position hint is cancelled.  If neither <u>x</u> nor <u>y</u> is
              specified, then the command returns a Tcl list containing two values, which  are  the  current
              icon position hints (if no hints are in effect then an empty string is returned).

       <b>wm</b> <b>iconwindow</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>pathName</u>?
              If  <u>pathName</u>  is  specified,  it is the path name for a window to use as icon for <u>window</u>: when
              <u>window</u> is iconified then <u>pathName</u> will be mapped to serve as icon,  and  when  <u>window</u>  is  de-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">iconified&nbsp;deiconified</font>
              iconified  then  <u>pathName</u> will be unmapped again.  If <u>pathName</u> is specified as an empty string
              then any existing icon window association for <u>window</u> will be cancelled.  If the <u>pathName</u> argu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment&nbsp;argument</font>
              ment  is  specified  then an empty string is returned.  Otherwise the command returns the path
              name of the current icon window for <u>window</u>, or an empty string if there is no icon window cur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rently&nbsp;currently</font>
              rently  specified for <u>window</u>.  Button press events are disabled for <u>window</u> as long as it is an
              icon window;  this is needed in order to allow window managers to ``own'' those events.  Note:
              not all window managers support the notion of an icon window.

       <b>wm</b> <b>maxsize</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>width</u> <u>height</u>?
              If  <u>width</u>  and  <u>height</u> are specified, they give the maximum permissible dimensions for <u>window</u>.
              For gridded windows the dimensions are specified in grid units;  otherwise they are  specified
              in  pixel  units.  The window manager will restrict the window's dimensions to be less than or
              equal to <u>width</u> and <u>height</u>.  If <u>width</u> and <u>height</u> are specified, then  the  command  returns  an
              empty  string.  Otherwise it returns a Tcl list with two elements, which are the maximum width
              and height currently in effect.  The maximum size defaults to the  size  of  the  screen.   If
              resizing  has  been  disabled  with the <b>wm</b> <b>resizable</b> command, then this command has no effect.
              See the sections on geometry management below for more information.

       <b>wm</b> <b>minsize</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>width</u> <u>height</u>?
              If <u>width</u> and <u>height</u> are specified, they give the minimum permissible  dimensions  for  <u>window</u>.
              For  gridded windows the dimensions are specified in grid units;  otherwise they are specified
              in pixel units.  The window manager will restrict the window's dimensions to be  greater  than
              or  equal to <u>width</u> and <u>height</u>.  If <u>width</u> and <u>height</u> are specified, then the command returns an
              empty string.  Otherwise it returns a Tcl list with two elements, which are the minimum  width
              and height currently in effect.  The minimum size defaults to one pixel in each dimension.  If
              resizing has been disabled with the <b>wm</b> <b>resizable</b> command, then this  command  has  no  effect.
              See the sections on geometry management below for more information.

       <b>wm</b> <b>overrideredirect</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>boolean</u>?
              If <u>boolean</u> is specified, it must have a proper boolean form and the override-redirect flag for
              <u>window</u> is set to that value.  If <u>boolean</u> is not specified then <b>1</b> or <b>0</b> is returned to  indicate
              whether  or not the override-redirect flag is currently set for <u>window</u>.  Setting the override-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">redirect&nbsp;overrideredirect</font>
              redirect flag for a window causes it to be ignored by the window manager;  among other things,
              this means that the window will not be reparented from the root window into a decorative frame
              and the user will not be able to manipulate the window using the normal window manager  mecha-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nisms.&nbsp;mechanisms.</font>
              nisms.

       <b>wm</b> <b>positionfrom</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>who</u>?
              If  <u>who</u>  is  specified,  it must be either <b>program</b> or <b>user</b>, or an abbreviation of one of these
              two.  It indicates whether <u>window</u>'s current position was requested by the program  or  by  the
              user.   Many  window  managers  ignore program-requested initial positions and ask the user to
              manually position the window;  if <b>user</b> is specified then the window  manager  should  position
              the  window at the given place without asking the user for assistance.  If <u>who</u> is specified as
              an empty string, then the current position source is cancelled.  If <u>who</u> is specified, then the
              command  returns an empty string.  Otherwise it returns <b>user</b> or <b>program</b> to indicate the source
              of the window's current position, or an empty string if no  source  has  been  specified  yet.
              Most  window managers interpret ``no source'' as equivalent to <b>program</b>.  Tk will automatically
              set the position source to <b>user</b> when a <b>wm</b> <b>geometry</b> command is invoked, unless the  source  has
              been set explicitly to <b>program</b>.

       <b>wm</b> <b>protocol</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>name</u>? ?<u>command</u>?
              This command is used to manage window manager protocols such as <b>WM_DELETE_WINDOW</b>.  <u>Name</u> is the
              name of an atom corresponding to a  window  manager  protocol,  such  as  <b>WM_DELETE_WINDOW</b>  or
              <b>WM_SAVE_YOURSELF</b>  or  <b>WM_TAKE_FOCUS</b>.   If both <u>name</u> and <u>command</u> are specified, then <u>command</u> is
              associated with the protocol specified by <u>name</u>.  <u>Name</u> will be added to  <u>window</u>'s  <b>WM_PROTOCOLS</b>
              property  to tell the window manager that the application has a protocol handler for <u>name</u>, and
              <u>command</u> will be invoked in the future whenever the window  manager  sends  a  message  to  the
              client for that protocol.  In this case the command returns an empty string.  If <u>name</u> is spec-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ified&nbsp;specified</font>
              ified but <u>command</u> isn't, then the current command for <u>name</u> is returned, or an empty string  if
              there  is  no  handler  defined for <u>name</u>.  If <u>command</u> is specified as an empty string then the
              current handler for <u>name</u> is deleted and it is removed from the <b>WM_PROTOCOLS</b> property  on  <u>win</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dow;&nbsp;window;</font>
              <u>dow</u>;  an empty string is returned.  Lastly, if neither <u>name</u> nor <u>command</u> is specified, the com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
              mand returns a list of all the protocols for which handlers are currently defined for  <u>window</u>.

              Tk  always  defines a protocol handler for <b>WM_DELETE_WINDOW</b>, even if you haven't asked for one
              with <b>wm</b> <b>protocol</b>.  If a <b>WM_DELETE_WINDOW</b> message arrives when you haven't defined  a  handler,
              then Tk handles the message by destroying the window for which it was received.

       <b>wm</b> <b>resizable</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>width</u> <u>height</u>?
              This command controls whether or not the user may interactively resize a top-level window.  If
              <u>width</u> and <u>height</u> are specified, they are boolean values that determine whether the  width  and
              height  of  <u>window</u>  may  be  modified  by the user.  In this case the command returns an empty
              string.  If <u>width</u> and <u>height</u> are omitted then the command returns a list with two 0/1 elements
              that  indicate  whether  the  width and height of <u>window</u> are currently resizable.  By default,
              windows are resizable in both dimensions.  If resizing is disabled,  then  the  window's  size
              will be the size from the most recent interactive resize or <b>wm</b> <b>geometry</b> command.  If there has
              been no such operation then the window's natural size will be used.

       <b>wm</b> <b>sizefrom</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>who</u>?
              If <u>who</u> is specified, it must be either <b>program</b> or <b>user</b>, or an abbreviation  of  one  of  these
              two.   It indicates whether <u>window</u>'s current size was requested by the program or by the user.
              Some window managers ignore program-requested sizes and ask the user to manually size the win-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dow;&nbsp;window;</font>
              dow;   if  <b>user</b> is specified then the window manager should give the window its specified size
              without asking the user for assistance.  If <u>who</u> is specified as an empty string, then the cur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rent&nbsp;current</font>
              rent size source is cancelled.  If <u>who</u> is specified, then the command returns an empty string.
              Otherwise it returns <b>user</b> or <b>window</b> to indicate the source of the window's current size, or an
              empty  string  if  no  source  has  been  specified  yet.  Most window managers interpret ``no
              source'' as equivalent to <b>program</b>.

       <b>wm</b> <b>stackorder</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>isabove|isbelow</u> <u>window</u>?
              The stackorder command returns a list of toplevel windows in stacking order,  from  lowest  to
              highest.  When  a single toplevel window is passed, the returned list recursively includes all
              of the window's children that are toplevels. Only those toplevels that are currently mapped to
              the screen are returned.  The stackorder command can also be used to determine if one toplevel
              is positioned above or below a second toplevel.  When two window arguments separated by either
              <u>isabove</u>  or  <u>isbelow</u> are passed, a boolean result indicates whether or not the first window is
              currently above or below the second window in the stacking order.

       <b>wm</b> <b>state</b> <u>window</u> ?newstate?
              If <u>newstate</u> is specified, the window will be set to the new state, otherwise  it  returns  the
              current  state  of  <u>window</u>:  either <b>normal</b>, <b>iconic</b>, <b>withdrawn</b>, <b>icon</b>, or (Windows only) <b>zoomed</b>.
              The difference between <b>iconic</b> and <b>icon</b> is that <b>iconic</b> refers to a window that has been  iconi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fied&nbsp;iconified</font>
              fied  (e.g.,  with the <b>wm</b> <b>iconify</b> command) while <b>icon</b> refers to a window whose only purpose is
              to serve as the icon for some other window (via the <b>wm</b> <b>iconwindow</b> command).   The  <b>icon</b>  state
              cannot be set.

       <b>wm</b> <b>title</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>string</u>?
              If  <u>string</u> is specified, then it will be passed to the window manager for use as the title for
              <u>window</u> (the window manager should display this string in <u>window</u>'s title bar).   In  this  case
              the  command  returns an empty string.  If <u>string</u> isn't specified then the command returns the
              current title for the <u>window</u>.  The title for a window defaults to its name.

       <b>wm</b> <b>transient</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>master</u>?
              If <u>master</u> is specified, then the window manager is informed that <u>window</u> is a transient  window
              (e.g.  pull-down  menu)  working on behalf of <u>master</u> (where <u>master</u> is the path name for a top-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">level&nbsp;toplevel</font>
              level window).  If <u>master</u> is specified as an empty string then <u>window</u> is marked as not being a
              transient  window  any  more.  Otherwise the command returns the path name of <u>window</u>'s current
              master, or an empty string if <u>window</u> isn't currently a transient window.  A  transient  window
              will  mirror  state  changes  in the master and inherit the state of the master when initially
              mapped. It is an error to attempt to make a window a transient of itself.

       <b>wm</b> <b>withdraw</b> <u>window</u>
              Arranges for <u>window</u> to be withdrawn from the screen.  This causes the window  to  be  unmapped
              and  forgotten  about  by  the window manager.  If the window has never been mapped, then this
              command causes the window to be mapped in the withdrawn state.  Not all window managers appear
              to  know  how  to  handle  windows that are mapped in the withdrawn state.  Note: it sometimes
              seems to be necessary to withdraw a window and then re-map it (e.g. with <b>wm</b> <b>deiconify</b>) to  get
              some window managers to pay attention to changes in window attributes such as group.


<b>GEOMETRY</b> <b>MANAGEMENT</b>
       By  default a top-level window appears on the screen in its <u>natural</u> <u>size</u>, which is the one determined
       internally by its widgets and geometry managers.  If the natural size of a top-level window  changes,
       then the window's size changes to match.  A top-level window can be given a size other than its natu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ral&nbsp;natural</font>
       ral size in two ways.  First, the user can resize the window manually using  the  facilities  of  the
       window  manager, such as resize handles.  Second, the application can request a particular size for a
       top-level window using the <b>wm</b> <b>geometry</b> command.  These two cases are handled identically by  Tk;   in
       either case, the requested size overrides the natural size.  You can return the window to its natural
       by invoking <b>wm</b> <b>geometry</b> with an empty <u>geometry</u> string.

       Normally a top-level window can have any size from one pixel in each dimension up to the size of  its
       screen.   However, you can use the <b>wm</b> <b>minsize</b> and <b>wm</b> <b>maxsize</b> commands to limit the range of allowable
       sizes.  The range set by <b>wm</b> <b>minsize</b> and <b>wm</b> <b>maxsize</b> applies to all forms of  resizing,  including  the
       window's  natural  size  as well as manual resizes and the <b>wm</b> <b>geometry</b> command.  You can also use the
       command <b>wm</b> <b>resizable</b> to completely disable interactive resizing in one or both dimensions.


<b>GRIDDED</b> <b>GEOMETRY</b> <b>MANAGEMENT</b>
       Gridded geometry management occurs when one of the widgets of an application supports a range of use-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ful&nbsp;useful</font>
       ful  sizes.  This occurs, for example, in a text editor where the scrollbars, menus, and other adorn-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ments&nbsp;adornments</font>
       ments are fixed in size but the edit widget can support any number of lines of text or characters per
       line.   In  this case, it is usually desirable to let the user specify the number of lines or charac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ters-per-line,&nbsp;characters-per-line,</font>
       ters-per-line, either with the <b>wm</b> <b>geometry</b> command or by interactively resizing the window.   In  the
       case of text, and in other interesting cases also, only discrete sizes of the window make sense, such
       as integral numbers of lines and characters-per-line;  arbitrary pixel sizes are not useful.

       Gridded geometry management provides support for this kind of application.  Tk (and the  window  man-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ager)&nbsp;manager)</font>
       ager) assume that there is a grid of some sort within the application and that the application should
       be resized in terms of <u>grid</u> <u>units</u> rather than  pixels.   Gridded  geometry  management  is  typically
       invoked  by turning on the <b>setGrid</b> option for a widget;  it can also be invoked with the <b>wm</b> <b>grid</b> com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
       mand or by calling <b>Tk_SetGrid</b>.  In each of these approaches the particular widget (or sometimes  code
       in  the application as a whole) specifies the relationship between integral grid sizes for the window
       and pixel sizes.  To return to non-gridded geometry management, invoke <b>wm</b> <b>grid</b>  with  empty  argument
       strings.

       When  gridded geometry management is enabled then all the dimensions specified in <b>wm</b> <b>minsize</b>, <b>wm</b> <b>max</b>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">size,&nbsp;maxsize,</font>
       <b>size</b>, and <b>wm</b> <b>geometry</b> commands are treated as grid units rather than pixel units.  Interactive resiz-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;resizing</font>
       ing is also carried out in even numbers of grid units rather than pixels.


<b>BUGS</b>
       Most  existing  window managers appear to have bugs that affect the operation of the <b>wm</b> command.  For
       example, some changes won't take effect if the window is already active:  the window will have to  be
       withdrawn and de-iconified in order to make the change happen.
