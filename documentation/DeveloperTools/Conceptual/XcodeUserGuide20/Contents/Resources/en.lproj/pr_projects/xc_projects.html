relies on certain key components. It uses projects to organize this
information. The project is a repository for all of the information needed
to build one or more software products. It is also the primary workspace
for your software development. This chapter describes the contents
of an Xcode project and gives an overview of the information required to
develop software with Xcode.</p>

<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH219-BABCIFCJ" title="Components of an Xcode Project"></a><h2>Components of an Xcode Project</h2>
<p>A project contains and organizes everything you need to create
one or more software products. Your Xcode project serves two important
purposes; it:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><p>Organizes
build system inputs for building a product.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Maintains information on the items in your project and their
relationships, to assist you in the development process.</p></li></ol>
<p>To develop a product using Xcode, you must understand the
key components of your project. <span class="content_text">Figure 2-1</span> shows a simplified
representation of a project and its essential pieces. </p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH219-BABBGBCE" title="Figure 2-1The key components of a project"></a><p><strong>Figure 2-1&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The key components of a project</p>
<img src = "../Art/wf_project_simple.gif" alt = "" width="143" height="141"></div><br/>
<p>The project&#8217;s contents include the following essential items;
in the course of developing a product, you will work with each of
these:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><p>Files. <strong>Source
files</strong> are the files used to build a product. These include
source code files, resource files, image files and others. </p><p>A
project keeps all of the source files you use for a particular product
or suite of related products. A project can also contain files that
are not directly used by Xcode to build a product, but contain information
that you use during the development process, such as notes, test
plans, and more.</p><p>In the course of developing a product
you edit project files&#8212;using Xcode&#8217;s built-in editor or an external
editor&#8212;to author source code for a product, and organize files
into a target (described below) to define the build system inputs
for creating the product.</p><p>A project keeps a reference
to each file you add to the project. A project can also contain
folder references, if you want to manipulate a group of files as
a whole; framework references to access the contents of a framework,
or references to other projects. <span class="content_text"><a href="../pr_add_files/pr_add_files.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH221-BABFAHJI">“Files in a Project”</a></span> describes
how Xcode stores these references and discusses the files in a project
in more detail.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Targets. When it comes time to actually create, or <strong>build</strong>,
a product, you use a target. A <strong>target</strong> defines
a single product; it organizes the inputs into the build system&#8212;the source
files and instructions for processing those source files&#8212;required
to build that product. To create a finished product, build its target.
Projects can contain one or more targets, each of which produces
one product. </p><p>Targets, and the products they create, may be
related. If a target requires the output of another target in order
to build, the first target is said to depend upon the second. Xcode
lets you add target dependencies to express this relationship. <span class="content_text"><a href="../bs_targets/bs_targets.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH227-CIHEHECG">“Targets”</a></span> describes
targets and the instructions they contain in more detail.</p><p>For
each target in your project, Xcode adds a <strong>product reference</strong>.
This is a file reference to the output generated by the target,
such as an application. You can use this product reference to refer
to the products in your project the same way you use a file reference
to refer to a file; however, the product reference does not actually
refer to anything in the file system until you build the product.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Executables. After you&#8217;ve successfully built a product,
you need to test it to make sure that it works. When it comes time
to run or debug your product, you use an executable environment
to tell Xcode how to do so. An <strong>executable environment</strong> tells
Xcode</p><ol class="ol"><li class="ol ol"><p>What
program to launch when you run or debug from within Xcode.</p></li>
<li class="ol ol"><p>How to launch the program. The executable environment lets
you tell Xcode what command-line arguments to pass, environment
variables to set, debugger to use, and so forth.</p></li></ol><p>If
you are building a product that can be run on its own&#8212;an application,
command-line tool, and so forth&#8212;Xcode automatically sets the default
executable to the target&#8217;s product. However, if you have a product
such as a plug-in or framework, you must create an executable environment
to specify a program to run and test your product with. </p><p>Even
if your product generates an executable that can run on its own,
you may want to customize the executable environment to specify
command-line arguments for Xcode to pass to the program on launch,
environment variables to set, and so forth. <span class="content_text"><a href="../db_executable/db_executable.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH237-BABBAGDH">“Executable Environments”</a></span> describes
executable environments in Xcode in more detail, and explains how
to modify executable settings.</p><p>A project can contain
any number of executables. There is not a one-to-one correspondence
between targets and executables, although Xcode automatically creates
an executable environment for each target that creates a product
that can be run on its own. You can, however, define multiple executable
environments to use to test the product of a single target under
different circumstances. </p></li></ol>
<p>In addition to these fundamental building blocks of the development
process, your Xcode project also maintains a great deal of information
about the items in your project and their current state. <span class="content_text">Figure 2-2</span> shows
a representation of a project with this additional information.</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH219-BABBIDGD" title="Figure 2-2An Xcode project"></a><p><strong>Figure 2-2&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>An Xcode project</p><img src = "../Art/wf_project.gif" alt = "" width="148" height="332"></div><br/>
<p>Your Xcode project tracks:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Organizational
information that Xcode uses to help you do your work. For example, projects
can contain groups to help you organize and find files, or bookmarks
to your favorite locations. Xcode also maintains a symbolic index
for your project; it uses this information to provide assistance
such as code completion, project-wide symbol searching, and more.
Groups and other features for organizing project contents are described
in <span class="content_text"><a href="../pr_organizing/pr_organizing.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH248-BABFAHJI">“Organizing Xcode Projects”</a></span>;
project-wide searches and other features for finding information
in your project are described in <span class="content_text"><a href="../pr_navigate/pr_navigate.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH250-BABJCBEG">“Finding Information in a Project.”</a></span></p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Project-wide settings that affect the build process and other
software-development operations for all targets and project items.
For example, the project tracks the &#8220;active&#8221; target; this is
the target that Xcode builds when you hit the Build button.</p></li></ul>
<p>The settings that an Xcode project tracks include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Source control
management system (SCM). Xcode supports the CVS, Perforce, and Subversion
version control systems for managing changes to source code. <span class="content_text"><a href="../scm/scm.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH252-BABCCJCJ">“Version Control”</a></span> describes
how to choose a version control system and how to work with version
control features in Xcode.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Mac OS X SDK version. Using Xcode, you can develop software
that can be deployed on versions of Mac OS X different from the
one you are developing on. You can choose which version (or SDK)
of Mac OS X headers and libraries to build with. <span class="content_text"><a href="../bs_cross_development/bs_cross_development.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH235-DAFFDICI">“Using Cross-Development in Xcode”</a></span> briefly describes how to choose a Mac OS X system version
in Xcode. For detailed information, see <em><a href="../../../../../cross_development/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000163i" target="_top">Cross-Development Programming Guide</a></em>.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Build styles. A <strong>build style</strong> lets you modify
how a target is built. It contains build settings that let you override
some of the information in a target, without creating a whole new
target. In this way, you can rapidly try variations on a target
without maintaining multiple copies. The project keeps track of
the available build styles and their definitions. See <span class="content_text"><a href="../bs_build_styles/bs_build_styles.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH230-CJAFDIGF">“Build Styles”</a></span> for
more information on build styles in Xcode.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Active target and build style. The <strong>active target</strong> is
the target that gets built when you initiate a build in Xcode. The <strong>active
build style</strong> is the build style that Xcode applies to the
active target, and any targets it depends upon, when you build.
See <span class="content_text"><a href="../bs_building_product/bs_building_product.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000833-BAJFIBIH">“Setting the Active Target and Build Style”</a></span> for
more information.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Active executable. The <strong>active executable</strong> is
the executable environment that specifies which program is launched,
and how, when you run or debug from within Xcode. </p></li></ul>
<p>Because active build style, choice of version control system,
and SDK version are all attributes of the project, they must be
the same for all targets in a project. For example, if you have
a target that uses the Perforce source control system, you can&#8217;t
have another target in the same project that uses the CVS system.
You can, however, use cross-project references and dependencies
to tie together targets in separate projects that use different version
control systems.</p>
<p>A project can have multiple targets and multiple executables.
However, there can only be one active target, one active build style,
and one active executable. So, for example, if a project builds more
than one application, only one executable&#8212;corresponding to one application&#8212;can
be active and that&#8217;s the only executable you can debug in Xcode&#8217;s graphical
debugger. If you want to debug both applications at once with the
graphical debugger, you&#8217;ll have to build them in separate projects.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH219-DontLinkElementID_228" title="The Project Directory"></a><h2>The Project Directory</h2>
<p>When you create a new project, Xcode creates a project directory
to hold your project&#8217;s contents. The project directory contains
the project package, which holds project metadata&#8212;as described
in the previous section&#8212;and user information. The project package
has the same name as the project and carries the extension <code>.xcode</code>.
For more on the project package, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../SCMManagingProjects/SCMManagingProjects.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH269-BAJFCAII">“Project Packages.”</a></span> </p>
<p>In addition to the project package, the project directory
can also contain:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Project files
and folders. Source files can live anywhere on your system, but
keeping them in your project directory makes it easy to move the
project and its contents around. By default, Xcode interprets most
paths relative to the project directory. </p><p>You can organize
files into any number of subfolders within the project directory.
This includes folders for localized resources, as described in <span class="content_text"><a href="../ed_localize/ed_localize.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH257-CFHIFBGJ">“Customizing for Different Regions.”</a></span> </p><p>If
you create a project from one of Xcode&#8217;s project templates, the
project directory already contains a number of example source files.
For more on the files in a project, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../pr_add_files/pr_add_files.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH221-BABFAHJI">“Files in a Project.”</a></span></p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Build folder. When you build a target, Xcode generates a number
of files, including the target&#8217;s finished product. By default,
Xcode creates a <code>build</code> folder
in the project directory to hold the files that it creates. The
build folder can, however, reside at any location in the filesystem.
For more information on the build folder, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../bs_building_product/bs_building_product.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000833-BAJCIICC">“Build Locations.”</a></span></p></li></ul>
