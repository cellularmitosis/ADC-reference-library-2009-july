<H1>Using PAP</H1>
 To use Open Transport PAP, you first open an endpoint as a PAP endpoint, which causes Open Transport to allocate the memory PAP needs for data buffers and for storing the variables PAP uses to maintain the connection between endpoints. After a connection is established, PAP manages and controls the data flow between the two endpoints throughout a session to ensure that data is delivered and received in the order in which it was sent and that duplicate data is not sent. <P>
 When you bind a PAP endpoint, the binding process associates a local protocol address with the endpoint. In PAP, this identifies the socket address, and PAP uses this as part of the address for sending and receiving packets of data. Each socket can maintain concurrent PAP connections with several other sockets, but only one PAP endpoint can bind with a <CODE>qlen</CODE> greater than 0. <P>
 As with other connection-oriented protocols, Open Transport PAP allows you to create a passive endpoint that listens for incoming connection requests rather than initiating such requests. In addition, the implementation of PAP under Open Transport includes some PAP-specific features: <P>
<UL>
<P><LI>an end-of-message option that lets you divide streams of data into logical units<P>
<P><LI>locally implemented orderly disconnects rather than over-the-wire remote disconnects<P>
</UL>
 PAP is also able to arbitrate connections requests and to accept requests from the workstations that have been waiting the longest to print. <P>
<A NAME=HEADING77-7></A>
<H2>Binding PAP Endpoints</H2>
 You have two choices when <A NAME=MARKER-13-23></A>binding a PAP endpoint: You can create an endpoint that can initiate connections and receive connection requests, or you can create a passive endpoint that can only receive connection requests. Typically, a passive PAP endpoint is a printer server. <P>
 If your endpoint can initiate connections, you can bind it as a normal Open Transport endpoint and use any of the three AppleTalk address formats for the socket address: DDP, NBP, or the combined DDP-NBP format. If the bind is successful, the endpoint is ready for use in establishing and using a connection. <P>
 The other choice when binding a PAP endpoint is to establish it as a <A NAME=MARKER-13-24></A>passive <B>peer </B>that listens for incoming connection requests. The passive peer can accept or deny a connection request. The use of a passive peer is typical of a server environment in which a server, such as a printer server, is registered with a single name. Endpoints throughout the network can contact the printer server with connection requests. The server can accept or deny a request. It might deny a request, for example, when its resources are exhausted, based on criteria that you define. <P>
 To create a passive peer that listens, you specify a <CODE><A NAME=MARKER-13-25></A>qlen</CODE> field value greater than 0 during the binding process. The number you use determines how many connection requests the endpoint can support. Once the endpoint is bound, it starts listening for incoming connection requests. When a request arrives, the endpoint retrieves certain information about the request and continues to process the connection request by accepting or rejecting it. <P>
 You can bind multiple PAP endpoints to the same socket, but you can have only one passive peer that listens for a given socket. When a server accepts a connection from a client workstation for processing its print request, it cannot accept another connection request from the same workstation endpoint. As with other connection-oriented protocols, you can only have one concurrent connection between the same pair of endpoints. <A NAME=MARKER-13-26></A><P>
<A NAME=HEADING77-13></A>
<H2><A NAME=MARKER-9-27></A><A NAME=MARKER-13-28></A>Specifying PAP Options</H2>
 You can use one of two options with PAP endpoints:<P>
<UL>
<P><LI>The enable end-of-message options allows you to break up a data stream into discrete logical units.<P>
By default, PAP soes not support TSDUs.<P>
<P><LI>The open retry option allows you to retry making connection requests.<P>
</UL>
 The following two sections explain the use of these options. <P>
<A NAME=HEADING77-19></A>
<H3>The End-of-Message Option</H3>
 You can send a PAP data stream that contains no logical boundaries which need to be preserved across the connection, or you can use <B><A NAME=MARKER-13-29></A>transport service data units (TSDUs)</B> to separate the data stream into discrete logical units when sending and receiving it across a connection. By default, PAP does not support TSDUs. Instead, PAP sends and receives a continuous stream of data with no message delimiters.<P>
 If transport independence is not crucial for your application, you can use a PAP-specific option that allows TSDUs. The <CODE>OPT_ENABLEEOM</CODE> option enables the PAP end-of-message feature, which permits dividing data streams into smaller logical units. Open Transport uses a flag in the send and receive functions to indicate multiple sends and receives. The use of this flag, the <A NAME=MARKER-13-36></A><CODE>T_MORE</CODE> flag, allows you to break up a large data stream without losing its logical boundaries at the other end of the connection. The flag, however, indicates nothing about how the data is packaged for transport on the lower-level protocols below the PAP endpoint provider. <P>
 To send a data stream that is broken up into TSDUs, set the <CODE>T_MORE</CODE> flag on each send after setting the <CODE>OPT_ENABLEEOM</CODE> option. This indicates to the provider that there are more packets coming that are part of this same message. When you send data without the <CODE>T_MORE</CODE> flag set, the provider knows this is the last packet for this message and sends an EOM packet to the remote peer. It is possible for this last (EOM) packet to contain no data because PAP supports the sending of <A NAME=MARKER-13-31></A>zero-length packets. This is useful when you send a packet with the <CODE>T_MORE</CODE> flag set only to discover that you have no more data to send. In this case, PAP still expects another packet, but you have no data to put into it. You can send a zero-length packet to set the <CODE>T_MORE</CODE> flag correctly. <P>
 Because printers expect an EOM indicator on the last packet of a connection, if you do not choose to use the <CODE>OPT_ENABLEEOM</CODE> option, PAP takes care of that for you, guaranteeing that the EOM indicator is set on the last packet. If, however, you do choose to use the <CODE>OPT_ENABLEEOM</CODE> option, you are responsible for setting the EOM indicator, by using the <CODE>T_MORE</CODE> flag on every packet but the last. <P>
 You can enable the EOM option for an endpoint in several ways. One way is to define the option as part of the configuration string you use to open the endpoint. The following line of code enables the EOM option for a PAP endpoint:<P>
<PRE>
<A NAME=MARKER-0-95></A>OTOpenEndpoint(OTCreateConfiguration(&quot;pap(EnableEOM=1)&quot;),0, NULL, &amp;err);
</PRE>
 Or you could call a function like that shown in <A HREF=NetworkingWOT-56.html#MARKER-9-65>Listing 7-5 </A> as follows:<P>
<PRE>
<A NAME=MARKER-0-95></A>err=SetFourByteOption(ep, ATK_PAP, OPT_ENABLEEOM, 1);
</PRE>
 to enable the EOM option for a PAP endpoint.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING77-29></A>
<H3>The <A NAME=MARKER-13-34></A>Open Retry Option</H3>
 By default, when a PAP endpoint provider calls the <CODE>OTConnect</CODE> function, which creates a connection request, it only tries to establish the connection once. This behavior is controlled by an option, PAP_OPT_OPENRETRY, whose default value is 1. (The default value of 1 for this option differs from the default retry count of 5 specified in <I>Inside AppleTalk</I>, second edition. In other aspects of Open Transport AppleTalk, AppleTalk protocols adhere to the specifications detailed in that book. )<P>
 To force PAP to try again to open the connection, you can set a value greater than 1 for the <A NAME=MARKER-13-35></A><CODE>PAP_OPT_OPENRETRY</CODE> option. Workstation client applications that want to print data, for example, will probably keep trying to get access to a printer server, retrying printer connections until it succeeds or until the user presses the cancel button. <A NAME=MARKER-13-36></A><P>
<A NAME=HEADING77-32></A>
<H3>The <A NAME=MARKER-13-37></A>Server Status Option</H3>
 In a client-server interaction, a client may sometimes need to know the status of the server. In these cases, the client can request the server's status. This request can occur outside a connection. If the <A NAME=MARKER-13-153></A><CODE>OPT_SERVERSTATUS</CODE> option has been set, with a C string up to 255 bytes long, the server can return that string as the server status.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING77-34></A>
<H3>The Reply Count Option</H3>
 One-call specific option which you might find useful when trying to connect to some printers is the <CODE>ATP_OPTREPLYCNT</CODE> option. <P>
 A PAP-compliant printer will respond to a PAP connection request with a single connection reply packet in which the EOM flag is set. Some printers do not set this flag in the response packet, so ATP (upon which PAP is layered) expects additional packets to be sent. After the timeout, the endpoint resends the connection request, and again the printer responds without setting the EOM bit. The <CODE>ATP_OPTREPLYCNT</CODE> option tells PAP to expect only one reply packet.<P>
 <A HREF=#MARKER-9-39>Listing 18-1</A> demonstrates how to implement the <CODE>ATP_OPTREPLYCNT</CODE> option. By default when you make a connection request, the response bitmap is set to request 8 packets. By using the <CODE>ATP_OPTREPLYCNT</CODE> option set to 1 (with the <CODE>OTConnect</CODE> call), the connection request can be satisfied when the response packet is received even when the EOM bit is not set. In the sample, the endpoint is assumed to be in synchronous mode.<P>

<H2><A NAME=MARKER-13-41></A>Disconnecting</H2>
 As with all connection-oriented Open Transport protocols, PAP supports abortive disconnects. In addition, PAP supports orderly disconnects, although it can only implement them locally. <P>
 An abortive disconnect directs the remote endpoint to abruptly tear down its connection without making any accomodation for the data that may be in the transmission pipeline at the time. You can define your own handshake to prevent losing data during the disconnect process.<P>
 PAP implements <A NAME=MARKER-13-42></A>orderly disconnects locally, not over the wire. This means that immediately after you request the disconnect, PAP sends all data buffered at the local end and then tears down the connection, breaking communication with the remote end. As a result, no data can be sent from either the local or remote endpoint. The endpoints can continue to process data already in their receive queues, but no new data can go out.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING77-44></A>
<H2><A NAME=MARKER-13-43></A><A NAME=MARKER-9-44></A>Using General Open Transport Functions With PAP</H2>
 This section describes any special considerations you must take into account for Open Transport functions when you use them with the Open Transport PAP implementation. You must be familiar with the function descriptions in the chapter "Endpoints"<A HREF=NetworkingWOT-26.html#MARKER-9-43></A> before reading this section. <P>
<A NAME=HEADING77-46></A>
<H3><A NAME=MARKER-9-45></A>OTBind</H3>
 The <A NAME=MARKER-13-46></A><CODE>OTBind</CODE> function associates a local protocol address with the endpoint specified by the <CODE>ref</CODE> parameter. <P>
 You can bind multiple PAP endpoints to a single protocol address, but you can bind only one passive endpoint that listens at that address. <P>
 With PAP, as with other connection-oriented protocols, the <CODE>req-&gt;<A NAME=MARKER-13-47></A>qlen</CODE> parameter specifies the number of outstanding connection requests that an endpoint can support. The endpoint can negotiate a lower final value of <CODE>qlen</CODE> if it cannot handle the requested number of outstanding connection requests. <P>
<A NAME=HEADING77-50></A>
<H3><A NAME=MARKER-9-48></A>OTConnect</H3>
 The <A NAME=MARKER-13-49></A><CODE>OTConnect</CODE> function requests a connection to a specified remote endpoint. <P>
 PAP does not allow application-specific data to be included when you establish a connection, so you need to set the <CODE>sndcall-&gt;udata.len</CODE> field to 0. PAP ignores the <CODE>sndcall-&gt;udata.buf</CODE> field.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING77-53></A>
<H3><A NAME=MARKER-9-50></A>OTRcvConnect</H3>
 The <A NAME=MARKER-13-51></A><CODE>OTRcvConnect</CODE> function reads the status of a previously issued connection request. <P>
 Because PAP does not allow application-specific data to be associated with a connection request, you need to set the <CODE>call-&gt;udata.maxlen</CODE> field to 0. PAP ignores the <CODE>call-&gt;udata.buf</CODE> field.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING77-56></A>
<H3><A NAME=MARKER-9-52></A>OTListen</H3>
 The <A NAME=MARKER-13-53></A><CODE>OTListen</CODE> function listens for an incoming connection request.<P>
 PAP does not allow application-specific data to be included when you request a connection, so you need to set the <CODE>call-&gt;udata.maxlen</CODE> field to 0. PAP ignores any data in the <CODE>call-&gt;udata.buf</CODE> field.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING77-59></A>
<H3>OTAccept</H3>
 The <A NAME=MARKER-13-54></A><CODE>OTAccept</CODE> function accept a connection request either on the same endpoint that received the connection request or on a different endpoint. <P>
 PAP does not allow application-specific data to be included when you accept a connection, so you need to set the <CODE>call-&gt;udata.len</CODE> field to 0. PAP ignores the <CODE>call-&gt;udata.buf</CODE> field.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING77-62></A>
<H3><A NAME=MARKER-9-55></A>OTSnd</H3>
 The <A NAME=MARKER-13-56></A><CODE>OTSnd</CODE> function sends normal and expedited data through a connection-oriented transactionless endpoint. <P>
 PAP supports TSDUs through the <A NAME=MARKER-13-60></A><CODE>OPT_ENABLEEOM</CODE> option. In PAP, TSDUs sent from the client endpoint can be of infinite length, but TSDUs sent from a server endpoint can only be up to 512 bytes long. Zero-length packets are supported by PAP. <P>
<A NAME=HEADING77-65></A>
<H3><A NAME=MARKER-9-58></A>OTRcv</H3>
 The <A NAME=MARKER-13-59></A><CODE>OTRcv</CODE> function receives normal and expedited data through a connection-oriented transactionless endpoint. <P>
 PAP supports TSDUs through the <A NAME=MARKER-13-60></A><CODE>OPT_ENABLEEOM</CODE> option. <P>
<A NAME=HEADING77-68></A>
<H3><A NAME=MARKER-9-61></A>OTSndDisconnect</H3>
 The <A NAME=MARKER-13-62></A><CODE>OTSndDisconnect</CODE> function initiates an abortive disconnect or rejects a connection request. <P>
 In an abortive disconnect, the <CODE>call</CODE> parameter is ignored because PAP does not allow application-specific data to be associated with a disconnect. You need to set the <CODE>call-&gt;udata.len</CODE> field to 0. PAP ignores the <CODE>call-&gt;udata.buf</CODE> field.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING77-71></A>
<H3><A NAME=MARKER-9-63></A>OTRcvDisconnect</H3>
 The <A NAME=MARKER-13-64></A><CODE>OTRcvDisconnect</CODE> function returns information about why a connection attempt failed or an established connection was terminated. <P>
 Because PAP does not allow application-specific data to be associated with a disconnect, you need to set the <CODE>discon-&gt;udata.maxlen</CODE> field to 0. PAP ignores the <CODE>discon-&gt;udata.buf</CODE> field. <A NAME=MARKER-13-65></A><A NAME=MARKER-13-66></A><P>
