About ADB Key SpyPete GontierMacintosh Developer Technical Support© 1995,1996,1998 Apple Computer, Inc.This package provides something of a replacement for GetKeys by maintaining a key map reflecting the state of each keyboard attached to the Mac via ADB. (This means it won't work with any Mac earlier than an SE and probably does not work well with USB Macs.)The embarrassing truth is that due to the previous lack of synchronization between the Sample Code folder on the Tool Chest Edition of the Developer CD Series and the Sample Code directory on <ftp://ftp.apple.com>, we're no longer certain what the differences, if any, are between ADB Key Spy 1 and ADB Key Spy 2. Please cut us some slack for a few months while we try to get enough time to figure this out.
