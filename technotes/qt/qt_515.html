We play movies with a hidden movie controller. Macintosh programmers have informed me that the Macintosh QuickTime doesn't require movie controllers.</p><p>The Windows implementation of QuickTime requires that a movie controller beassociated with a movie in order to control it, even in the case when thecontroller is invisible. In the same line, the movie and its controller need tohave the same parent window. This may change in future releases but this is theway QuickTime for Windows works now.</p><a name="Section2"></a><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></p><H2>Creating QuickTime movies to play on a PC</h2><p>Date Written:   2/25/93</p><p>Last reviewed: 4/26/93</p><p>I'm trying to create a QuickTime movie on my Macintosh and play it on a PCusing the standard QuickTime Play that came with QuickTime for Windows. I getthe message "Movie X contains a data reference. Data references aren't supported by the current version of QuickTime for Windows," even after flattening the file and removing file dependencies. What do I have to do to eliminate these data references and build movies that I can play on the PC?</p><p>This problem occurs when Macintosh QuickTime 1.0 or its utilities are used tocreate the movies. The solution is to edit (or create) the QTW.INI file toinclude the following lines:</p><p>[Override]</p><p>DREF = no</p><p>This should force QuickTime for Windows to look in the file for the data. Abetter solution is to update your Macintosh software to the latest QuickTimeextension and related utilities.</p><a name="Section3"></a><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></p><H2>Edit QTW.INI file for special configurations</h2><p>Date Written:   12/14/92</p><p>Last reviewed: 7/2/93</p><p>The demo programs on the final QuickTime for Windows CD won't run withoutlocking up, because the <code>QTInitialize</code> function doesn't return. Any ideas?</p><p>The final QuickTime for Windows exhibits the behavior you describe when thedisplay board is configured in a way that QuickTime for Windows doesn'trecognize. XGA and SuperVGA are modes that could cause this problem. To checkwhether this is the problem, edit the QTW.INI file to include the following:</p><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=550><TR>	<td bgcolor="#E6E6E6" align=left><pre>[Video]Optimize = Driver</pre>	</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><p>The default is Hardware. This could be causing the problem you describe.</p><a name="Section4"></a><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></p><H2>Conditions for playing Macintosh movies on Windows</h2><p>Date Written:   11/6/92</p><p>Last reviewed: 4/26/93</p><p>Is there anything different between Windows movies and Macintosh movies? Howcan we get Macintosh movies to play on Windows?</p><p>There's no difference between Macintosh and Windows movies. The conditions thatneed to be met to get Macintosh movies to play on Windows are:</p><ul type="disc">	<li>The movie must be self-contained.</li>	<li>The movie must be in a single-fork file.</li></ul><p>No limitations apply other than these. We've successfully converted moviesusing Movie Converter in the QuickTime Developer Toolkit. One other thing toremember is that QuickTime for Windows doesn't support text track movies. Seethe QuickTime for Windows Developer Notes for details about how to convertmovies from Macintosh to Windows.</p><a name="Section5"></a><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></p><H2>QuickTime for Windows 1.0 error code 0x8002</h2><p>Date Written: 12/14/92</p><p>Last Reviewed:  6/14/93</p><p>What does an error return code of 0x8002 signify? I didn't find it documented.We occasionally get this return value from <code>MCControllerInfo</code>.</p><p>Error code 0x8002 means a <code>badComponentSelector</code>. As far as QuickTime for Windowsis concerned, the controller you're passing to <code>MCGetControllerInfo</code> isn't good.You may be passing nil or a controller handle that has already been disposed of.</p><a name="Section6"></a><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></p><H2>Trapping mouse clicks in QuickTime for Windows</h2><p>Date Written: 11/12/92</p><p>Last Reviewed:  3/1/93</p><p>I realize that the function <code>MCIsPlayerMessage</code> traps all Window messages beforethe big switch statement. How do I trap the user's double click or single clickin the movie window? How can I tell the coordinate of the single mouse click inthe movie window in my application? How can I disable the double click effect(play movie)?</p><p>The interface doesn't provide an easy solution to your problem. There aredifferent ways to do this depending on what you're trying to accomplish. Thefirst one involves setting a filter proc for the controller to monitor changesof state in the movie. In this case you'd still need to make sure the mouseclicked on the movie and not in the play button which causes the same action.</p><p>The second option gives you more control but goes against all laws of codingdecency since it implies splitting the processing of the message in such a waythat you get the opportunity first to do what you want with mouse clicks as soon deferring to second place the controller and its own processing.</p><a name="Section7"></a><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></p><H2>QuickTime for Windows system requirements</h2><p>Date Written:  11/12/92</p><p>Last Reviewed:  1/13/93</p><p>What is QuickTime for Windows and what hardware do you need to run it?</p><p>QuickTime for Windows makes QuickTime a cross-platform technology that you canuse in both the Macintosh and the Microsoft Windows programs that you'redeveloping. With it, you can create multimedia programs on the Macintosh and beable to add the playback of QuickTime movies to any PC application runningMicrosoft Windows 3.1.</p><p>The <i>minimum</i> hardware configuration required for QuickTime for Windows is the following:</p><ul type="disc">	<li>A personal computer with an 80386SX or greater CPU</li>	<li>A CPU speed of 20 MHz or higher</li>	<li>4 MB of conventional and extended memory</li>	<li>A hard disk with at least 4 MB free for the basic QuickTime for Windows software</li>	<li>A graphics adapter and mouse (or other pointing device) supported by Microsoft Windows</li></ul><p>Optional hardware:</p><ul type="disc">	<li>A CD-ROM drive supported by Microsoft Windows (if installing from a CD)</li>	<li>A sound card supported by Microsoft Windows</li>	<li>Additional free disk space if you want to keep movies and pictures on your hard disk</li></ul><p>The software requirement for running QuickTime for Windows is Microsoft Windows3.1. To write QuickTime for Windows programs, you must have (in addition to theQuickTime for Windows Developer's Kit) a development package such as BorlandC++ 3.1 or Microsoft C/C++ 7.0.</p><p>The sample QuickTime for Windows executables may be played under Windows 3.1immediately following QuickTime for Windows installation and configuration,without C or C++ being present.</p><a name="Section8"></a><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></p><H2>QTW requires movie and controller to be in same window</h2><p>Date Written: 11/3/92</p><p>Last Reviewed:  3/1/93</p><p>The current implementation of QuickTime for Windows prevents having a movie inone window and a controller in another. Both pieces are expected to share thesame parent window. One way to get around this is to do the following:</p><ol  start="1">	<li>Create a window in which you set up a movie and an invisible controller.</li>	<li>Create another window in which you set up the same movie attached to a visible controller, with the controller bounds set to be exactly equal to the controller rect so that the movie doesn't show at all.</li>	<li>Set an action filter proc for the second controller so that you know which actions take place because of user actions. See <code>MCSetActionFilter</code>.</li>	<li>Propagate the necessary actions to the first (invisible) filter to make the visible movie react to the controller action. See <code>MCDoAction</code>.</li></ol><p>This requires a lot of redundancy, but it's a way to get the effect you want.</p>         <a name="Downloads"></a>       <P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></p><H2>Downloadables</H2>                  <TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <td width=50 align=left>                  <P ALIGN=center><img src="images/acrobatsmall.gif" width=22 height=23 align=middle alt="Acrobat gif"></P>               </TD>               <td align="left">                  <P>Acrobat version of this Note (36).</P>               </TD>               <td width=60 align=left>                  <P><A HREF="pdf/qt_515.pdf">Download</A></P>               </TD>            </TR>                    </TABLE>         <BR></TD></TR></table></center><!-- begin_footer_information -->	<table width="680" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
