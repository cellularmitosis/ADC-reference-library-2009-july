<b>NAME</b>
       gfdl - GNU Free Documentation License

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       <b>GNU</b> <b>Free</b> <b>Documentation</b> <b>License</b>


       <b>Version</b> <b>1.2,</b> <b>November</b> <b>2002</b>

               Copyright (c) 2000,2001,2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
               59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA

               Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
               of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

       0.  PREAMBLE

           The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful
           document <u>free</u> in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and
           redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
           Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their
           work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

           This License is a kind of ``copyleft'', which means that derivative works of the document must
           themselves be free in the same sense.  It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a
           copyleft license designed for free software.

           We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free
           software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same
           freedoms that the software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be
           used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed
           book.  We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

       1.  APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

           This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by
           the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
           grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the
           conditions stated herein.  The ``Document'', below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any
           member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as ``you''.  You accept the license if you
           copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.

           A ``Modified Version'' of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it,
           either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.

           A ``Secondary Section'' is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals
           exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's
           overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that
           overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary
           Section may not explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
           connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical,
           ethical or political position regarding them.

           The ``Invariant Sections'' are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being
           those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this
           License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to
           be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
           does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

           The ``Cover Texts'' are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or
           Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
           Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

           A ``Transparent'' copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format
           whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the
           document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic
           paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for
           input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
           to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence
           of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not
           Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
           copy that is not ``Transparent'' is called ``Opaque''.

           Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo
           input format, LaTeX input format, @acronym{SGML} or @acronym{XML} using a publicly available
           @acronym{DTD}, and standard-conforming simple @acronym{HTML}, PostScript or @acronym{PDF}
           designed for human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include @acronym{PNG},
           @acronym{XCF} and @acronym{JPG}.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
           edited only by proprietary word processors, @acronym{SGML} or @acronym{XML} for which the
           @acronym{DTD} and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated
           @acronym{HTML}, PostScript or @acronym{PDF} produced by some word processors for output purposes
           only.

           The ``Title Page'' means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as
           are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
           works in formats which do not have any title page as such, ``Title Page'' means the text near the
           most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

           A section ``Entitled XYZ'' means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely
           XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here
           XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as ``Acknowledgements'',
           ``Dedications'', ``Endorsements'', or ``History''.)  To ``Preserve the Title'' of such a section
           when you modify the Document means that it remains a section ``Entitled XYZ'' according to this
           definition.

           The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License
           applies to the Document.  These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference
           in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these
           Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.

       2.  VERBATIM COPYING

           You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially,
           provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
           applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions
           whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control
           the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
           compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must
           also follow the conditions in section 3.

           You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display
           copies.

       3.  COPYING IN QUANTITY

           If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the
           Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you
           must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">Cover&nbsp;FrontCover</font>
           Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also
           clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
           the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other
           material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they
           preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
           copying in other respects.

           If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the
           first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
           adjacent pages.

           If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must
           either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or
           with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has
           access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the
           Document, free of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent
           steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent
           copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last
           time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition
           to the public.

           It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before
           redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
           version of the Document.

       4.  MODIFICATIONS

           You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2
           and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
           the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and
           modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do
           these things in the Modified Version:

           A.  Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document,
               and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
               History section of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version if the
               original publisher of that version gives permission.

           B.  List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for
               authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
               principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
               unless they release you from this requirement.

           C.  State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.

           D.  Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

           E.  Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright
               notices.

           F.  Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public
               permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
               the Addendum below.

           G.  Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts
               given in the Document's license notice.

           H.  Include an unaltered copy of this License.

           I.  Preserve the section Entitled ``History'', Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating
               at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
               Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled ``History'' in the Document, create one stating
               the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
               an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.

           J.  Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a
               Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document
               for previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the ``History'' section.  You
               may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the
               Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

           K.  For any section Entitled ``Acknowledgements'' or ``Dedications'', Preserve the Title of the
               section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
               acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

           L.  Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their
               titles.  Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

           M.  Delete any section Entitled ``Endorsements''.  Such a section may not be included in the
               Modified Version.

           N.  Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled ``Endorsements'' or to conflict in title
               with any Invariant Section.

           O.  Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

           If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as
           Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option
           designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the list
           of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct
           from any other section titles.

           You may add a section Entitled ``Endorsements'', provided it contains nothing but endorsements of
           your Modified Version by various parties---for example, statements of peer review or that the
           text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.

           You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words
           as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
           passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements
           made by) any one entity.  If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
           previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
           you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the
           previous publisher that added the old one.

           The <!-- a -->author(s)<!-- /a --> and <!-- a -->publisher(s)<!-- /a --> of the Document do not by this License give permission to use
           their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

       5.  COMBINING DOCUMENTS

           You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms
           defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
           all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as
           Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their
           Warranty Disclaimers.

           The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant
           Sections may be replaced with a single copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the
           same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end
           of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or
           else a unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant
           Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

           In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled ``History'' in the various original
           documents, forming one section Entitled ``History''; likewise combine any sections Entitled
           ``Acknowledgements'', and any sections Entitled ``Dedications''.  You must delete all sections
           Entitled ``Endorsements.''

       6.  COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

           You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this
           License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single
           copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
           verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

           You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under
           this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
           this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

       7.  AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

           A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or
           works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an ``aggregate'' if the
           copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the
           compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.  When the Document is included an
           aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not
           themselves derivative works of the Document.

           If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if
           the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be
           placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of
           covers if the Document is in electronic form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that
           bracket the whole aggregate.

       8.  TRANSLATION

           Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the
           Document under the terms of section 4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires
           special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all
           Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may
           include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any
           Warrany Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License
           and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
           the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original
           version will prevail.

           If a section in the Document is Entitled ``Acknowledgements'', ``Dedications'', or ``History'',
           the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
           actual title.

       9.  TERMINATION

           You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for
           under this License.  Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
           void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties who have
           received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated
           so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

       10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

           The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation
           License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
           but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
           &lt;<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/"><b>http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</b></a><b></b>.

           Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Document specifies
           that a particular numbered version of this License ``or any later version'' applies to it, you
           have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any
           later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
           Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever
           published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.

       <b>ADDENDUM:</b> <b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>this</b> <b>License</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>documents</b>

       To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and
       put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:

                 Copyright (C)  &lt;year&gt;  &lt;your name&gt;.
                 Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
                 under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
                 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
                 with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
                 A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
                 Free Documentation License''.

       If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the ``with...Texts.''
       line with this:

                   with the Invariant Sections being &lt;list their titles&gt;, with
                   the Front-Cover Texts being &lt;list&gt;, and with the Back-Cover Texts
                   being &lt;list&gt;.

       If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge
       those two alternatives to suit the situation.

       If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples
       in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
       permit their use in free software.
