/*	TCP Client/Server Queuing Example	Steve Falkenburg, MacDTS, Apple Computer	3/11/92		this client/server sample uses MacTCP to implement a simple "greeting" server.  the server	opens up several listeners on kGreetingPort (1235).  when a client connects, the data entered	in the greeting dialog is sent to the remote connection, and the connection is closed.		connection management is done through the use of Operating System queues to simplify tracking	and usage.*/#ifndef __PROCESSES__#include <Processes.h>#endifBoolean		gDone = false;				// set to true when user clicks quitshort		gTcpDrvrRef;				// MacTCP (.ipp driver) driver reference numberDialogPtr	gMainDialog;				// pointer to main windowshort		gFree,gRunning,gCompleted;	// queue counters indicating number of blocks in each q.long		gServiced;					// counter indicating how many clients have been servedBoolean		gRunningSeven;				// true if we're running System 7ProcessSerialNumber gOurPSN;			// process serial number for use in WakeUpProcess()Str255		gGreetingData;				// greeting string sent to client
