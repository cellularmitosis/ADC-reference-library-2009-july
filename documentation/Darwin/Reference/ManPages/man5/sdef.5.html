SDEF(5)                     BSD File Formats Manual                    SDEF(5)

<b>NAME</b>
     <b>sdef</b> -- scripting definition file

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
     Scripting definition files (sdefs) are XML files that describe everything about an application script-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;scripting</font>
     ing interface: terminology, implementation information, and complete documentation.  Applications may
     incorporate them to define their own scriptability, and scripting clients such as AppleScript and
     Scripting Bridge read them to determine what operations an application supports.

<b>BASICS</b>
     To read this man page, you should know what ``element'' and ``attribute'' mean in an XML document.  To
     create an sdef, you should know how to create well-formed XML; use of an XML editor will probably make
     your life easier.  For basic concepts and style guidelines, see Technical Note TN2106, <u>Scripting</u>
     <u>Interface</u> <u>Guidelines</u>.  Knowledge of AppleScript is helpful but not necessary; see the <u>AppleScript</u>
     <u>Language</u> <u>Guide</u>, especially chapters 4 (Commands) and 5 (Objects and References).  If you have already
     been working with sdefs in an older version of Mac OS X, read the <u>History</u> section, since there have
     been changes to the format.  If you are using Cocoa, Cocoa Scripting as of Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) sup-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ports&nbsp;supports</font>
     ports using sdefs directly rather than preprocessing them with <a href="../man1/sdp.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/sdp">sdp(1)</a>; see the <u>Sdef</u> <u>Scriptability</u> <u>Guide</u>
     <u>for</u> <u>Cocoa</u> for details.

     If you are familiar with AppleScript or with writing aete resources, most of the sdef elements will be
     familiar to you.  If you are not, or if you want to know how sdef elements map to your implementation
     language, here is a brief translation guide.  Many of these equivalents are not exact; for more
     detailed information, see the definitions in the <u>Reference</u> section.

           <u>sdef</u>              <u>code</u>
           class             class
           class-extension   category
           property          property (ObjC), member variable (C++), attribute (XML), to-one relation
           element           element (XML), to-many relation
           command, event    method (ObjC), member function (C++)
           parameter         parameter
           direct parameter  self (ObjC), this (C++)

<b>STRUCTURE</b>
     There are two broad categories of elements:

     <u>terminology</u> <u>element</u>: An element that defines a term usable in a script: class, command, contents, enu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">merator,&nbsp;enumerator,</font>
           merator, event, parameter, property, record-type, and value-type.

     <u>implementation</u> <u>element</u>: An element that holds implementation information for a particular application
           framework.  Currently, the only implementation element is the <u>cocoa</u> element.

     The element structure of an sdef is as follows.  Indentation shows containment, and `*', `+', and `?'
     have their usual EBNF meanings: `*' means zero or more, `+' means one or more, and `?' means zero or
     one (i.e., optional).

           dictionary (the root element)
                 suite+
                       (class | class-extension | command | enumeration | event | record-type | value-type)
                       +

           enumeration
                 enumerator+

           record-type
                 property+

           class | class-extension
                 contents?
                 property*
                 element*
                       accessor*
                 responds-to*

           command | event
                 direct-parameter?
                 parameter*
                 result?

     The elements listed above may also contain documentation, implementation, synonym, and xref elements,
     as noted here:

     <u>element</u>         <u>occurs</u> <u>in</u>
     documentation   dictionary, suite, and all terminology elements
     implementation  all but dictionary
     synonym         all terminology elements
     xref            suite children: class, class-extension, command, enumeration, event, record-type, and
                     value-type.

   <b>Including</b> <b>Other</b> <b>Scripting</b> <b>Definitions</b>
     If you wish to re-export scripting features from a framework your application links to, such as AppKit,
     you should include the sdef of that framework in your own.  (Sdef-based applications have only the
     scripting interface that they explicitly declare.  This is in contrast to the older scriptSuite scheme,
     which would automatically import scripting interface from any loaded bundles.)

     To do this, use an XInclude element (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude)"><u>http://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude</u>)</u></a><u> pointing to the desired file.
     Sdefs for system frameworks are located in <u>/System/Library/ScriptingDefinitions</u>.  For example, the sdef
     for a typical Cocoa application would begin with this:

       &lt;dictionary xmlns:xi="<a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude</u></a><u>"&gt;
         &lt;<a href="xi:includehref="file:///System/Library/ScriptingDefinitions/CocoaStandard.sdef"xpointer="xpointer(/dictionary/suite)"/">xi:include</a>
           <a href="xi:includehref="file:///System/Library/ScriptingDefinitions/CocoaStandard.sdef"xpointer="xpointer(/dictionary/suite)"/">href="file:///System/Library/ScriptingDefinitions/CocoaStandard.sdef"</a>
           <a href="xi:includehref="file:///System/Library/ScriptingDefinitions/CocoaStandard.sdef"xpointer="xpointer(/dictionary/suite)"/">xpointer="xpointer(/dictionary/suite)"</a>
         <a href="xi:includehref="file:///System/Library/ScriptingDefinitions/CocoaStandard.sdef"xpointer="xpointer(/dictionary/suite)"/">/</a>
         ...

     By using inclusion instead of copying and pasting, your application will automatically stay up to date
     with changes to the framework.  Only include a framework sdef if you also link to that framework; oth-
     erwise you run the risk of your application interface disagreeing with what it actually implements.

<b>REFERENCE</b>
   <b>Common</b> <b>Attributes</b>
     The following attributes are common to several of the element types described below.

     name         For terminology elements, the scripting term for the element.  Names must be one or more C
                  identifiers (i.e., [A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*) separated by a space.  (Other elements have
                  name attributes too, but for different purposes and with different content rules.)

     id           (optional) A unique identifier for the element.  Use one when you want to refer to one of
                  a set of identically named elements in a <u>responds-to</u> or <u>xref</u> element.

     code         The four-character code (eight-character for verbs) for the element.  AppleScript and the
                  Apple Event Manager use these codes to handle dispatching.  ``Character'' is something of
                  a misnomer; a four-character code is really four bytes of data expressed as a string of
                  four characters in the Mac OS Roman encoding.  A code may also be expressed as hexadecimal
                  data with a leading ``0x''.  For example, ``ABCD'' and ``0x41424344'' are equivalent.
                  This is useful when one of the bytes is not in the printable ASCII range of 0x20 to 0x7E,
                  such as the code ``0x00000001''.

     type         The type of an element, property, or parameter.  The value must be one of the primitive
                  types `any', `text', `integer', `real', `number', `boolean', `specifier', `location
                  specifier', `record', `date', `file', `point', `rectangle', `type', or `missing value', or
                  the name of a class, enumeration, record-type, or value-type defined elsewhere in the
                  sdef.  To specify a complex type such as ``list of integer'' or ``number or text'', use a
                  <u>type</u> element as described below.  Usage of type attributes changed significantly in Mac OS
                  X 10.4; see <u>History</u> for details.

     description  (optional) A short description of the element.

     hidden       (optional) If an element is marked hidden, it is not shown in the dictionary, though it is
                  still implemented.  This is useful for obsolete or not-ready-for-prime-time scripting fea-
                  tures.  Cocoa scriptTerminology files do not support hidden terms; for best results, build
                  an `aete' into your application as well.  The value may be `yes' or `no' (the default).

   <b>Elements</b>
     <u>accessor</u>     Accessors define which access forms an element supports.  There are six forms:

                      index     numeric index (window 1)
                      name      named element (window "Bob")
                      id        unique id (file id 8727).  Ids are often numeric, but don't have to be.
                      range     a range of elements (records 4 through 12)
                      relative  relative to another object (word before paragraph 2)
                      test      objects satisfying a test (shapes whose color is blue)

                  Accessor elements are currently only useful for aetes; Cocoa Scripting ignores them and
                  figures out supported forms based on the element's properties.

                  ATTRIBUTES
                  style         index | name | id | range | relative | test

     <u>class</u>        An abstract object definition that lists the properties, elements, and supported verbs for
                  instances of that class.  Class instances are called ``objects.''

                  CONTAINS
                  implementation?, synonym*, contents?, element*, property*, responds-to*

                  ATTRIBUTES
                  name          As above.
                  id            As above.
                  code          As above.
                  description   As above.
                  hidden        As above.
                  plural        (optional) The plural name of the class.  If omitted, defaults to the name
                                with `s' appended.
                  inherits      (optional) The class, if any, that this one descends from.

     <u>class-extension</u>
                  An extension to an existing class; in Objective-C terms, a category.  Use one of these
                  when you want to add behavior to an existing class, such as the base ``application''
                  class, without defining a subclass.  You can also use it to break a class definition
                  across multiple suites.  A <u>class-extension</u> has mostly the same content as a <u>class</u>, but
                  because it is extending an existing class, it does not define its own name or code, but
                  instead an `extends' attribute.

                  A <u>class-extension</u> may have a <u>cocoa</u> element, depending on how it is implemented: despite
                  its resemblance to an Objective-C category, the implementation of a <u>class-extension</u> may in
                  fact be a subclass.  For example, when defining your own document class, the sdef would
                  extend the standard ``document'' definition, but the implementation would be a subclass of
                  NSDocument.  If the implementation is an Objective-C category, then a <u>cocoa</u> element is not
                  required; if it is a subclass, then use a <u>cocoa</u> element with a `class' attribute naming
                  the subclass.

                  CONTAINS
                  synonym*, contents?, element*, property*, responds-to*

                  ATTRIBUTES
                  extends       The name of the class this element extends.
                  id            As above.
                  description   As above.
                  hidden        As above.

     <u>cocoa</u>        Holds implementation information for Cocoa Scripting.  Use the appropriate attribute for
                  the containing element to describe the relevant bit of Cocoa implementation.

                  ATTRIBUTES
                  class         An Objective-C class name: use for classes and the CommandClass of verbs.
                  key           A string key for an NSDictionary of parameters, or a KVC key name for a
                                property or element.
                  method        An Objective-C method name: use for responds-to methods.
                  boolean-value, string-value, integer-value
                                A value for an enumerator.  For `boolean-value', the value may be YES or NO;
                                for `string-value', any text; and for `integer-value', any integer.  You may
                                use at most one of these three attributes in a given <u>cocoa</u> element.  The
                                default value is the numeric value of the enumerator's `code' attribute.
                  name          A name used internally by Cocoa Scripting: use for suites, command and event
                                key names, enumerations, and enumerators.

                  <u>cocoa</u> elements are optional; if omitted, <a href="../man1/sdp.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/sdp">sdp(1)</a> will generate a default name.  The basic
                  rule is to capitalize each word of the element's name except the first, and then to remove
                  any spaces.  There are two special cases: classes also capitalize the first word, and ele-
                  ments start with the plural of the specified element type.  For example:

                  <u>element</u>                               <u>default</u> <u>name</u>
                  &lt;class name="refresh rate"&gt;           RefreshRate
                  &lt;property name="current resolution"&gt;  currentResolution
                  &lt;element type="monitor"&gt;              monitors

                  This default name becomes the `class' for classes, the `key' for properties, elements, and
                  parameters, and the `name' for suites, verbs, enumerations, and enumerators.  In Cocoa,
                  verbs are implemented by a class, which Cocoa refers to in scriptSuite files as the
                  CommandClass; the default is always NSScriptCommand.  An explicit <u>cocoa</u> element is only
                  necessary if you want to override these defaults.

                  <u>WARNING</u>: The above is correct for <a href="../man1/sdp.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/sdp">sdp(1)</a>, but not for Cocoa Scripting.  See <u>Bugs</u>.

     <u>command</u>      (aka method, member function; see also <u>event</u>) Commands and events, collectively called
                  ``verbs,'' are messages that may be sent to an object.  For documentation purposes, sdefs
                  distinguish between <u>command</u>s, which are verbs a script would send to an object (e.g.,
                  ``close''), and <u>event</u>s, which are notifications sent to an object by a framework or system
                  service (e.g., ``did close'').

                  Unlike most object-oriented languages, verbs are defined independently of any particular
                  class; a class may then list the verbs that it responds to.  To Java and Objective-C pro-
                  grammers, sdef verbs therefore resemble protocols more than member functions.  You may
                  specify the same command more than once with different parameters, such as to define a
                  polymorphic ``open'' command that has different parameters depending on whether it is
                  applied to a document or a database.

                  CONTAINS
                  implementation?, synonym*, direct-parameter?, parameter*, result?

                  ATTRIBUTES
                  name          As above.
                  id            As above.
                  code          As above; event codes are eight characters.

     <u>contents</u>     <u>contents</u> is a special type of <u>property</u>: like a <u>property</u>, it defines a unique data member,
                  but its name and code are optional; if omitted, they default to ``contents'' and `pcnt',
                  respectively.  There may be at most one contents element in a class.

                  In addition, Cocoa Scripting will treat the contents property as its class's implied con-
                  tainer: scripts may refer to properties and elements of the contents property as if they
                  belong to the class.  For example, TextEdit documents have a ``text'' contents property.
                  Technically, the first word of a document is ``word 1 of text of document 1'', but because
                  ``text'' is an implied container, a script can also say ``word 1 of document 1''.

     <u>dictionary</u>   The root element of an sdef.

                  suite+

                  ATTRIBUTES
                  title         (optional) The title of the dictionary, which appears in the dictionary dis-
                                play.

     <u>direct-parameter</u>
                  <u>direct-parameter</u> is a special type of <u>parameter</u>: like a <u>parameter</u>, it defines a value
                  included with a verb, but it has no `name' or `code' attribute, and may not be hidden.
                  There may be at most one direct-parameter element in a verb.

                  The direct parameter of a verb is a value that appears immediately after the verb and
                  specifies its target.  The type of the direct parameter is usually an application class.
                  For example, in the command ``close window 1'', the direct parameter is ``window 1''.  Not
                  all verbs have a direct parameter; in such cases, omit this element.

                  In Cocoa Scripting, the direct parameter is the object to which the message is sent (i.e.,
                  ``self'') <u>if</u> the direct parameter is an application class.  Otherwise, the message is sent
                  to the application object with the direct parameter's value as a normal parameter.

     <u>documentation</u>
                  When an element needs more exposition than a simple `description' attribute can provide,
                  use a documentation element.  A documentation element may contain any number of html ele-
                  ments, which contain text that will be displayed at that point in the dictionary.  The
                  text may contain HTML markup tags, but in order to keep the XML processor from interpret-
                  ing them as XML, they must be escaped using either entities or a CDATA section, for exam-
                  ple:

     <u>element</u>      (aka to-many relation.) An object contained in another one.  An object may have any number
                  of elements of a given class, including none at all, and may have any number of element
                  classes.  For example, the documents of an application are elements.

     <u>enumeration</u>  A list of symbolic constants (<u>enumerator</u>s).  For example, the type of the ``saving''
                  parameter for ``close'' is the enumeration yes/no/ask.

     <u>property</u>     (aka field, instance variable, to-one relation.) A unique data member of an object.  Prop-
                  erties always have a name, and there is always exactly one of them with a given name in an
                  object.  For example, the name of a document is a property.

     <u>record-type</u>  A simple structure, as opposed to a class.  (In C terms, a ``POD'' or ``plain old data''
                  type.)  Points, rectangles, and print settings are all record-types.

     <u>responds-to</u>  Defines a verb that a class responds to.  Cocoa Scripting only requires these in order to
                  define a custom method for handling a verb (see <u>cocoa</u>); they are otherwise purely for doc-
                  umentation.

     <u>result</u>       The type of value generated when a verb is executed.  If there is no result, omit this

                  attributes and may not be hidden or optional.

     <u>suite</u>        A collection of related terms.  Suites are purely an organizational aid to the user; they
                  have no impact on scripts.  There is no technical limit on how many items a suite can con-
                  tain, but 10 to 15 items is considered a comfortable size.

                  description   As above.

     <u>synonym</u>      Defines an alternate term or code for the main element.

                  ATTRIBUTES
                  name          The alternate name, which follows the rules for terminology element names.
                  code          The alternate code.
                  hidden        As above.

                  At least one of `name' or `code' is required.  Depending on which attributes are present,
                  the element will have different effects:

                      <u>Name</u> <u>only</u>
                      Use these to define an alternate term that may be used at compile time.  It will
                      decompile as the main term.  For example, AppleScript uses ``app'' as a name-only syn-
                      onym for ``application''.  Cocoa scriptTerminology files do not support these; gener-
                      ate an `aete' resource for your application as well.

                      <u>Code</u> <u>only</u>
                      Use these when migrating from one code to another.  (Typically, this happens when
                      correcting an older version of the dictionary which used a non-standard code.)  Com-
                      piled scripts that use the synonym code will decompile using the main term.  Code-only
                      synonyms are implicitly hidden.  Because of how Cocoa scriptSuite files work, they
                      must contain a <u>cocoa</u> element with a `method' or `key' attribute in order to generate a
                      correct scriptSuite file.

                      <u>Name</u> <u>and</u> <u>Code</u>
                      Use these to define an alternate term that is preserved across compilation.  Effec-
                      tively, this is a separate term that happens to act the same as the main one.  As with
                      code-only synonyms, they must contain a <u>cocoa</u> element to generate a correct script-
                      Suite file.

                  Sdef synonym elements have nothing to do with `Synonyms' sections in Cocoa's suite defini-
                  tion files. Those are a trick to allow two different classes in the dictionary to share
                  the same implementation class; this is necessary because suite definition files use the
                  implementation class name as a key.  If you have two classes that happen to share the same
                  implementation, declare them separately, and point their <u>cocoa</u> elements at the same class.
                  <a href="../man1/sdp.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/sdp">sdp(1)</a> will do the right thing and generate a `Synonyms' section for you.

     <u>type</u>         Any element that has a type attribute may instead have one or more type elements.  (Using
                  both in the same element is an error.) Using more than one type element indicates that any
                  of the types are allowed; using the `list' attribute indicates a list of the specified
                  type.  Using type elements inside type elements, such as to express ``list of list of
                  integer'', is not currently supported.

                  type          As above.

                  EXAMPLES

                  &lt;/property&gt;

     <u>value-type</u>   A simple type definition.  A value-type has no properties and no elements accessible by
                  your scripting; it is useful for defining new basic types, such as an image.

                  <u>cocoa</u> elements for value-type elements should declare the backing Cocoa class (typically
                  NSData) using the `class' attribute, and may also declare the qualifier name using the
                  `name' attribute, but this is only used inside the scriptSuite file.  For example, an
                  ``image'' type might be declared like this:

                        &lt;value-type name="image" code="PICT"&gt;
                            &lt;cocoa class="NSData" name="Image"/&gt;
                        &lt;/value-type&gt;

     <u>xref</u>         A cross-reference.  These are purely for documentation purposes; use one to refer to
                  another <u>suite</u> child that is somehow related.  For example, ``open'' might have a cross-
                  reference to ``close''.  The cross-referenced element does not need to be of the same type
                  as the original; a <u>class</u> may refer to a <u>command</u>, for example.

     Changes in Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard):

     <b></b><b><u>oo</u></b>   Added xref elements.

     <b></b><b><u>oo</u></b>   html elements (children of documentation elements) are now declared to contain text, not XHTML ele-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ments.&nbsp;elements.</font>
         ments.  For example:

               <u>before:</u>  &lt;html&gt;&lt;b&gt;Important&lt;/b&gt;&lt;html&gt;

               <u>after:</u>   &lt;html&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;b&gt;Important&lt;/b&gt;]]&gt;&lt;html&gt;

         Both forms work in 10.4 and 10.5, but the former is now deprecated.

     <b></b><b><u>oo</u></b>   The `name' attribute of responds-to elements is now called `command', and may be an id or a name.

     Changes in Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger):

     <b></b><b><u>oo</u></b>   ``collector'' elements such as classes, types, and properties no longer exist.  Their former chil-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dren&nbsp;children</font>
         dren should be moved to their immediate ancestor element.  In general, children may be freely mixed
         now.  For example, placing a command element next to a class element is perfectly acceptable.

     <b></b><b><u>oo</u></b>   Some primitive types changed their names: `string' is now `text', `object' is now `specifier', and
         `location' is now `location specifier'.

     <b></b><b><u>oo</u></b>   Complex types such as `list of integer' or `number or text' are now expressed using type elements,
         not complex strings.  For example:

               <u>before:</u>
               &lt;property name="tabs" type="list of integer"/&gt;

               <u>after:</u>
               &lt;property name="tabs"&gt;
                   &lt;type type="integer" list="yes"/&gt;
               &lt;/property&gt;

               <u>before:</u>
               &lt;property name="frequency" type="number | text"/&gt;

               <u>after:</u>
               &lt;property name="frequency"&gt;
                   &lt;type type="number"/&gt;
                   &lt;type type="text"/&gt;
               &lt;/property&gt;

         See the <u>type</u> documentation for complete details.

     <b></b><b><u>oo</u></b>   Boolean attributes, that is, optional and hidden, now accept `yes' and `no' as values (formerly the
         attribute name, e.g. `hidden="hidden"').

     <b></b><b><u>oo</u></b>   The not-in-properties attribute is now named in-properties; its possible values are `yes' (the
         default) and `no'.

     <b></b><b><u>oo</u></b>   cocoa elements of property and element elements now use a `key' attribute (formerly `method').

     <b></b><b><u>oo</u></b>   The default Cocoa key for element elements is now the type's plural (formerly its name).

<b>BUGS</b>
     Cocoa Scripting requires cocoa elements in some places that should be optional: class, parameter,
     responds-to, and value-type elements all <u>must</u> have cocoa sub-elements.
