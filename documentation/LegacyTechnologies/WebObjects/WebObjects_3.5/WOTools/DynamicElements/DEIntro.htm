<h1> Introduction to Dynamic Elements</h1>

</a><a name="6189">

A <em>dynamic element</em> is an element whose exact HTML representation isn't determined until run time. Dynamic elements are represented in the HTML template by the tag &lt;WEBOBJECT&gt;.<p>

</a><a name="6255">

There are several types of dynamic elements that you can use in your WebObjects applications. Some of them (such as dynamic forms or images) have counterparts in standard HTML (&lt;FORM&gt; and &lt;IMG&gt;) and are always translated into those counterparts at run time. Others (such as conditionals and repetitions) are <em>abstract</em> dynamic elements, which don't translate directly into HTML but control the generation of other elements.<p>

This chapter describes the techniques you use to add dynamic elements to your components and to bind them to variables and methods in your code. For more information on programming with dynamic elements, see "Dynamic Elements"</a> in the <em>WebObjects Developer's Guide</em>. For details about specific dynamic elements, see the <a href = "../Reference/DynamicElements/DynamicElementsTOC.html"><em>Dynamic Elements Reference</a></em>. <p>
