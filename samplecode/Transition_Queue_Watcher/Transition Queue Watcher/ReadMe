Transition Queue Watcher v1.0.1Since the previous release of the ATQWatcher program, a bug has been discoveredwith the glue code for the two LAP Manager calls, LAPAddATQ and for LAPRmvATQ.These bugs have been fixed by implementing replacement glue code functions -LAPAddATQFix and for LAPRmvATQFix.  This was done to remove any dependency onthe version of the Interface.o library supplied for MPW.  Note that Think 5.0users will encounter the same problem as their library routines are based onthe same Interface.o library.The bug involves the fact that the glue code leaves the stack off by two bytesupon return from the LAP Manager call.  At one point, the LAP Manager functionresult in register A0 should simply be moved onto the stack pointed to by A7.Instead the stack is pre-decremented 2 bytes, before the return result ismoved.
