HOSTS_ACCESS(5)                                                                              HOSTS_ACCESS(5)



<b>NAME</b>
       hosts_access - format of host access control files

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       This  manual  page  describes  a  simple  access  control  language  that  is  based  on client (host
       name/address, user name), and server (process name, host name/address) patterns.  Examples are  given
       at  the end. The impatient reader is encouraged to skip to the EXAMPLES section for a quick introduc-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion.&nbsp;introduction.</font>
       tion.

       An extended version of the access control language is described in the <a href="hosts_options.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/hosts_options"><u>hosts</u><b>_</b><u>options</u>(5)</a> document. The
       extensions  are turned on at program build time by building with -DPROCESS_OPTIONS.  These extensions
       are enabled on Mac OS X.

       In the following text, <u>daemon</u> is the the process name of a network daemon process, and <u>client</u> is  the
       name  and/or  address of a host requesting service. Network daemon process names are specified in the
       inetd configuration file.

<b>ACCESS</b> <b>CONTROL</b> <b>FILES</b>
       The access control software consults two files. The search stops at the first match:

             Access will be granted when a (daemon,client) pair matches an entry  in  the  <u>/etc/hosts.allow</u>
              file.

             Otherwise,  access  will  be  denied  when  a  (daemon,client)  pair  matches  an entry in the
              <u>/etc/hosts.deny</u> file.

             Otherwise, access will be granted.

       A non-existing access control file is treated as if it were an empty file. Thus, access  control  can
       be turned off by providing no access control files.

<b>ACCESS</b> <b>CONTROL</b> <b>RULES</b>
       Each  access control file consists of zero or more lines of text.  These lines are processed in order
       of appearance. The search terminates when a match is found.

             A newline character is ignored when it is preceded by a backslash character. This permits  you
              to break up long lines so that they are easier to edit.

             Blank  lines or lines that begin with a `#' character are ignored.  This permits you to insert
              comments and whitespace so that the tables are easier to read.

             All other lines should satisfy the following format, things between [] being optional:

                 daemon_list : client_list [ : shell_command ]

       <u>daemon</u><b>_</b><u>list</u> is a list of one or more daemon process names (argv[0] values) or wildcards (see  below).

       <u>client</u><b>_</b><u>list</u>  is  a  list of one or more host names, host addresses, patterns or wildcards (see below)
       that will be matched against the client host name or address.

       The more complex forms <u>daemon@host</u> and <u>user@host</u> are explained in the  sections  on  server  endpoint
       patterns and on client username lookups, respectively.

       List elements should be separated by blanks and/or commas.

       With the exception of NIS (YP) netgroup lookups, all access control checks are case insensitive.

<b>PATTERNS</b>
       The access control language implements the following patterns:

             A  string  that  begins with a `.' character. A host name is matched if the last components of
              its name match the specified pattern.  For example, the pattern  `.tue.nl'  matches  the  host
              name `wzv.win.tue.nl'.

             A string that ends with a `.' character. A host address is matched if its first numeric fields
              match the given string.  For example, the pattern `131.155.' matches the address  of  (almost)
              every host on the Eindhoven University network (131.155.x.x).

             A string that begins with an `@' character is treated as an NIS (formerly YP) netgroup name. A
              host name is matched if it is a host member of the specified netgroup.  Netgroup  matches  are
              not supported for daemon process names or for client user names.

             An  expression  of  the  form  `n.n.n.n/m.m.m.m'  is  interpreted as a `net/mask' pair. A host
              address is matched if `net' is equal to the bitwise AND of the address  and  the  `mask'.  For
              example,  the net/mask pattern `131.155.72.0/255.255.254.0' matches every address in the range
              `131.155.72.0' through `131.155.73.255'.

<b>WILDCARDS</b>
       The access control language supports explicit wildcards:

       ALL    The universal wildcard, always matches.

       LOCAL  Matches any host whose name does not contain a dot character.

       UNKNOWN
              Matches any user whose name is unknown, and  matches  any  host  whose  name  <u>or</u>  address  are
              unknown.   This  pattern should be used with care: host names may be unavailable due to tempo-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rary&nbsp;temporary</font>
              rary name server problems. A network address will be unavailable when the software cannot fig-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ure&nbsp;figure</font>
              ure out what type of network it is talking to.

       KNOWN  Matches  any  user whose name is known, and matches any host whose name <u>and</u> address are known.
              This pattern should be used with care: host names may be unavailable  due  to  temporary  name
              server  problems.   A  network address will be unavailable when the software cannot figure out
              what type of network it is talking to.

       PARANOID
              Matches any host whose name does not match its address.  When tcpd is  built  with  -DPARANOID
              (default  mode), it drops requests from such clients even before looking at the access control
              tables.  Build without -DPARANOID when you want more control over such requests.

<b>OPERATORS</b>
       EXCEPT Intended use is of the form: `list_1 EXCEPT list_2';  this  construct  matches  anything  that
              matches  <u>list</u><b>_</b><u>1</u> unless it matches <u>list</u><b>_</b><u>2</u>.  The EXCEPT operator can be used in daemon_lists and
              in client_lists. The EXCEPT operator can be nested: if the control language would  permit  the
              use of parentheses, `a EXCEPT b EXCEPT c' would parse as `(a EXCEPT (b EXCEPT c))'.

<b>SHELL</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       If  the  first-matched  access  control  rule  contains a shell command, that command is subjected to
       %&lt;letter&gt; substitutions (see next section).  The result is executed by a <u>/bin/sh</u> child  process  with
       standard input, output and error connected to <u>/dev/null</u>.  Specify an `&amp;' at the end of the command if
       you do not want to wait until it has completed.

       Shell commands should not rely on the PATH setting of the inetd.  Instead, they should  use  absolute
       path names, or they should begin with an explicit PATH=whatever statement.

       The  <a href="hosts_options.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/hosts_options"><u>hosts</u><b>_</b><u>options</u>(5)</a> document describes an alternative language that uses the shell command field in
       a different and incompatible way.

<b>%</b> <b>EXPANSIONS</b>
       The following expansions are available within shell commands:

       %a (%A)
              The client (server) host address.

       %c     Client information: user@host, user@address, a host name, or just an address, depending on how
              much information is available.

       %d     The daemon process name (argv[0] value).

       %h (%H)
              The client (server) host name or address, if the host name is unavailable.

       %n (%N)
              The client (server) host name (or "unknown" or "paranoid").

       %p     The daemon process id.

       %s     Server  information: daemon@host, daemon@address, or just a daemon name, depending on how much
              information is available.

       %u     The client user name (or "unknown").

       %%     Expands to a single `%' character.

       Characters in % expansions that may confuse the shell are replaced by underscores.

<b>SERVER</b> <b>ENDPOINT</b> <b>PATTERNS</b>
       In order to distinguish clients by the network address that they connect  to,  use  patterns  of  the
       form:

          process_name@host_pattern : client_list ...

       Patterns  like  these  can  be  used when the machine has different internet addresses with different
       internet hostnames.  Service providers can use this facility to offer FTP,  GOPHER  or  WWW  archives
       with  internet  names that may even belong to different organizations. See also the `twist' option in
       the <a href="hosts_options.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/hosts_options">hosts_options(5)</a> document. Some systems (Solaris,  FreeBSD)  can  have  more  than  one  internet
       address  on  one  physical interface; with other systems you may have to resort to SLIP or PPP pseudo
       interfaces that live in a dedicated network address space.

       The host_pattern obeys the same syntax rules as host names and addresses in client_list context. Usu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ally,&nbsp;Usually,</font>
       ally, server endpoint information is available only with connection-oriented services.

<b>CLIENT</b> <b>USERNAME</b> <b>LOOKUP</b>
       When  the  client host supports the RFC 931 protocol or one of its descendants (TAP, IDENT, RFC 1413)
       the wrapper programs can retrieve additional information about the  owner  of  a  connection.  Client
       username  information,  when available, is logged together with the client host name, and can be used
       to match patterns like:

          daemon_list : ... user_pattern@host_pattern ...

       The daemon wrappers can be configured  at  compile  time  to  perform  rule-driven  username  lookups
       (default) or to always interrogate the client host.  In the case of rule-driven username lookups, the
       above rule would cause username lookup only when both the <u>daemon</u><b>_</b><u>list</u> and the <u>host</u><b>_</b><u>pattern</u> match.

       A user pattern has the same syntax as a daemon process pattern, so the same wildcards apply (netgroup
       membership is not supported).  One should not get carried away with username lookups, though.

             The client username information cannot be trusted when it is needed most, i.e. when the client
              system has been compromised.  In general, ALL and (UN)KNOWN are the only  user  name  patterns
              that make sense.

             Username lookups are possible only with TCP-based services, and only when the client host runs
              a suitable daemon; in all other cases the result is "unknown".

             A well-known UNIX kernel bug may cause loss of service when username lookups are blocked by  a
              firewall.  The  wrapper  README  document describes a procedure to find out if your kernel has
              this bug.

             Username lookups may cause noticeable delays for non-UNIX  users.   The  default  timeout  for
              username lookups is 10 seconds: too short to cope with slow networks, but long enough to irri-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tate&nbsp;irritate</font>
              tate PC users.

       Selective username lookups can alleviate the last problem. For example, a rule like:

          daemon_list : @pcnetgroup ALL@ALL

       would match members of the pc netgroup without doing username lookups,  but  would  perform  username
       lookups with all other systems.

<b>DETECTING</b> <b>ADDRESS</b> <b>SPOOFING</b> <b>ATTACKS</b>
       A  flaw  in  the  sequence number generator of many TCP/IP implementations allows intruders to easily
       impersonate trusted hosts and to break in via, for example, the  remote  shell  service.   The  IDENT
       (RFC931 etc.)  service can be used to detect such and other host address spoofing attacks.

       Before accepting a client request, the wrappers can use the IDENT service to find out that the client
       did not send the request at all.  When the client host  provides  IDENT  service,  a  negative  IDENT
       lookup result (the client matches `UNKNOWN@host') is strong evidence of a host spoofing attack.

       A  positive IDENT lookup result (the client matches `KNOWN@host') is less trustworthy. It is possible
       for an intruder to spoof both the client connection and the IDENT lookup, although doing so  is  much
       harder  than  spoofing  just  a  client  connection. It may also be that the client's IDENT server is
       lying.

       Note: IDENT lookups don't work with UDP services.

<b>EXAMPLES</b>
       The language is flexible enough that different types of access control policy can be expressed with a
       minimum  of  fuss. Although the language uses two access control tables, the most common policies can
       be implemented with one of the tables being trivial or even empty.

       When reading the examples below it is important to realize that the allow table is scanned before the
       deny  table,  that  the  search  terminates when a match is found, and that access is granted when no
       match is found at all.

       The examples use host and domain names. They can be improved by including address and/or network/net-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mask&nbsp;network/netmask</font>
       mask information, to reduce the impact of temporary name server lookup failures.

<b>MOSTLY</b> <b>CLOSED</b>
       In this case, access is denied by default. Only explicitly authorized hosts are permitted access.

       The default policy (no access) is implemented with a trivial deny file:

       /etc/hosts.deny:
          ALL: ALL

       This  denies all service to all hosts, unless they are permitted access by entries in the allow file.

       The explicitly authorized hosts are listed in the allow file.  For example:

       /etc/hosts.allow:
          ALL: LOCAL @some_netgroup
          ALL: .foobar.edu EXCEPT terminalserver.foobar.edu

       The first rule permits access from hosts in the local domain (no `.' in the host name) and from  mem-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">bers&nbsp;members</font>
       bers  of the <u>some</u><b>_</b><u>netgroup</u> netgroup.  The second rule permits access from all hosts in the <u>foobar.edu</u>
       domain (notice the leading dot), with the exception of <u>terminalserver.foobar.edu</u>.

<b>MOSTLY</b> <b>OPEN</b>
       Here, access is granted by default; only explicitly specified hosts are refused service.

       The default policy (access granted) makes the allow file redundant so that it can  be  omitted.   The
       explicitly non-authorized hosts are listed in the deny file. For example:

       /etc/hosts.deny:
          ALL: some.host.name, .some.domain
          ALL EXCEPT in.fingerd: other.host.name, .other.domain

       The  first  rule  denies  some  hosts  and domains all services; the second rule still permits finger
       requests from other hosts and domains.

<b>BOOBY</b> <b>TRAPS</b>
       The next example permits tftp requests from hosts in the  local  domain  (notice  the  leading  dot).
       Requests  from  any other hosts are denied.  Instead of the requested file, a finger probe is sent to
       the offending host. The result is mailed to the superuser.

       /etc/hosts.allow:
          in.tftpd: LOCAL, .my.domain

       /etc/hosts.deny:
          in.tftpd: ALL: (/some/where/safe_finger -l @%h | \
               /usr/ucb/mail -s %d-%h root) &amp;

       The safe_finger command comes with the tcpd wrapper and should be installed in a suitable  place.  It
       limits  possible  damage from data sent by the remote finger server.  It gives better protection than
       the standard finger command.

       The expansion of the %h (client host) and %d (service name) sequences is described in the section  on
       shell commands.

       Warning: do not booby-trap your finger daemon, unless you are prepared for infinite finger loops.

       On  network  firewall  systems  this trick can be carried even further.  The typical network firewall
       only provides a limited set of services to the outer world. All other services can be  "bugged"  just
       like the above tftp example. The result is an excellent early-warning system.

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       An  error  is reported when a syntax error is found in a host access control rule; when the length of
       an access control rule exceeds the capacity of an internal buffer; when an access control rule is not
       terminated  by a newline character; when the result of %&lt;letter&gt; expansion would overflow an internal
       buffer; when a system call fails that shouldn't.  All problems are reported via the syslog daemon.

<b>FILES</b>
       /etc/hosts.allow, (daemon,client) pairs that are granted access.
       /etc/hosts.deny, (daemon,client) pairs that are denied access.
