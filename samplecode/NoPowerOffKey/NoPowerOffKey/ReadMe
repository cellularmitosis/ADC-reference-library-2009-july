NoPowerOffKey 1.2This extension disables the keyboard power key from being used to turn off a Macintosh.  Starting with System 7.5, you can turn off power by pressing the power key, just as you turn on the Macintosh by pressing the power key.  This behavior isn't appropriate for some classroom or kiosk settings.  Therefore, this extension exists.  Drop it into your system folder and restart.Starting with System 7.5.3, there is a programmatic way to turn off the power-off key behavior.  I use that call if it is available.  If not, I do a skanky hack on Alert.  (I do not recommend the patch on Alert, but sometimes, you use what is available.)There was a 1.0 version of this; it didn't work. Hence the palimpsest.  Version 1.2 fixes a minor concern, removes one line of assembly, and adds a Finder help string.  (Technogeek for "minor concern"; my definition of the UniversalProcPtr for the PowerOff gestalt function didn't include space for a return code.  It shouldn't have caused any problems, but I'm being anal.)Copyright © 1996 Apple Computer, Inc.All rights reserved.You may incorporate this sample code into your applications without	restriction, though the sample code has been provided "AS IS" and the	responsibility for its operation is 100% yours.
