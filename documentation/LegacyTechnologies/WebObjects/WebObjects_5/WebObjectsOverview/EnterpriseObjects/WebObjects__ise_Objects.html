WebObjects has mechanismsfor ensuring that the integrity of your data is maintained betweenyour application and the database without sacrificing performanceor flexibility:</font></p><dl><dt>Validation</dt><dd>A good part of your application's business logic isusually validation-for example, verifying that customers don'texceed their credit limits, return dates don't come before theircorresponding check-out dates, and so on. In your enterprise objectclasses, you implement methods that check for invalid data, andWebObjects automatically invokes them before saving anything tothe database.</dd></dl><dl><dt>Referential integrity enforcement</dt><dd>In your model you can specify rules governing the relationshipsbetween objects, such as whether a to-one relationship is optionalor mandatory. You can also specify delete rules-actions that shouldoccur when an enterprise object is deleted. For example, if youhave a "department" object you can specify that when it is deletedall the employees in that department are also deleted (a cascadingdelete), all the employees in that department are updated to haveno department (nullify), or the department deletion is rejectedif it has any employees (deny).</dd></dl><dl><dt>Automatic primary and foreign key generation</dt><dd>You needn't maintain database artifacts such as databaseprimary and foreign key values in your application; WebObjects keepstrack of them for you. Database primary and foreign keys aren'tusually meaningful parts of a business model; rather, they'reattributes created in a relational database to express relationshipsbetween entities. Key values can be generated and propagated automatically.</dd></dl><dl><dt>Transaction management</dt><dd>Most transactions are handled for you, using the nativetransaction management features of your database to group databaseoperations that correspond to the changes that have been made toenterprise objects in memory. You don't have to worry about beginning,committing, or rolling back transactions unless you want to fine-tunetransaction management behavior. WebObjects also provides a separatein-memory transaction management feature that allows you to createnested contexts in which a child context's changes are foldedinto the parent context only upon successful completion of an in-memoryoperation.</dd></dl><dl><dt>Locking</dt><dd>WebObjects offers three types of locking. "Pessimistic"uses your database server's native locking mechanism to lock rowsas they're fetched and prevents update conflicts by never allowingtwo users to look at the same object at the same time. "Optimistic"doesn't detect update conflicts until you try to save an object'schanges to the database; if the corresponding database row has changedsince it was originally fetched, the save is aborted. "On-Demand"is a mixture of the other two: it locks an object after you fetchit but before you attempt to modify it. The lock can fail for oneof two reasons: either the corresponding database row has changedsince you fetched the object (optimistic locking), or because someoneelse already has a lock on the row (pessimistic locking).</dd></dl><dl><dt>Faulting</dt><dd>When WebObjects fetches an object, it creates objectsrepresenting the destinations of the fetched object's relationships.By default WebObjects doesn't immediately fetch data for the destinationobjects of relationships, however. Fetching is fairly expensive,and further, if WebObjects fetched objects related to the one explicitlyasked for, it would also have to fetch the objects related to those,and so on, until all of the interrelated rows in the database hadbeen retrieved. For many applications, this would be a waste of timeand resources. To avoid this, WebObjects creates empty destination objects,called faults, that fetch their data the first time they're accessed.This process, known as "faulting," is automatic.</dd></dl><dl><dt>Uniquing</dt><dd>In marrying relational databases to object-orientedprogramming, one of the key requirements is that a row in the databasebe associated with only one enterprise object in a given contextin your application. WebObjects maintains the mapping of each enterpriseobject to its corresponding database row, and uses this informationto ensure that, within a given context, your object set does notinclude two (possibly inconsistent) objects for the same databaserow. Uniquing of enterprise objects, as this process is called,reduces memory usage and allows you to know with confidence thatthe object you're interacting with represents the true state ofits associated row as it was last fetched.</dd></dl>    <br><a href="Mapping_You_base_Tables.html" target="_right"><img src="../Images/previous.gif" border="0" alt="Previous"></a><a href="The_Enterpr_s_Advantage.html" target="_right"><img src="../Images/next.gif" border="0" alt="Next"></a>&nbsp;<p><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="1">&#169; 2001 Apple Computer, Inc.</font></p><!-- start of footer --><!--#include virtual="/includes/framesetfooter" --><!-- end of footer --></body></html>
