JNI Sample
A demonstration of a Java application built in ProjectBuilder that calls native code through JNI.

This example shows:
Calling into a dylib from a JNI library.
Using the shell scripts build phase to execute the command line tool javah.
Using the copy files build phase to copy the jni, and dylib libraries into the bundle.
Using a makefile to build the example.

Version 2.0
6/18/2001

Version 2.0: Mac OS X
JNI Sample is built with ProjectBuilder.

Output will be set to standard out. Standard out is the console when running as a double clickable application, or the terminal when running as a command line application.

The source files of intrest are:
JNISample.java		// Contains the method that does the JNI call
ExampleJNILib.c		// Contains the native method that JNISample.java calls

ExampleDylib.c		// Contains the function called by the functioin in ExampleJNILib.c

Makefile		// A Makefile to build this example with out project builder.

Also of interest is:

The Shell script that runs javah to create the jni header file (JNISample.h) for ExampleJNILib.c
This shell script is run in the "Shell Script Build Phase" of the "Do Javah" Target.
            
The "Copy Files Build Phase" of the JNISample target which copies the libExample.jnilib into the JNISample.app bundle.

We hope this helps people get up an running with JNI on Mac OS X.
