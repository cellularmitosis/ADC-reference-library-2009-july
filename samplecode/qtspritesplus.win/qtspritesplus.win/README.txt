README - QTSpritesPlusThis sample code shows how to use video overrides and tween tracks with sprite movies.For Windows builds using Microsoft Visual C++, the Makefile (QTSprites.mak)automatically calls Rez to create the resource file QTSprites.qtr from theinput file QTSprites.r. The .qtr file must reside in the same directory as theapplication QTSprites.exe. For final delivery of your product, you shouldinsert the .qtr file into the .exe file by using the tool RezWack.Enjoy,QuickTime Team
