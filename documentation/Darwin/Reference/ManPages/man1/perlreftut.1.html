PERLREFTUT(1)                         Perl Programmers Reference Guide                         PERLREFTUT(1)



<b>NAME</b>
       perlreftut - Mark's very short tutorial about references

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       One of the most important new features in Perl 5 was the capability to manage complicated data struc-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tures&nbsp;structures</font>
       tures like multidimensional arrays and nested hashes.  To enable these, Perl 5 introduced a feature
       called `references', and using references is the key to managing complicated, structured data in
       Perl.  Unfortunately, there's a lot of funny syntax to learn, and the main manual page can be hard to
       follow.  The manual is quite complete, and sometimes people find that a problem, because it can be
       hard to tell what is important and what isn't.

       Fortunately, you only need to know 10% of what's in the main page to get 90% of the benefit.  This
       page will show you that 10%.

<b>Who</b> <b>Needs</b> <b>Complicated</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Structures?</b>
       One problem that came up all the time in Perl 4 was how to represent a hash whose values were lists.
       Perl 4 had hashes, of course, but the values had to be scalars; they couldn't be lists.

       Why would you want a hash of lists?  Let's take a simple example: You have a file of city and country
       names, like this:

               Chicago, USA
               Frankfurt, Germany
               Berlin, Germany
               Washington, USA
               Helsinki, Finland
               New York, USA

       and you want to produce an output like this, with each country mentioned once, and then an alphabeti-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cal&nbsp;alphabetical</font>
       cal list of the cities in that country:

               Finland: Helsinki.
               Germany: Berlin, Frankfurt.
               USA:  Chicago, New York, Washington.

       The natural way to do this is to have a hash whose keys are country names.  Associated with each
       country name key is a list of the cities in that country.  Each time you read a line of input, split
       it into a country and a city, look up the list of cities already known to be in that country, and
       append the new city to the list.  When you're done reading the input, iterate over the hash as usual,
       sorting each list of cities before you print it out.

       If hash values can't be lists, you lose.  In Perl 4, hash values can't be lists; they can only be
       strings.  You lose.  You'd probably have to combine all the cities into a single string somehow, and
       then when time came to write the output, you'd have to break the string into a list, sort the list,
       and turn it back into a string.  This is messy and error-prone.  And it's frustrating, because Perl
       already has perfectly good lists that would solve the problem if only you could use them.

<b>The</b> <b>Solution</b>
       By the time Perl 5 rolled around, we were already stuck with this design: Hash values must be
       scalars.  The solution to this is references.

       A reference is a scalar value that <u>refers</u> <u>to</u> an entire array or an entire hash (or to just about any-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">thing&nbsp;anything</font>
       thing else).  Names are one kind of reference that you're already familiar with.  Think of the Presi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dent&nbsp;President</font>
       dent of the United States: a messy, inconvenient bag of blood and bones.  But to talk about him, or
       to represent him in a computer program, all you need is the easy, convenient scalar string "George
       Bush".

       References in Perl are like names for arrays and hashes.  They're Perl's private, internal names, so
       you can be sure they're unambiguous.  Unlike "George Bush", a reference only refers to one thing, and
       you always know what it refers to.  If you have a reference to an array, you can recover the entire
       array from it.  If you have a reference to a hash, you can recover the entire hash.  But the refer-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ence&nbsp;reference</font>
       ence is still an easy, compact scalar value.

       You can't have a hash whose values are arrays; hash values can only be scalars.  We're stuck with
       that.  But a single reference can refer to an entire array, and references are scalars, so you can
       have a hash of references to arrays, and it'll act a lot like a hash of arrays, and it'll be just as
       useful as a hash of arrays.

       We'll come back to this city-country problem later, after we've seen some syntax for managing refer-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ences.&nbsp;references.</font>
       ences.

<b>Syntax</b>
       There are just two ways to make a reference, and just two ways to use it once you have it.

       <b>Making</b> <b>References</b>

       <u></u><b><u>M</u></b><u></u><b><u>k</u></b> <u></u><b><u>R</u></b><u></u><b><u>l</u></b> <u></u><b><u>1</u></b>

       If you put a "\" in front of a variable, you get a reference to that variable.

           $aref = \@array;         # $aref now holds a reference to @array
           $href = \%hash;          # $href now holds a reference to %hash
           $sref = \$scalar;        # $sref now holds a reference to $scalar

       Once the reference is stored in a variable like $aref or $href, you can copy it or store it just the
       same as any other scalar value:

           $xy = $aref;             # $xy now holds a reference to @array
           $p[3] = $href;           # $p[3] now holds a reference to %hash
           $z = $p[3];              # $z now holds a reference to %hash

       These examples show how to make references to variables with names.  Sometimes you want to make an
       array or a hash that doesn't have a name.  This is analogous to the way you like to be able to use
       the string "\n" or the number 80 without having to store it in a named variable first.

       <b>Make</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>2</b>

       "[ ITEMS ]" makes a new, anonymous array, and returns a reference to that array.  "{ ITEMS }" makes a
       new, anonymous hash, and returns a reference to that hash.

           $aref = [ 1, "foo", undef, 13 ];
           # $aref now holds a reference to an array

           $href = { APR =&gt; 4, AUG =&gt; 8 };
           # $href now holds a reference to a hash

       The references you get from rule 2 are the same kind of references that you get from rule 1:

               # This:
               $aref = [ 1, 2, 3 ];

               # Does the same as this:
               @array = (1, 2, 3);
               $aref = \@array;

       The first line is an abbreviation for the following two lines, except that it doesn't create the
       superfluous array variable @array.

       If you write just "[]", you get a new, empty anonymous array.  If you write just "{}", you get a new,
       empty anonymous hash.

       <b>Using</b> <b>References</b>

       What can you do with a reference once you have it?  It's a scalar value, and we've seen that you can
       store it as a scalar and get it back again just like any scalar.  There are just two more ways to use
       it:

       <u></u><b><u>U</u></b><u></u><b><u>e</u></b> <u></u><b><u>R</u></b><u></u><b><u>l</u></b> <u></u><b><u>1</u></b>

       You can always use an array reference, in curly braces, in place of the name of an array.  For exam-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ple,&nbsp;example,</font>
       ple, "@{$aref}" instead of @array.

       Here are some examples of that:

       Arrays:

               @a              @{$aref}                An array
               reverse @a      reverse @{$aref}        Reverse the array
               $a[3]           ${$aref}[3]             An element of the array
               $a[3] = 17;     ${$aref}[3] = 17        Assigning an element

       On each line are two expressions that do the same thing.  The left-hand versions operate on the array
       @a.  The right-hand versions operate on the array that is referred to by $aref.  Once they find the
       array they're operating on, both versions do the same things to the arrays.

       Using a hash reference is <u>exactly</u> the same:

               %h              %{$href}              A hash
               keys %h         keys %{$href}         Get the keys from the hash
               $h{'red'}       ${$href}{'red'}       An element of the hash
               $h{'red'} = 17  ${$href}{'red'} = 17  Assigning an element

       Whatever you want to do with a reference, <b>Use</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>1</b> tells you how to do it.  You just write the Perl
       code that you would have written for doing the same thing to a regular array or hash, and then
       replace the array or hash name with "{$reference}".  "How do I loop over an array when all I have is
       a reference?"  Well, to loop over an array, you would write

               for my $element (@array) {
                  ...
               }

       so replace the array name, @array, with the reference:

               for my $element (@{$aref}) {
                  ...
               }

       "How do I print out the contents of a hash when all I have is a reference?"  First write the code for
       printing out a hash:

               for my $key (keys %hash) {
                 print "$key =&gt; $hash{$key}\n";
               }

       And then replace the hash name with the reference:

               for my $key (keys %{$href}) {
                 print "$key =&gt; ${$href}{$key}\n";
               }

       <u></u><b><u>U</u></b><u></u><b><u>e</u></b> <u></u><b><u>R</u></b><u></u><b><u>l</u></b> <u></u><b><u>2</u></b>

       <b>Use</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>1</b> is all you really need, because it tells you how to do absolutely everything you ever need
       to do with references.  But the most common thing to do with an array or a hash is to extract a sin-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">gle&nbsp;single</font>
       gle element, and the <b>Use</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>1</b> notation is cumbersome.  So there is an abbreviation.

       "${$aref}[3]" is too hard to read, so you can write "$aref-&gt;[3]" instead.

       "${$href}{red}" is too hard to read, so you can write "$href-&gt;{red}" instead.

       If $aref holds a reference to an array, then "$aref-&gt;[3]" is the fourth element of the array.  Don't
       confuse this with $aref[3], which is the fourth element of a totally different array, one deceptively
       named @aref.  $aref and @aref are unrelated the same way that $item and @item are.

       Similarly, "$href-&gt;{'red'}" is part of the hash referred to by the scalar variable $href, perhaps
       even one with no name.  $href{'red'} is part of the deceptively named %href hash.  It's easy to for-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">get&nbsp;forget</font>
       get to leave out the "-&gt;", and if you do, you'll get bizarre results when your program gets array and
       hash elements out of totally unexpected hashes and arrays that weren't the ones you wanted to use.

       <b>An</b> <b>Example</b>

       Let's see a quick example of how all this is useful.

       First, remember that "[1, 2, 3]" makes an anonymous array containing "(1, 2, 3)", and gives you a
       reference to that array.

       Now think about

               @a = ( [1, 2, 3],
                      [4, 5, 6],
                      [7, 8, 9]
                    );

       @a is an array with three elements, and each one is a reference to another array.

       $a[1] is one of these references.  It refers to an array, the array containing "(4, 5, 6)", and
       because it is a reference to an array, <b>Use</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>2</b> says that we can write $a[1]-&gt;[2] to get the third
       element from that array.  $a[1]-&gt;[2] is the 6.  Similarly, $a[0]-&gt;[1] is the 2.  What we have here is
       like a two-dimensional array; you can write $a[ROW]-&gt;[COLUMN] to get or set the element in any row
       and any column of the array.

       The notation still looks a little cumbersome, so there's one more abbreviation:

       <b>Arrow</b> <b>Rule</b>

       In between two <b>subscripts</b>, the arrow is optional.

       Instead of $a[1]-&gt;[2], we can write $a[1][2]; it means the same thing.  Instead of "$a[0]-&gt;[1] = 23",
       we can write "$a[0][1] = 23"; it means the same thing.

       Now it really looks like two-dimensional arrays!

       You can see why the arrows are important.  Without them, we would have had to write "${$a[1]}[2]"
       instead of $a[1][2].  For three-dimensional arrays, they let us write $x[2][3][5] instead of the
       unreadable "${${$x[2]}[3]}[5]".

<b>Solution</b>
       Here's the answer to the problem I posed earlier, of reformatting a file of city and country names.

           1   my %table;

           2   while (&lt;&gt;) {
           3    chomp;
           4     my ($city, $country) = split /, /;
           5     $table{$country} = [] unless exists $table{$country};
           6     push @{$table{$country}}, $city;
           7   }

           8   foreach $country (sort keys %table) {
           9     print "$country: ";
          10     my @cities = @{$table{$country}};
          11     print join ', ', sort @cities;
          12     print ".\n";
          13   }

       The program has two pieces: Lines 2--7 read the input and build a data structure, and lines 8-13 ana-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lyze&nbsp;analyze</font>
       lyze the data and print out the report.  We're going to have a hash, %table, whose keys are country
       names, and whose values are references to arrays of city names.  The data structure will look like
       this:

                  %table
               +-------+---+
               |       |   |   +-----------+--------+
               |Germany| *----&gt;| Frankfurt | Berlin |
               |       |   |   +-----------+--------+
               +-------+---+
               |       |   |   +----------+
               |Finland| *----&gt;| Helsinki |
               |       |   |   +----------+
               +-------+---+
               |       |   |   +---------+------------+----------+
               |  USA  | *----&gt;| Chicago | Washington | New York |
               |       |   |   +---------+------------+----------+
               +-------+---+

       We'll look at output first.  Supposing we already have this structure, how do we print it out?

           8   foreach $country (sort keys %table) {
           9     print "$country: ";
          10     my @cities = @{$table{$country}};
          11     print join ', ', sort @cities;
          12     print ".\n";
          13   }

       %table is an ordinary hash, and we get a list of keys from it, sort the keys, and loop over the keys
       as usual.  The only use of references is in line 10.  $table{$country} looks up the key $country in
       the hash and gets the value, which is a reference to an array of cities in that country.  <b>Use</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>1</b>
       says that we can recover the array by saying "@{$table{$country}}".  Line 10 is just like

               @cities = @array;

       except that the name "array" has been replaced by the reference "{$table{$country}}".  The "@" tells
       Perl to get the entire array.  Having gotten the list of cities, we sort it, join it, and print it
       out as usual.

       Lines 2-7 are responsible for building the structure in the first place.  Here they are again:

           2   while (&lt;&gt;) {
           3    chomp;
           4     my ($city, $country) = split /, /;
           5     $table{$country} = [] unless exists $table{$country};
           6     push @{$table{$country}}, $city;
           7   }

       Lines 2-4 acquire a city and country name.  Line 5 looks to see if the country is already present as
       a key in the hash.  If it's not, the program uses the "[]" notation (<b>Make</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>2</b>) to manufacture a
       new, empty anonymous array of cities, and installs a reference to it into the hash under the appro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">priate&nbsp;appropriate</font>
       priate key.

       Line 6 installs the city name into the appropriate array.  $table{$country} now holds a reference to
       the array of cities seen in that country so far.  Line 6 is exactly like

               push @array, $city;

       except that the name "array" has been replaced by the reference "{$table{$country}}".  The "push"
       adds a city name to the end of the referred-to array.

       There's one fine point I skipped.  Line 5 is unnecessary, and we can get rid of it.

           2   while (&lt;&gt;) {
           3    chomp;
           4     my ($city, $country) = split /, /;
           5   ####  $table{$country} = [] unless exists $table{$country};
           6     push @{$table{$country}}, $city;
           7   }

       If there's already an entry in %table for the current $country, then nothing is different.  Line 6
       will locate the value in $table{$country}, which is a reference to an array, and push $city into the
       array.  But what does it do when $country holds a key, say "Greece", that is not yet in %table?

       This is Perl, so it does the exact right thing.  It sees that you want to push "Athens" onto an array
       that doesn't exist, so it helpfully makes a new, empty, anonymous array for you, installs it into
       %table, and then pushes "Athens" onto it.  This is called `autovivification'--bringing things to life
       automatically.  Perl saw that they key wasn't in the hash, so it created a new hash entry automati-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cally.&nbsp;automatically.</font>
       cally. Perl saw that you wanted to use the hash value as an array, so it created a new empty array
       and installed a reference to it in the hash automatically.  And as usual, Perl made the array one
       element longer to hold the new city name.

<b>The</b> <b>Rest</b>
       I promised to give you 90% of the benefit with 10% of the details, and that means I left out 90% of
       the details.  Now that you have an overview of the important parts, it should be easier to read the
       perlref manual page, which discusses 100% of the details.

       Some of the highlights of perlref:

          You can make references to anything, including scalars, functions, and other references.

          In <b>Use</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>1</b>, you can omit the curly brackets whenever the thing inside them is an atomic scalar
           variable like $aref.  For example, @$aref is the same as "@{$aref}", and $$aref[1] is the same as
           "${$aref}[1]".  If you're just starting out, you may want to adopt the habit of always including
           the curly brackets.

          This doesn't copy the underlying array:

                   $aref2 = $aref1;

           You get two references to the same array.  If you modify "$aref1-&gt;[23]" and then look at
           "$aref2-&gt;[23]" you'll see the change.

           To copy the array, use

                   $aref2 = [@{$aref1}];

           This uses "[...]" notation to create a new anonymous array, and $aref2 is assigned a reference to
           the new array.  The new array is initialized with the contents of the array referred to by
           $aref1.

           Similarly, to copy an anonymous hash, you can use

                   $href2 = {%{$href1}};

          To see if a variable contains a reference, use the "ref" function.  It returns true if its argu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment&nbsp;argument</font>
           ment is a reference.  Actually it's a little better than that: It returns "HASH" for hash refer-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ences&nbsp;references</font>
           ences and "ARRAY" for array references.

          If you try to use a reference like a string, you get strings like

                   ARRAY(0x80f5dec)   or    HASH(0x826afc0)

           If you ever see a string that looks like this, you'll know you printed out a reference by mis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">take.&nbsp;mistake.</font>
           take.

           A side effect of this representation is that you can use "eq" to see if two references refer to
           the same thing.  (But you should usually use "==" instead because it's much faster.)

          You can use a string as if it were a reference.  If you use the string "foo" as an array refer-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ence,&nbsp;reference,</font>
           ence, it's taken to be a reference to the array @foo.  This is called a <u>soft</u> <u>reference</u> or <u>sym</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">bolic&nbsp;symbolic</font>
           <u>bolic</u> <u>reference</u>.  The declaration "use strict 'refs'" disables this feature, which can cause all
           sorts of trouble if you use it by accident.

       You might prefer to go on to perllol instead of perlref; it discusses lists of lists and multidimen-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sional&nbsp;multidimensional</font>
       sional arrays in detail.  After that, you should move on to perldsc; it's a Data Structure Cookbook
       that shows recipes for using and printing out arrays of hashes, hashes of arrays, and other kinds of
       data.

<b>Summary</b>
       Everyone needs compound data structures, and in Perl the way you get them is with references.  There
       are four important rules for managing references: Two for making references and two for using them.
       Once you know these rules you can do most of the important things you need to do with references.
