EQN(1)                                                                                                EQN(1)



<b>NAME</b>
       eqn - format equations for troff

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>eqn</b> [ <b>-rvCNR</b> ] [ <b>-d</b><u>xy</u> ] [ <b>-T</b><u>name</u> ] [ <b>-M</b><u>dir</u> ] [ <b>-f</b><u>F</u> ] [ <b>-s</b><u>n</u> ] [ <b>-p</b><u>n</u> ] [ <b>-m</b><u>n</u> ] [ <u>files...</u> ]

       It is possible to have whitespace between a command line option and its parameter.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       This  manual  page  describes  the GNU version of <b>eqn</b>, which is part of the groff document formatting
       system.  <b>eqn</b> compiles descriptions of equations embedded within <b>troff</b> input files into commands  that
       are understood by <b>troff</b>.  Normally, it should be invoked using the <b>-e</b> option of <b>groff</b>.  The syntax is
       quite compatible with Unix eqn.  The output of GNU <b>eqn</b> cannot be processed with Unix troff;  it  must
       be  processed  with GNU troff.  If no files are given on the command line, the standard input will be
       read.  A filename of <b>-</b> will cause the standard input to be read.

       <b>eqn</b> searches for the file <b>eqnrc</b>  in  the  directories  given  with  the  <b>-M</b>  option  first,  then  in
       <b>/usr/lib/groff/site-tmac</b>,  <b>/usr/share/groff/site-tmac</b>,  and  finally  in the standard macro directory
       <b>/usr/share/groff/1.19.2/tmac</b>.  If it exists, <b>eqn</b> will process it before the other input  files.   The
       <b>-R</b> option prevents this.

       GNU  <b>eqn</b>  does not provide the functionality of neqn: it does not support low-resolution, typewriter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">like&nbsp;typewriterlike</font>
       like devices (although it may work adequately for very simple input).

<b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-d</b><u>xy</u>   Specify delimiters <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> for the left and right end,  respectively,  of  in-line  equations.
              Any <b>delim</b> statements in the source file overrides this.

       <b>-C</b>     Recognize <b>.EQ</b> and <b>.EN</b> even when followed by a character other than space or newline.

       <b>-N</b>     Don't allow newlines within delimiters.  This option allows <b>eqn</b> to recover better from missing
              closing delimiters.

       <b>-v</b>     Print the version number.

       <b>-r</b>     Only one size reduction.

       <b>-m</b><u>n</u>    The minimum point-size is <u>n</u>.  <b>eqn</b> will not reduce the size of subscripts or superscripts to  a
              smaller size than <u>n</u>.

       <b>-T</b><u>name</u> The output is for device <u>name</u>.  The only effect of this is to define a macro <u>name</u> with a value
              of <b>1</b>.  Typically <b>eqnrc</b> will use this to provide definitions appropriate for the output device.
              The default output device is <b>ps</b>.

       <b>-M</b><u>dir</u>  Search <u>dir</u> for <b>eqnrc</b> before the default directories.

       <b>-R</b>     Don't load <b>eqnrc</b>.

       <b>-f</b><u>F</u>    This is equivalent to a <b>gfont</b> <u>F</u> command.

       <b>-s</b><u>n</u>    This  is  equivalent  to a <b>gsize</b> <u>n</u> command.  This option is deprecated.  <b>eqn</b> will normally set
              equations at whatever the current point size is when the equation is encountered.

       <b>-p</b><u>n</u>    This says that subscripts and superscripts should be <u>n</u> points  smaller  than  the  surrounding
              text.   This option is deprecated.  Normally <b>eqn</b> makes sets subscripts and superscripts at 70%
              of the size of the surrounding text.

<b>USAGE</b>
       Only the differences between GNU <b>eqn</b> and Unix eqn are described here.

       Most of the new features of GNU <b>eqn</b> are based on TeX.  There are some references to  the  differences
       between TeX and GNU <b>eqn</b> below; these may safely be ignored if you do not know TeX.

   <b>Automatic</b> <b>spacing</b>
       <b>eqn</b> gives each component of an equation a type, and adjusts the spacing between components using that
       type.  Possible types are:

              ordinary     an ordinary character such as `1' or `<u>x</u>';
                                                     _
              operator     a large operator such as `<u>&gt;</u>';

              binary       a binary operator such as `+';

              relation     a relation such as `=';

              opening      a opening bracket such as `(';

              closing      a closing bracket such as `)';

              punctuation  a punctuation character such as `,';

              inner        a subformula contained within brackets;

              suppress     spacing that suppresses automatic spacing adjustment.

       Components of an equation get a type in one of two ways.

       <b>type</b> <u>t</u> <u>e</u>
              This yields an equation component that contains <u>e</u> but that has type <u>t</u>, where <u>t</u> is one  of  the
              types mentioned above.  For example, <b>times</b> is defined as

                     <b>type</b> <b>"binary"</b> <b>\(mu</b>

              The name of the type doesn't have to be quoted, but quoting protects from macro expansion.

       <b>chartype</b> <u>t</u> <u>text</u>
              Unquoted  groups  of  characters are split up into individual characters, and the type of each
              character is looked up; this changes the type that is stored for each character; it says  that
              the characters in <u>text</u> from now on have type <u>t</u>.  For example,

                     <b>chartype</b> <b>"punctuation"</b> <b>.,;:</b>

              would  make the characters `.,;:' have type punctuation whenever they subsequently appeared in
              an equation.  The type <u>t</u> can also be <b>letter</b> or <b>digit</b>; in these cases <b>chartype</b> changes the font
              type of the characters.  See the <b>Fonts</b> subsection.

   <b>New</b> <b>primitives</b>
       <u>e1</u> <b>smallover</b> <u>e2</u>
              This  is  similar to <b>over</b>; <b>smallover</b> reduces the size of <u>e1</u> and <u>e2</u>; it also puts less vertical
              space between <u>e1</u> or <u>e2</u> and the fraction bar.  The <b>over</b> primitive corresponds to the TeX  <b>\over</b>
              primitive in display styles; <b>smallover</b> corresponds to <b>\over</b> in non-display styles.

       <b>vcenter</b> <u>e</u>
              This  vertically  centers <u>e</u> about the math axis.  The math axis is the vertical position about
              which characters such as `+' and `-' are centered; also it is the vertical position  used  for
              the bar of fractions.  For example, <b>sum</b> is defined as

                     <b>{</b> <b>type</b> <b>"operator"</b> <b>vcenter</b> <b>size</b> <b>+5</b> <b>\(*S</b> <b>}</b>

       <u>e1</u> <b>accent</b> <u>e2</u>
              This  sets <u>e2</u> as an accent over <u>e1</u>.  <u>e2</u> is assumed to be at the correct height for a lowercase
              letter; <u>e2</u> will be moved down according if <u>e1</u> is taller or shorter than  a  lowercase  letter.
              For example, <b>hat</b> is defined as

                     <b>accent</b> <b>{</b> <b>"^"</b> <b>}</b>

              <b>dotdot</b>, <b>dot</b>, <b>tilde</b>, <b>vec</b>, and <b>dyad</b> are also defined using the <b>accent</b> primitive.

       <u>e1</u> <b>uaccent</b> <u>e2</u>
              This sets <u>e2</u> as an accent under <u>e1</u>.  <u>e2</u> is assumed to be at the correct height for a character
              without a descender; <u>e2</u> will be moved down if <u>e1</u> has a descender.  <b>utilde</b> is pre-defined using
              <b>uaccent</b> as a tilde accent below the baseline.

       <b>split</b> <b>"</b><u>text</u><b>"</b>
              This has the same effect as simply

                     <u>text</u>

              but <u>text</u> is not subject to macro expansion because it is quoted; <u>text</u> will be split up and the
              spacing between individual characters will be adjusted.

       <b>nosplit</b> <u>text</u>
              This has the same effect as

                     <b>"</b><u>text</u><b>"</b>

              but because <u>text</u> is not quoted it will be subject to macro expansion; <u>text</u> will not  be  split
              up and the spacing between individual characters will not be adjusted.

       <u>e</u> <b>opprime</b>
              This is a variant of <b>prime</b> that acts as an operator on <u>e</u>.  It produces a different result from
              <b>prime</b> in a case such as <b>A</b> <b>opprime</b> <b>sub</b> <b>1</b>: with <b>opprime</b> the <b>1</b> will be tucked under the prime  as
              a  subscript  to  the  <b>A</b>  (as is conventional in mathematical typesetting), whereas with <b>prime</b>
              the <b>1</b> will be a subscript to the prime character.  The precedence of <b>opprime</b> is  the  same  as
              that  of <b>bar</b> and <b>under</b>, which is higher than that of everything except <b>accent</b> and <b>uaccent</b>.  In
              unquoted text a <b>'</b> that is not the first character will be treated like <b>opprime</b>.

       <b>special</b> <u>text</u> <u>e</u>
              This constructs a new object from <u>e</u> using a <a href="troff.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/troff"><b>troff</b>(1)</a> macro named  <u>text</u>.   When  the  macro  is
              called,  the  string  <b>0s</b>  will  contain the output for <u>e</u>, and the number registers <b>0w</b>, <b>0h</b>, <b>0d</b>,
              <b>0skern</b>, and <b>0skew</b> will contain the width, height, depth, subscript kern, and skew of <u>e</u>.   (The
              <u>subscript</u>  <u>kern</u> of an object says how much a subscript on that object should be tucked in; the
              <u>skew</u> of an object says how far to the right of the center of the object  an  accent  over  the
              object  should be placed.)  The macro must modify <b>0s</b> so that it will output the desired result
              with its origin at the current point, and increase the  current  horizontal  position  by  the
              width  of  the  object.  The number registers must also be modified so that they correspond to
              the result.

              For example, suppose you wanted a construct that `cancels' an expression by drawing a diagonal
              line through it.

                     <b>.EQ</b>
                     <b>define</b> <b>cancel</b> <b>'special</b> <b>Ca'</b>
                     <b>.EN</b>
                     <b>.de</b> <b>Ca</b>
                     <b>.</b>  <b>ds</b> <b>0s</b> <b>\</b>
                     <b>\Z'\\*(0s'\</b>
                     <b>\v'\\n(0du'\</b>
                     <b>\D'l</b> <b>\\n(0wu</b> <b>-\\n(0hu-\\n(0du'\</b>
                     <b>\v'\\n(0hu'</b>
                     <b>..</b>

              Then you could cancel an expression <u>e</u> with <b>cancel</b> <b>{</b> <u>e</u> <b>}</b>

              Here's a more complicated construct that draws a box round an expression:

                     <b>.EQ</b>
                     <b>define</b> <b>box</b> <b>'special</b> <b>Bx'</b>
                     <b>.EN</b>
                     <b>.de</b> <b>Bx</b>
                     <b>.</b>  <b>ds</b> <b>0s</b> <b>\</b>
                     <b>\Z'\h'1n'\\*(0s'\</b>
                     <b>\Z'\</b>
                     <b>\v'\\n(0du+1n'\</b>
                     <b>\D'l</b> <b>\\n(0wu+2n</b> <b>0'\</b>
                     <b>\D'l</b> <b>0</b> <b>-\\n(0hu-\\n(0du-2n'\</b>
                     <b>\D'l</b> <b>-\\n(0wu-2n</b> <b>0'\</b>
                     <b>\D'l</b> <b>0</b> <b>\\n(0hu+\\n(0du+2n'\</b>
                     <b>'\</b>
                     <b>\h'\\n(0wu+2n'</b>
                     <b>.</b>  <b>nr</b> <b>0w</b> <b>+2n</b>
                     <b>.</b>  <b>nr</b> <b>0d</b> <b>+1n</b>
                     <b>.</b>  <b>nr</b> <b>0h</b> <b>+1n</b>
                     <b>..</b>

       <b>space</b> <u>n</u>
              A  positive  value  of the integer <u>n</u> (in hundredths of an em) sets the vertical spacing before
              the equation, a negative value sets the spacing after the equation, replacing the default val-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ues.&nbsp;values.</font>
              ues.  This primitive provides an interface to <b>groff</b>'s <b>\x</b> escape (but with opposite sign).

              This keyword has no effect if the equation is part of a <b>pic</b> picture.

   <b>Extended</b> <b>primitives</b>
       <b>col</b> <u>n</u> <b>{</b> <u>...</u> <b>}</b>
       <b>ccol</b> <u>n</u> <b>{</b> <u>...</u> <b>}</b>
       <b>lcol</b> <u>n</u> <b>{</b> <u>...</u> <b>}</b>
       <b>rcol</b> <u>n</u> <b>{</b> <u>...</u> <b>}</b>
       <b>pile</b> <u>n</u> <b>{</b> <u>...</u> <b>}</b>
       <b>cpile</b> <u>n</u> <b>{</b> <u>...</u> <b>}</b>
       <b>lpile</b> <u>n</u> <b>{</b> <u>...</u> <b>}</b>
       <b>rpile</b> <u>n</u> <b>{</b> <u>...</u> <b>}</b>
              The  integer  value  <u>n</u>  (in  hundredths of an em) increases the vertical spacing between rows,
              using <b>groff</b>'s <b>\x</b> escape.  Negative values are possible but have no effect.  If there  is  more
              than a single value given in a matrix, the biggest one is used.

   <b>Customization</b>
       The  appearance  of  equations is controlled by a large number of parameters.  These can be set using
       the <b>set</b> command.

       <b>set</b> <u>p</u> <u>n</u>
              This sets parameter <u>p</u> to value <u>n</u>; <u>n</u> is an integer.  For example,

                     <b>set</b> <b>x_height</b> <b>45</b>

              says that <b>eqn</b> should assume an x height of 0.45 ems.

              Possible parameters are as follows.  Values are in units of hundredths of an em unless  other-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">wise&nbsp;otherwise</font>
              wise stated.  These descriptions are intended to be expository rather than definitive.

              <b>minimum_size</b>
                     <b>eqn</b> will not set anything at a smaller point-size than this.  The value is in points.

              <b>fat_offset</b>
                     The <b>fat</b> primitive emboldens an equation by overprinting two copies of the equation hor-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">izontally&nbsp;horizontally</font>
                     izontally offset by this amount.

              <b>over_hang</b>
                     A fraction bar will be longer by twice this amount than the maximum of  the  widths  of
                     the  numerator  and  denominator;  in  other  words, it will overhang the numerator and
                     denominator by at least this amount.

              <b>accent_width</b>
                     When <b>bar</b> or <b>under</b> is applied to a single character, the line will be this  long.   Nor-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mally,&nbsp;Normally,</font>
                     mally, <b>bar</b> or <b>under</b> produces a line whose length is the width of the object to which it
                     applies; in the case of a single character, this tends to produce a line that looks too
                     long.

              <b>delimiter_factor</b>
                     Extensible  delimiters produced with the <b>left</b> and <b>right</b> primitives will have a combined
                     height and depth of at least this many thousandths of twice the maximum amount by which
                     the sub-equation that the delimiters enclose extends away from the axis.

              <b>delimiter_shortfall</b>
                     Extensible  delimiters produced with the <b>left</b> and <b>right</b> primitives will have a combined
                     height and depth not less than the difference of twice the maximum amount by which  the
                     sub-equation that the delimiters enclose extends away from the axis and this amount.

              <b>null_delimiter_space</b>
                     This much horizontal space is inserted on each side of a fraction.

              <b>script_space</b>
                     The width of subscripts and superscripts is increased by this amount.

              <b>thin_space</b>
                     This amount of space is automatically inserted after punctuation characters.

              <b>medium_space</b>
                     This amount of space is automatically inserted on either side of binary operators.

              <b>thick_space</b>
                     This amount of space is automatically inserted on either side of relations.

              <b>x_height</b>
                     The height of lowercase letters without ascenders such as `x'.

              <b>axis_height</b>
                     The  height  above the baseline of the center of characters such as `+' and `-'.  It is
                     important that this value is correct for the font you are using.

              <b>default_rule_thickness</b>
                     This should set to the thickness of the <b>\(ru</b> character, or the thickness of  horizontal
                     lines produced with the <b>\D</b> escape sequence.

              <b>num1</b>   The <b>over</b> command will shift up the numerator by at least this amount.

              <b>num2</b>   The <b>smallover</b> command will shift up the numerator by at least this amount.

              <b>denom1</b> The <b>over</b> command will shift down the denominator by at least this amount.

              <b>denom2</b> The <b>smallover</b> command will shift down the denominator by at least this amount.

              <b>sup1</b>   Normally superscripts will be shifted up by at least this amount.

              <b>sup2</b>   Superscripts  within  superscripts or upper limits or numerators of <b>smallover</b> fractions
                     will be shifted up by at least this amount.  This is usually less than sup1.

              <b>sup3</b>   Superscripts within denominators or square roots or subscripts or lower limits will  be
                     shifted up by at least this amount.  This is usually less than sup2.

              <b>sub1</b>   Subscripts will normally be shifted down by at least this amount.

              <b>sub2</b>   When there is both a subscript and a superscript, the subscript will be shifted down by
                     at least this amount.

              <b>sup_drop</b>
                     The baseline of a superscript will be no more than this much amount below  the  top  of
                     the object on which the superscript is set.

              <b>sub_drop</b>
                     The  baseline  of a subscript will be at least this much below the bottom of the object
                     on which the subscript is set.

              <b>big_op_spacing1</b>
                     The baseline of an upper limit will be at least this much above the top of  the  object
                     on which the limit is set.

              <b>big_op_spacing2</b>
                     The baseline of a lower limit will be at least this much below the bottom of the object
                     on which the limit is set.

              <b>big_op_spacing3</b>
                     The bottom of an upper limit will be at least this much above the top of the object  on
                     which the limit is set.

              <b>big_op_spacing4</b>
                     The  top  of a lower limit will be at least this much below the bottom of the object on
                     which the limit is set.

              <b>big_op_spacing5</b>
                     This much vertical space will be added above and below limits.

              <b>baseline_sep</b>
                     The baselines of the rows in a pile or matrix will normally be this far apart.  In most
                     cases this should be equal to the sum of <b>num1</b> and <b>denom1</b>.

              <b>shift_down</b>
                     The  midpoint between the top baseline and the bottom baseline in a matrix or pile will
                     be shifted down by this much from the axis.  In most cases  this  should  be  equal  to
                     <b>axis_height</b>.

              <b>column_sep</b>
                     This much space will be added between columns in a matrix.

              <b>matrix_side_sep</b>
                     This much space will be added at each side of a matrix.

              <b>draw_lines</b>
                     If this is non-zero, lines will be drawn using the <b>\D</b> escape sequence, rather than with
                     the <b>\l</b> escape sequence and the <b>\(ru</b> character.

              <b>body_height</b>
                     The amount by which the height of the equation exceeds this  will  be  added  as  extra
                     space before the line containing the equation (using <b>\x</b>).  The default value is 85.

              <b>body_depth</b>
                     The amount by which the depth of the equation exceeds this will be added as extra space
                     after the line containing the equation (using <b>\x</b>).  The default value is 35.

              <b>nroff</b>  If this is non-zero, then <b>ndefine</b> will behave like <b>define</b> and <b>tdefine</b> will be  ignored,
                     otherwise  <b>tdefine</b>  will  behave  like <b>define</b> and <b>ndefine</b> will be ignored.  The default
                     value is 0 (This is typically changed to 1 by the <b>eqnrc</b> file  for  the  <b>ascii</b>,  <b>latin1</b>,
                     <b>utf8</b>, and <b>cp1047</b> devices.)

              A  more precise description of the role of many of these parameters can be found in Appendix H
              of <u>The</u> <u>TeXbook</u>.

   <b>Macros</b>
       Macros can take arguments.  In a macro body, <b>$</b><u>n</u> where <u>n</u> is between 1 and 9, will be replaced  by  the
       <u>n-th</u>  argument if the macro is called with arguments; if there are fewer than <u>n</u> arguments, it will be
       replaced by nothing.  A word containing a left parenthesis where the part of the word before the left
       parenthesis  has  been defined using the <b>define</b> command will be recognized as a macro call with argu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ments;&nbsp;arguments;</font>
       ments; characters following the left parenthesis up to a matching right parenthesis will  be  treated
       as comma-separated arguments; commas inside nested parentheses do not terminate an argument.

       <b>sdefine</b> <u>name</u> <u>X</u> <u>anything</u> <u>X</u>
              This is like the <b>define</b> command, but <u>name</u> will not be recognized if called with arguments.

       <b>include</b> <b>"</b><u>file</u><b>"</b>
       <b>copy</b> <b>"</b><u>file</u><b>"</b>
              Include  the  contents  of <u>file</u> (<b>include</b> and <b>copy</b> are synonyms).  Lines of <u>file</u> beginning with
              <b>.EQ</b> or <b>.EN</b> will be ignored.

       <b>ifdef</b> <u>name</u> <u>X</u> <u>anything</u> <u>X</u>
              If <u>name</u> has been defined by <b>define</b> (or has been automatically defined because <u>name</u> is the out-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">put&nbsp;output</font>
              put device) process <u>anything</u>; otherwise ignore <u>anything</u>.  <u>X</u> can be any character not appearing
              in <u>anything</u>.

       <b>undef</b> <u>name</u>
              Remove definition of <u>name</u>, making it undefined.

       Besides the macros mentioned above, the following definitions are available: <b>Alpha</b>, <b>Beta</b>, ...,  <b>Omega</b>
       (this is the same as <b>ALPHA</b>, <b>BETA</b>, ..., <b>OMEGA</b>), <b>ldots</b> (three dots on the base line), and <b>dollar</b>.

   <b>Fonts</b>
       <b>eqn</b> normally uses at least two fonts to set an equation: an italic font for letters, and a roman font
       for everything else.  The existing <b>gfont</b> command changes the font that is used as  the  italic  font.
       By  default  this  is <b>I</b>.  The font that is used as the roman font can be changed using the new <b>grfont</b>
       command.

       <b>grfont</b> <u>f</u>
              Set the roman font to <u>f</u>.

       The <b>italic</b> primitive uses the current italic font set by <b>gfont</b>; the <b>roman</b> primitive uses the  current
       roman  font  set  by  <b>grfont</b>.  There is also a new <b>gbfont</b> command, which changes the font used by the
       <b>bold</b> primitive.  If you only use the <b>roman</b>, <b>italic</b> and <b>bold</b> primitives to  changes  fonts  within  an
       equation,  you can change all the fonts used by your equations just by using <b>gfont</b>, <b>grfont</b> and <b>gbfont</b>
       commands.

       You can control which characters are treated as letters (and therefore set in italics) by  using  the
       <b>chartype</b>  command described above.  A type of <b>letter</b> will cause a character to be set in italic type.
       A type of <b>digit</b> will cause a character to be set in roman type.
