Building on the known LiveVideoMixer sample code that shows compositing of video streams using the QTVisualContext and OpenGL, the LiveVideoMixer3 adds video input capabilites using QTKit and the QTCapture API.
You find the code for capturing in the CaptureChannel files. The device setup is in the LiveVideoMixer controller - look out for 'for capturing' comments.
Note that for in WWDC 2006 Leopard seed the QTCaptureVideoPreviewOutput is missing and therefore commented out in this sample which causes a few compiler warnings.
