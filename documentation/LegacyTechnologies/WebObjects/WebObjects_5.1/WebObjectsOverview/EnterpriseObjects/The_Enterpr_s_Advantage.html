In WebObjects, you put thebusiness logic in the enterprise objects, as shown in  <a href="#BCIJJGDF">Figure 3-4</a>.</p><br><a name = "BCIJJGDF"></a><p><b><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">Figure3-4 Implementing business logic in enterpriseobjects</font></b></p> <img src = "../Art/businesslogicwo.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/businesslogicwo.gif]"><p>Another approach ( <a href="#BCICAFDI">Figure 3-5</a>) is to implement business logic in the Web or desktop application.The WebObjects approach betters this approach in the following ways:</p><ul><li><b>Itoffers greater reuse.</b> In WebObjects, you code your businesslogic once, and each application that accesses your database canuse it. You don't have to re-code your business logic into eachscreen or Web page.</font></li><li><b>It's more maintainable.</b> With WebObjects,you don't have to duplicate your business logic. Thus you caneasily make substantial changes to your rules without resortingto finding and fixing every affected page in every affected application.You can also easily track changes to your schema.</font></li><li><b>It improves data integrity.</b> In WebObjects,you don't need to rely on all application developers to implementthe business rules correctly. If one application has an error, it isless likely to corrupt your database.</font></li><li><b>It scales better.</b> In WebObjects, youcan improve your application's performance without having to provideyour users with faster systems. Instead, you can simply move somecomputation-intensive processing to fast computers.</font></li></ul><br><a name = "BCICAFDI"></a><p><b><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">Figure3-5 Implementing business logic in theuser interface application</font></b></p> <img src = "../Art/businesslogicapp.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/businesslogicapp.gif]"><p>Another approach ( <a href="#BCICEAAB">Figure 3-6</a>) is to implement your business rules in the database&#151;with storedprocedures, rules, constraints, and triggers, for example. The WebObjectsapproach betters this approach in the following ways:</p><ul><li><b>Itoffers improved interactivity.</b> If you implement yourbusiness rules in the datasource, you need to make a round tripto the database every time the user performs an action. Alternatively,you can batch up database changes, which prevents the user fromreceiving immediate feedback. In WebObjects applications, changesimmediately appear in the user interface, but you access the databaseonly when saving these changes or fetching data.</font></li><li><b>It improves back-end portability.</b> Databasevendors have different ways of implementing logic. If you have tosupport more than one database and you're using WebObjects, youdon't have to implement the logic multiple times and thus suffer maintenanceproblems.</font></li><li><b>Java is a good development language.</b> WithWebObjects, you program in Java, an industrial-strength languagedesigned from the ground up to be object-oriented. The programmablevariants of SQL usually have some object-oriented features, butare basically procedural languages.</font></li></ul><br><a name = "BCICEAAB"></a><p><b><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">Figure3-6 Implementing business logic in thedatabase</font></b></p> <img src = "../Art/businesslogicserver.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/businesslogicserver.gif]"><br><br><br><a href="WebObjects__t_Instances.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/previous.gif" border="0"></a><a href="../WOHTML/index.html" target="_top"><img src="../images/next.gif" border="0"></a>&nbsp;<br><br><p><hr><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">&#169; 2002 Apple Computer, Inc.
