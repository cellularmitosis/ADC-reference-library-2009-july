<p><font face="Times">The tasks of creating a Direct to Java Client application
are similar to writing a Direct to Web application. There are four
steps:</font></p>
<ul><p><li>Create a
Direct to Java Client project using Project Builder.</li></p>
<p><li>Create a model using EOModeler.</li></p>
<p><li>Customize your application using the Direct to Java Client
Assistant (optional).</li></p>
<p><li>Further customize your application (optional).</li></p></ul>
<p><font face="Times">Further information about the last two optional steps is given
below.</font></p>
<a name = "BCIDFACE"></a><h3><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande">The
Direct to Java Client Assistant</font></h3>
<p><font face="Times">The Direct to Java Client Assistant is the easiest way to
customize a Direct to Java Client application. It is an easy-to-use
tool that is integrated into a running client application. It allows
you to perform the most common customizations, directly test them
while the application is running, and save them in your project.
The Direct to Java Client Assistant is very similar in concept to
the Direct to Web Assistant even though the two assistants look
and behave differently.</font></p>

<a name = "TPXREF118"></a><h3><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande">Further
Customizing Your Application</font></h3>
<p><font face="Times">Writing custom rules is another way to customize your Direct
to Java Client application. It's very similar to writing custom
rules for Direct to Web applications. As with Direct to Web applications,
all the information about how to configure a Direct to Java Client application
is stored in the form of rules. The default rules generate the default
Direct to Java Client application. Adding new rules that override
or supplement the default rules is an easy-to-maintain approach
that doesn't interfere with your use of the assistant. You write
rules with the Rule Editor, the same application used for writing
rules in Direct to Web applications. For more information, see  <a sector="mod" href="../D2W/iDeveloping__Application.html" target="_top">"Developing a Direct to Web Application" (page 57)</a>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">There are also some more specialized ways to change the way
Direct to Java Client works. For example, you can get the precise
user interface layout for a particular window by freezing the interface
and supplying a nib file (created in Interface Builder the way you
do for regular Java Client applications). As another example, Direct
to Java Client provides hooks you can use to introduce custom commands
into an application's main menu. Additionally, you can also subclass
Direct to Java Client classes to change the way an application performs
a particular task or to add new functionality to the default set.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Direct to Java Client was designed to be flexible and extensible,
so there are numerous customization approaches. There are simple
approaches that are code-free and maintainable (using the assistant
and writing custom rules), there are more specialized approaches
that are complex and require a lot of work, and there's everything
in between. You can achieve almost any effect that you need. It's
generally simply a question of which technique to use and what trade-offs
you're willing to make.</font></p>
