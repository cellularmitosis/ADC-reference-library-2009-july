Each of the tabs in the QueryWindow corresponds to an entity in one of the application's models.Not all of the entities in the Movie and Rentals models have tabsin the Query Window. The way Direct to Java Client chooses whichentities to represent in the Query Window is described in the section  <a href="#BBCDGJEA">"Main, Enumeration, and "Other" Entities"</a>.</font></p><ol><p><li>Focus theQuery Window on the Movie entity.<p>In the Query Window, clickthe Movie tab. The Query Window switches its contents to a userinterface for searching for Movies.</p><p>Note that the defaultDirect to Java Client application allows you to search on <code>title</code> and <code>plotSummary</code>.You can easily configure the application to search on differentattributes using the Direct to Java Client Assistant (Assistantfor short). In later sections, you are shown how to change the searchattributes.</p></li></p><p><li>Search for Movies whose titles begin with the letter "A".<p>Type <code>A</code> inthe Title text box, and click Find. The application lists the Moviesmeeting the search criteria.</p><p>Note that the applicationlists <code>title</code>, <code>category</code>, <code>dateReleased</code>, <code>posterName</code>, <code>revenue</code>, <code>trailerName</code>,and <code>plotSummary</code> for theMovies in the result set. As with the search attributes, you caneasily configure the application to display different attributesin the table, which you do later.</p></li></p><p><li>Search for Movies whose titles begin with the letter "A"or "B".<p>Click Clear. Although the "A" is cleared fromthe Name field, the Movies in the results table remain. To add Moviesthat start with the letter "B" to the results, type <code>B</code> inthe Name text box, and click Append. Now the results table containsMovies that start with the letter "A" and the letter "B".</p><p>Thedifference between Find and Append is this: Find replaces the recordsin the results list with the results of the most recent search.Append adds data from the most recent search to the records alreadyin the results table. So using Append is a way to add the resultsof more than one query (for example, Movies whose titles start with"A" and Movies whose titles start with "B").</p></li></p><p><li>Open a Movie.<p>Select a Movie in the result list and clickOpen, or simply double-click the Movie's title. Either actionopens the Movie in a separate window that displays its attributesand relationships. The attributes-<code>title</code>, <code>category</code>, <code>dateReleased</code>, <code>posterName</code>, <code>revenue</code>,and <code>trailerName</code>-arein the top part of the window. You can edit any of the Movie's attributeshere. After making changes, you can save them (click Save at thetop of the Movie window) or revert back to the original values (clickRevert).</p><p>The Movie's relationships are in the bottompart of the window. One relationship-<code>studio</code>-isdisplayed by itself in the middle of the window while the othersare displayed below in a tab view. The reason for this is explainedlater in the section  <a href="#BBCDGJEA">"Main, Enumeration, and "Other" Entities"</a>.</p><p>Inthe Studio area of the Movie window, you can change the Movie'sStudio (Select), open the Movie's Studio (Open), or unassign theMovie's Studio (Deselect). Clicking the Open button simply opensthe Movie's Studio in a Studio window that is similar to the Moviewindow in that it displays Studio attributes and relationships.Clicking Deselect unsets the Movie's <code>studio</code> relationshipso that the Movie has no Studio.</p></li></p><p><li>Select a new Studio.<p>In the Studio area of the Moviewindow, click Select. A dialog opens for searching for Studios.Type search criteria (<code>A</code> inthe Name text box, for example), and click Find. Choose a Studiofrom the result list and click OK. The dialog closes, and the Movie's Studiois changed from the original to the one you selected.</p><p>Notethat the Movie window now has an asterisk ("*") in the titlebar. The asterisk indicates that the Movie has changes that haven'tbeen saved. If you wanted to save the change, you would click Save.In this case, however, click Revert to discard the change.</p></li></p><p><li>Examine the relationship tabs at the bottom of the window.<p>Therelationships for the Plot Summary and Voting tabs-<code>plotSummary</code> and <code>voting</code>-are to-onerelationships. Their respective panes allow you to modify the destinationobjects directly. For example, if you change the contents of theSummary text box in the Plot Summary pane and click Save, you changethe PlotSummary object's <code>summary</code> valueand commit the change to the database.</p><p>The other relationships-<code>directors</code>, <code>reviews</code>,and <code>roles</code>-are to-manyrelationships. Their panes allow you to add destination objectsto the relationships and to delete objects from them. Additionallyyou can open destination objects (in their own window) and editthem.</p></li></p><p><li>Create a new Movie.<p>In the Movie window, click New. Alternatively,if the Query Window's Movie tab is still selected, you can clickNew in the Query Window. Either action creates a new Movie windowinto which you enter information about the new Movie. Fields with bluetitles are required; that is, you can't save the new Movie ifthe blue titled fields are empty.</p><p>Fill in the Movie'sattributes as follows:</p><ul><p><li><b>Title</b> EvilDead 2</li></p><p><li><b>Category</b> Horror</li></p><p><li><b>Date Released</b> 4/1/1987</li></p></ul><p>ClickSave to save the new Movie.</p></li></p><p><li>Set the Movie's Studio to Elite Entertainment.<p>In theStudio area of the window, click Select. In the Studio dialog, type <code>E</code> inthe Name text box, and click Find. No results are returned, so youhave to create the Elite Entertainment Studio.</p><p>ClickNew in the Studio dialog. The first dialog closes, and a new Studiodialog opens for creating a new Studio. Name the Studio "EliteEntertainment" and provide a budget. Click Save.</p><p>Thenew Studio is saved to the database and assigned as the Studio forthe <i>Evil Dead 2</i> Movie.</p><p>You canadd directors and movie roles (and their actors) in a similar manner.</p></li></p></ol><a name = "BBCDGJEA"></a><h3><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande">Main,Enumeration, and "Other" Entities</font></h3><p><font face="Times">Direct to Java Client divides entities into three types: main,enumeration, and other. Each of an application's entities is exactlyone of these types.</font></p><a name = "TPXREF105"></a><h4><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande">MainEntities</font></h4><p><font face="Times">A <i>main</i> entity is generally a top-levelentity that users work with most frequently. Consequently, Directto Java Client creates a tab for each main entity in the Query Window andprovides form windows for editing each of the main entities. Forexample, in this tutorial application, the main entities are Customer,Movie, Studio, Talent, Unit, User, and Video.</font></p><p><font face="Times">Direct to Java Client by default defines a main entity asone that is not the destination of any relationships that</font></p><ul><p><li>propagateprimary key</li></p><p><li>own destination</li></p><p><li>use the cascade delete rule</li></p></ul><a name = "TPXREF106"></a><h4><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande">EnumerationEntities</font></h4><p><font face="Times">	Direct to Java Client also defines the concept of an <i>enumeration</i> entity.An enumeration entity by default is an entity that conforms to theconditions for main entities and additionally conforms to the followingconditions:</font></p><ul><p><li>The entityhas fewer than five attributes.</li></p><p><li>The entity has no relationships that are mandatory.</li></p><p><li>All the entity's relationships use the deny delete rule.</li></p></ul><p><font face="Times">In practice, enumeration entities should define a collectionof values that represent a list of choices. For example, in thistutorial application, the enumeration entities are FeeTypes andRentalTerms.</font></p><p><font face="Times">The values in enumeration entities are usually fairly static,and you usually don't want a complex user-interface for changingthem. Consequently, Direct to Java Client applications provide asingle window for editing enumeration values, the Enumeration Window.</font></p><p><font face="Times">Choose Tools &gt; Enumeration Window.</font></p><p><font face="Times">This opens the Enumeration Window containing a tab for eachof the application's enumeration entities. The tab for a particularentity shows the complete set of values in that entity (that shouldbe a small number of values). You can add a new value to the enumeration'scollection (Add), delete a value from the collection (Remove), andmodify a value (simply make the changes and click Save).</font></p><p><font face="Times">By displaying enumeration values in this special window, anapplication doesn't clutter the Query Window with tabs for enumerationentities. This approach simplifies the application's user interfacein other ways, as well. The application doesn't provide form windowsfor enumeration entities, and relationships to enumeration entitiescan be represented simply with combo boxes (for to-one relationships)and pick lists (for to-many relationships) instead of with tables(to-ones) and select dialogs (to-manys).</font></p><a name = "TPXREF107"></a><h4><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande">"Other"Entities</font></h4><p><font face="Times">Entities that aren't main or enumeration entities are simply <i>other</i> entities.For example, in this tutorial application, the <em>other</em> entitiesare CreditCard, Director, Fee, MovieRole, PlotSummary, Rental, Review,TalentPhoto, and Voting.</font></p><p><font face="Times"><em>Other</em> entities can be manipulated throughthe master-detail user interfaces of main entities. This explainswhy a Movie's <code>studio</code> relationshipis displayed by itself in the middle of the window while the otherrelationships are displayed below in a tab view. The destinationentity of the <code>studio</code> relationship,Studio, is a main entity. Main entities have their own form windowswith which you edit them. The destinations of the other relationshipsare <em>other</em> entities. Since they don't havetheir own form windows, they are edited in master-detail interfacesinside a main entity's form window.</font></p><a name = "TPXREF108"></a><h3><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande">Customizingthe Application</font></h3><p><font face="Times">As you can see, the default application is fairly complete.Direct to Java Client uses a sophisticated set of rules to assemblethe user interface. However, the default user interface isn'texactly what you want in every case.</font></p><p><font face="Times">In the next sections you make changes to the application,including the following:</font></p><ul><p><li>modify theset of main entities</li></p><p><li>modify the search attributes in the Query Window, and specifythe order in which the attributes are displayed. Similarly, modifythe attributes displayed in the results table of the Query Window.</li></p><p><li>specify the order of the attributes and relationships thatcan be edited in a form</li></p><p><li>change the widget used to display and edit particular attributes</li></p></ul><br>    <br><a href="Building_an_Application.html" target="_right"><img src="../Images/previous.gif" border="0" alt="Previous"></a><a href="The_Assistant.html" target="_right"><img src="../Images/next.gif" border="0" alt="Next"></a>&nbsp;<p><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="1">&#169; 2001 Apple Computer, Inc.</font></p></body></html>
