<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       <b>Net::LDAP</b> is a collection of modules that implements a LDAP services API for Perl programs. The
       module may be used to search directories or perform maintenance functions such as adding, deleting or
       modifying entries.

       This document assumes that the reader has some knowledge of the LDAP protocol.

<b>CONSTRUCTOR</b>
       new ( HOST, OPTIONS )
           Creates a new <b>Net::LDAP</b> object and opens a connection to the named host.

           "HOST" may be a host name or an IP number. TCP port may be specified after the host name followed
           by a colon (such as localhost:10389). The default TCP port for LDAP is 389.

           You can also specify a URI, such as 'ldaps://127.0.0.1:666' or
           'ldapi://%2fvar%2flib%2fldap_sock'. Note that '%2f's in the LDAPI socket path will be translated
           into '/'. This is to support LDAP query options like base, search etc. although the query part of
           the URI will be ignored in this context. If port was not specified in the URI, the default is
           either 389 or 636 for 'LDAP' and 'LDAPS' schemes respectively.

           "HOST" may also be a reference to an array of hosts, host-port pairs or URIs to try. Each will be
           tried in order until a connection is made. Only when all have failed will the result of "undef"
           be returned.

           port =&gt; N
               Port to connect to on the remote server. May be overridden by "HOST".

           timeout =&gt; N
               Timeout passed to IO::Socket when connecting the remote server.  (Default: 120)

           multihomed =&gt; N
               Will be passed to IO::Socket as the "MultiHomed" parameter when connecting to the remote
               server

           localaddr =&gt; HOST
               Will be passed to IO::Socket as the "LocalAddr" parameter, which sets the client's IP address
               (as opposed to the server's IP address.)

           debug =&gt; N
               Set the debug level. See the debug method for details.

           async =&gt; 1
               Perform all operations asynchronously.

           onerror =&gt; 'die' | 'warn' | undef | sub { ... }
               In synchronous mode, change what happens when an error is detected.

               'die'
                   Net::LDAP will croak whenever an error is detected.

               'warn'
                   Net::LDAP will warn whenever an error is detected.

               undef
                   Net::LDAP will warn whenever an error is detected and "-w" is in effect. The method that
                   was called will return "undef".

               sub { ... }
                   The given sub will be called in a scalar context with a single argument, the result
                   message. The value returned will be the return value for the method that was called.

           version =&gt; N
               Set the protocol version being used (default is LDAPv3). This is useful if you want to talk
               to an old server and therefore have to use LDAPv2.

           Example

             $ldap = Net::LDAP-&gt;new( 'remote.host', async =&gt; 1 );

           LDAPS connections have some extra valid options, see the start_tls method for details. Note the
           default value for 'sslversion' for LDAPS is 'sslv2/3', and the default port for LDAPS is 636.

           For LDAPI connections, HOST is actually the location of a UNIX domain socket to connect to. The
           default location is '/var/lib/ldapi'.

<b>METHODS</b>
       Each of the following methods take as arguments some number of fixed parameters followed by options,
       these options are passed in a named fashion, for example

         $mesg = $ldap-&gt;bind( "cn=me,o=example", password =&gt; "mypasswd");

       The return value from these methods is an object derived from the Net::LDAP::Message class. The
       methods of this class allow you to examine the status of the request.

       abandon ( ID, OPTIONS )
           Abandon a previously issued request. "ID" may be a number or an object which is a sub-class of
           Net::LDAP::Message, returned from a previous method call.

           control =&gt; CONTROL
           control =&gt; [ CONTROL, ... ]
               See "CONTROLS" below

           callback =&gt; CALLBACK
               See "CALLBACKS" below

           <b>Example</b>

             $res = $ldap-&gt;search( @search_args );

             $mesg = $ldap-&gt;abandon( $res ); # This could be written as $res-&gt;abandon

       add ( DN, OPTIONS )
           Add a new entry to the directory. "DN" can be either a Net::LDAP::Entry object or a string.

           attrs =&gt; [ ATTR =&gt; VALUE, ... ]
               "VALUE" should be a string if only a single value is wanted, or a reference to an array of
               strings if multiple values are wanted.

               This argument is not used if "DN" is a Net::LDAP::Entry object.

           control =&gt; CONTROL
           control =&gt; [ CONTROL, ... ]
               See "CONTROLS" below

           callback =&gt; CALLBACK
               See "CALLBACKS" below

           <b>Example</b>

             # $entry is an object of class Net::LDAP::Entry
             $mesg = $ldap-&gt;add( $entry );

             $mesg = $ldap-&gt;add( $dn,
                                 attrs =&gt; [
                                   name  =&gt; 'Graham Barr',
                                   attr  =&gt; 'value1',
                                   attr  =&gt; 'value2',
                                   multi =&gt; [qw(value1 value2)]
                                 ]
                               );

       bind ( DN, OPTIONS )
           Bind (log in) to the server. "DN" is the DN to bind with. An anonymous bind may be done by
           calling bind without any arguments.

               Bind with the given password.

           sasl =&gt; SASLOBJ
               Bind using a SASL mechanism. The argument given should be a sub-class of Authen::SASL.

           <b>Example</b>

             $mesg = $ldap-&gt;bind; # Anonymous bind

             $mesg = $ldap-&gt;bind( $dn, password =&gt; $password );

             # $sasl is an object of class Authen::SASL
             $mesg = $ldap-&gt;bind( $dn, sasl =&gt; $sasl, version =&gt; 3 );

       compare ( DN, OPTIONS )
           Compare values in an attribute in the entry given by "DN" on the server. "DN" may be a string or
           a Net::LDAP::Entry object.

           attr =&gt; ATTR
               The name of the attribute to compare.

           value =&gt; VALUE

                                     attr  =&gt; 'cn',
                                     value =&gt; 'Graham Barr'
                                   );

       delete ( DN, OPTIONS )
           Delete the entry given by "DN" from the server. "DN" may be a string or a Net::LDAP::Entry
           object.

           control =&gt; CONTROL
           control =&gt; [ CONTROL, ... ]
               See "CONTROLS" below.

           callback =&gt; CALLBACK
               See "CALLBACKS" below.

           <b>Example</b>

            $mesg = $ldap-&gt;delete( $dn );

       moddn ( DN, OPTIONS )

           newrdn =&gt; RDN
               This value should be a new RDN to assign to "DN".

           deleteoldrdn =&gt; 1
               This option should be passwd if the existing RDN is to be deleted.

           newsuperior =&gt; NEWDN
               If given this value should be the DN of the new superior for "DN".

           control =&gt; CONTROL
           control =&gt; [ CONTROL, ... ]
               See "CONTROLS" below.

           callback =&gt; CALLBACK

           <b>Example</b>

            $mesg = $ldap-&gt;moddn( $dn, newrdn =&gt; 'cn=Graham Barr' );

       modify ( DN, OPTIONS )
           Modify the contents of the entry given by "DN" on the server. "DN" may be a string or a
           Net::LDAP::Entry object.

           add =&gt; { ATTR =&gt; VALUE, ... }
               Add more attributes or values to the entry. "VALUE" should be a string if only a single value
               is wanted in the attribute, or a reference to an array of strings if multiple values are
               wanted.

           delete =&gt; [ ATTR, ... ]
               Delete complete attributes from the entry.

           delete =&gt; { ATTR =&gt; VALUE, ... }
               Delete individual values from an attribute. "VALUE" should be a string if only a single value
               is being deleted from the attribute, or a reference to an array of strings if multiple values
               are being deleted.

           replace =&gt; { ATTR =&gt; VALUE, ... }
               Replace any existing values in each given attribute with "VALUE". "VALUE" should be a string
               if only a single value is wanted in the attribute, or a reference to an array of strings if
               multiple values are wanted. A reference to an empty array will remove the entire attribute.

           changes =&gt; [ OP =&gt; [ ATTR =&gt; VALUE ], ... ]
               This is an alternative to <b>add</b>, <b>delete</b> and <b>replace</b> where the whole operation can be given in a
               single argument. "OP" should be <b>add</b>, <b>delete</b> or <b>replace</b>. "VALUE" should be either a string or
               a reference to an array of strings, as before.

               Use this form if you want to control the order in which the operations will be performed.

           control =&gt; CONTROL
           control =&gt; [ CONTROL, ... ]
               See "CONTROLS" below.

           callback =&gt; CALLBACK
               See "CALLBACKS" below.

           <b>Example</b>

            $mesg = $ldap-&gt;modify( $dn, add =&gt; { sn =&gt; 'Barr' } );

            $mesg = $ldap-&gt;modify( $dn, delete =&gt; [qw(faxNumber)] );

            $mesg = $ldap-&gt;modify( $dn, delete =&gt; { 'telephoneNumber' =&gt; '911' } );

            $mesg = $ldap-&gt;modify( $dn, replace =&gt; { 'mail' =&gt; 'gbarr@pobox.com' } );

            $mesg = $ldap-&gt;modify( $dn,

                                       # delete all fax numbers
                                     delete  =&gt; [ faxNumber =&gt; []],
                                       # delete phone number 911

                                   ]
                                 );

       search ( OPTIONS )
           Search the directory using a given filter.  This can be used to read attributes from a single
           entry, from entries immediately below a particular entry, or a whole subtree of entries.

           The result is an object of class Net::LDAP::Search.

           base =&gt; DN
               The DN that is the base object entry relative to which the search is to be performed.

           scope =&gt; 'base' | 'one' | 'sub'
               By default the search is performed on the whole tree below the specified base object. This
               maybe changed by specifying a "scope" parameter with one of the following values:

               base
                   Search only the base object.

               one Search the entries immediately below the base object.

               sub Search the whole tree below (and including) the base object. This is the default.

           deref =&gt; 'never' | 'search' | 'find' | 'always'
               By default aliases are dereferenced to locate the base object for the search, but not when
               searching subordinates of the base object. This may be changed by specifying a "deref"
               parameter with one of the following values:

               never
                   Do not dereference aliases in searching or in locating the base object of the search.

               search
                   Dereference aliases in subordinates of the base object in searching, but not in locating
                   the base object of the search.

               find
                   Dereference aliases in locating the base object of the search, but not when searching
                   subordinates of the base object. This is the default.

               always
                   Dereference aliases both in searching and in locating the base object of the search.

           sizelimit =&gt; N
               A sizelimit that restricts the maximum number of entries to be returned as a result of the
               search. A value of 0, and the default, means that no restriction is requested.  Servers may
               enforce a maximum number of entries to return.

           timelimit =&gt; N
               A timelimit that restricts the maximum time (in seconds) allowed for a search. A value of 0
               (the default), means that no timelimit will be requested.

           typesonly =&gt; 1
               Only attribute types (no values) should be returned. Normally attribute types and values are
               returned.

           filter =&gt; FILTER
               A filter that defines the conditions an entry in the directory must meet in order for it to
               be returned by the search. This may be a string or a Net::LDAP::Filter object. Values inside
               filters may need to be escaped to avoid security problems; see Net::LDAP::Filter for a
               definition of the filter format, including the escaping rules.

           attrs =&gt; [ ATTR, ... ]
               A list of attributes to be returned for each entry that matches the search filter.

               If not specified, then the server will return the attributes that are specified as accessible
               by default given your bind credentials.

               Certain additional attributes such as "createTimestamp" and other operational attributes may
               also be available for the asking:

                 $mesg = $ldap-&gt;search( ... ,
                                        attrs =&gt; ['createTimestamp']
                                      );

               To retrieve the default attributes and additional ones, use '*'.

                 $mesg = $ldap-&gt;search( ... ,
                                        attrs =&gt; ['*', 'createTimestamp']
                                      );

               To retrieve no attributes (the server only returns the DNs of matching entries), use '1.1':

                 $mesg = $ldap-&gt;search( ... ,
                                        attrs =&gt; ['1.1']
                                      );

           control =&gt; CONTROL
           control =&gt; [ CONTROL, ... ]
               See "CONTROLS" below.

           callback =&gt; CALLBACK
               See "CALLBACKS" below.

           <b>Example</b>

            $mesg = $ldap-&gt;search(
                                   base   =&gt; $base_dn,
                                   scope  =&gt; 'sub',
                                   filter =&gt; '(|(objectclass=rfc822mailgroup)(sn=jones))'
                                 );

            Net::LDAP::LDIF-&gt;new( \*STDOUT,"w" )-&gt;write( $mesg-&gt;entries );

       start_tls ( OPTIONS )
           Calling this method will convert the existing connection to using Transport Layer Security (TLS),
           which provides an encrypted connection. This is <u>only</u> possible if the connection uses LDAPv3, and
           requires that the server advertizes support for LDAP_EXTENSION_START_TLS. Use
           "supported_extension" in Net::LDAP::RootDSE to check this.

           verify =&gt; 'none' | 'optional' | 'require'
               How to verify the server's certificate:

               none
                   The server may provide a certificate but it will not be checked - this may mean you are
                   be connected to the wrong server

               optional
                   Verify only when the server offers a certificate

               require
                   The server must provide a certificate, and it must be valid.

               If you set verify to optional or require, you must also set either cafile or capath. The most
               secure option is <b>require</b>.

           sslversion =&gt; 'sslv2' | 'sslv3' | 'sslv2/3' | 'tlsv1'
               This defines the version of the SSL/TLS protocol to use. Defaults to <b>'tlsv1'</b>.

           ciphers =&gt; CIPHERS
               Specify which subset of cipher suites are permissible for this connection, using the standard
               OpenSSL string format. The default value is <b>'ALL'</b>, which permits all ciphers, even those that
               don't encrypt.

           clientcert =&gt; '/path/to/cert.pem'
           clientkey =&gt; '/path/to/key.pem'
           keydecrypt =&gt; sub { ... }
               If you want to use the client to offer a certificate to the server for SSL authentication
               (which is not the same as for the LDAP Bind operation) then set clientcert to the user's
               certificate file, and clientkey to the user's private key file. These files must be in PEM
               format.

               If the private key is encrypted (highly recommended) then keydecrypt should be a subroutine
               that returns the decrypting key. For example:

                $ldap = Net::LDAP-&gt;new( 'myhost.example.com', version =&gt; 3 );
                $mesg = $ldap-&gt;start_tls(
                                          verify =&gt; 'require',
                                          clientcert =&gt; 'mycert.pem',
                                          clientkey =&gt; 'mykey.pem',
                                          keydecrypt =&gt; sub { 'secret'; },
                                          capath =&gt; '/usr/local/cacerts/'
                                        );

           capath =&gt; '/path/to/servercerts/'
           cafile =&gt; '/path/to/servercert.pem'
               When verifying the server's certificate, either set capath to the pathname of the directory
               containing CA certificates, or set cafile to the filename containing the certificate of the
               CA who signed the server's certificate. These certificates must all be in PEM format.

               The directory in 'capath' must contain certificates named using the hash value of the
               certificates' subject names. To generate these names, use OpenSSL like this in Unix:

                   ln -s cacert.pem `openssl x509 -hash -noout &lt; cacert.pem`.0

               (assuming that the certificate of the CA is in cacert.pem.)

       unbind ( )
           The unbind method does not take any parameters and will unbind you from the server. Some servers
           may allow you to re-bind or perform other operations after unbinding. If you wish to switch to
           another set of credentials while continuing to use the same connection, re-binding with another
           DN and password, without unbind-ing, will generally work.

           <b>Example</b>

            $mesg = $ldap-&gt;unbind;

       The following methods are for convenience, and do not return "Net::LDAP::Message" objects.

       async ( VALUE )
           If "VALUE" is given the async mode will be set. The previous value will be returned. The value is
           <u>true</u> if LDAP operations are being performed asynchronously.

       certificate ( )
           Returns an X509_Certificate object containing the server's certificate. See the IO::Socket::SSL
           documentation for information about this class.

           For example, to get the subject name (in a peculiar OpenSSL-specific format, different from RFC
           1779 and RFC 2253) from the server's certificate, do this:

               print "Subject DN: " . $ldaps-&gt;certificate-&gt;subject_name . "\n";

       cipher ( )
           Returns the cipher mode being used by the connection, in the string format used by OpenSSL.

       debug ( VALUE )
           If "VALUE" is given the debug bit-value will be set. The previous value will be returned. Debug
           output will be sent to "STDERR". The bits of this value are:

            1   Show outgoing packets (using asn_hexdump).
            2   Show incoming packets (using asn_hexdump).
            4   Show outgoing packets (using asn_dump).
            8   Show incoming packets (using asn_dump).

           The default value is 0.

       disconnect ( )
           Disconnect from the server

       root_dse ( OPTIONS )
           The root_dse method retrieves cached information from the server's rootDSE.

           attrs =&gt; [ ATTR, ... ]
               A reference to a list of attributes to be returned.  If not specified, then the following
               attributes will be requested

                 subschemaSubentry
                 namingContexts
                 altServer
                 supportedExtension
                 supportedFeatures
                 supportedControl
                 supportedSASLMechanisms
                 supportedLDAPVersion

           The result is an object of class Net::LDAP::RootDSE.

           <b>Example</b>

            my $root = $ldap-&gt;root_dse;
            # get naming Context
            $root-&gt;get_value( 'namingContext', asref =&gt; 1 );
            # get supported LDAP versions
            $root-&gt;supported_version;

           As the root DSE may change in certain circumstances - for instance when you change the connection
           using start_tls - you should always use the root_dse method to return the most up-to-date copy of
           the root DSE.

       schema ( OPTIONS )
           Read schema information from the server.

           The result is an object of class Net::LDAP::Schema.  Read this documentation for further
           information about methods that can be performed with this object.

           dn =&gt; DN
               If a DN is supplied, it will become the base object entry from which the search for schema
               information will be conducted.  If no DN is supplied the base object entry will be determined
               from the rootDSE entry.

           <b>Example</b>

            my $schema = $ldap-&gt;schema;
            # get objectClasses
            @ocs = $schema-&gt;all_objectclasses;
            # Get the attributes
            @atts = $schema-&gt;all_attributes;

       socket ( )
           Returns the underlying "IO::Socket" object being used.

       sync ( MESG )
           Wait for a given "MESG" request to be completed by the server. If no "MESG" is given, then wait
           for all outstanding requests to be completed.

           Returns an error code defined in Net::LDAP::Constant.

       version ( )
           Returns the version of the LDAP protocol that is being used.

<b>CONTROLS</b>
       Many of the methods described above accept a control option.  This allows the user to pass controls
       to the server as described in LDAPv3.

       A control is a reference to a HASH and should contain the three elements below. If any of the
       controls are blessed then the method "to_asn" will be called which should return a reference to a
       HASH containing the three elements described below.

       type =&gt; OID
           This element must be present and is the name of the type of control being requested.

       critical =&gt; FLAG
           critical is optional and should be a boolean value, if it is not specified then it is assumed to
           be <u>false</u>.

       value =&gt; VALUE
           If the control being requested requires a value then this element should hold the value for the
           server.

<b>CALLBACKS</b>
       Most of the above commands accept a callback option. This option should be a reference to a
       subroutine. This subroutine will be called for each packet received from the server as a response to
       the request sent.

       When the subroutine is called the first argument will be the Net::LDAP::Message object which was
       returned from the method.

       If the request is a search then multiple packets can be received from the server. Each entry is
       received as a separate packet. For each of these the subroutine will be called with a
       Net::LDAP::Entry object as the second argument.

       During a search the server may also send a list of references. When such a list is received then the
       subroutine will be called with a Net::LDAP::Reference object as the second argument.

<b>LDAP</b> <b>ERROR</b> <b>CODES</b>
       <b>Net::LDAP</b> also exports constants for the error codes that can be received from the server, see
       Net::LDAP::Constant.
