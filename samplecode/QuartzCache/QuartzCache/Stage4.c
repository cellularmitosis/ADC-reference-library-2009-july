// Stage 4 - Draw a 2K by 2K source image to an offscreen 512 x 512 CG Layer,
// effectively caching the original image. The test measures how fast drawing 
// the cached layer takes. The cache alleviates the time taken to color match the
// image and also time required to downsample the image. 
// This cache technique is useful when the image has to be repeatedly draw at the
// same scale. The difference between this test the previous is that the previous 
// performed the caching using a bitmap context. This one caches using a CGLayerRef.
// Notice that we don't need to know the colorspace or destination context's device
// specific information when creating a CG Layer. 
// The source image is created programattically as a gradient between colors.
// Returns: the number of operations per second for this stage
