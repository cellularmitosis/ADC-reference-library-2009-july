MacintoshSample Code Notes_____________________________________________________________________________                                                  Developer Technical Support#22:	ScreenFKeyWritten by:	Guillermo OrtizVersions:			1.00						February 1990Components:			ScreenFKey.p 		    	February 1, 1990					ScreenFKey.a			    February 1, 1990					ScreenFKey.make 			February 1, 1990_____________________________________________________________________________ScreenFKey is a basic example on how to spool a PICT file to disk byreplacing the bottleneck PutPICProc, it saves the contents of the screen toa file. The FKEY creates ten files Screen 0 through Screen 9; it is necessaryto erase or rename old files when the limit is reached. This FKEY works in any Macintosh computer and saves the screen regardless ofthe setting of the screen; to use, it has to be added to the System file usingResEdit.ATTENTION 32-BIT QD USERS: A 'feature' in 32 Bit Quickdraw makes it possiblefor this FKEY to fail under normal conditions (normal means it would workokay without 32-Bit QD) the symptoms are lost cursor and empty pictures. Thecheap solutions are use Finder or increase the partition size for yourapplication.  As a quick reference if the main screen is set to 8-bits deepthen 32-Bit QD will try to allocate a 300K handle, when the main screen isa direct device 32-bit deep then 1.2M is necessary. Future versions willcompensate for this anomalous behavior.
