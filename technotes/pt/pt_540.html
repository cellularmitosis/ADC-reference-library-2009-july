Why? This hampers bug testing on the PowerBook.</p><P>The current version of <code>EvenBetterBusError</code> (creation date April 8, 1991) isn'tcompatible with the PowerBook 140, 145, 160, 170, 180 and Duos because of theway the Power Manager implements "power cycling." When a power cycle ends, thePower Manager uses location 0 to restore the processor state.</p><p><code>EvenBetterBusError</code>'s author said he'll update his program so it doesn't checkfor writes to location 0 on PowerBooks that power cycle. Until<code>EvenBetterBusError</code> is updated, turn off Rest Mode when using <code>EvenBetterBusError</code>on PowerBooks that have power cycling. When Rest Mode is turned off, the unitwill not power cycle the processor.</p><h2>Using Discipline with MacsBug</h2><P>Date Written:    8/12/91</p><P>Last reviewed:    9/17/91</p><p>At the 1991 WWDC debugging session, mention was made of using Discipline withMacsBug. How this is done? Copies of Discipline on AppleLink and on the<i>Developer CD Series</i> discs never include documentation. When I installDiscipline and reboot, I get the "MacsBug Installed" line in the originaldialog, but then I always get a "No debugger installed" dialog fromDiscipline.</p><P>Discipline's "No debugger installed" dialog is not a common message, but it canhappen if you use try to use old versions of Discipline or MacsBug, or athird-party debugger that isn't compatible with Discipline. Discipline alsodisplays this message if you have Macintosh IIci ROMs in your IIx, and thus itcan't tell whether you have a 24-bit or 32-bit machine.</p><p>If you're running System 7, you should use MacsBug 6.2.1 or later andDiscipline 2.0.1 or later. You might even want to upgrade to Discipline 2.1d1,available on the Essentials*Tools*Objects (ETO) #5 CD.</p><p>To use Discipline with MacsBug, put the Discipline system extension into theExtensions folder (in your System Folder), and put the strict or lenientDiscipline Startup document into your System Folder. For help on the Disciplinecommands, simply break into MacsBug and type DSC ? &lt;return&gt;. Pressingreturn additional times scrolls through the various pages of help.</p><p>Our lack of documentation on this tool does make it a little difficult to use.Hopefully we will be addressing that in the near future.</p><h2>Where to find Discipline module (DSC command)</h2><P>Date Written:    3/5/91</p><P>Last reviewed:    6/20/91</p><p>Where can I get the trap Discipline module (DSC command) mentioned in theMacsBug documentation?</p><P>Discipline is included with the Essentials*Tools*Objects (E.T.O.) CD startingwith #3, and is available on AppleLink.</p><h2>Where to get third-party XTND translators</h2><P>Date Written:    9/17/91</p><P>Last reviewed:    6/14/93</p><p>Where can I find XTND translators for third-party products?</p><P>The only XTND translators available from Apple ship with the XTND 1.3 package.You get MacWrite II, MacWrite 5.0, MacPaint, and PICT. To obtain moretranslators, you can purchase them from one of the companies that sell XTNDtranslators (DataViz is one such company). You can also write your owntranslators. You might want to write translators for your own products and makethem available to other third parties.</p><p>The translators that Claris ships with their products were written by Clarisand are not currently available for distribution with your products. (However,any of your users who have these Claris translators will be able to use anyXTND-aware product you have created with their translators.)</P><h2>RAMDump and ReAnimator modem &amp; printer nub extensions</h2><P>Date Written:    10/2/91</p><P>Last reviewed:    10/15/91</p><p>On the "Desperately Seeking Seven" Developer CD, I found RamDump/ReAnimator,with a thing called ModemNub. The release notes claim documentation is includedwith it, but there isn't any. Could you possibly round up some documentation?</p><P>You can obtain documentation on these utilities from APDA when you purchaseRAMDump &amp; ReAnimator v.1.0 (#M7045, $20.00). The trick, however, is thatthese utilities haven't been updated since October, 1988, so RAMDump 1.0 won'twork on the Macintosh IIci or IIfx (RAMDump isn't aware of the floppycontroller, thus it can't write to the disk). The revised version of RAMDumpthat you found on the Desperately Seeking Seven CD should address thisproblem.</p><p>To debug a running program using ReAnimator via two Macintosh systems, you needto have the following setup: Have a host Macintosh running ReAnimator, and thetarget Mac running the Nub init (modem nub or printer nub, depending on theport you use). This allows the host Mac to stop the target Mac, start it, andread its memory over the serial line. You run the program to be debugged on thetarget machine. Since ReAnimator is not running on the machine that is beingdebugged, ReAnimator can use windows and menus without interfering in thedebugging process. When debugging a live Macintosh over a serial link,ReAnimator can step, trace, and perform other flow control instructions.</p><br>         <a name=Downloads></A>                  <P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></p><h2>Downloadables</H2>                  <TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <td width=50 align=left>                  <P ALIGN=center><img src="images/acrobatsmall.gif" width=22 height=23 align=middle alt="Acrobat gif"></P>               </TD>               <td align="left">                  <P>Acrobat version of this Note (36K).</P>               </TD>               <td width=60 align=left>                  <P><A HREF="pdf/pt_540.pdf">Download</A></P>               </TD>            </TR>                    </TABLE>         <BR></TD></TR></table></center><!-- begin_footer_information -->	<table width="680" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
