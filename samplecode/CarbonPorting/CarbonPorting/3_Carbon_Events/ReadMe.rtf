Step 3 in your Carbonizing project is to start to "modernize" it.  This version switches exclusively to Carbon Events, RunApplicationEventLoop(), and standard handlers.  This was a lot easier due to the setup made in version 1.0 of the study (see that version's Read Me).  Most of the event handlers were salvageable, but the event loop and event dispatcher portions had to be rewritten.  The trickiest parts were supporting the list's scroll bar in the window, and supporting using the keyboard to dismiss the dialog.  The Carbon Event model doesn't really support the Dialog Manager very well so in order to keep using the dialog item handler, the pertinent controls have their Dialog Item IDs assigned as their Control IDs.  The window/list method continues to be tedious, 832 (+208 from 2.0) lines to 456 (+133 from 2.0) lines for the dialog/list box control method.}
