curl(1)                                          Curl Manual                                         curl(1)



<b>NAME</b>
       curl - transfer a URL

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>curl</b> <b>[options]</b> <u>[URL...]</u>

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       <b>curl</b>  is  a  tool  to  transfer data from or to a server, using one of the supported protocols (HTTP,
       HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SCP, SFTP, TFTP, DICT, TELNET, LDAP or FILE).  The  command  is  designed  to  work
       without user interaction.

       curl  offers  a  busload  of  useful tricks like proxy support, user authentication, ftp upload, HTTP
       post, SSL connections, cookies, file transfer resume and more. As you will see below, the  amount  of
       features will make your head spin!

       curl is powered by libcurl for all transfer-related features. See <a href="../man3/libcurl.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/libcurl"><b>libcurl</b>(3)</a> for details.

<b>URL</b>
       The URL syntax is protocol dependent. You'll find a detailed description in RFC 3986.

       You can specify multiple URLs or parts of URLs by writing part sets within braces as in:

        <a href="http://site.{one,two,three}.com">http://site.{one,two,three}.com</a>

       or you can get sequences of alphanumeric series by using [] as in:

        <a href="ftp://ftp.numericals.com/file[1-100].txt">ftp://ftp.numericals.com/file[1-100].txt</a>
        <a href="ftp://ftp.numericals.com/file[001-100].txt">ftp://ftp.numericals.com/file[001-100].txt</a>    (with leading zeros)
        <a href="ftp://ftp.letters.com/file[a-z].txt">ftp://ftp.letters.com/file[a-z].txt</a>

       No  nesting  of  the  sequences is supported at the moment, but you can use several ones next to each
       other:

        <a href="http://any.org/archive[1996-1999]/vol[1-4]/part{a,b,c}.html">http://any.org/archive[1996-1999]/vol[1-4]/part{a,b,c}.html</a>

       You can specify any amount of URLs on the command line. They will be fetched in a  sequential  manner
       in the specified order.

       Since  curl  7.15.1  you  can also specify step counter for the ranges, so that you can get every Nth
       number or letter:

        <a href="http://www.numericals.com/file[1-100:10].txt">http://www.numericals.com/file[1-100:10].txt</a>
        <a href="http://www.letters.com/file[a-z:2].txt">http://www.letters.com/file[a-z:2].txt</a>

       If you specify URL without protocol:// prefix, curl will attempt to guess  what  protocol  you  might
       want.  It  will  then default to HTTP but try other protocols based on often-used host name prefixes.
       For example, for host names starting with "ftp." curl will assume you want to speak FTP.

       Curl will attempt to re-use connections for multiple file transfers, so that getting many files  from
       the  same  server  will not do multiple connects / handshakes. This improves speed. Of course this is
       only done on files specified on a single command line  and  cannot  be  used  between  separate  curl
       invokes.

<b>PROGRESS</b> <b>METER</b>
       curl  normally  displays  a  progress  meter during operations, indicating amount of transfered data,
       transfer speeds and estimated time left etc.

       However, since curl displays data to the terminal by default, if you invoke curl to do  an  operation
       and  it  is about to write data to the terminal, it <u>disables</u> the progress meter as otherwise it would
       mess up the output mixing progress meter and response data.

       If you want a progress meter for HTTP POST or PUT requests, you need to redirect the response  output
       to a file, using shell redirect (&gt;), -o [file] or similar.

       It is not the same case for FTP upload as that operation is not spitting out any response data to the
       terminal.

       If you prefer a progress "bar" instead of the regular meter, <u>-#</u> is your friend.

<b>OPTIONS</b>
       -a/--append
              (FTP) When used in an FTP upload, this will tell curl to append to the target file instead  of
              overwriting it. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created.

              If this option is used twice, the second one will disable append mode again.

       -A/--user-agent &lt;agent string&gt;
              (HTTP)  Specify the User-Agent string to send to the HTTP server. Some badly done CGIs fail if
              its not set to "Mozilla/4.0".  To encode blanks in the string, surround the string with single
              quote marks.  This can also be set with the <u>-H/--header</u> option of course.

              If this option is set more than once, the last one will be the one that's used.

       --anyauth
              (HTTP)  Tells  curl to figure out authentication method by itself, and use the most secure one
              the remote site claims it supports. This is done by first doing a  request  and  checking  the
              response-headers, thus inducing an extra network round-trip. This is used instead of setting a
              specific authentication method, which you can do with <u>--basic</u>, <u>--digest</u>, <u>--ntlm</u>, and <u>--negoti</u>-
              <u>ate</u>.

              Note  that  using  --anyauth  is  not  recommended  if you do uploads from stdin, since it may
              require data to be sent twice and then the client must be able to rewind. If the  need  should
              arise when uploading from stdin, the upload operation will fail.

              If this option is used several times, the following occurrences make no difference.

       -b/--cookie &lt;name=data&gt;
              (HTTP)  Pass  the  data  to  the HTTP server as a cookie. It is supposedly the data previously
              received from the server  in  a  "Set-Cookie:"  line.   The  data  should  be  in  the  format
              "NAME1=VALUE1; NAME2=VALUE2".

              If  no  '='  letter is used in the line, it is treated as a filename to use to read previously
              stored cookie lines from, which should be used in this  session  if  they  match.  Using  this
              method  also  activates  the "cookie parser" which will make curl record incoming cookies too,
              which may be handy if you're using this in combination with the <u>-L/--location</u> option. The file
              format  of  the file to read cookies from should be plain HTTP headers or the Netscape/Mozilla
              cookie file format.

              <b>NOTE</b> that the file specified with <u>-b/--cookie</u> is only used as input. No cookies will be stored
              in  the file. To store cookies, use the <u>-c/--cookie-jar</u> option or you could even save the HTTP
              headers to a file using <u>-D/--dump-header</u>!

              If this option is set more than once, the last one will be the one that's used.

       -B/--use-ascii
              Enable ASCII transfer when using FTP or LDAP. For FTP, this can also be enforced by  using  an
              URL  that  ends  with ";type=A". This option causes data sent to stdout to be in text mode for
              win32 systems.

              If this option is used twice, the second one will disable ASCII usage.

       --basic
              (HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP Basic authentication. This is the default  and  this  option  is
              usually pointless, unless you use it to override a previously set option that sets a different
              authentication method (such as <u>--ntlm</u>, <u>--digest</u> and <u>--negotiate</u>).

              If this option is used several times, the following occurrences make no difference.

       --ciphers &lt;list of ciphers&gt;
              (SSL) Specifies which ciphers to use in the connection. The list  of  ciphers  must  be  using
              valid    ciphers.    Read    up    on    SSL    cipher    list    details    on    this   URL:
              <a href="http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html"><u>http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html</u></a>

              NSS ciphers are done differently than OpenSSL and GnuTLS. The full list of NSS ciphers  is  in
              the      NSSCipherSuite      entry      at      this     URL:     <a href="http://directory.fedora.redhat.com/docs/mod_nss.html#Directives"><u>http://directory.fedora.red</u>-</a>
              <a href="http://directory.fedora.redhat.com/docs/mod_nss.html#Directives"><u>hat.com/docs/mod</u><b>_</b><u>nss.html#Directives</u></a>

              If this option is used several times, the last one will override the others.

       --compressed
              (HTTP) Request a compressed response using one of the algorithms libcurl supports, and  return
              the  uncompressed document.  If this option is used and the server sends an unsupported encod-
              ing, Curl will report an error.

              If this option is used several times, each occurrence will toggle it on/off.

       --connect-timeout &lt;seconds&gt;
              Maximum time in seconds that you allow the connection to the server to take.  This only limits
              the  connection  phase,  once  curl  has connected this option is of no more use. See also the
              <u>-m/--max-time</u> option.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       -c/--cookie-jar &lt;file name&gt;
              Specify to which file you want curl to write all cookies after  a  completed  operation.  Curl
              writes  all cookies previously read from a specified file as well as all cookies received from
              remote <!-- a -->server(s)<!-- /a -->. If no cookies are known, no file will be written. The file will  be  written
              using  the  Netscape  cookie  file format. If you set the file name to a single dash, "-", the
              cookies will be written to stdout.

              <b>NOTE</b> If the cookie jar can't be created or written to, the whole curl operation won't fail  or
              even report an error clearly. Using -v will get a warning displayed, but that is the only vis-
              ible feedback you get about this possibly lethal situation.

              If this option is used several times, the last specified file name will be used.

       -C/--continue-at &lt;offset&gt;
              Continue/Resume a previous file transfer at the given offset. The given offset  is  the  exact
              number  of  bytes that will be skipped counted from the beginning of the source file before it
              is transferred to the destination.  If used with uploads, the ftp server command SIZE will not
              be used by curl.

              Use  "-C  -"  to tell curl to automatically find out where/how to resume the transfer. It then
              uses the given output/input files to figure that out.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --create-dirs
              When used in conjunction with the -o option, curl will create the  necessary  local  directory
              hierarchy  as needed. This option creates the dirs mentioned with the -o option, nothing else.
              If the -o file name uses no dir or if the dirs it mentions already exist, no dir will be  cre-
              ated.

              To create remote directories when using FTP or SFTP, try <u>--ftp-create-dirs</u>.

       --crlf (FTP) Convert LF to CRLF in upload. Useful for MVS (OS/390).

              If this option is used several times, the following occurrences make no difference.

       -d/--data &lt;data&gt;
              (HTTP)  Sends  the specified data in a POST request to the HTTP server, in a way that can emu-
              late as if a user has filled in a HTML form and pressed the submit button. Note that the  data
              is  sent  exactly as specified with no extra processing (with all newlines cut off).  The data
              is expected to be "url-encoded". This will cause curl to pass the data to the server using the
              content-type  application/x-www-form-urlencoded.  Compare to <u>-F/--form</u>. If this option is used
              more than once on the same command line, the data pieces specified  will  be  merged  together
              with  a separating &amp;-letter. Thus, using '-d name=daniel -d skill=lousy' would generate a post
              chunk that looks like 'name=daniel&amp;skill=lousy'.

              If you start the data with the letter @, the rest should be a file name to read the data from,
              or  -  if you want curl to read the data from stdin.  The contents of the file must already be
              url-encoded. Multiple files can also be specified. Posting data from  a  file  named  'foobar'
              would thus be done with <u>--data</u> @foobar".

              To post data purely binary, you should instead use the <u>--data-binary</u> option.

              <u>-d/--data</u> is the same as <u>--data-ascii</u>.

              If this option is used several times, the ones following the first will append data.

       --data-ascii &lt;data&gt;
              (HTTP) This is an alias for the <u>-d/--data</u> option.

              If this option is used several times, the ones following the first will append data.

       --data-binary &lt;data&gt;
              (HTTP)  This  posts  data  in  a similar manner as <u>--data-ascii</u> does, although when using this
              option the entire context of the posted data is kept as-is. If you want to post a binary  file
              without the strip-newlines feature of the <u>--data-ascii</u> option, this is for you.

              If this option is used several times, the ones following the first will append data.

       --digest
              (HTTP) Enables HTTP Digest authentication. This is a authentication that prevents the password
              from being sent over the wire in clear text. Use this in combination with the normal <u>-u/--user</u>
              option  to  set user name and password. See also <u>--ntlm</u>, <u>--negotiate</u> and <u>--anyauth</u> for related
              options.

              If this option is used several times, the following occurrences make no difference.

       --disable-eprt
              (FTP) Tell curl to disable the use of the EPRT and LPRT commands when doing active FTP  trans-
              fers.  Curl  will  normally always first attempt to use EPRT, then LPRT before using PORT, but
              with this option, it will use PORT right away. EPRT and LPRT are extensions  to  the  original
              FTP  protocol,  may not work on all servers but enable more functionality in a better way than
              the traditional PORT command.

              If this option is used several times, each occurrence will toggle this on/off.

       --disable-epsv
              (FTP) Tell curl to disable the use of the EPSV command when doing passive FTP transfers.  Curl
              will  normally always first attempt to use EPSV before PASV, but with this option, it will not
              try using EPSV.

              If this option is used several times, each occurrence will toggle this on/off.

       -D/--dump-header &lt;file&gt;
              Write the protocol headers to the specified file.

              This option is handy to use when you want to store the headers that a HTTP site sends to  you.
              Cookies  from  the headers could then be read in a second curl invoke by using the <u>-b/--cookie</u>
              option! The <u>-c/--cookie-jar</u> option is however a better way to store cookies.

              When used on FTP, the ftp server response lines are considered being "headers"  and  thus  are
              saved there.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       -e/--referer &lt;URL&gt;
              (HTTP)  Sends the "Referer Page" information to the HTTP server. This can also be set with the
              <u>-H/--header</u> flag of course.  When used with <u>-L/--location</u> you can append ";auto" to the --ref-
              erer  URL  to make curl automatically set the previous URL when it follows a Location: header.
              The ";auto" string can be used alone, even if you don't set an initial --referer.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --engine &lt;name&gt;
              Select the OpenSSL crypto engine to use for cipher operations. Use <u>--engine</u> <u>list</u>  to  print  a
              list of build-time supported engines. Note that not all (or none) of the engines may be avail-
              able at run-time.

       --environment
              (RISC OS ONLY) Sets a range of environment variables, using the names the -w option  supports,
              to easier allow extraction of useful information after having run curl.

              If this option is used several times, each occurrence will toggle this on/off.

       --egd-file &lt;file&gt;
              (SSL) Specify the path name to the Entropy Gathering Daemon socket. The socket is used to seed
              the random engine for SSL connections. See also the <u>--random-file</u> option.

       -E/--cert &lt;certificate[:password]&gt;
              (SSL) Tells curl to use the specified certificate file when getting a file with HTTPS or FTPS.
              The  certificate  must be in PEM format.  If the optional password isn't specified, it will be
              queried for on the terminal. Note that this option assumes a "certificate" file  that  is  the
              private  key  and  the  private certificate concatenated! See <u>--cert</u> and <u>--key</u> to specify them
              independently.

              If curl is built against the NSS SSL library then this option tells curl the nickname  of  the
              certificate to use within the NSS database defined by --cacert.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --cert-type &lt;type&gt;
              (SSL)  Tells  curl  what certificate type the provided certificate is in. PEM, DER and ENG are
              recognized types.  If not specified, PEM is assumed.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --cacert &lt;CA certificate&gt;
              (SSL) Tells curl to use the specified certificate file to verify the peer. The file  may  con-
              tain multiple CA certificates. The <!-- a -->certificate(s)<!-- /a --> must be in PEM format.

              curl  recognizes  the environment variable named 'CURL_CA_BUNDLE' if that is set, and uses the
              given path as a path to a CA cert bundle. This option overrides that variable.

              The windows version of curl will automatically look for a CA certs  file  named  'curl-ca-bun-
              dle.crt', either in the same directory as curl.exe, or in the Current Working Directory, or in
              any folder along your PATH.

              If curl is built against the NSS SSL library then this option tells curl  the  directory  that
              the NSS certificate database resides in.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --capath &lt;CA certificate directory&gt;
              (SSL)  Tells  curl to use the specified certificate directory to verify the peer. The certifi-
              cates must be in PEM format, and the directory must have been  processed  using  the  c_rehash
              utility supplied with openssl. Using <u>--capath</u> can allow curl to make SSL-connections much more
              efficiently than using <u>--cacert</u> if the <u>--cacert</u> file contains many CA certificates.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       -f/--fail
              (HTTP) Fail silently (no output at all) on server errors. This is mostly  done  like  this  to
              better  enable  scripts  etc  to better deal with failed attempts. In normal cases when a HTTP
              server fails to deliver a document, it returns an HTML document stating so (which  often  also
              describes why and more). This flag will prevent curl from outputting that and return error 22.

              This method is not fail-safe and there are occasions where non-successful response codes  will
              slip through, especially when authentication is involved (response codes 401 and 407).

              If this option is used twice, the second will again disable silent failure.

       --ftp-account [data]
              (FTP)  When  an  FTP server asks for "account data" after user name and password has been pro-
              vided, this data is sent off using the ACCT command. (Added in 7.13.0)

              If this option is used twice, the second will override the previous use.

       --ftp-create-dirs
              (FTP) When an FTP or SFTP URL/operation uses a  path  that  doesn't  currently  exist  on  the
              server, the standard behavior of curl is to fail. Using this option, curl will instead attempt
              to create missing directories.

              If this option is used twice, the second will again disable directory creation.

       --ftp-method [method]
              (FTP) Control what method curl should use to reach a file on a <!-- a -->FTP(S)<!-- /a --> server. The method argu-
              ment should be one of the following alternatives:

              multicwd
                     curl  does a single CWD operation for each path part in the given URL. For deep hierar-
                     chies this means very many commands. This is how RFC1738 says it should be  done.  This
                     is the default but the slowest behavior.

              nocwd  curl  does no CWD at all. curl will do SIZE, RETR, STOR etc and give a full path to the
                     server for all these commands. This is the fastest behavior.

              singlecwd
                     curl does one CWD with the full target directory and then operates on  the  file  "nor-
                     mally"  (like  in  the  multicwd  case). This is somewhat more standards compliant than
                     'nocwd' but without the full penalty of 'multicwd'.

       --ftp-pasv
              (FTP) Use PASV when transferring. PASV is the internal default behavior, but using this option
              can be used to override a previous --ftp-port option. (Added in 7.11.0)

              If this option is used several times, the following occurrences make no difference.

       --ftp-alternative-to-user &lt;command&gt;
              (FTP)  If  authenticating with the USER and PASS commands fails, send this command.  When con-
              necting to Tumbleweed's Secure Transport server over FTPS using a  client  certificate,  using
              "SITE  AUTH"  will  tell  the  server to retrieve the username from the certificate. (Added in
              7.15.5)

       --ftp-skip-pasv-ip
              (FTP) Tell curl to not use the IP address the server suggests in its response to  curl's  PASV
              command  when  curl connects the data connection. Instead curl will re-use the same IP address
              it already uses for the control connection. (Added in 7.14.2)

              This option has no effect if PORT, EPRT or EPSV is used instead of PASV.

              If this option is used twice, the second will again use the server's suggested address.

       --ftp-ssl
              (FTP) Try to use SSL/TLS for the FTP connection.  Reverts to a non-secure  connection  if  the
              server  doesn't  support SSL/TLS.  See also <u>--ftp-ssl-control</u> and <u>--ftp-ssl-reqd</u> for different
              levels of encryption required. (Added in 7.11.0)

              If this option is used twice, the second will again disable this.

       --ftp-ssl-control
              (FTP) Require SSL/TLS for the ftp login, clear for transfer.   Allows  secure  authentication,
              but  non-encrypted  data  transfers  for efficiency.  Fails the transfer if the server doesn't
              support SSL/TLS.  (Added in 7.16.0)

              If this option is used twice, the second will again disable this.

       --ftp-ssl-reqd
              (FTP) Require SSL/TLS for the FTP connection.  Terminates the connection if the server doesn't
              support SSL/TLS.  (Added in 7.15.5)

              If this option is used twice, the second will again disable this.

       --ftp-ssl-ccc
              (FTP)  Use  CCC (Clear Command Channel) Shuts down the SSL/TLS layer after authenticating. The
              rest of the control channel communication will be unencrypted. This allows NAT routers to fol-
              low  the FTP transaction. The default mode is passive. See --ftp-ssl-ccc-mode for other modes.
              (Added in 7.16.1)

              If this option is used twice, the second will again disable this.

       --ftp-ssl-ccc-mode [active/passive]
              (FTP) Use CCC (Clear Command Channel) Sets the CCC mode. The passive mode  will  not  initiate
              the  shutdown,  but  instead  wait for the server to do it, and will not reply to the shutdown
              from the server. The active mode initiates the shutdown and waits for a reply from the server.
              (Added in 7.16.2)

       -F/--form &lt;name=content&gt;
              (HTTP)  This lets curl emulate a filled in form in which a user has pressed the submit button.
              This causes curl to POST data using the Content-Type multipart/form-data according to RFC1867.
              This  enables  uploading of binary files etc. To force the 'content' part to be a file, prefix
              the file name with an @ sign. To just get the content part from a file, prefix the  file  name
              with  the letter &lt;. The difference between @ and &lt; is then that @ makes a file get attached in
              the post as a file upload, while the &lt; makes a text field and just get the contents  for  that
              text field from a file.

              Example,  to  send your password file to the server, where 'password' is the name of the form-
              field to which /etc/passwd will be the input:

              <b>curl</b> -F password=@/etc/passwd www.mypasswords.com

              To read the file's content from stdin instead of a file, use - where the file  name  should've
              been. This goes for both @ and &lt; constructs.

              You can also tell curl what Content-Type to use by using 'type=', in a manner similar to:

              <b>curl</b> -F "web=@index.html;type=text/html" url.com

              or

              <b>curl</b> -F "name=daniel;type=text/foo" url.com

              You  can  also  explicitly  change the name field of an file upload part by setting filename=,
              like this:

              <b>curl</b> -F "file=@localfile;filename=nameinpost" url.com

              See further examples and details in the MANUAL.

              This option can be used multiple times.

       --form-string &lt;name=string&gt;
              (HTTP) Similar to <u>--form</u> except that the value string for the named parameter is  used  liter-
              ally.  Leading  '@'  and  '&lt;' characters, and the ';type=' string in the value have no special
              meaning. Use this in preference to <u>--form</u> if there's any possibility that the string value may
              accidentally trigger the '@' or '&lt;' features of <u>--form</u>.

       -g/--globoff
              This  option switches off the "URL globbing parser". When you set this option, you can specify
              URLs that contain the letters {}[] without having them being interpreted by curl itself.  Note
              that  these  letters are not normal legal URL contents but they should be encoded according to
              the URI standard.

       -G/--get
              When used, this option will make all data specified with <u>-d/--data</u> or <u>--data-binary</u> to be used
              in  a HTTP GET request instead of the POST request that otherwise would be used. The data will
              be appended to the URL with a '?'  separator.

              If used in combination with -I, the POST data will instead be appended to the URL with a  HEAD
              request.

              If this option is used several times, the following occurrences make no difference.

       -h/--help
              Usage help.

       -H/--header &lt;header&gt;
              (HTTP)  Extra header to use when getting a web page. You may specify any number of extra head-
              ers. Note that if you should add a custom header that has the same name as one of the internal
              ones curl would use, your externally set header will be used instead of the internal one. This
              allows you to make even trickier stuff than curl would normally do.  You  should  not  replace
              internally  set  headers  without knowing perfectly well what you're doing. Remove an internal
              header by giving a replacement without content on the right side  of  the  colon,  as  in:  -H
              "Host:".

              curl  will  make  sure  that  each header you add/replace get sent with the proper end of line
              marker, you should thus <b>not</b> add that as a part of the header content: do not add  newlines  or
              carriage returns they will only mess things up for you.

              See also the <u>-A/--user-agent</u> and <u>-e/--referer</u> options.

              This option can be used multiple times to add/replace/remove multiple headers.

       --ignore-content-length
              (HTTP)  Ignore  the  Content-Length  header.  This  is particularly useful for servers running
              Apache 1.x, which will report incorrect Content-Length for files larger than 2 gigabytes.

       -i/--include
              (HTTP) Include the HTTP-header in the output. The HTTP-header  includes  things  like  server-
              name, date of the document, HTTP-version and more...

              If this option is used twice, the second will again disable header include.

       --interface &lt;name&gt;
              Perform  an operation using a specified interface. You can enter interface name, IP address or
              host name. An example could look like:

               curl --interface eth0:1 <a href="http://www.netscape.com/">http://www.netscape.com/</a>

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       -I/--head
              (HTTP/FTP/FILE) Fetch the HTTP-header only! HTTP-servers feature the command HEAD  which  this
              uses  to  get nothing but the header of a document. When used on a FTP or FILE file, curl dis-
              plays the file size and last modification time only.

              If this option is used twice, the second will again disable header only.

       -j/--junk-session-cookies
              (HTTP) When curl is told to read cookies from a given file, this option will make  it  discard
              all  "session  cookies".  This  will  basically  have  the  same effect as if a new session is
              started. Typical browsers always discard session cookies when they're closed down.

              If this option is used several times, each occurrence will toggle this on/off.

       -k/--insecure
              (SSL) This option explicitly allows curl to perform "insecure" SSL connections and  transfers.
              All  SSL  connections  are  attempted  to  be  made  secure by using the CA certificate bundle
              installed by default.  This  makes  all  connections  considered  "insecure"  to  fail  unless
              <u>-k/--insecure</u> is used.

              See this online resource for further details: <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html"><b>http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html</b></a>

              If this option is used twice, the second time will again disable it.

       --key &lt;key&gt;
              (SSL/SSH) Private key file name. Allows you to provide your private key in this separate file.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --key-type &lt;type&gt;
              (SSL) Private key file type. Specify which type your <u>--key</u> provided private key is.  DER,  PEM
              and ENG are supported. If not specified, PEM is assumed.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --krb4 &lt;level&gt;
              (FTP)  Enable Kerberos4 authentication and use. The level must be entered and should be one of
              'clear', 'safe', 'confidential' or 'private'. Should you use a level that is not one of these,
              'private' will instead be used.

              This  option requires that the library was built with Kerberos4 support. This is not very com-
              mon. Use <u>-V/--version</u> to see if your curl supports it.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       -K/--config &lt;config file&gt;
              Specify which config file to read curl arguments from. The config file is a text file in which
              command  line  arguments can be written which then will be used as if they were written on the
              actual command line. Options and their parameters must be specified on the  same  config  file
              line.  If  the  parameter  is  to  contain white spaces, the parameter must be enclosed within
              quotes.  If the first column of a config line is a '#' character, the rest of the line will be
              treated as a comment. Only write one option per physical line in the config file.

              Specify the filename to -K/--config as '-' to make curl read the file from stdin.

              Note  that  to  be  able to specify a URL in the config file, you need to specify it using the
              <u>--url</u> option, and not by simply writing the URL on its own line. So, it could look similar  to
              this:

              url = "<a href="http://curl.haxx.se/docs/">http://curl.haxx.se/docs/</a>"

              Long  option  names  can  optionally  be  given  in the config file without the initial double
              dashes.

              When curl is invoked, it always (unless <u>-q</u> is used) checks for a default config file and  uses
              it if found. The default config file is checked for in the following places in this order:

              1)  curl  tries  to  find  the "home dir": It first checks for the CURL_HOME and then the HOME
              environment variables. Failing that, it uses getpwuid() on unix-like  systems  (which  returns
              the  home  dir given the current user in your system). On Windows, it then checks for the APP-
              DATA variable, or as a last resort the '%USERPROFILE%0lication Data'.

              2) On windows, if there is no _curlrc file in the home dir, it checks for one in the same  dir
              the  executable  curl is placed. On unix-like systems, it will simply try to load .curlrc from
              the determined home dir.

              # --- Example file ---
              # this is a comment
              url = "curl.haxx.se"
              output = "curlhere.html"
              user-agent = "superagent/1.0"

              # and fetch another URL too
              url = "curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html"
              -O
              referer = "<a href="http://nowhereatall.com/">http://nowhereatall.com/</a>"
              # --- End of example file ---

              This option can be used multiple times to load multiple config files.

       --libcurl &lt;file&gt;
              Append this option to any ordinary curl command line, and you will get a libcurl-using  source
              code  written  to the file that does the equivalent operation of what your command line opera-
              tion does!

              If this option is used several times, the last given file name will be used.

       --limit-rate &lt;speed&gt;
              Specify the maximum transfer rate you want curl to use. This feature is useful if you  have  a
              limited pipe and you'd like your transfer not use your entire bandwidth.

              The  given  speed  is measured in bytes/second, unless a suffix is appended.  Appending 'k' or
              'K' will count the number as kilobytes, 'm' or M' makes it megabytes while 'g' or 'G' makes it
              gigabytes. Examples: 200K, 3m and 1G.

              The  given  rate  is the average speed, counted during the entire transfer. It means that curl
              might use higher transfer speeds in short bursts, but over time it uses no more than the given
              rate.

              If  you are also using the <u>-Y/--speed-limit</u> option, that option will take precedence and might
              cripple the rate-limiting slightly, to help keeping the speed-limit logic working.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       -l/--list-only
              (FTP) When listing an FTP directory, this switch forces a name-only view.   Especially  useful
              if  you want to machine-parse the contents of an FTP directory since the normal directory view
              doesn't use a standard look or format.

              This option causes an FTP NLST command to be sent.  Some FTP servers list only files in  their
              response to NLST; they do not include subdirectories and symbolic links.

              If this option is used twice, the second will again disable list only.

       --local-port &lt;num&gt;[-num]
              Set a preferred number or range of local port numbers to use for the <!-- a -->connection(s)<!-- /a -->.  Note that
              port numbers by nature is a scarce resource that will be busy at times so setting  this  range
              to something too narrow might cause unnecessary connection setup failures. (Added in 7.15.2)

       -L/--location
              (HTTP/HTTPS)  If  the server reports that the requested page has moved to a different location
              (indicated with a Location: header and a 3XX response code) this option will  make  curl  redo
              the  request  on  the new place. If used together with <u>-i/--include</u> or <u>-I/--head</u>, headers from
              all requested pages will be shown. When authentication is used, curl only  sends  its  creden-
              tials  to  the initial host. If a redirect takes curl to a different host, it won't be able to
              intercept the user+password. See also <u>--location-trusted</u> on how to change this. You can  limit
              the amount of redirects to follow by using the <u>--max-redirs</u> option.

              When  curl follows a redirect and the request is not a plain GET (for example POST or PUT), it
              will do the following request with a GET if the HTTP response was 301, 302,  or  303.  If  the
              response  code  was any other 3xx code, curl will re-send the following request using the same
              unmodified method.

              If this option is used twice, the second will again disable location following.

       --location-trusted
              (HTTP/HTTPS) Like <u>-L/--location</u>, but will allow sending the name + password to all hosts  that
              the  site  may  redirect to. This may or may not introduce a security breach if the site redi-
              rects you do a site to which you'll send your authentication info (which is plaintext  in  the
              case of HTTP Basic authentication).

              If this option is used twice, the second will again disable location following.

       --max-filesize &lt;bytes&gt;
              Specify  the  maximum  size  (in bytes) of a file to download. If the file requested is larger
              than this value, the transfer will not start and curl will return with exit code 63.

              NOTE: The file size is not always known prior to download, and for such files this option  has
              no  effect even if the file transfer ends up being larger than this given limit. This concerns
              both FTP and HTTP transfers.

       -m/--max-time &lt;seconds&gt;
              Maximum time in seconds that you allow the whole operation to take.  This is useful  for  pre-
              venting  your batch jobs from hanging for hours due to slow networks or links going down.  See
              also the <u>--connect-timeout</u> option.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       -M/--manual
              Manual. Display the huge help text.

       -n/--netrc
              Makes curl scan the <u>.netrc</u> file in the user's home directory for login name and password. This
              is  typically  used  for ftp on unix. If used with http, curl will enable user authentication.
              See <a href="ftp.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/ftp"><b>ftp(1)</b></a><b></b> for details on the file format. Curl will not complain  if  that  file  hasn't  the
              right permissions (it should not be world nor group readable). The environment variable "HOME"
              is used to find the home directory.

              A quick and very simple example of how to setup a <u>.netrc</u> to allow curl to ftp to  the  machine
              host.domain.com with user name 'myself' and password 'secret' should look similar to:

              <b>machine</b> <b>host.domain.com</b> <b>login</b> <b>myself</b> <b>password</b> <b>secret</b>

              If this option is used twice, the second will again disable netrc usage.

       --netrc-optional
              Very  similar to <u>--netrc</u>, but this option makes the .netrc usage <b>optional</b> and not mandatory as
              the <u>--netrc</u> does.

       --negotiate
              (HTTP)  Enables  GSS-Negotiate  authentication.  The  GSS-Negotiate  method  was  designed  by
              Microsoft  and  is used in their web applications. It is primarily meant as a support for Ker-
              beros5 authentication but may be also used along with another authentication methods. For more
              information see IETF draft draft-brezak-spnego-http-04.txt.

              This  option requires that the library was built with GSSAPI support. This is not very common.
              Use <u>-V/--version</u> to see if your version supports GSS-Negotiate.

              When using this option, you must also provide a fake -u/--user option to activate the  authen-
              tication  code  properly. Sending a '-u :' is enough as the user name and password from the -u
              option aren't actually used.

              If this option is used several times, the following occurrences make no difference.

       -N/--no-buffer
              Disables the buffering of the output stream. In normal work situations, curl will use a  stan-
              dard  buffered output stream that will have the effect that it will output the data in chunks,
              not necessarily exactly when the data arrives.  Using this option will disable that buffering.

              If this option is used twice, the second will again switch on buffering.

       --no-sessionid
              (SSL)  Disable  curl's use of SSL session-ID caching.  By default all transfers are done using
              the cache. Note that while nothing ever should get hurt by attempting to  reuse  SSL  session-
              IDs,  there  seem to be broken SSL implementations in the wild that may require you to disable
              this in order for you to succeed. (Added in 7.16.0)

              If this option is used twice, the second will again switch on use of the session cache.

       --ntlm (HTTP) Enables NTLM authentication. The NTLM authentication method was designed  by  Microsoft
              and  is  used  by IIS web servers. It is a proprietary protocol, reversed engineered by clever
              people and implemented in curl based on their efforts. This kind of  behavior  should  not  be
              endorsed,  you  should  encourage  everyone who uses NTLM to switch to a public and documented
              authentication method instead. Such as Digest.

              If you want to enable NTLM for your proxy authentication, then use <u>--proxy-ntlm</u>.

              This option requires that the library was built with SSL support. Use <u>-V/--version</u> to  see  if
              your curl supports NTLM.

              If this option is used several times, the following occurrences make no difference.

       -o/--output &lt;file&gt;
              Write  output  to  &lt;file&gt; instead of stdout. If you are using {} or [] to fetch multiple docu-
              ments, you can use '#' followed by a number in the &lt;file&gt; specifier.  That  variable  will  be
              replaced with the current string for the URL being fetched. Like in:

                curl <a href="http://{one,two}.site.com">http://{one,two}.site.com</a> -o "file_#1.txt"

              or use several variables like:

                curl <a href="http://{site,host}.host[1-5].com">http://{site,host}.host[1-5].com</a> -o "#1_#2"

              You may use this option as many times as you have number of URLs.

              See also the <u>--create-dirs</u> option to create the local directories dynamically.

       -O/--remote-name
              Write  output  to  a  local file named like the remote file we get. (Only the file part of the
              remote file is used, the path is cut off.)

              The remote file name to use for saving is extracted from the given URL, nothing else.

              You may use this option as many times as you have number of URLs.

       --pass &lt;phrase&gt;
              (SSL/SSH) Pass phrase for the private key

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --proxy-anyauth
              Tells curl to pick a suitable authentication method when communicating with the  given  proxy.
              This will cause an extra request/response round-trip. (Added in 7.13.2)

              If  this option is used twice, the second will again disable the proxy use-any authentication.

       --proxy-basic
              Tells curl to use HTTP Basic authentication when  communicating  with  the  given  proxy.  Use
              <u>--basic</u> for enabling HTTP Basic with a remote host. Basic is the default authentication method
              curl uses with proxies.

              If this option is used twice, the second will again disable proxy HTTP Basic authentication.

       --proxy-digest
              Tells curl to use HTTP Digest authentication when communicating  with  the  given  proxy.  Use
              <u>--digest</u> for enabling HTTP Digest with a remote host.

              If this option is used twice, the second will again disable proxy HTTP Digest.

       --proxy-ntlm
              Tells curl to use HTTP NTLM authentication when communicating with the given proxy. Use <u>--ntlm</u>
              for enabling NTLM with a remote host.

              If this option is used twice, the second will again disable proxy HTTP NTLM.

       -p/--proxytunnel
              When an HTTP proxy is used (<u>-x/--proxy</u>), this option will cause non-HTTP protocols to  attempt
              to  tunnel through the proxy instead of merely using it to do HTTP-like operations. The tunnel
              approach is made with the HTTP proxy CONNECT request and requires that the proxy allows direct
              connect to the remote port number curl wants to tunnel through to.

              If this option is used twice, the second will again disable proxy tunnel.

       --pubkey &lt;key&gt;
              (SSH) Public key file name. Allows you to provide your public key in this separate file.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       -P/--ftp-port &lt;address&gt;
              (FTP)  Reverses  the initiator/listener roles when connecting with ftp. This switch makes Curl
              use the PORT command instead of PASV. In practise, PORT tells the server  to  connect  to  the
              client's  specified address and port, while PASV asks the server for an ip address and port to
              connect to. &lt;address&gt; should be one of:

              interface
                     i.e "eth0" to specify which interface's IP address you want to use  (Unix only)

              IP address
                     i.e "192.168.10.1" to specify exact IP number

              host name
                     i.e "my.host.domain" to specify machine

              -      make curl pick the same IP address that is already used for the control connection

       If this option is used several times, the last one will be used. Disable the use of PORT with  <u>--ftp</u>-
       <u>pasv</u>.  Disable  the  attempt to use the EPRT command instead of PORT by using <u>--disable-eprt</u>. EPRT is
       really PORT++.

       -q     If used as the first parameter on the command line, the <u>curlrc</u> config file will  not  be  read
              and used. See the <u>-K/--config</u> for details on the default config file search path.

       -Q/--quote &lt;command&gt;
              (FTP/SFTP) Send an arbitrary command to the remote FTP or SFTP server. Quote commands are sent
              BEFORE the transfer is taking place (just after the initial PWD command in an FTP transfer, to
              be  exact).  To  make commands take place after a successful transfer, prefix them with a dash
              '-'.  To make commands get sent after libcurl has changed working directory, just  before  the
              transfer  <!-- a -->command(s)<!-- /a -->,  prefix  the  command with '+' (this is only supported for FTP). You may
              specify any number of commands. If the server returns failure for one  of  the  commands,  the
              entire  operation  will be aborted. You must send syntactically correct FTP commands as RFC959
              defines to FTP servers, or one of the following commands (with appropriate arguments) to  SFTP
              servers: chgrp, chmod, chown, ln, mkdir, rename, rm, rmdir, symlink.

              This option can be used multiple times.

       --random-file &lt;file&gt;
              (SSL)  Specify  the  path  name to file containing what will be considered as random data. The
              data is used to seed the random engine for SSL connections.  See also the <u>--egd-file</u> option.

       -r/--range &lt;range&gt;
              (HTTP/FTP) Retrieve a byte range (i.e a partial document)  from  a  HTTP/1.1  or  FTP  server.
              Ranges can be specified in a number of ways.

              <b>0-499</b>     specifies the first 500 bytes

              <b>500-999</b>   specifies the second 500 bytes

              <b>-500</b>      specifies the last 500 bytes

              <b>9500-</b>     specifies the bytes from offset 9500 and forward

              <b>0-0,-1</b>    specifies the first and last byte only(*)(H)

              <b>500-700,600-799</b>
                        specifies 300 bytes from offset 500(H)

              <b>100-199,500-599</b>
                        specifies two separate 100 bytes ranges(*)(H)

       (*) = NOTE that this will cause the server to reply with a multipart response!

       Only  digit  characters (0-9) are valid in 'start' and 'stop' of range syntax 'start-stop'. If a non-
       digit character is given in the range, the server's response will  be  indeterminable,  depending  on
       different server's configuration.

       You  should  also  be aware that many HTTP/1.1 servers do not have this feature enabled, so that when
       you attempt to get a range, you'll instead get the whole document.

       FTP range downloads only support the simple syntax 'start-stop' (optionally with one of  the  numbers
       omitted). It depends on the non-RFC command SIZE.

       If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --raw  When used, it disables all internal HTTP decoding of content or transfer encodings and instead
              makes them passed on unaltered, raw. (Added in 7.16.2)

              If this option is used several times, each occurrence toggles this on/off.

       -R/--remote-time
              When used, this will make libcurl attempt to figure out the timestamp of the remote file,  and
              if that is available make the local file get that same timestamp.

              If this option is used twice, the second time disables this again.

       --retry &lt;num&gt;
              If  a  transient  error  is returned when curl tries to perform a transfer, it will retry this
              number of times before giving up. Setting the number to 0 makes curl do no retries  (which  is
              the default). Transient error means either: a timeout, an FTP 5xx response code or an HTTP 5xx
              response code.

              When curl is about to retry a transfer, it will first wait one second and then for all  forth-
              coming  retries it will double the waiting time until it reaches 10 minutes which then will be
              the delay between the rest of the retries.  By using <u>--retry-delay</u> you disable  this  exponen-
              tial backoff algorithm. See also <u>--retry-max-time</u> to limit the total time allowed for retries.
              (Added in 7.12.3)

              If this option is used multiple times, the last occurrence decide the amount.

       --retry-delay &lt;seconds&gt;
              Make curl sleep this amount of time between each retry when a transfer has failed with a tran-
              sient  error  (it  changes the default backoff time algorithm between retries). This option is
              only interesting if <u>--retry</u> is also used. Setting this delay to zero will make  curl  use  the
              default backoff time.  (Added in 7.12.3)

              If this option is used multiple times, the last occurrence decide the amount.

       --retry-max-time &lt;seconds&gt;
              The retry timer is reset before the first transfer attempt. Retries will be done as usual (see
              <u>--retry</u>) as long as the timer hasn't reached this given limit. Notice that if the timer hasn't
              reached the limit, the request will be made and while performing, it may take longer than this
              given time period. To limit a single request's maximum  time,  use  <u>-m/--max-time</u>.   Set  this
              option to zero to not timeout retries. (Added in 7.12.3)

              If this option is used multiple times, the last occurrence decide the amount.

       -s/--silent
              Silent mode. Don't show progress meter or error messages.  Makes Curl mute.

              If this option is used twice, the second will again disable silent mode.

       -S/--show-error
              When used with -s it makes curl show error message if it fails.

              If this option is used twice, the second will again disable show error.

       --socks4 &lt;host[:port]&gt;
              Use  the  specified  SOCKS4  proxy. If the port number is not specified, it is assumed at port
              1080. (Added in 7.15.2)

              This option overrides any previous use of <u>-x/--proxy</u>, as they are mutually exclusive.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --socks5 &lt;host[:port]&gt;
              Use the specified SOCKS5 proxy. If the port number is not specified, it  is  assumed  at  port
              1080. (Added in 7.11.1)

              This option overrides any previous use of <u>-x/--proxy</u>, as they are mutually exclusive.

              If  this  option is used several times, the last one will be used. (This option was previously
              wrongly documented and used as --socks without the number appended.)

       --stderr &lt;file&gt;
              Redirect all writes to stderr to the specified file instead. If the file name is a plain  '-',
              it  is  instead  written  to  stdout.  This option has no point when you're using a shell with
              decent redirecting capabilities.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --tcp-nodelay
              Turn on the TCP_NODELAY option. See the <a href="../man3/curl_easy_setopt.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/curl_easy_setopt"><u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>easy</u><b>_</b><u>setopt(3)</u></a><u></u> man page for  details  about  this
              option. (Added in 7.11.2)

              If this option is used several times, each occurrence toggles this on/off.

       -t/--telnet-option &lt;OPT=val&gt;
              Pass options to the telnet protocol. Supported options are:

              TTYPE=&lt;term&gt; Sets the terminal type.

              XDISPLOC=&lt;X display&gt; Sets the X display location.

              NEW_ENV=&lt;var,val&gt; Sets an environment variable.

       -T/--upload-file &lt;file&gt;
              This  transfers  the  specified  local file to the remote URL. If there is no file part in the
              specified URL, Curl will append the local file name. NOTE that you must use a  trailing  /  on
              the  last directory to really prove to Curl that there is no file name or curl will think that
              your last directory name is the remote file name to use.  That  will  most  likely  cause  the
              upload operation to fail. If this is used on a <!-- a -->http(s)<!-- /a --> server, the PUT command will be used.

              Use the file name "-" (a single dash) to use stdin instead of a given file.

              You  can specify one -T for each URL on the command line. Each -T + URL pair specifies what to
              upload and to where. curl also supports "globbing" of the -T argument, meaning  that  you  can
              upload  multiple  files  to a single URL by using the same URL globbing style supported in the
              URL, like this:

              curl -T "{file1,file2}" <a href="http://www.uploadtothissite.com">http://www.uploadtothissite.com</a>

              or even

              curl -T "img[1-1000].png" <a href="ftp://ftp.picturemania.com/upload/">ftp://ftp.picturemania.com/upload/</a>

       --trace &lt;file&gt;
              Enables a full trace dump of all incoming and outgoing data,  including  descriptive  informa-
              tion, to the given output file. Use "-" as filename to have the output sent to stdout.

              This option overrides previous uses of <u>-v/--verbose</u> or <u>--trace-ascii</u>.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --trace-ascii &lt;file&gt;
              Enables  a  full  trace dump of all incoming and outgoing data, including descriptive informa-
              tion, to the given output file. Use "-" as filename to have the output sent to stdout.

              This is very similar to <u>--trace</u>, but leaves out the hex part and only shows the ASCII part  of
              the dump. It makes smaller output that might be easier to read for untrained humans.

              This option overrides previous uses of <u>-v/--verbose</u> or <u>--trace</u>.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --trace-time
              Prepends a time stamp to each trace or verbose line that curl displays.  (Added in 7.14.0)

              If this option is used several times, each occurrence will toggle it on/off.

       -u/--user &lt;user:password&gt;
              Specify  user and password to use for server authentication. Overrides <u>-n/--netrc</u> and <u>--netrc</u>-
              <u>optional</u>.

              If you use an SSPI-enabled curl binary and do NTLM authentication, you can force curl to  pick
              up  the  user name and password from your environment by simply specifying a single colon with
              this option: "-u :".

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       -U/--proxy-user &lt;user:password&gt;
              Specify user and password to use for proxy authentication.

              If you use an SSPI-enabled curl binary and do NTLM authentication, you can force curl to  pick
              up  the  user name and password from your environment by simply specifying a single colon with
              this option: "-U :".

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --url &lt;URL&gt;
              Specify a URL to fetch. This option is mostly handy when you want to specify <!-- a -->URL(s)<!-- /a --> in a  con-
              fig file.

              This  option  may  be  used any number of times. To control where this URL is written, use the
              <u>-o/--output</u> or the <u>-O/--remote-name</u> options.

       -v/--verbose
              Makes the fetching more verbose/talkative. Mostly usable for debugging.  Lines  starting  with
              '&gt;'  means "header data" sent by curl, '&lt;' means "header data" received by curl that is hidden
              in normal cases and lines starting with '*' means additional info provided by curl.

              Note that if you only want HTTP headers in the output, <u>-i/--include</u>  might  be  option  you're
              looking for.

              If  you  think  this  option  still doesn't give you enough details, consider using <u>--trace</u> or
              <u>--trace-ascii</u> instead.

              This option overrides previous uses of <u>--trace-ascii</u> or <u>--trace</u>.

              If this option is used twice, the second will do nothing extra.

       -V/--version
              Displays information about curl and the libcurl version it uses.

              The first line includes the full version of curl, libcurl and other 3rd party libraries linked
              with the executable.

              The  second  line  (starts with "Protocols:") shows all protocols that libcurl reports to sup-
              port.

              The third line (starts with "Features:") shows specific features  libcurl  reports  to  offer.
              Available features include:

              IPv6   You can use IPv6 with this.

              krb4   Krb4 for ftp is supported.

              SSL    HTTPS and FTPS are supported.

              libz   Automatic decompression of compressed files over HTTP is supported.

              NTLM   NTLM authentication is supported.

              GSS-Negotiate
                     Negotiate authentication is supported.

              Debug  This  curl uses a libcurl built with Debug. This enables more error-tracking and memory
                     debugging etc. For curl-developers only!

              AsynchDNS
                     This curl uses asynchronous name resolves.

              SPNEGO SPNEGO Negotiate authentication is supported.

              Largefile
                     This curl supports transfers of large files, files larger than 2GB.

              IDN    This curl supports IDN - international domain names.

              SSPI   SSPI is supported. If you use NTLM and set a blank user name,  curl  will  authenticate
                     with your current user and password.

       -w/--write-out &lt;format&gt;
              Defines  what to display on stdout after a completed and successful operation. The format is a
              string that may contain plain text mixed with any number of variables. The string can be spec-
              ified  as  "string", to get read from a particular file you specify it "@filename" and to tell
              curl to read the format from stdin you write "@-".

              The variables present in the output format will be substituted by the value or text that  curl
              thinks  fit, as described below. All variables are specified like %{variable_name} and to out-
              put a normal % you just write them like %%. You can output a newline by using \n,  a  carriage
              return with \r and a tab space with \t.

              <b>NOTE:</b>  The  %-letter  is a special letter in the win32-environment, where all occurrences of %
              must be doubled when using this option.

              Available variables are at this point:

              <b>url_effective</b>  The URL that was fetched last. This is mostly meaningful if you've told curl to
                             follow location: headers.

              <b>http_code</b>      The numerical code that was found in the last retrieved <!-- a -->HTTP(S)<!-- /a --> page.

              <b>http_connect</b>   The numerical code that was found in the last response (from a proxy) to a curl
                             CONNECT request. (Added in 7.12.4)

              <b>time_total</b>     The total time, in seconds, that the full operation lasted. The  time  will  be
                             displayed with millisecond resolution.

              <b>time_namelookup</b>
                             The  time, in seconds, it took from the start until the name resolving was com-
                             pleted.

              <b>time_connect</b>   The time, in seconds, it took from the start until the connect  to  the  remote
                             host (or proxy) was completed.

              <b>time_pretransfer</b>
                             The  time,  in  seconds, it took from the start until the file transfer is just
                             about to begin. This includes all pre-transfer commands and  negotiations  that
                             are specific to the particular <!-- a -->protocol(s)<!-- /a --> involved.

              <b>time_redirect</b>  The  time,  in  seconds, it took for all redirection steps include name lookup,
                             connect,  pretransfer  and  transfer  before  final  transaction  was  started.
                             time_redirect  shows  the  complete  execution  time for multiple redirections.
                             (Added in 7.12.3)

              <b>time_starttransfer</b>
                             The time, in seconds, it took from the start until the first byte is just about
                             to  be transferred. This includes time_pretransfer and also the time the server
                             needs to calculate the result.

              <b>size_download</b>  The total amount of bytes that were downloaded.

              <b>size_upload</b>    The total amount of bytes that were uploaded.

              <b>size_request</b>   The total amount of bytes that were sent in the HTTP request.

              <b>speed_download</b> The average download speed that curl measured for the complete download.

              <b>speed_upload</b>   The average upload speed that curl measured for the complete upload.

              <b>content_type</b>   The Content-Type of the requested document, if there was any.

              <b>num_connects</b>   Number of new connects made in the recent transfer. (Added in 7.12.3)

              <b>num_redirects</b>  Number of redirects that were followed in the request. (Added in 7.12.3)

              <b>ftp_entry_path</b> The initial path libcurl ended up in when logging on to the remote FTP  server.
                             (Added in 7.15.4)

       If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       -x/--proxy &lt;proxyhost[:port]&gt;
              Use specified HTTP proxy. If the port number is not specified, it is assumed at port 1080.

              This  option  overrides  existing  environment variables that sets proxy to use. If there's an
              environment variable setting a proxy, you can set proxy to "" to override it.

              <b>Note</b> that all operations that are performed over a HTTP proxy will transparently be  converted
              to  HTTP.  It  means that certain protocol specific operations might not be available. This is
              not the case if you can tunnel through the proxy, as done with the <u>-p/--proxytunnel</u> option.

              Starting with 7.14.1, the proxy host can be specified the exact same way as the proxy environ-
              ment variables, include protocol prefix (<a href="http://)">http://)</a> and embedded user + password.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       -X/--request &lt;command&gt;
              (HTTP)  Specifies a custom request method to use when communicating with the HTTP server.  The
              specified request will be used instead of the method otherwise used (which defaults  to  GET).
              Read the HTTP 1.1 specification for details and explanations.

              (FTP) Specifies a custom FTP command to use instead of LIST when doing file lists with ftp.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       -y/--speed-time &lt;time&gt;
              If  a  download  is  slower  than speed-limit bytes per second during a speed-time period, the
              download gets aborted. If speed-time is used, the default speed-limit will  be  1  unless  set
              with -y.

              This  option  controls transfers and thus will not affect slow connects etc. If this is a con-
              cern for you, try the <u>--connect-timeout</u> option.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       -Y/--speed-limit &lt;speed&gt;
              If a download is slower than this given speed, in bytes per second, for speed-time seconds  it
              gets aborted. speed-time is set with -Y and is 30 if not set.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       -z/--time-cond &lt;date expression&gt;
              (HTTP/FTP)  Request  a  file that has been modified later than the given time and date, or one
              that has been modified before that time. The date expression can be all sorts of date  strings
              or  if  it  doesn't  match  any internal ones, it tries to get the time from a given file name
              instead! See the <a href="../man3/curl_getdate.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/curl_getdate"><u>curl</u><b>_</b><u>getdate(3)</u></a><u></u> man pages for date expression details.

              Start the date expression with a dash (-) to make it request for a document that is older than
              the given date/time, default is a document that is newer than the specified date/time.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --max-redirs &lt;num&gt;
              Set  maximum  number  of redirection-followings allowed. If <u>-L/--location</u> is used, this option
              can be used to prevent curl from following redirections "in absurdum". By default,  the  limit
              is set to 50 redirections. Set this option to -1 to make it limitless.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       -0/--http1.0
              (HTTP)  Forces  curl to issue its requests using HTTP 1.0 instead of using its internally pre-
              ferred: HTTP 1.1.

       -1/--tlsv1
              (SSL) Forces curl to use TSL version 1 when negotiating with a remote TLS server.

       -2/--sslv2
              (SSL) Forces curl to use SSL version 2 when negotiating with a remote SSL server.

       -3/--sslv3
              (SSL) Forces curl to use SSL version 3 when negotiating with a remote SSL server.

       -4/--ipv4
              If libcurl is capable of resolving an address to multiple IP versions (which it is  if  it  is
              ipv6-capable), this option tells libcurl to resolve names to IPv4 addresses only.

       -6/--ipv6
              If  libcurl  is  capable of resolving an address to multiple IP versions (which it is if it is
              ipv6-capable), this option tells libcurl to resolve names to IPv6 addresses only.

       -#/--progress-bar
              Make curl display progress information as a progress bar instead of the default statistics.

              If this option is used twice, the second will again disable the progress bar.

<b>FILES</b>
       <u>~/.curlrc</u>
              Default config file, see <u>-K/--config</u> for details.


<b>ENVIRONMENT</b>
       http_proxy [protocol://]&lt;host&gt;[:port]
              Sets proxy server to use for HTTP.

       HTTPS_PROXY [protocol://]&lt;host&gt;[:port]
              Sets proxy server to use for HTTPS.

       FTP_PROXY [protocol://]&lt;host&gt;[:port]
              Sets proxy server to use for FTP.

       ALL_PROXY [protocol://]&lt;host&gt;[:port]
              Sets proxy server to use if no protocol-specific proxy is set.

       NO_PROXY &lt;comma-separated list of hosts&gt;
              list of host names that shouldn't go through any proxy. If set to  a  asterisk  '*'  only,  it
              matches all hosts.

<b>EXIT</b> <b>CODES</b>
       There  exists a bunch of different error codes and their corresponding error messages that may appear
       during bad conditions. At the time of this writing, the exit codes are:

       1      Unsupported protocol. This build of curl has no support for this protocol.

       2      Failed to initialize.

       3      URL malformat. The syntax was not correct.

       4      URL user malformatted. The user-part of the URL syntax was not correct.

       7      Failed to connect to host.

       8      FTP weird server reply. The server sent data curl couldn't parse.

       9      FTP access denied. The server denied login or denied access  to  the  particular  resource  or
              directory  you  wanted  to  reach.  Most often you tried to change to a directory that doesn't
              exist on the server.

       10     FTP user/password incorrect. Either one or both were not accepted by the server.

       11     FTP weird PASS reply. Curl couldn't parse the reply sent to the PASS request.

       12     FTP weird USER reply. Curl couldn't parse the reply sent to the USER request.

       13     FTP weird PASV reply, Curl couldn't parse the reply sent to the PASV request.

       14     FTP weird 227 format. Curl couldn't parse the 227-line the server sent.

       15     FTP can't get host. Couldn't resolve the host IP we got in the 227-line.

       16     FTP can't reconnect. Couldn't connect to the host we got in the 227-line.

       17     FTP couldn't set binary. Couldn't change transfer method to binary.

       18     Partial file. Only a part of the file was transferred.

       19     FTP couldn't download/access the given file, the RETR (or similar) command failed.

       20     FTP write error. The transfer was reported bad by the server.

       21     FTP quote error. A quote command returned error from the server.

       22     HTTP page not retrieved. The requested url was not found or returned another  error  with  the
              HTTP error code being 400 or above. This return code only appears if <u>-f/--fail</u> is used.

       23     Write error. Curl couldn't write data to a local filesystem or similar.

       24     Malformed user. User name badly specified.

       28     Operation timeout. The specified time-out period was reached according to the conditions.

       29     FTP couldn't set ASCII. The server returned an unknown reply.

       30     FTP  PORT  failed.  The PORT command failed. Not all FTP servers support the PORT command, try
              doing a transfer using PASV instead!

       31     FTP couldn't use REST. The REST command failed. This command is used for  resumed  FTP  trans-
              fers.

       32     FTP  couldn't  use  SIZE. The SIZE command failed. The command is an extension to the original
              FTP spec RFC 959.
