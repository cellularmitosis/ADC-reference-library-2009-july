\fs22 \cf0 MyRecorder is a QTKit capture player, a simple yet powerful application that demonstrates how you can take advantage of some of the new capture classes and methods available in the next iteration of the QuickTime Kit framework. This QTKit capture player application will allow you to capture a video stream and record the media to a QuickTime movie. No more than 20 or 30 lines of Objective-C code were required to implement this capture player. \
\
Using Xcode 3 as your integrated development environment (IDE), along with Interface Builder 3, you\'92ll see how easy it is to work with the QuickTime Kit framework. This example makes use of the new QTKit capture control provided in the library of controls available in Interface Builder 3. The QTKit capture control will perform much of the work for you in implementing the design of the user interface for this application. \
\
For this project, you\'92ll need an iSight camera, either built-in or plugged into your Macintosh. You\'92ll also need Mac OS X v10.5, the latest release of Mac OS X, installed in your system. \
\
In building this QTKit capture application, you\'92ll work with the following three classes:
