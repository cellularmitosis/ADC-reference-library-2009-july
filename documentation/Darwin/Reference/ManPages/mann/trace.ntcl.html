trace(n)                                    Tcl Built-In Commands                                   trace(n)



____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

<b>NAME</b>
       trace - Monitor variable accesses, command usages and command executions

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>trace</b> <u>option</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________


<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       This  command  causes Tcl commands to be executed whenever certain operations are invoked.  The legal
       <u>option</u>'s (which may be abbreviated) are:

       <b>trace</b> <b>add</b> <u>type</u> <u>name</u> <u>ops</u> <u>?args?</u>
              Where <u>type</u> is <b>command</b>, <b>execution</b>, or <b>variable</b>.

              <b>trace</b> <b>add</b> <b>command</b> <u>name</u> <u>ops</u> <u>command</u>
                     Arrange for <u>command</u> to be executed whenever command <u>name</u> is modified in one of the ways
                     given  by  the  list  <u>ops</u>.   <u>Name</u> will be resolved using the usual namespace resolution
                     rules used by procedures.  If the command does not exist, an error will be thrown.

                     <u>Ops</u> indicates which operations are of interest, and is a list of one  or  more  of  the
                     following items:

                     <b>rename</b> Invoke <u>command</u> whenever the command is renamed.  Note that renaming to the empty
                            string is considered deletion, and will not be traced with '<b>rename</b>'.

                     <b>delete</b> Invoke <u>command</u> when the command is deleted.  Commands can be deleted  explicitly
                            by  using the <b>rename</b> command to rename the command to an empty string.  Commands
                            are also deleted when the interpreter is deleted, but traces will not be invoked
                            because there is no interpreter in which to execute them.

                     When  the  trace  triggers, depending on the operations being traced, a number of argu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ments&nbsp;arguments</font>
                     ments are appended to <u>command</u> so that the actual command is as follows:
                            <u>command</u> <u>oldName</u> <u>newName</u> <u>op</u>
                     <u>OldName</u> and <u>newName</u> give the traced command's current (old) name, and the name to which
                     it  is  being renamed (the empty string if this is a 'delete' operation).  <u>Op</u> indicates
                     what operation is being performed on the command, and is one of  <b>rename</b>  or  <b>delete</b>  as
                     defined  above.   The  trace  operation  cannot  be  used  to stop a command from being
                     deleted.  Tcl will always remove the command once the  trace  is  complete.   Recursive
                     renaming or deleting will not cause further traces of the same type to be evaluated, so
                     a delete trace which itself deletes the command, or a rename trace which itself renames
                     the  command  will not cause further trace evaluations to occur.  Both <u>oldName</u> and <u>new</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">Name&nbsp;newName</font>
                     <u>Name</u> are fully qualified with any <!-- a -->namespace(s)<!-- /a --> in which they appear.

              <b>trace</b> <b>add</b> <b>execution</b> <u>name</u> <u>ops</u> <u>command</u>
                     Arrange for <u>command</u> to be executed whenever  command  <u>name</u>  is  executed,  with  traces
                     occurring  at  the  points  indicated by the list <u>ops</u>.  <u>Name</u> will be resolved using the
                     usual namespace resolution rules used by procedures.  If the command does not exist, an
                     error will be thrown.

                     <u>Ops</u>  indicates  which  operations  are of interest, and is a list of one or more of the
                     following items:

                     <b>enter</b>  Invoke <u>command</u> whenever the command <u>name</u> is executed,  just  before  the  actual
                            execution takes place.

                     <b>leave</b>  Invoke <u>command</u> whenever the command <u>name</u> is executed, just after the actual exe-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cution&nbsp;execution</font>
                            cution takes place.

                     <b>enterstep</b>
                            Invoke <u>command</u> for every tcl command which  is  executed  inside  the  procedure
                            <u>name</u>,  just  before  the  actual  execution takes place.  For example if we have
                            'proc foo {} { puts "hello" }', then a <u>enterstep</u> trace  would  be  invoked  just
                            before  <u>puts</u>  <u>"hello"</u>  is executed.  Setting a <u>enterstep</u> trace on a <u>command</u> will
                            not result in an error and is simply ignored.

                     <b>leavestep</b>
                            Invoke <u>command</u> for every tcl command which  is  executed  inside  the  procedure
                            <u>name</u>, just after the actual execution takes place.  Setting a <u>leavestep</u> trace on
                            a <u>command</u> will not result in an error and is simply ignored.

                     When the trace triggers, depending on the operations being traced, a  number  of  argu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ments&nbsp;arguments</font>
                     ments are appended to <u>command</u> so that the actual command is as follows:

                     For <b>enter</b> and <b>enterstep</b> operations:
                            <u>command</u> <u>command-string</u> <u>op</u>
                     <u>Command-string</u>  gives  the  complete current command being executed (the traced command
                     for a <b>enter</b> operation, an arbitrary command for a <b>enterstep</b> operation),  including  all
                     arguments in their fully expanded form.  <u>Op</u> indicates what operation is being performed
                     on the command execution, and is one of <b>enter</b> or <b>enterstep</b> as defined above.  The trace
                     operation  can  be  used to stop the command from executing, by deleting the command in
                     question.  Of course when the command is subsequently executed,  an  'invalid  command'
                     error will occur.

                     For <b>leave</b> and <b>leavestep</b> operations:
                            <u>command</u> <u>command-string</u> <u>code</u> <u>result</u> <u>op</u>
                     <u>Command-string</u>  gives  the  complete current command being executed (the traced command
                     for a <b>enter</b> operation, an arbitrary command for a <b>enterstep</b> operation),  including  all
                     arguments  in their fully expanded form.  <u>Code</u> gives the result code of that execution,
                     and <u>result</u> the result string.  <u>Op</u> indicates what operation is being  performed  on  the
                     command  execution,  and  is one of <b>leave</b> or <b>leavestep</b> as defined above.  Note that the
                     creation of many <b>enterstep</b> or <b>leavestep</b> traces can lead to unintuitive  results,  since
                     the  invoked commands from one trace can themselves lead to further command invocations
                     for other traces.

                     <u>Command</u> executes in the same context as the code that  invoked  the  traced  operation:
                     thus the <u>command</u>, if invoked from a procedure, will have access to the same local vari-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ables&nbsp;variables</font>
                     ables as code in the procedure.  This context may be  different  than  the  context  in
                     which  the  trace  was created. If <u>command</u> invokes a procedure (which it normally does)
                     then the procedure will have to use upvar or uplevel commands if it  wishes  to  access
                     the local variables of the code which invoked the trace operation.

                     While  <u>command</u>  is  executing during an execution trace, traces on <u>name</u> are temporarily
                     disabled. This allows the <u>command</u> to execute <u>name</u> in  its  body  without  invoking  any
                     other traces again.  If an error occurs while executing the <u>command</u> body, then the com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
                     mand <u>name</u> as a whole will return that same error.

                     When multiple traces are set on <u>name</u>, then for  <u>enter</u>  and  <u>enterstep</u>  operations,  the
                     traced commands are invoked in the reverse order of how the traces were originally cre-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ated;&nbsp;created;</font>
                     ated; and for <u>leave</u> and <u>leavestep</u> operations, the traced commands are  invoked  in  the
                     original order of creation.

                     The  behavior  of  execution  traces is currently undefined for a command <u>name</u> imported
                     into another namespace.

              <b>trace</b> <b>add</b> <b>variable</b> <u>name</u> <u>ops</u> <u>command</u>
                     Arrange for <u>command</u> to be executed whenever variable <u>name</u> is accessed  in  one  of  the
                     ways  given  by  the  list  <u>ops</u>.  <u>Name</u> may refer to a normal variable, an element of an
                     array, or to an array as a whole (i.e. <u>name</u> may be just the name of an array,  with  no
                     parenthesized  index).   If <u>name</u> refers to a whole array, then <u>command</u> is invoked when-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ever&nbsp;whenever</font>
                     ever any element of the array is manipulated.  If the variable does not exist, it  will
                     be  created  but  will  not  be given a value, so it will be visible to <b>namespace</b> <b>which</b>
                     queries, but not to <b>info</b> <b>exists</b> queries.

                     <u>Ops</u> indicates which operations are of interest, and is a list of one  or  more  of  the
                     following items:

                     <b>array</b>  Invoke  <u>command</u> whenever the variable is accessed or modified via the <b>array</b> com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand,&nbsp;command,</font>
                            mand, provided that <u>name</u> is not a scalar variable at the  time  that  the  <b>array</b>
                            command is invoked.  If <u>name</u> is a scalar variable, the access via the <b>array</b> com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mand&nbsp;command</font>
                            mand will not trigger the trace.

                     <b>read</b>   Invoke <u>command</u> whenever the variable is read.

                     <b>write</b>  Invoke <u>command</u> whenever the variable is written.

                     <b>unset</b>  Invoke <u>command</u> whenever the variable is unset.  Variables can be  unset  explic-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">itly&nbsp;explicitly</font>
                            itly  with the <b>unset</b> command, or implicitly when procedures return (all of their
                            local variables are unset).  Variables are  also  unset  when  interpreters  are
                            deleted, but traces will not be invoked because there is no interpreter in which
                            to execute them.

                     When the trace triggers, three arguments are appended to <u>command</u>  so  that  the  actual
                     command is as follows:
                            <u>command</u> <u>name1</u> <u>name2</u> <u>op</u>
                     <u>Name1</u> and <u>name2</u> give the <!-- a -->name(s)<!-- /a --> for the variable being accessed:  if the variable is a
                     scalar then <u>name1</u> gives the variable's name and <u>name2</u> is an empty string; if the  vari-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">able&nbsp;variable</font>
                     able  is  an  array  element then <u>name1</u> gives the name of the array and name2 gives the
                     index into the array; if an entire array is being deleted and the trace was  registered
                     on the overall array, rather than a single element, then <u>name1</u> gives the array name and
                     <u>name2</u> is an empty string.  <u>Name1</u> and <u>name2</u> are not necessarily the  same  as  the  name
                     used  in the <b>trace</b> <b>variable</b> command:  the <b>upvar</b> command allows a procedure to reference
                     a variable under a different name.  <u>Op</u> indicates what operation is being  performed  on
                     the variable, and is one of <b>read</b>, <b>write</b>, or <b>unset</b> as defined above.

                     <u>Command</u> executes in the same context as the code that invoked the traced operation:  if
                     the variable was accessed as part of a Tcl procedure, then <u>command</u> will have access  to
                     the  same local variables as code in the procedure.  This context may be different than
                     the context in which the trace was created. If <u>command</u> invokes a  procedure  (which  it
                     normally  does)  then  the  procedure will have to use <b>upvar</b> or <b>uplevel</b> if it wishes to
                     access the traced variable.  Note also that <u>name1</u> may not necessarily be  the  same  as
                     the  name used to set the trace on the variable; differences can occur if the access is
                     made through a variable defined with the <b>upvar</b> command.

                     For read and write traces, <u>command</u> can modify the variable to affect the result of  the
                     traced  operation.   If <u>command</u> modifies the value of a variable during a read or write
                     trace, then the new value will be returned as the result of the traced operation.   The
                     return  value  from   <u>command</u> is ignored except that if it returns an error of any sort
                     then the traced operation also returns an error with the same error message returned by
                     the  trace  command  (this  mechanism can be used to implement read-only variables, for
                     example).  For write traces, <u>command</u> is invoked after the  variable's  value  has  been
                     changed;  it  can  write  a  new value into the variable to override the original value
                     specified in the write operation.  To implement read-only variables, <u>command</u> will  have
                     to restore the old value of the variable.

                     While  <u>command</u>  is  executing  during a read or write trace, traces on the variable are
                     temporarily disabled.  This means that reads and writes invoked by <u>command</u>  will  occur
                     directly,  without  invoking  <u>command</u> (or any other traces) again.  However, if <u>command</u>
                     unsets the variable then unset traces will be invoked.

                     When an unset trace is invoked, the variable has already been deleted: it  will  appear
                     to be undefined with no traces.  If an unset occurs because of a procedure return, then
                     the trace will be invoked in the variable context of the procedure being  returned  to:
                     the  stack  frame of the returning procedure will no longer exist.  Traces are not dis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">abled&nbsp;disabled</font>
                     abled during unset traces, so if an  unset  trace  command  creates  a  new  trace  and
                     accesses  the  variable,  the  trace  will  be invoked.  Any errors in unset traces are
                     ignored.

                     If there are multiple traces on a variable they are invoked in order of creation, most-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">recent&nbsp;mostrecent</font>
                     recent  first.   If  one trace returns an error, then no further traces are invoked for
                     the variable.  If an array element has a trace set, and there is also a  trace  set  on
                     the  array  as a whole, the trace on the overall array is invoked before the one on the
                     element.

                     Once created, the trace remains in effect either until the trace is  removed  with  the
                     <b>trace</b>  <b>remove</b>  <b>variable</b>  command described below, until the variable is unset, or until
                     the interpreter is deleted.  Unsetting an element of array will remove  any  traces  on
                     that element, but will not remove traces on the overall array.

                     This command returns an empty string.

       <b>trace</b> <b>remove</b> <u>type</u> <u>name</u> <u>opList</u> <u>command</u>
              Where <u>type</u> is either <b>command</b>, <b>execution</b> or <b>variable</b>.

              <b>trace</b> <b>remove</b> <b>command</b> <u>name</u> <u>opList</u> <u>command</u>
                     If there is a trace set on command <u>name</u> with the operations and command given by <u>opList</u>
                     and <u>command</u>, then the trace is removed, so that <u>command</u> will never  again  be  invoked.
                     Returns an empty string.   If <u>name</u> doesn't exist, the command will throw an error.

              <b>trace</b> <b>remove</b> <b>execution</b> <u>name</u> <u>opList</u> <u>command</u>
                     If there is a trace set on command <u>name</u> with the operations and command given by <u>opList</u>
                     and <u>command</u>, then the trace is removed, so that <u>command</u> will never  again  be  invoked.
                     Returns an empty string.   If <u>name</u> doesn't exist, the command will throw an error.

              <b>trace</b> <b>remove</b> <b>variable</b> <u>name</u> <u>opList</u> <u>command</u>
                     If  there  is  a  trace  set  on variable <u>name</u> with the operations and command given by
                     <u>opList</u> and <u>command</u>, then the trace is removed, so that  <u>command</u>  will  never  again  be
                     invoked.  Returns an empty string.

       <b>trace</b> <b>info</b> <u>type</u> <u>name</u>
              Where <u>type</u> is either <b>command</b>, <b>execution</b> or <b>variable</b>.

              <b>trace</b> <b>info</b> <b>command</b> <u>name</u>
                     Returns  a  list  containing  one element for each trace currently set on command <u>name</u>.
                     Each element of the list is itself a list containing two elements, which are the <u>opList</u>
                     and  <u>command</u>  associated with the trace.  If <u>name</u> doesn't have any traces set, then the
                     result of the command will be an empty string.  If <u>name</u> doesn't exist, the command will
                     throw an error.

              <b>trace</b> <b>info</b> <b>execution</b> <u>name</u>
                     Returns  a  list  containing  one element for each trace currently set on command <u>name</u>.
                     Each element of the list is itself a list containing two elements, which are the <u>opList</u>
                     and  <u>command</u>  associated with the trace.  If <u>name</u> doesn't have any traces set, then the
                     result of the command will be an empty string.  If <u>name</u> doesn't exist, the command will
                     throw an error.

              <b>trace</b> <b>info</b> <b>variable</b> <u>name</u>
                     Returns  a  list  containing one element for each trace currently set on variable <u>name</u>.
                     Each element of the list is itself a list containing two elements, which are the <u>opList</u>
                     and  <u>command</u>  associated  with  the  trace.   If <u>name</u> doesn't exist or doesn't have any
                     traces set, then the result of the command will be an empty string.

       For backwards compatibility, three other subcommands are available:

              <b>trace</b> <b>variable</b> <u>name</u> <u>ops</u> <u>command</u>
                     This is equivalent to <b>trace</b> <b>add</b> <b>variable</b> <u>name</u> <u>ops</u> <u>command</u>.

              <b>trace</b> <b>vdelete</b> <u>name</u> <u>ops</u> <u>command</u>
                     This is equivalent to <b>trace</b> <b>remove</b> <b>variable</b> <u>name</u> <u>ops</u> <u>command</u>

              <b>trace</b> <b>vinfo</b> <u>name</u>
                     This is equivalent to <b>trace</b> <b>info</b> <b>variable</b> <u>name</u>

       These subcommands are deprecated and will likely be removed in a future version of Tcl.  They use  an
       older  syntax  in which <b>array</b>, <b>read</b>, <b>write</b>, <b>unset</b> are replaced by <b>a</b>, <b>r</b>, <b>w</b> and <b>u</b> respectively, and the
       <u>ops</u> argument is not a list, but simply a string concatenation of the operations, such as <b>rwua</b>.
