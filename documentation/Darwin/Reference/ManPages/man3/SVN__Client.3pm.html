<b>NAME</b>
       SVN::Client - Subversion client functions

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
           use SVN::Client;
           my $ctx = new SVN::Client(
                     auth =&gt; [SVN::Client::get_simple_provider(),
                     SVN::Client::get_simple_prompt_provider(\&amp;simple_prompt,2),
                     SVN::Client::get_username_provider()]
                     );

           $ctx-&gt;cat (\*STDOUT, '<a href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/README">http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/README</a>',
                      'HEAD');

           sub simple_prompt {
             my $cred = shift;
             my $realm = shift;
             my $default_username = shift;
             my $may_save = shift;
             my $pool = shift;

             print "Enter authentication info for realm: $realm\n";
             print "Username: ";
             my $username = &lt;&gt;;
             chomp($username);
             $cred-&gt;username($username);
             print "Password: ";
             my $password = &lt;&gt;;
             chomp($password);
             $cred-&gt;password($password);
           }

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       SVN::Client wraps the highest level of functions provided by subversion to accomplish specific tasks
       in an object oriented API.  Methods are similar to the functions provided by the C API and as such
       the documentation for it may be helpful in understanding this interface.

       There are a few notable differences from the C API.  Most C function calls take a svn_client_ctx_t
       pointer as the next to last parameter.  The Perl method calls take a SVN::Client object as the first
       parameter.  This allows method call invocation of the methods to be possible.  For example, the
       following are equivalent:

         SVN::Client::add($ctx,$path, $recursive, $pool);
         $ctx-&gt;add($path, $recursive, $pool);

       Many of the C API calls also take a apr_pool_t pointer as their last argument.  The Perl bindings
       generally deal with this for you and you do not need to pass a pool parameter.  However, you may
       still pass a pool parameter as the last parameter to override the automatic handling of this for you.

       Users of this interface should not directly manipulate the underlying hash values but should use the
       respective attribute methods.  Many of these attribute methods do other things, especially when
       setting an attribute, besides simply manipulating the value in the hash.

<b>PARAMETER</b> <b>NOTES</b>
       The client methods described below take a variety of parameters.  Many of them are similar.  Methods
       accepting parameters named below will follow the rules below or will be noted otherwise in the method
       description.

       $ctx
           An SVN::Client object that you get from the constructor.

       $url
           This is a URL to a subversion repository.

       $path
           This is a path to a file or directory on the local file system.

       $paths
           This argument can either be a single path to a file or directory on the local file system, or it
           can be a reference to an array of files or directories on the local file system.

       $target
           This is a path to a file or directory in a working copy or a URL to a file or directory in a
           subversion repository.

       $targets
           This argument can either be a single $target (as defined above) or a reference to an array of
           them.

       $revision
           This specifies a revision in the subversion repository.  You can specify a revision in several
           ways.  The easiest and most obvious is to directly provide the revision number.  You may also use
           the strings (aka revision keywords) 'HEAD', 'BASE', 'COMMITTED', and 'PREV' which have the same
           meanings as in the command line client.  When referencing a working copy you can use the string
           'WORKING" to reference the BASE plus any local modifications.  undef may be used to specify an
           unspecified revision.  Finally you may pass a date by specifying the date inside curly braces
           '{}'.  The date formats accepted are the same as the command line client accepts.

       $recursive $nonrecursive.
           A boolean parameter that specifies if the action should follow directories.  It should only be 1
           or 0.  $recursive means, 1 means to descend into directories, 0 means not to.  $nonrecursive has
           the inverse meaning.

       $pool
           Pool is always an option parameter.  If you wish to pass a pool parameter it should be a
           SVN::Pool or an apr_pool_t object.

<b>METHODS</b>
       The following methods are available:

       $ctx = SVN::Client-&gt;new( %options );
           This class method constructs a new "SVN::Client" object and returns a reference to it.

           Key/value pair arguments may be provided to set up the initial state of the user agent.  The
           following methods correspond to attribute methods described below:

               KEY                    DEFAULT
               ----------             ----------------------------------------
               auth                   auth_baton initiated with providers that
                                      read cached authentication options from
                                      the subversion config only.

               cancel                 undef

               config                 Hash containing the config from the
                                      default subversion config file location.

               log_msg                undef

               notify                 undef

               pool                   A new pool is created for the context.

       $ctx-&gt;add($path, $recursive, $pool);
           Schedule a working copy $path for addition to the repository.

           $path's parent must be under revision control already, but $path is not.  If $recursive is set,
           then assuming $path is a directory, all of its contents will be scheduled for addition as well.

           Calls the notify callback for each added item.

           Important: this is a <b>scheduling</b> operation.  No changes will happen to the repository until a
           commit occurs.  This scheduling can be removed with $ctx-&gt;<u>revert()</u>.

           No return.

       $ctx-&gt;blame($target, $start, $end, \&amp;receiver, $pool);
           Invoke \&amp;receiver subroutine on each line-blame item associated with revision $end of $target,
           using $start as the default source of all blame.

           An Error will be raised if either $start or $end is undef.

           No return.

           The blame receiver subroutine receives the following arguments: $line_no, $revision, $author,
           $date, $line, $pool

           $line_no is the line number of the file (starting with 0).  The line was last changed in revision
           number $revision by $author on $date and the contents were $line.

           The blame receiver subroutine can return an svn_error_t object to return an error.  All other
           returns will be ignored.  You can create an svn_error_t object with <u>SVN::Error::create()</u>.

       $ctx-&gt;cat(\*FILEHANDLE, $target, $revision, $pool);
           Outputs the content of the file identified by $target and $revision to the FILEHANDLE.
           FILEHANDLE is a reference to a filehandle.

           If $target is not a local path and if $revision is 'PREV' (or some other kind that requires a
           local path), then an error will be raised, because the desired revision can not be determined.

       $ctx-&gt;checkout($url, $path, $revision, $recursive, $pool);
           Checkout a working copy of $url at $revision using $path as the root directory of the newly
           checked out working copy.

           $revision must be a number, 'HEAD', or a date.  If $revision does not meet these requirements the
           $SVN::Error::CLIENT_BAD_REVISION is raised.

           Returns the value of the revision actually checked out of the repository.

       $ctx-&gt;cleanup($dir, $pool);
           Recursively cleanup a working copy directory, $dir, finishing any incomplete operations, removing
           lockfiles, etc.

       $ctx-&gt;commit($targets, $nonrecursive, $pool);
           Commit files or directories referenced by target.  Will use the log_msg callback to obtain the
           log message for the commit.

           If $targets contains no paths (zero elements), then does nothing and immediately returns without
           error.

           Calls the notify callback as the commit progresses with any of the following actions:
           $SVN::Wc::Notify::Action::commit_modified, $SVN::Wc::Notify::Action::commit_added,
           $SVN::Wc::Notify::Action::commit_deleted, $SVN::Wc::Notify::Action::commit_replaced,
           $SVN::Wc::Notify::Action::commit_postfix_txdelta.

           Use $nonrecursive to indicate that subdirectories of directory targets should be ignored.

           Returns a svn_client_commit_info_t object.  If the revision member of the commit information
           object is $SVN::Core::INVALID_REVNUM and no error was raised, then the commit was a no-op;
           nothing needed to be committed.

       $ctx-&gt;copy($src_target, $src_revision, $dst_target, $pool);
           Copies $src_target to $dst_target.

           $src_target must be a file or directory under version control, or the URL of a versioned item in
           the repository.  If $src_target is a URL, $src_revision is used to choose the revision from which
           to copy the $src_target.  $dst_path must be a file or directory under version control, or a
           repository URL, existing or not.

           If $dst_target is a URL, immediately attempt to commit the copy action to the repository.  The
           log_msg callback will be called to query for a commit log message.  If the commit succeeds,
           return a svn_client_commit_info_t object.

           If $dst_target is not a URL, then this is just a variant of $ctx-&gt;<u>add()</u>, where the $dst_path
           items are scheduled for addition as copies.  No changes will happen to the repository until a
           commit occurs.  This scheduling can be removed with $ctx-&gt;<u>revert()</u>.  undef will be returned in
           this case.

           Calls the notify callback for each item added at the new location, passing the new, relative path
           of the added item.

       $ctx-&gt;delete($targets, $force, $pool);
           Delete items from a repository or working copy.

           If the paths in $targets are URLs, immediately attempt to commit a deletion of the URLs from the
           repository.  The log_msg callback will be called to query for a commit log message.  If the
           commit succeeds, return a svn_client_commit_info_t object.  Every path must belong to the same
           repository.

           Else, schedule the working copy paths in $targets for removal from the repository.  Each path's
           parent must be under revision control.  This is just a <b>scheduling</b> operation.  No changes will
           happen to the repository until a commit occurs.  This scheduling can be removed with
           $ctx-&gt;<u>revert()</u>.  If a path is a file it is immediately removed from the working copy.  If the
           path is a directory it will remain in the working copy but all the files, and all unversioned
           items it contains will be removed.  If $force is not set then this operation will fail if any
           path contains locally modified and/or unversioned items.  If $force is set such items will be
           deleted.

           The notify callback is called for each item deleted with the path of the deleted item.

           Has no return.

       $ctx-&gt;diff($diff_options, $target1, $revision1, $target2, $revision2, $recursive, $ignore_ancestry,
       $no_diff_deleted, $outfile, $errfile, $pool);
           Produces diff output which describes the delta between $target1 at $revision1 and $target2 at
           $revision2.  They both must represent the same node type (i.e. they most both be directories or
           files).  The revisions must not be undef.

           Prints the output of the diff to the filename or filehandle passed as $outfile, and any errors to
           the filename or filehandle passed as $errfile.

           Use $ignore_ancestry to control whether or not items being diffed will be checked for relatedness
           first.  Unrelated items are typically transmitted to the editor as a deletion of one thing and
           the addition of another, but if this flag is true, unrelated items will be diffed as if they were
           related.

           If $no_diff_deleted is true, then no diff output will be generated on deleted files.

           $diff_options is a reference to an array of additional arguments to pass to diff process invoked
           to compare files.  You'll usually just want to use [] to pass an empty array to return a unified
           context diff (like `diff -u`).

           Has no return.

       $ctx-&gt;export($from, $to, $revision, $force, $pool);
           Export the contents of either a subversion repository or a subversion working copy into a 'clean'
           directory (meaning a directory with no administrative directories).

           $from is either the path to the working copy on disk, or a URL to the repository you wish to
           export.

           $to is the path to the directory where you wish to create the exported tree.

           $revision is the revision that should be exported, which is only used when exporting from a
           repository.  It may be undef otherwise.

           The notify callback will be called for the items exported.

           Returns the value of the revision actually exported or $SVN::Core::INVALID_REVNUM for local
           exports.

       $ctx-&gt;import($path, $url, $nonrecursive, $pool);
           Import file or directory $path into repository directory $url at head.

           If some components of $url do not exist then create parent directories as necessary.

           If $path is a directory, the contents of that directory are imported directly into the directory
           identified by $url.  Note that the directory $path itself is not imported; that is, the basename
           of $path is not part of the import.

           If $path is a file, then the dirname of $url is the directory receiving the import.  The basename
           of $url is the filename in the repository.  In this case if $url already exists, raise an error.

           The notify callback (if defined) will be called as the import progresses, with any of the
           following actions: $SVN::Wc::Notify::Action::commit_added,
           $SVN::Wc::Notify::Action::commit_postfix_txdelta.

           Use $nonrecursive to indicate that imported directories should not recurse into any
           subdirectories they may have.

           Uses the log_msg callback to determine the log message for the commit when one is needed.

           Returns a svn_client_commit_info_t object.

       $ctx-&gt;log($targets, $start, $end, $discover_changed_paths, $strict_node_history, \&amp;log_receiver,
       $pool);
           Invoke the log_receiver subroutine on each log_message from $start to $end in turn, inclusive
           (but will never invoke receiver on a given log message more than once).

           $targets is a reference to an array containing all the paths or URLs for which the log messages
           are desired.  The log_receiver is only invoked on messages whose revisions involved a change to
           some path in $targets.

           If $discover_changed_paths is set, then the changed_paths argument to the log_receiver routine
           will be passed on each invocation.

           If $strict_node_history is set, copy history (if any exists) will not be traversed while
           harvesting revision logs for each target.

           If $start or $end is undef the arp_err code will be set to: $SVN::Error::CLIENT_BAD_REVISION.

           Special case for repositories at revision 0:

           If $start is 'HEAD' and $end is 1, then handle an empty (no revisions) repository specially:
           instead of erroring because requested revision 1 when the highest revision is 0, just invoke
           $log_receiver on revision 0, passing undef to changed paths and empty strings for the author and
           date.  This is because that particular combination of $start and $end usually indicates the
           common case of log invocation; the user wants to see all log messages from youngest to oldest,
           where the oldest commit is revision 1.  That works fine, except there are no commits in the
           repository, hence this special case.

           Calls the notify subroutine with a $SVN::Wc::Notify::Action::skip signal on any unversioned
           targets.

           The log_receiver takes the following arguments: $changed_paths, $revision, $author, $date,
           $message, $pool

           It is called once for each log $message from the $revision on $date by $author.  $author, $date
           or $message may be undef.

           If $changed_paths is defined it references a hash with the keys every path committed in
           $revision; the values are svn_log_changed_path_t objects.

       $ctx-&gt;ls($target, $revision, $recursive, $pool);
           Returns a hash of svn_dirent_t objects for $target at $revision.

           If $target is a directory, returns entries for all of the directories' contents.  If $recursive
           is true, it will recurse subdirectories in $target.

           If $target is a file only return an entry for the file.

           If $target is non-existent, raises the $SVN::Error::FS_NOT_FOUND error.

       $ctx-&gt;merge($src1, $rev1, $src2, $rev2, $target_wcpath, $recursive, $ignore_ancestry, $force,
       $dry_run, $pool);
           Merge changes from $src1/$rev1 to $src2/$rev2 into the working-copy path $target_wcpath.

           $src1 and $src2 are either URLs that refer to entries in the repository, or paths to entries in
           the working copy.

           By 'merging', we mean: apply file differences and schedule additions &amp; deletions when
           appropriate.

           $src1 and $src2 must both represent the same node kind; that is, if $src1 is a directory, $src2
           must also be, and if $src1 is a file, $src2 must also be.

           If either $rev1 or $rev2 is undef raises the $SVN::Error::CLIENT_BAD_REVISION error.

           If $recursive is true (and the URLs are directories), apply changes recursively; otherwise, only
           apply changes in the current directory.

           Use $ignore_ancestry to control whether or not items being diffed will be checked for relatedness
           first.  Unrelated items are typically transmitted to the editor as a deletion of one thing and
           the addition of another, but if this flag is true, unrelated items will be diffed as if they were
           related.

           If $force is not set and the merge involves deleting locally modified or unversioned items the
           operation will raise an error.  If $force is set such items will be deleted.

           Calls the notify callback once for each merged target, passing the targets local path.

           If $dry_run is true the merge is carried out, and the full notification feedback is provided, but
           the working copy is not modified.

           Has no return.

       $ctx-&gt;mkdir($targets, $pool);
           Create a directory, either in a repository or a working copy.

           If $targets contains URLs, immediately attempts to commit the creation of the directories in
           $targets in the repository.  Returns a svn_client_commit_info_t object.

           Else, create the directories on disk, and attempt to schedule them for addition.  In this case
           returns undef.

           Calls the notify callback when the directory has been created (successfully) in the working copy,
           with the path of the new directory.  Note this is only called for items added to the working
           copy.

       $ctx-&gt;move($src_path, $src_revision, $dst_path, $force, $pool);
           Move $src_path to $dst_path.

           $src_path must be a file or directory under version control, or the URL of a versioned item in
           the repository.

           If $src_path is a repository URL:

           * $dst_path must also be a repository URL (existent or not).

           * $src_revision is used to choose the revision from which to copy the $src_path.

           * The log_msg callback will be called for the commit log message.

           * The move operation will be immediately committed.  If the commit succeeds, returns a
           svn_client_commit_info_t object.

           If $src_path is a working copy path

           * $dst_path must also be a working copy path (existent or not).

           * $src_revision is ignored and may be undef.  The log_msg callback will not be called.

           * This is a scheduling operation.  No changes will happen to the repository until a commit
           occurs.  This scheduling can be removed with $ctx-&gt;<u>revert()</u>.  If $src_path is a file it is
           removed from the working copy immediately.  If $src_path is a directory it will remain in the
           working copy but all files, and unversioned items, it contains will be removed.

           * If $src_path contains locally modified and/or unversioned items and $force is not set, the copy
           will raise an error.  If $force is set such items will be removed.

           The notify callback will be called twice for each item moved, once to indicate the deletion of
           the moved node, and once to indicate the addition of the new location of the node.

       $ctx-&gt;propget($propname, $target, $revision, $recursive, $pool);
           Returns a reference to a hash containing paths or URLs, prefixed by $target (a working copy or
           URL), of items for which the property $propname is set, and whose values represent the property
           value for $propname at that path.

       $ctx-&gt;proplist($target, $revision, $recursive, $pool);
           Returns a reference to an array of svn_client_proplist_item_t objects.

           For each item the node_name member of the proplist_item object contains the name relative to the
           same base as $target.

           If $revision is undef, then get properties from the working copy, if $target is a working copy,
           or from the repository head if $target is a URL.  Else get the properties as of $revision.

           If $recursive is false, or $target is a file, the returned array will only contain a single
           element.  Otherwise, it will contain one entry for each versioned entry below (and including)
           $target.

           If $target is not found, raises the $SVN::Error::ENTRY_NOT_FOUND error.

       $ctx-&gt;propset($propname, $propval, $target, $recursive, $pool);
           Set $propname to $propval on $target (a working copy or URL path).

           If $recursive is true, then $propname will be set recursively on $target and all children.  If
           $recursive is false, and $target is a directory, $propname will be set on <b>only</b> $target.

           A $propval of undef will delete the property.

           If $propname is an svn-controlled property (i.e. prefixed with svn:), then the caller is
           responsible for ensuring that $propval is UTF8-encoded and uses LF line-endings.

       $ctx-&gt;relocate($dir, $from, $to, $recursive, $pool);
           Modify a working copy directory $dir, changing any repository URLs that begin with $from to begin
           with $to instead, recursing into subdirectories if $recursive is true.

           Has no return.

       $ctx-&gt;resolved($path, $recursive, $pool);
           Removed the 'conflicted' state on a working copy path.

           This will not semantically resolve conflicts; it just allows $path to be committed in the future.
           The implementation details are opaque.  If $recursive is set, recurse below $path, looking for
           conflicts to resolve.

           If $path is not in a state of conflict to begin with, do nothing.

           If $path's conflict state is removed, call the notify callback with the $path.

       $ctx-&gt;revert($paths, $recursive, $pool);
           Restore the pristine version of a working copy $paths, effectively undoing any local mods.

           For each path in $paths, if it is a directory and $recursive is true, this will be a recursive
           operation.

       $ctx-&gt;revprop_get($propname, $url, $revision, $pool);
           Returns two values, the first of which is the value of $propname on revision $revision in the
           repository represented by $url.  The second value is the actual revision queried.

           Note that unlike its cousin $ctx-&gt;<u>propget()</u>, this routine doesn't affect working copy at all;
           it's a pure network operation that queries an <b>unversioned</b> property attached to a revision.  This
           can be used to query log messages, dates, authors, and the like.

       $ctx-&gt;revprop_list($url, $revision, $pool);
           Returns two values, the first of which is a reference to a hash containing the properties
           attached to $revision in the repository represented by $url.  The second value is the actual
           revision queried.

           Note that unlike its cousin $ctx-&gt;<u>proplist()</u>, this routine doesn't read a working copy at all;
           it's a pure network operation that reads <b>unversioned</b> properties attached to a revision.

       $ctx-&gt;revprop_set($propname, $propval, $url, $revision, $force, $pool);
           Set $propname to $propval on revision $revision in the repository represented by $url.

           Returns the actual revision affected.  A $propval of undef will delete the property.

           If $force is true, allow newlines in the author property.

           If $propname is an svn-controlled property (i.e. prefixed with svn:), then the caller is
           responsible for ensuring that the value is UTF8-encoded and uses LF line-endings.

           Note that unlike its cousin $ctx-&gt;<u>propset()</u>, this routine doesn't affect the working copy at all;
           it's a pure network operation that changes an <b>unversioned</b> property attached to a revision.  This
           can be used to tweak log messages, dates, authors, and the like.  Be careful: it's a lossy
           operation, meaning that any existing value is replaced with the new value, with no way to
           retrieve the prior value.

           Also note that unless the administrator creates a pre-revprop-change hook in the repository, this
           feature will fail.

       $ctx-&gt;status($path, $revision, \&amp;status_func, $recursive, $get_all, $update, $no_ignore, $pool);
           Given $path to a working copy directory (or single file), call <u>status</u><b>_</b><u>func()</u> with a set of
           svn_wc_status_t objects which describe the status of $path and its children.

           If $recursive is true, recurse fully, else do only immediate children.

           If $get_all is set, retrieve all entries; otherwise, retrieve only 'interesting' entries (local
           mods and/or out-of-date).

           If $update is set, contact the repository and augment the status objects with information about
           out-of-dateness (with respect to $revision).  Also, will return the value of the actual revision
           against with the working copy was compared.  (The return will be undef if $update is not set).

           The function recurses into externals definitions ('svn:externals') after handling the main
           target, if any exist.  The function calls the notify callback with
           $SVN::Wc::Notify::Action::status_external action before handling each externals definition, and
           with $SVN::Wc::Notify::Action::status_completed after each.

           The status_func subroutine takes the following parameters: $path, $status

           $path is the pathname of the file or directory which status is being reported.  $status is a
           svn_wc_status_t object.

           The return of the status_func subroutine is ignored.

       $ctx-&gt;info($path_or_url, $peg_revision, $revision, \&amp;receiver, $recurse);
           Invokes \&amp;receiver passing it information about $path_or_url for $revision.  The information
           returned is system-generated metadata, not the sort of "property" metadata created by users.  For
           methods available on the object passed to \&amp;receiver, <b>see</b> <b>svn_info_t</b>.

           If both revision arguments are either svn_opt_revision_unspecified or NULL, then information will
           be pulled solely from the working copy; no network connections will be made.

           Otherwise, information will be pulled from a repository.  The actual node revision selected is
           determined by the $path_or_url as it exists in $peg_revision.  If $peg_revision is undef, then it
           defaults to HEAD for URLs or WORKING for WC targets.

           If $path_or_url is not a local path, then if $revision is PREV (or some other kind that requires
           a local path), an error will be returned, because the desired revision cannot be determined.

           Uses the authentication baton cached in ctx to authenticate against the repository.

           If $recurse is true (and $path_or_url is a directory) this will be a recursive operation,
           invoking $receiver on each child.

            my $receiver = sub {
                my( $path, $info, $pool ) = @_;
                print "Current revision of $path is ", $info-&gt;rev, "\n";
            };
            $ctx-&gt;info( 'foo/bar.c', undef, 'WORKING', $receiver, 0 );

       $ctx-&gt;switch($path, $url, $revision, $recursive, $pool);
           Switch working tree $path to $url at $revision.

           $revision must be a number, 'HEAD', or a date, otherwise it raises the
           $SVN::Error::CLIENT_BAD_REVISION error.

           Calls the notify callback on paths affected by the switch.  Also invokes the callback for files
           that may be restored from the text-base because they were removed from the working copy.

           Summary of purpose: This is normally used to switch a working directory over to another line of
           development, such as a branch or a tag.  Switching an existing working directory is more
           efficient than checking out $url from scratch.

           Returns the value of the revision to which the working copy was actually switched.

       $ctx-&gt;update($path, $revision, $recursive, $pool)
           Update a working copy $path to $revision.

           $revision must be a revision number, 'HEAD', or a date or this method will raise the
           $SVN::Error::CLIENT_BAD_REVISION error.

           Calls the notify callback for each item handled by the update, and also for files restored from
           the text-base.

           Returns the revision to which the working copy was actually updated.

       $ctx-&gt;url_from_path($target, $pool); or SVN::Client::url_from_path($target, $pool);
           Returns the URL for $target.

           If $target is already a URL it returns $target.

           If $target is a versioned item, it returns $target's entry URL.

           If $target is unversioned (has no entry), returns undef.

       $ctx-&gt;uuid_from_path($path, $adm_access, $pool);
           Return the repository uuid for working-copy $path, allocated in $pool.

           Use $adm_access to retrieve the uuid from $path's entry; if not present in the entry, then call
           $ctx-&gt;<u>uuid</u><b>_</b><u>from</u><b>_</b><u>url()</u> to retrieve, using the entry's URL.

           Note: The only reason this function falls back on $ctx-&gt;uuid_from_url is for compatibility
           purposes.  Old working copies may not have uuids in the entries files.

           Note: This method probably doesn't work right now without a lot of pain, because SVN::Wc is
           incomplete and it requires an adm_access object from it.

       $ctx-&gt;uuid_from_url($url, $pool);
           Return repository uuid for url.

<b>ATTRIBUTE</b> <b>METHODS</b>
       The following attribute methods are provided that allow you to set various configuration or retrieve
       it.  They all take <!-- a -->value(s)<!-- /a --> to set the attribute and return the new value of the attribute or no
       parameters which returns the current value.

       $ctx-&gt;auth(<u>SVN::Client::get</u><b>_</b><u>username</u><b>_</b><u>provider());</u>
           Provides access to the auth_baton in the svn_client_ctx_t attached to the SVN::Client object.

           This method will accept an array or array ref of values returned from the authentication provider
           functions see "AUTHENTICATION PROVIDERS", which it will convert to an auth_baton for you.  This
           is the preferred method of setting the auth_baton.

           It will also accept a scalar that references a _p_svn_auth_baton_t such as those returned from
           SVN::Core::auth_open and SVN::Core::auth_open_helper.

       $ctx-&gt;notify(\&amp;notify);
           Sets the notify callback for the client context to a code reference that you pass.  It always
           returns the current codereference set.

           The subroutine pointed to by this reference will be called when a change is made to the working
           copy.  The return value of this function is ignored.  It's only purpose is to notify you of the
           change.

           The subroutine will receive 6 parameters.  The first parameter will be the path of the changed
           file (absolute or relative to the cwd).  The second is an integer specifying the type of action
           taken.  See SVN::Wc for a list of the possible actions values and what they mean.  The 3rd is an
           integer specifying the kind of node the path is, which can be: $SVN::Node::none,
           $SVN::Node::file, $SVN::Node::dir, $SVN::Node::unknown.  The fourth parameter is the mime-type of
           the file or undef if the mime-type is unknown (it will always be undef for directories).  The 5th
           parameter is the state of the file, again see SVN::Wc for a list of the possible states.  The 6th
           and final parameter is the numeric revision number of the changed file.  The revision number will
           be -1 except when the action is $SVN::Wc::Notify::Action::update_completed.

       $ctx-&gt;log_msg(\&amp;log_msg)
           Sets the log_msg callback for the client context to a code reference that you pass.  It always
           returns the current codereference set.

           The subroutine pointed to by this coderef will be called to get the log message for any operation
           that will commit a revision to the repo.

           It receives 4 parameters.  The first parameter is a reference to a scalar value in which the
           callback should place the log_msg.  If you wish to cancel the commit you can set this scalar to
           undef.  The 2nd value is a path to a temporary file which might be holding that log message, or
           undef if no such field exists (though, if log_msg is undef, this value is undefined).  The log
           message <b>MUST</b> be a UTF8 string with LF line separators.  The 3rd parameter is a reference to an
           array of svn_client_commit_item_t objects, which may be fully or only partially filled-in,
           depending on the type of commit operation.  The 4th and last parameter will be a pool.

           If the function wishes to return an error it should return a svn_error_t object made with
           SVN::Error::create.  Any other return value will be interpreted as SVN_NO_ERROR.

       $ctx-&gt;cancel(\&amp;cancel)
           Sets the log_msg callback for the client context to a code reference that you pass.  It always
           returns the current codereference set.

           The subroutine pointed to by this value will be called to see if the operation should be
           canceled.  If the operation should be canceled, the function may return one of the following
           values:

           An svn_error_t object made with SVN::Error::create.

           Any true value, in which case the bindings will generate an svn_error_t object for you with the
           error code of SVN_ERR_CANCELLED and the string set to "By cancel callback".

           A string, in which case the bindings will generate an svn_error_t object for you with the error
           code of SVN_ERR_CANCELLED and the string set to the string you returned.

           Any other value will be interpreted as wanting to continue the operation.  Generally, it's best
           to return 0 to continue the operation.

       $ctx-&gt;pool(new SVN::Pool);
           Method that sets or gets the default pool that is passed to method calls requiring a pool, but
           which were not explicitly passed one.

           See SVN::Core for more information about how pools are managed in this interface.

       $ctx-&gt;config(SVN::Core::config_get_config(undef));
           Method that allows access to the config member of the svn_client_ctx_t.  Accepts a Perl hash to
           set, which is what functions like <u>SVN::Core:config</u><b>_</b><u>get</u><b>_</b><u>config()</u> will return.

           It will return a _p_arp_hash_t scalar.  This is a temporary situation.  The return value is not
           particular useful.  In the future, this value will be tied to the actual hash used by the C API.

<b>AUTHENTICATION</b> <b>PROVIDERS</b>
       The following functions get authentication providers for you.  They come in two forms.  Standard or
       File versions, which look for authentication information in the subversion configuration directory
       that was previously cached, or Prompt versions which call a subroutine to allow you to prompt the
       user for the information.

       The functions that return the svn_auth_provider_object_t for prompt style providers take a reference
       to a Perl subroutine to use for the callback.  The first parameter each of these subroutines receive
       is a credential object.  The subroutines return the response by setting members of that object.
       Members may be set like so: $cred-&gt;username("breser");  These functions and credential objects always
       have a may_save member which specifies if the authentication data will be cached.

       The providers are as follows:

               NAME                WHAT IT HANDLES
               ----------------    ----------------------------------------
               simple              username and password pairs

               username            username only

               ssl_server_trust    server certificates and failures
                                   authenticating them

               ssl_client_cert     client side certificate files

               ssl_client_cert_pw  password for a client side certificate file.

       SVN::Client::get_simple_provider
           Returns a simple provider that returns information from previously cached sessions.  Takes no
           parameters or one pool parameter.

       SVN::Client::get_simple_prompt_provider
           Returns a simple provider that prompts the user via a callback.  Takes two or three parameters,
           the first is the callback subroutine, the 2nd is the number of retries to allow, the 3rd is
           optionally a pool.  The subroutine gets called with the following parameters: a
           svn_auth_cred_simple_t object, a realm string, a default username, may_save, and a pool.  The
           svn_auth_cred_simple has the following members: username, password, and may_save.

       SVN::Client::get_username_provider
           Returns a username provider that returns information from a previously cached sessions.  Takes no
           parameters or one pool parameter.

       SVN::Client::get_username_prompt_provider
           Returns a username provider that prompts the user via a callback.  Takes two or three parameters,
           the first is the callback subroutine, the 2nd is the number of retries to allow, the 3rd is
           optionally a pool.  The subroutine gets called with the following parameters: a
           svn_auth_cred_username_t object, a realm string, a default username, may_save, and a pool.  The
           svn_auth_cred_username has the following members: username and may_save.

       SVN::Client::get_ssl_server_trust_file_provider
           Returns a server trust provider that returns information from previously cached sessions.  Takes
           no parameters or optionally a pool parameter.

       SVN::Client::get_ssl_server_trust_prompt_provider
           Returns a server trust  provider that prompts the user via a callback. Takes one or two
           parameters the callback subroutine and optionally a pool parameter.  The subroutine gets called
           with the following parameters.  A svn_auth_cred_ssl_server_trust_t object, a realm string, an
           integer specifying how the certificate failed authentication, a svn_auth_ssl_server_cert_info_t
           object, may_save, and a pool.  The svn_auth_cred_ssl_server_trust_t object has the following
           members: may_save and accepted_failures.  The svn_auth_ssl_server_cert_info_t object has the
           following members (and behaves just like cred objects though you can't modify it): hostname,
           fingerprint, valid_from, valid_until, issuer_dname, ascii_cert.

           The masks used for determining the failures are in SVN::Auth::SSL and are named:

           $SVN::Auth::SSL::NOTYETVALID $SVN::Auth::SSL::EXPIRED $SVN::Auth::SSL::CNMISMATCH
           $SVN::Auth::SSL::UNKNOWNCA $SVN::Auth::SSL::OTHER

           You reply by setting the accepted_failures of the cred object with an integer of the values for
           what you want to accept bitwise AND'd together.

       SVN::Client::get_ssl_cert_file_provider
           Returns a client certificate provider that returns information from previously cached sessions.
           Takes no parameters or optionally a pool parameter.

       SVN::Client::get_ssl_cert_prompt_provider
           Returns a client certificate provider that prompts the user via a callback.  Takes two or three
           parameters: the first is the callback subroutine, the 2nd is the number of retries to allow, the
           3rd is optionally a pool parameter.  The subroutine gets called with the following parameters.  A
           svn_auth_cred_ssl_client_cert object, a realm string, may_save, and a pool.  The
           svn_auth_cred_ssl_client_cert the following members: cert_file and may_save.

       SVN::Client::get_ssl_cert_pw_file_provider
           Returns a client certificate password provider that returns information from previously cached
           sessions.  Takes no parameters or optionally a pool parameter.

       SVN::Client::get_ssl_cert_pw_prompt_provider
           Returns a client certificate password provider that prompts the user via a callback. Takes two or
           three parameters, the first is the callback subroutine, the 2nd is the number of retries to
           allow, the 3rd is optionally a pool parameter.  The subroutine gets called with the following
           parameters.  A svn_auth_cred_ssl_client_cert_pw object, a realm string, may_save, and a pool.
           The svn_auth_cred_ssl_client_cert_pw has the following members: password and may_save.

<b>OBJECTS</b>
       These are some of the object types that are returned from the methods and functions.  Others are
       documented in SVN::Core and SVN::Wc.  If an object is not documented, it is more than likely opaque
       and not something you can do anything with, except pass to other functions that require such objects.

       <b>svn_info_t</b>


       $info-&gt;<u>URL()</u>
               Where the item lives in the repository.

       $info-&gt;<u>rev()</u>
               The revision of the object.  If path_or_url is a working-copy path, then this is its current
               working revnum.  If path_or_url is a URL, then this is the repos revision that path_or_url
               lives in.

       $info-&gt;<u>kind()</u>
               The node's kind.

       $info-&gt;<u>repos</u><b>_</b><u>root</u><b>_</b><u>URL()</u>
               The root URL of the repository.

       $info-&gt;<u>repos</u><b>_</b><u>UUID()</u>
               The repository's UUID.

       $info-&gt;<u>last</u><b>_</b><u>changed</u><b>_</b><u>rev()</u>
               The last revision in which this object changed.

       $info-&gt;<u>last</u><b>_</b><u>changed</u><b>_</b><u>date()</u>

       See SVN::Wc::svn_wc_entry_t for the rest of these.   svn_client.h indicates that these were copied
       from that struct and mean the same things.   They are also only useful when working with a WC.

<b>TODO</b>
       * Better support for the config.

       * Unit tests for cleanup, diff, export, merge, move, relocate, resolved and switch.  This may reveal
       problems for using these methods as I haven't tested them yet that require deeper fixes.
