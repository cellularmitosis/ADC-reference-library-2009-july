PROCMAIL(1)                                                                                      PROCMAIL(1)



<b>NAME</b>
       procmail - autonomous mail processor

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>procmail</b> [<b>-ptoY</b>] [<b>-f</b> <u>fromwhom</u>]
            [<u>parameter</u><b>=</b><u>value</u> | <u>rcfile</u>] ...
       <b>procmail</b> [<b>-toY</b>] [<b>-f</b> <u>fromwhom</u>] [<b>-a</b> <u>argument</u>] ...
            <b>-d</b> <u>recipient</u> ...
       <b>procmail</b> [<b>-ptY</b>] <b>-m</b> [<u>parameter</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>] ...  <u>rcfile</u>
            [<u>argument</u>] ....br <b>procmail</b> <b>-v</b>

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       For a quick start, see <b>NOTES</b> at the end.

       <b>Procmail</b>  should  be  invoked automatically over the <b>.forward</b> file mechanism as soon as mail arrives.
       Alternatively, when installed by a system administrator, it can be invoked  from  within  the  mailer
       immediately.   When  invoked,  it  first sets some environment variables to default values, reads the
       mail message from stdin until an EOF, separates the body from the header, and  then,  if  no  command
       line  arguments  are present, it starts to look for a file named <b>$HOME/.procmailrc</b>.  According to the
       processing recipes in this file, the mail message that just arrived gets distributed into  the  right
       folder  (and  more).   If no rcfile is found, or processing of the rcfile falls off the end, procmail
       will store the mail in the default system mailbox.

       If no rcfiles and no <b>-p</b> have been specified on the command line,  procmail  will,  prior  to  reading
       $HOME/.procmailrc,  interpret  commands  from  <b>/etc/procmailrc</b> (if present).  Care must be taken when
       creating /etc/procmailrc, because, if circumstances permit, it will be executed with root  privileges
       (contrary to the $HOME/.procmailrc file of course).

       If  running  suid  root  or  with root privileges, procmail will be able to perform as a functionally
       enhanced, backwards compatible mail delivery agent.

       Procmail can also be used as a general purpose mail filter, i.e., provisions have been made to enable
       procmail to be invoked in a special sendmail rule.

       The rcfile format is described in detail in the <a href="../man5/procmailrc.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/procmailrc"><b>procmailrc</b>(5)</a> man page.

       The weighted scoring technique is described in detail in the <a href="../man5/procmailsc.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/procmailsc"><b>procmailsc</b>(5)</a> man page.

       Examples for rcfile recipes can be looked up in the <a href="../man5/procmailex.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/procmailex"><b>procmailex</b>(5)</a> man page.

   <b>Signals</b>
       <b>TERMINATE</b>   Terminate prematurely and requeue the mail.

       <b>HANGUP</b>      Terminate prematurely and bounce the mail.

       <b>INTERRUPT</b>   Terminate prematurely and bounce the mail.

       <b>QUIT</b>        Terminate prematurely and silently lose the mail.

       <b>ALARM</b>       Force a timeout (see <b>TIMEOUT).</b>

       <b>USR1</b>        Equivalent to a <b>VERBOSE</b>=off.

       <b>USR2</b>        Equivalent to a <b>VERBOSE</b>=on.

<b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-v</b>   Procmail will print its version number, display its compile time configuration and exit.

       <b>-p</b>   Preserve any old environment.  Normally procmail clears the environment upon startup, except for
            the value of TZ.  However, in any case: any default values will override any  preexisting  envi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ronment&nbsp;environment</font>
            ronment variables, i.e., procmail will not pay any attention to any predefined environment vari-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ables,&nbsp;variables,</font>
            ables, it will happily overwrite them with its own defaults.  For the list of environment  vari-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ables&nbsp;variables</font>
            ables  that  procmail  will preset see the <a href="../man5/procmailrc.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/procmailrc"><b>procmailrc</b>(5)</a> man page.  If both -p and -m are speci-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fied,&nbsp;specified,</font>
            fied, the list of preset environment variables shrinks to just: LOGNAME,  HOME,  SHELL,  ORGMAIL
            and MAILDIR.

       <b>-t</b>   Make  procmail fail softly, i.e., if procmail cannot deliver the mail to any of the destinations
            you gave, the mail will not bounce, but will return to the mailqueue.  Another  delivery-attempt
            will be made at some time in the future.

       <b>-f</b> <u>fromwhom</u>
            Causes  procmail  to regenerate the leading `From ' line with <u>fromwhom</u> as the sender (instead of
            -f one could use the alternate and obsolete -r).  If <u>fromwhom</u> consists merely of a  single  `-',
            then  procmail  will  only update the timestamp on the `From ' line (if present, if not, it will
            generate a new one).

       <b>-o</b>   Instead of allowing anyone to generate `From ' lines, simply override the fakes.

       <b>-Y</b>   Assume traditional Berkeley mailbox format, ignore any <b>Content-Length:</b> fields.

       <b>-a</b> <u>argument</u>
            This will set $1 to be equal to <u>argument</u>.  Each succeeding <b>-a</b> <u>argument</u> will set the next  number
            variable  ($2,  $3,  etc).   It can be used to pass meta information along to procmail.  This is
            typically done by passing along the $@x information from the sendmail mailer rule.

       <b>-d</b> <u>recipient</u> <u>...</u>
            This turns on explicit delivery mode, delivery will be to the local user  <u>recipient</u>.   This,  of
            course, only is possible if procmail has root privileges (or if procmail is already running with
            the recipient's euid and egid).  Procmail will setuid to the intended  recipients  and  delivers
            the  mail as if it were invoked by the recipient with no arguments (i.e., if no rcfile is found,
            delivery is like ordinary mail).  This option is incompatible with <b>-p</b>.

       <b>-m</b>   Turns procmail into a general purpose mail filter.  In this mode one rcfile must be specified on
            the  command line.  After the rcfile, procmail will accept an unlimited number of arguments.  If
            the rcfile is an absolute path starting with <b>/etc/procmailrcs/</b> without backward references (i.e.
            the  parent  directory  cannot  be  mentioned) procmail will, only if no security violations are
            found, take on the identity of the owner of the rcfile (or symbolic link).   For  some  advanced
            usage  of  this option you should look in the <b>EXAMPLES</b> section below..SH ARGUMENTS Any arguments
            containing an '=' are considered to be environment variable assignments, they will <u>all</u> be evalu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ated&nbsp;evaluated</font>
            ated after the default values have been assigned and before the first rcfile is opened.

       Any other arguments are presumed to be rcfile paths (either absolute, or if they start with `./' rel-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ative&nbsp;relative</font>
       ative to the current directory; <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>relative</b> path is relative to $HOME, unless  the  <b>-m</b>  option
       has  been  given,  in  which case all relative paths are relative to the current directory); procmail
       will start with the first one it finds on the command line.  The following ones will only  be  parsed
       if the preceding ones have a not matching HOST-directive entry, or in case they should not exist.

       If no rcfiles are specified, it looks for <b>$HOME/.procmailrc</b>.  If not even that can be found, process-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;processing</font>
       ing will continue according to the default settings of the environment variables and the ones  speci-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fied&nbsp;specified</font>
       fied on the command line.

<b>EXAMPLES</b>
       Examples  for  rcfile  recipes can be looked up in the <a href="../man5/procmailex.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/procmailex"><b>procmailex</b>(5)</a> man page.  A small sample rcfile
       can be found in the <b>NOTES</b> section below.

       Skip the rest of this EXAMPLES section unless you are a system administrator who is vaguely  familiar
       with sendmail.cf syntax.

       The  <b>-m</b>  option is typically used when procmail is called from within a rule in the sendmail.cf file.
       In order to be able to do this it is convenient to create an extra `procmail' mailer  in  your  send-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mail.cf&nbsp;sendmail.cf</font>
       mail.cf file (in addition to the perhaps already present `local' mailer that starts up procmail).  To
       create such a `procmail' mailer I'd suggest something like:

              Mprocmail, P=/usr/bin/procmail, F=mSDFMhun, S=11, R=21,
                      A=procmail -m $h $g $u

       This enables you to use rules like the following (most likely in ruleset 0) to  filter  mail  through
       the  procmail  mailer  (please note the leading tab to continue the rule, and the tab to separate the
       comments):

              R$*&lt;@some.where&gt;$*
                      $#procmail $@/etc/procmailrcs/some.rc $:$1@some.where.procmail$2
              R$*&lt;@$*.procmail&gt;$*
                      $1&lt;@$2&gt;$3       Already filtered, map back

       And /etc/procmailrcs/some.rc could be as simple as:

              SENDER = "&lt;$1&gt;"                 # fix for empty sender addresses
              SHIFT = 1                       # remove it from $@

              :0                              # sink all junk mail
              * ^Subject:.*junk
              /dev/null

              :0 w                            # pass along all other mail
              ! -oi -f "$SENDER" "$@"

       Do watch out when sending mail from within the /etc/procmailrcs/some.rc file, if  you  send  mail  to
       addresses which match the first rule again, you could be creating an endless mail loop.

<b>FILES</b>
       <b>/etc/passwd</b>            to set the recipient's LOGNAME, HOME and SHELL variable defaults

       <b>/var/mail/$LOGNAME</b>     system  mailbox;  both the system mailbox and the immediate directory it is in
                              will be created every time procmail starts and either one is not present

       <b>/etc/procmailrc</b>        initial global rcfile

       <b>/etc/procmailrcs/</b>      special privileges path for rcfiles

       <b>$HOME/.procmailrc</b>      default rcfile

       <b>/var/mail/$LOGNAME.lock</b>
                              lockfile for the system mailbox (not automatically used  by  procmail,  unless
                              $DEFAULT equals /var/mail/$LOGNAME and procmail is delivering to $DEFAULT)

       <b>/usr/sbin/sendmail</b>     default mail forwarder

       <b>_????`hostname`</b>        temporary `unique' zero-length files created by procmail

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       Autoforwarding mailbox found
                              The system mailbox had its suid or sgid  bit  set,  procmail  terminates  with
                              EX_NOUSER assuming that this mailbox must not be delivered to.

       Bad substitution of "x"
                              Not a valid environment variable name specified.

       Closing brace unexpected
                              There was no corresponding opening brace (nesting block).

       Conflicting options    Not all option combinations are useful

       Conflicting x suppressed
                              Flag x is not compatible with some other flag on this recipe.

       Couldn't create "x"    The system mailbox was missing and could not/will not be created.

       Couldn't create maildir part "x"
                              The  maildir  folder  "x"  is  missing one or more required subdirectories and
                              procmail could not create them.

       Couldn't create or rename temp file "x"
                              An error occurred in the mechanics of  delivering to the directory folder "x".

       Couldn't determine implicit lockfile from "x"
                              There  were no `&gt;&gt;' redirectors to be found, using simply `$LOCKEXT' as local-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lockfile.&nbsp;locallockfile.</font>
                              lockfile.

       Couldn't read "x"      Procmail was unable to open an rcfile or it was not a regular file,  or  proc-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mail&nbsp;procmail</font>
                              mail couldn't open an MH directory to find the highest numbered file.

       Couldn't unlock "x"    Lockfile  was  already  gone,  or  write permission to the directory where the
                              lockfile is has been denied.

       Deadlock attempted on "x"
                              The locallockfile specified on this recipe is equal to a still  active  $LOCK-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">FILE.&nbsp;$LOCKFILE.</font>
                              FILE.

       Denying special privileges for "x"
                              Procmail  will  not  take on the identity that comes with the rcfile because a
                              security violation was found (e.g.  <b>-p</b> or variable assignments on the  command
                              line) or procmail had insufficient privileges to do so.

       Descriptor "x" was not open
                              As  procmail  was started, stdin, stdout or stderr was not connected (possibly
                              an attempt to subvert security)

       Enforcing stricter permissions on "x"
                              The system mailbox of the recipient was found to be  unsecured,  procmail  se-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cured&nbsp;secured</font>
                              cured it.

       Error while writing to "x"
                              Nonexistent subdirectory, no write permission, pipe died or disk full.

       Exceeded LINEBUF       Buffer  overflow  detected,  LINEBUF was too small, PROCMAIL_OVERFLOW has been
                              set.

       MAILDIR is not an absolute path

       MAILDIR path too long

       ORGMAIL is not an absolute path

       ORGMAIL path too long

       default rcfile is not an absolute path

       default rcfile path too long
                              The specified item's full path, when expanded,  was  longer  than  LINEBUF  or
                              didn't start with a file separator.

       Excessive output quenched from "x"
                              The  program  or  filter  "x" tried to produce too much output for the current
                              LINEBUF, the rest was discarded and PROCMAIL_OVERFLOW has been set.

       Extraneous x ignored   The action line or other flags on this recipe makes flag x meaningless.

       Failed forking "x"     Process table is full (and NORESRETRY has been exhausted).

       Failed to execute "x"  Program not in path, or not executable.

       Forced unlock denied on "x"
                              No write permission in the directory where <b>lockfile</b> "x" resides, or more  than
                              one procmail trying to force a lock at exactly the same time.

       Forcing lock on "x"    <b>Lockfile</b>  "x"  is going to be removed by force because of a timeout (see also:
                              <b>LOCKTIMEOUT</b>).

       Incomplete recipe      The start of a recipe was found, but it stranded in an EOF.

       Insufficient privileges
                              Procmail either needs root privileges, or  must  have  the  right  (e)uid  <b>and</b>
                              (e)gid to run in delivery mode.  The mail will bounce.

       Invalid regexp "x"     The regular expression "x" contains errors (most likely some missing or extra-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">neous&nbsp;extraneous</font>
                              neous parens).

       Kernel-lock failed     While trying to use the kernel-supported locking calls,  one  of  them  failed
                              (usually indicates an OS error), procmail ignores this error and proceeds.

       Kernel-unlock failed   See above.

       Lock failure on "x"    Can  only  occur if you specify some real weird (and illegal) lockfilenames or
                              if the <b>lockfile</b> could not be created because of  insufficient  permissions  or
                              nonexistent subdirectories.

       Lost "x"               Procmail  tried  to clone itself but could not find back rcfile "x" (it either
                              got removed or it was a relative path and you changed directory since procmail
                              opened it last time).

       Missing action         The current recipe was found to be incomplete.

       Missing closing brace  A nesting block was started, but never finished.

       Missing name           The -f option needs an extra argument.

       Missing argument       You specified the -a option but forgot the argument.

       Missing rcfile         You  specified  the -m option, procmail expects the name of an rcfile as argu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ment.&nbsp;argument.</font>
                              ment.

       Missing recipient      You specified the -d option or called procmail under a different name, it  ex-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pects&nbsp;expects</font>

       No space left to finish writing "x"
                              The filesystem containing "x" does not have enough free space to permit deliv-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ery&nbsp;delivery</font>
                              ery of the message to the file.

       Out of memory          The system is out of swap space (and NORESRETRY has been exhausted).

       Processing continued   The unrecognised options on the command line are ignored, proceeding as usual.

       Program failure (nnn) of "x"
                              Program  that  was  started  by  procmail returned nnn instead of EXIT_SUCCESS
                              (=0); if nnn is negative, then this is the signal the program died on.

       Quota exceeded while writing "x"
                              The filesize quota for the recipient on the filesystem containing "x" does not
                              permit delivering the message to the file.

       Renaming bogus "x" into "x"
                              The  system mailbox of the recipient was found to be bogus, procmail performed
                              evasive actions.

       Rescue of unfiltered data succeeded/failed
                              A filter returned unsuccessfully, procmail tried  to  get  back  the  original
                              text.

       Skipped: "x"           Couldn't do anything with "x" in the rcfile (syntax error), ignoring it.

       Suspicious rcfile "x"  The  owner  of  the  rcfile  was not the recipient or root, the file was world
                              writable, or the directory that contained it was world writable, or  this  was
                              the default rcfile ($HOME/.procmailrc) and either it was group writable or the
                              directory that contained it was group writable (the rcfile was not used).

       Terminating prematurely whilst waiting for ...
                              Procmail received a signal while it was waiting for ...

       Timeout, terminating "x"
                              Timeout has occurred on program or filter "x".

       Timeout, was waiting for "x"
                              Timeout has occurred on program, filter or file "x".  If it was a  program  or
                              filter, then it didn't seem to be running anymore.

       Truncated file to former size
                              The  file could not be delivered to successfully, so the file was truncated to
                              its former size.

       Truncating "x" and retrying lock
                              "x" does not seem to be a valid filename or the file is not empty.

       Unable to treat as directory "x"
                              Either the suffix on "x" would indicate that it should be  an  MH  or  maildir
                              folder,  or  it  was listed as an second folder into which to link, but it al-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ready&nbsp;already</font>
                              ready exists and is not a directory.

       Unexpected EOL         Missing closing quote, or trying to escape EOF.

       Unknown user "x"       The specified recipient does not have a corresponding uid.

<b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       Extended diagnostics can be turned on and off through setting the VERBOSE variable.

       [pid] time &amp; date      Procmail's pid and a timestamp.  Generated whenever procmail logs a diagnostic
                              and at least a second has elapsed since the last timestamp.

       Acquiring kernel-lock  Procmail  now tries to kernel-lock the most recently opened file (descriptor).

       Assigning "x"          Environment variable assignment.

       Assuming identity of the recipient, VERBOSE=off
                              Dropping all privileges (if any), implicitly turns off extended diagnostics.

       Bypassed locking "x"   The mail spool directory was not accessible to procmail, it relied  solely  on
                              kernel locks.

       Executing "x"          Starting  program  "x".  If it is started by procmail directly (without an in-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">termediate&nbsp;intermediate</font>
                              termediate shell), procmail will show where it separated the arguments by  in-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">serting&nbsp;inserting</font>
                              serting commas.

       No match on "x"        Condition didn't match, recipe skipped.

       Non-zero exitcode (nnn) by "x"
                              Program  that  was  started  by  procmail as a condition or as the action of a
                              recipe with the `W' flag returned nnn instead of EXIT_SUCCESS (=0); the  usage
                              indicates that this is not an entirely unexpected condition.

       Notified comsat: "$LOGNAME@offset:file"
                              Sent  comsat/biff  a notice that mail arrived for user $LOGNAME at `offset' in
                              `file'.

       Opening "x"            Opening file "x" for appending.

       Reiterating kernel-lock
                              While attempting several locking methods, one of these failed.  Procmail  will
                              reiterate until they all succeed in rapid succession.

       Score: added newtotal "x"
                              This condition scored `added' points, which resulted in a `newtotal' score.

       Unlocking "x"          Removing lockfile "x" again.

<b>WARNINGS</b>
       You should create a shell script that uses <a href="lockfile.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/lockfile"><b>lockfile</b>(1)</a> before invoking your mail shell on any mailbox
       file other than the system mailbox (unless of course, your mail shell uses the same lockfiles  (local
       or global) you specified in your rcfile).

       In the unlikely event that you absolutely need to kill procmail before it has finished, first try and
       use the regular kill command (i.e., <u>not</u> kill -9, see the subsection <u>Signals</u> for suggestions),  other-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">wise&nbsp;otherwise</font>
       wise some <u>lockfiles</u> might not get removed.

       Beware  when  using the <b>-t</b> option, if procmail repeatedly is unable to deliver the mail (e.g., due to
       an incorrect rcfile), the system mailqueue could fill up.  This could aggravate both the local  post-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">master&nbsp;postmaster</font>
       master and other users.

       The  <b>/etc/procmailrc</b>  file might be executed with root privileges, so be very careful of what you put
       in it.  <b>SHELL</b> will be equal to that of the current recipient, so if procmail has to invoke the shell,
       you'd better set it to some safe value first.  See also: <b>DROPPRIVS</b>.

       Keep in mind that if <!-- a --><b>chown</b>(1)<!-- /a --> is permitted on files in <b>/etc/procmailrcs/</b>, that they can be chowned to
       root (or anyone else) by their current owners.  For maximum security, make sure this directory is <u>ex</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ecutable&nbsp;executable</font>
       <u>ecutable</u> to root only.

       Procmail  is  not the proper tool for sharing one mailbox among many users, such as when you have one
       POP account for all mail to your domain. It can be done if you manage to configure your  MTA  to  add
       some  headers  with  the  envelope recipient data in order to tell Procmail who a message is for, but
       this is usually not the right thing to do.  Perhaps you want to investigate if your MTA offers  `vir-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tual&nbsp;`virtual</font>
       tual user tables', or check out the `multidrop' facility of Fetchmail.

<b>BUGS</b>
       After removing a lockfile by force, procmail waits $SUSPEND seconds before creating a new lockfile so
       that another process that decides to remove the stale lockfile will not remove the newly created lock
       by mistake.

       Procmail  uses the regular TERMINATE signal to terminate any runaway filter, but it does not check if
       the filter responds to that signal and it only sends it to the filter itself, not to any of the  fil-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ter's&nbsp;filter's</font>
       ter's children.

       A continued <b>Content-Length:</b> field is not handled correctly.

       The  embedded newlines in a continued header should be skipped when matching instead of being treated
       as a single space as they are now.

<b>MISCELLANEOUS</b>
       If there is an existing <b>Content-Length:</b> field in the header of the mail and  the  <b>-Y</b>  option  is  not
       specified,  procmail  will  trim  the field to report the correct size.  Procmail does not change the
       fieldwidth.

       If there is no <b>Content-Length:</b> field or the <b>-Y</b> option has been specified and procmail appends to reg-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ular&nbsp;regular</font>
       ular  mailfolders,  any  lines in the body of the message that look like postmarks are prepended with
       `&gt;' (disarms bogus mailheaders).  The regular expression that is used to search for  these  postmarks
       is:
              `\nFrom '

       If  the  destination name used in explicit delivery mode is not in /etc/passwd, procmail will proceed
       as if explicit delivery mode was not in effect.  If not in explicit delivery mode and should the  uid
       procmail is running under, have no corresponding /etc/passwd entry, then HOME will default to /, LOG-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">NAME&nbsp;LOGNAME</font>
       NAME will default to #uid, SHELL will default to /bin/sh, and ORGMAIL will default to  /tmp/dead.let-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ter.&nbsp;/tmp/dead.letter.</font>
       ter.

       When in explicit delivery mode, procmail will generate a leading `From ' line if none is present.  If
       one is already present procmail will leave it intact.  If procmail is not invoked  with  one  of  the
       following user or group ids: root, daemon, uucp, mail, x400, network, list, slist, lists or news, but
       still has to generate or accept a new `From ' line, it will generate an additional `&gt;From '  line  to
       help distinguish fake mails.

       For  security  reasons  procmail will only use an absolute or $HOME-relative rcfile if it is owned by
       the recipient or root, not world writable, and  the  directory  it  is  contained  in  is  not  world
       writable.  The $HOME/.procmailrc file has the additional constraint of not being group-writable or in
       a group-writable directory.

       If /var/mail/$LOGNAME is a bogus mailbox (i.e., does not belong to the recipient, is unwritable, is a
       symbolic  link  or  is a hard link), procmail will upon startup try to rename it into a file starting
       with `BOGUS.$LOGNAME.' and ending in an inode-sequence-code.  If this turns  out  to  be  impossible,
       <b>ORGMAIL</b> will have <u>no</u> initial value, and hence will inhibit delivery without a proper rcfile.

       If  /var/mail/$LOGNAME  already is a valid mailbox, but has got too loose permissions on it, procmail
       will correct this.  To prevent procmail from doing this make sure the u+x bit is set.

       When delivering to directories, MH folders, or maildir folders, you <b>don't</b> need to  use  lockfiles  to
       prevent several concurrently running procmail programs from messing up.

       Delivering  to  MH  folders  is slightly more time consuming than delivering to normal directories or
       mailboxes, because procmail has to search for the next available number (instead of having the  file-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">name&nbsp;filename</font>
       name immediately available).

       On general failure procmail will return EX_CANTCREAT, unless option <b>-t</b> is specified, in which case it
       will return EX_TEMPFAIL.

       To make `egrepping' of headers more consistent, procmail concatenates all  continued  header  fields;
       but only internally.  When delivering the mail, line breaks will appear as before.

       If  procmail  is  called  under a name not starting with `procmail' (e.g., if it is linked to another
       name and invoked as such), it comes up in explicit delivery mode, and expects the  recipients'  names
       as command line arguments (as if -d had been specified).

       Comsat/biff  notifications  are  done  using udp.  They are sent off once when procmail generates the
       regular logfile entry.  The notification messages have the following extended format (or as close  as
       you can get when final delivery was not to a file):
              $LOGNAME@offset_of_message_in_mailbox:absolute_path_to_mailbox

       Whenever  procmail itself opens a file to deliver to, it consistently uses the following kernel lock-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;locking</font>
       ing strategies: <a href="../man2/fcntl.2.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/2/fcntl"><b>fcntl</b>(2)</a> and <a href="../man3/lockf.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/lockf"><b>lockf</b>(3)</a>.

       Procmail is NFS-resistant and eight-bit clean.

<b>NOTES</b>
       Calling up procmail with the -h or -? options will cause it to display a command-line help and recipe
       flag quick-reference page.

       There exists an excellent newbie FAQ about mailfilters (and procmail in particular); it is maintained
       by Nancy McGough &lt;nancym@ii.com&gt; and can be obtained by sending a  mail  to  mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu
       with the following in the body:
              send usenet/news.answers/mail/filtering-faq

       If procmail is <u>not</u> installed globally as the default mail delivery agent (ask your system administra-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tor),&nbsp;administrator),</font>
       tor), you have to make sure it is invoked when your mail arrives.  In this case  your  $HOME/.forward
       (beware,  it  <b>has</b>  to  be world readable) file should contain the line below.  Be sure to include the
       single and double quotes, and unless you know your site to be running smrsh (the SendMail  Restricted
       SHell),  it  must be an <u>absolute</u> path.The \fB#\fP\fIYOUR_USERNAME\fP is not actually a parameter that
       is required by procmail, in fact, it will be discarded by sh before procmail ever sees it; it is how-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ever&nbsp;however</font>
       ever a necessary kludge against overoptimising sendmail programs:


       "|IFS=' '&amp;&amp;p=/usr/bin/procmail&amp;&amp;test -f $p&amp;&amp;exec $p -Yf-||exit 75 <b>#</b><u>YOUR</u><b>_</b><u>USERNAME</u>"

       Procmail  can also be invoked to postprocess an already filled system mailbox.  This can be useful if
       you don't want to or can't use a $HOME/.forward file (in which case the following script could  peri-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">odically&nbsp;periodically</font>
       odically be called from within <!-- a --><b>cron</b>(1)<!-- /a -->, or whenever you start reading mail):
