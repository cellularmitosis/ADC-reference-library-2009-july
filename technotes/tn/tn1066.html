It is designed for programmers who areworking on applications designed for both 680x0- and PowerPC-based Macintoshsystems.</p><P>E.T.O., which includes the MPW development environment, the MacApp applicationframework, and the OpenDoc Development Framework, is sold only by subscriptionand updates are automatically sent to subscribers every four months during thesubscription year. New subscribers receive the current issue followed by thenext two scheduled updates.</p><P>While E.T.O. provides you with a complete development system, it alsoincludes many components that are not available with either MetrowerksCodeWarrior or Symantec C++, making it a valuable companion to theseother popular environments. Users of other development environments willfind E.T.O. the convenient source for the Macintosh ProgrammerpisAssistant, performance analysis tools, Pascal to C conversion tools, andthe Virtual User testing tool. CodeWarrior users also get the benefit ofa plug-in MrC/MrCpp compiler and the Power Mac Debugger.</p><center><img src="images/tn1066_003.gif" alt="" width=381 height=373></center><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><a name="Section2"></a><H2>Major Components of E.T.O.</H2><H3>MPW Shell</H3><P>The Shell is the centerpiece of the Macintosh Programmer's Workshop (MPW)development environment. It is an integrated multiwindow text editor andcommand executer which supports numerous built-in commands and a powerfulscripting language that allows you to customize the environment to suit yourneeds. The Shell also includes Projector, an integrated source code controlsystem that simplifies the management of large, complex software projects beingworked on by a team of programmers.</p><center><img src="images/tn1066_004.gif" alt="" width=381 height=355></center><H3>SC/SCpp -- C and C++ Compilers (68K)</H3><P>SC and SCpp are new ANSI-compliant 680x0-code-generating C and C++ compilersthat are faster than previous compilers included with MPW, run in native modeon a Power Macintosh, and support the new CFM-68K runtime model.</P><H3>MrC/MrCpp -- C and C++ Compilers (PowerPC)</H3><P>MrC and MrCpp are new MPW compilers which offer greatly improved turnaroundtime and also generate efficient and highly-optimized PowerPC code for fastestbinary execution on Power Macintosh systems. MrC adheres to the ANSI C standard(ANSI X3.159-1991) and MrCpp adheres to the ANSI C++ working paper (ANSI X3J16)except for templates and exception handling.</P><H3>Assemblers (68K and PowerPC)</H3><P>Two assemblers are included, one which supports the full 68xxx instruction setand the other which supports the PowerPC instruction set. The 68xxx assemblersupports all the instructions and addressing modes for the MC68000, MC68010,MC68020, and MC68030 microprocessors, the MC68851 Paged Memory Management Unit(PMMU), and the MC68881 and MC68882 Floating-Point Coprocessors, in all usablecombinations.</P><H3>MPW Tool and Script Suite</H3><P>Dozens of tools and scripts are included to assist you in the developmentprocess. These include linkers, a Make tool, resource manipulation and analysistools, file comparison utilities, and many more.</P><H3>MacApp (68K and PowerPC)</H3><P>MacApp is an advanced object-oriented application framework and class librarywhich can be used to streamline the development of Power Macintosh and 680x0applications through the benefits of object-oriented programming. For moredetailed information, please refer to Apple's <a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/">MacApp Home Page</A>.</P><H3>68K Macintosh Debugger</H3><P>The 68K Macintosh Debugger runs on 68k and PowerPC machines and is designed fordebugging 680x0-based Macintosh applications and can act as a one-machine or atwo-machine debugger. It can be used to debug both classic 68K applications andCFM-68K applications and shared libraries. The debugger host communicates withthe target application through 68K Mac DebugServices, a "high-level" nub thatuses either a local connection via direct callbacks, or a remote connection viaAppleTalk.</P><H3>Power Macintosh Debugger</H3><P>Power Macintosh Debugger 2.0 is designed for debugging native Power Macintoshapplications and can act as a one- or two-machine debugger. The debugger hostcommunicates with the target application using Power Mac DebugServices, a"high-level" nub that uses either a local connection via direct callbacks, or aremote connection via AppleTalk. In remote (two-machine) mode, the host canalso communicate with the target via PPC Debugger Nub, a "low-level" nub thatuses a serial connection. The high-level nub should be used, where possible,because it does not stop the whole target machine, only the process beingdebugged. Conversely, the low-level nub takes control of the whole targetsystem, but is necessary to debug low-level code such as code that runs atinterrupt time.</p><P>The Power Mac Debugger also includes ASP (Adaptive Sampling Profiler). ASP is asampling utility that allows you to measure how often sections of code execute.The ASP is an integral part of the debugger; you enable the ASP by a selectionfrom the debugger's Performance menu. Unlike other samplers, the ASP does notrequire you to modify your source code in order to take measurements. Thismeans that you do not have to recompile your source to measure its performance.In addition, you can obtain a more reliable picture of your application'sperformance because you do not have to worry about paging behavior or memoryuse that is due to inserted sampling code.</p><center><img src="images/tn1066_005.gif" alt="" width=388 height=281></center><H3>MacsBug (68K and PowerPC)</H3><P>MacsBug is a low-level debugger for debugging software at the assembly-languagelevel (680x0 or PowerPC). It loads at system startup time and idles until it isinvoked either manually (by pressing the interrupt switch or a key that youdefine) or programmatically (by calling special traps from within yourprogram). And since MacsBug needs so little of the system to operate, it can beused even in the case of fatal system errors.</P><H3>ResEdit</H3><P>ResEdit is a graphical resource editor for creating and editing elements of theMacintosh user interface, such as menus, windows, icons, dialog boxes, andother standard data structures. Programmers and advanced users can quicklycreate portions of their application's user interface as well as modify anexisting interface.</P><H3>Macintosh Programmer's Assistant</H3><P>This is a useful new on-line reference tool which provides rapid up-to-dateaccess to information on all aspects of the Macintosh API, including toolboxmanagers, data structures, routines, constants, resources, and MPW commands.MPW scripts and tools are also provided that let you access it directly fromthe MPW environment using "hot keys".</P><H3>Virtual User</H3><P>Virtual User is a test automation system that enables a host Macintosh tocontrol the actions of target Macintosh computers remotely. The host executestests on one or more target machines by reading the commands it is to issuefrom a file called a script. The script is a text file written in the VirtualUser scripting language. This interpreted procedural language provides VirtualUser with the ability to recognize and manipulate various elements of anapplication's human interface, compare the actual result of a command with anexpected result, and branch logically according to the result of thecomparison.</P><H3>MPW p2c</H3><P>p2c is a source-to-source translation tool which translates between Object Pascal and C++. (p2c has an option to generate standard C code instead of C++.)</P><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><a name="Section3"></a><H2>On the Horizon: Pre-Release Tools</H2><H3>ResEdit 3.0</H3><P>ResEdit 3.0 is a completely new implementation of ResEdit, designed to providea powerful, extensible, and maintainable editing solution for resource files,PEF files, and other file types. It is being developed to replace previousversions of ResEdit. Here are some of the features of ResEdit 3.0: </P><ul><li>Standard Macintosh application look-and-feel</li><li>Extensible architecture with plug-ins and enhanced templates</li><li>WorldScript support</li><li>Macintosh Drag and Drop support</li></ul><H3>MrPlus/MrProf</H3><P>MrPlus is an MPW performance tool which operates on Apple PEF files. It is amulti-function tool which can do the following: </P><ul><li>Produce static information about the executable file, such as counts ofimportant program structures, frequency of appearance of the variousinstructions, and frequency of appearance of references to the variousregisters.</li><li>Produce a PEF file which is an enhanced version of the original file. Itcontains instrumentation code which, at the time of execution, outputs dynamicinformation about the program. Corresponding to the static information alreadylisted will be dynamic data on the instruction mix. The distinction is that thedynamic information states the frequency of execution instead of the frequencyof appearance. The dynamic information also includes a routine profile: therelative number of instructions executed in each routine.</li><li>Produce a PEF file containing instrumentation that traps attempts to storeinto low memory (0-32K).</li><li>Optimize the program by reordering portions of code in the PEF file toimprove the utilization of the instruction cache and to reduce the number ofpage faults in a system with virtual memory enabled.</li></ul><P>MrProf is an application that provides tabular and graphic presentations ofdata collected when executing programs that were instrumented by MrPlus. Theinput data to MrProf are a .pmap file, optionally a .xcoff file, and one ormore .pcnt files.</P><H3>PPCProff and Proff</H3><P>PPCProff (for PowerPC programs) and Proff (for classic 68K programs) provideprofiling and performance monitoring for programs compiled from C and C++. Forevery routine called during program execution, the Proff tools record theidentity of the called routine, the identity of the calling routine, and thetime spent in each routine.</P><P>PPCProff prints an analysis of the Profiler.pgh data file generated when yourun a PowerPC application or shared library that was linked using PPCLink's-profile option.</P><H3>Direct SOMobjects for Mac OS</H3><P>A folder which contains information on how to use the "Direct-to-SOM"capability of the new prerelease version of the MrCpp compiler. You canuse this capability to write SOM-based classes directly using C++, thatis, without using the IDL language or the IDL compiler. This folder alsocontains new SOMobjects header files which must be used instead of thestandard set that are installed with SOMobjects for Mac OS 2.0.8.</P><H3>MrC/MrCpp - Plugin version for CodeWarrior</H3><P>This is a new prerelease version of the MrC/MrCpp compiler for use withthe Metrowerks CodeWarrior environment. Note that it can be used onlywith CodeWarrior 9 or later.</P><H3>Instrumentation SDK 1.0</H3><P>This is the first release of the Instrumentation Viewer and the Mac OS7.5 Instrumentation SDK, a set of applications and libraries that allowyou to instrument your 68K and PowerPC code with traces and statisticsunder System 7.5.</P><P>The instrumentation system is designed to help you record informationabout running software. This allows you to expose its behavior and driveperformance investigations.</P><H3>Mac OS Runtime for Java 1.0b1</H3><P>Mac OS Runtime for Java (MRJ) is Apple's Java execution environmentbased on technology from Sun Microsystems, Inc. The MRJ is designed toprovide a robust, stable, reliable implementation of the Sun JDK 1.0.2specification.</P><P>This beta preview will allow developers to build Macintosh applicationswhich incorporate Java. Using MRJ, developers can build standaloneJava applications as well as run Java within existing applications.</P><P>For more information about Java at Apple, and to download periodicupdates, see Apple's <A HREF = "http://developer.apple.com/java/">MRJ Home Page</A>.</P><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><a name="Summary"></a><H2>Summary</H2><P>E.T.O. brings together a deluxe collection of Macintosh core development tools,designed to support C, C++, and assembly-language programmers.
