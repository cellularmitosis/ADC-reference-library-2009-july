MovieGWorlds Sample Code
April 3, 2003

This sample contains 3 targets: MovieProc, MovieGWorlds and TrackGWorlds which demonstrate the following QuickTime programming techniques:

- Assigning a drawing-complete function to a movie using the SetMovieDrawingCompleteProc function

- Drawing movie content into a separate graphics world for compositing, then copying the result to the screen

- Using the SetTrackGWorld function to force a track to draw into a particular graphics world. A Track-transfer procedure is specified here. When the movie is drawn, QuickTime calls the transfer callback to copy the track to the actual movie graphics world.

Launch the application and you will be prompted to select a movie file - you can easily selected the movie included with the project. Next, press any key and movie playback will start. To stop movie playback, click the mouse.
