Notification Manager HacksMacHack 1992By Brigham StevensApple Developer Technical SupportAppleLink BRIGHAMinternet    brigham@appleLInk.apple.comIf you fix any of my bugs, please let me know.   PoliteNotification----------------Extension prevents notification dialogs from begin displayed by storing the text in a private buffer, accessable through a buffer located via Gestalt.TrashCanNotifications--------------------Displayes the most recent notification text in the trash can window.  Really in any window named trash.  Patched EndUpdate to do this.NotificationMon--------------This application registers with the PoliteNotification extension when it runs.  When a notification is received, it saves the text in a window.  Save does not work, but who the heck would want to save the notification text anyway.  GestaltTalk-----------Put this in the THINK C Folder so the other projects can locate it.  IT contains a protocol for accessing the buffer that contains the notifications.  Right now it only saves one thing.  I would like to extend it to queue up entries, but did not have the time.  This may be useful for other Extensions that need to communicate to an application.  I don't think it is totally cool to use Gestalt like this, but hey, it's a HACK, and why not anyway?
