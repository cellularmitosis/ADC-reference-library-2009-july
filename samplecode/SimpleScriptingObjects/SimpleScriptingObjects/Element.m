	/* storage management
	
	The normal sequence of events when an object is created is as follows:
	
	1. an AppleScript 'make' command will allocate and initialize an instance
	of the class it has been asked to create.  For example, it may create a Trinket.
	
	2. then it will call the insertInXXXXX: insertInXXXXX:atIndex: method on the container
	object where the new object will be stored.  For example, if we were being asked
	to create a Trinket in a Bucket, then the make command would create an instance
	of Trinket and then it would call insertInTrinkets: on the Bucket object.
	
	3. Inside of the insertInXXXXX: or insertInXXXXX:atIndex: you must record the
	parent object and the parent's property key for the new object being created so
	you can create a objectSpecifier later.  In this class, we have defined the
	setContainer:andProperty: for that purpose.  For example, inside of our
	insertInTrinkets: method on our Bucket object, we the setContainer:andProperty:
	method on the trinket object like so:
	   [trinket setContainer:self andProperty:@"trinkets"]
	to inform the trinket object who its container is and the name of the Cocoa key
	on that container object used for the list of trinkets.
