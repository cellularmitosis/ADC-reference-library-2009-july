To can find the shared library (possibly even    using CatSearch), call GetDiskFragment to open a connection    to it, late import it using this library, and then the    rest of your code can continue to use the shared library    as if nothing had happened.  No more defining thousands    of stub routines which call through routine pointers.        There are, however, numerous less obvious uses.  You can    use this code to make a 'self repairing' application.  If    the user removes your shared library from the Extensions    folder, the startup code for your application can offer    tor re-install it.  If the user agrees, you can then    re-install your shared library, late import it, and then    continue running your application if nothing happened.        You can even use this code to free yourself from the    Extensions folder entirely.  Say you have a suite of    applications that currently installs a dozen shared     libraries in the Extensions folder.  You can move those    libraries to another folder entirely and each application's    startup code can track down the library (using an alias    in the Preferences file) and late import it.        An even cooler use is to provide easy abstraction layers.    Say you have a network code for both the MacTCP    API and the Open Transport API.  Typically, you would be    force to do this by having an abstraction layer where every    routine contains a switch between MacTCP and OT.  Your    OpenSocket routine might look like:      static int OpenSocket(void)      {          if (gOTAvailable) {              return OpenSocketOT();          } else {              return OpenSocketMacTCP();          }      }        With this code, you can avoid that entirely.  Simply    weak link to a shared library that you know is never    going to be implemented (&quot;crea;MySocketsDummy&quot;) and then,     at runtime, decide whether the system has MacTCP or OT    and late import the relevant real implementation    (&quot;crea;MySocketsMacTCP&quot; or &quot;crea;MySocketsOT&quot;).    One benefit of this approach is that only the MacTCP or    the OT code is resident in memory on any given system.*/typedef pascal OSStatus (*CFMLateImportLookupProc)(ConstStr255Param symName, CFragSymbolClass symClass,                          void **symAddr, void *refCon);  // CFMLateImportLookupProc defines a callback for CFMLateImportCore.  // The routine is expected to look up the address of the symbol named   // symName and return it in *symAddr.  The symbol should be of class   // symClass, although the callback decides whether a class mismatch is   // an error.  refCon is an application defined value that was originally   // passed in to CFMLateImportCore.  //  // If this routine returns an error, a symbol address of 0 is assumed.   // If the symbol is marked as a weak import, the CFMLateImportCore will   // continue, otherwise the CFMLateImportCore routine will fail with the   // error.  extern pascal OSStatus CFMLateImportCore(const CFragSystem7DiskFlatLocator *fragToFixLocator,                    CFragConnectionID fragToFixConnID,                    CFragInitFunction fragToFixInitRoutine,                    ConstStr255Param weakLinkedLibraryName,                    CFMLateImportLookupProc lookup,                    void *refCon);  // This routine will link you, at runtime, to some library   // that you were weak linked to and wasn't present when your  // fragment was prepared.  As well as the obvious functionality  // of being able to resolve weak links after prepare time,  // this functionality can be put to a number of less obvious uses,  // some of which are discussed at the top of this header file.  //  // To call this routine, you need a number of pieces of information:  //  // 1. fragToFixLocator, fragToFixConnID:  The location of your own  //    code fragment on disk and the CFM connection ID to your own  //    code fragment.  Typically you get this information from your   //    fragment's CFM init routine.  You must ensure that  //    fragToFixLocator-&gt;fileSpec points to an FSSpec of the  //    file which holds your code fragment.  //  //    IMPORTANT:  //    The fact that you pass in a CFragSystem7DiskFlatLocator as the  //    fragToFixLocator implies that the fragment to be fixed up must  //    be in the data fork of a file.  The code could be modified  //    to remove this requirement, but on disk code fragments are the most  //    common case.  //  //    IMPORTANT:  //    The fragment to fix may have a packed data section.  Packing the   //    data section will reduce the size of your fragment on disk, but it   //    will significantly increase the memory needed by this routine   //    (it increases memory usage by the sum of the sizes of the packed   //    and unpacked data section).  See below for instructions on how to   //    create an unpacked data section.  //  // 2. fragToFixInitRoutine:  A pointer to your own code fragment's  //    fragment initialiser routine.  You necessarily have one of these   //    because you need it to get values for the fragToFixLocator and   //    fragToFixConnID parameters.  Just pass its address in as a parameter   //    as well.   //  // 3. weakLinkedLibraryName:  The name of the weak linked library which  //    failed to link.  You must have weak linked to this library.  //    It is oxymoric for you to pass a strong linked library here,  //    because your code would not have prepared if a strong linked  //    library failed to prepare, and so you couldn't supply a valid  ///   fragToFix.  //  // 4. lookup, refCon:  A pointer to a callback function that the   //    routine calls to look up the address of a symbol, and a refCon   //    for that callback routine.  //  // Note:  // The fragToFixLocator and fragToFixInitRoutine parameters  // are artifacts of the way in which this functionality is implemented.  // In an ideal world, where CFM exported decent introspection APIs  // to third party developers, these parameters would not be necessary.  // If you're using this code inside Apple, you probably should investigate  // using the CFM private APIs for getting at the information these  // parameters are needed for.  See the comments inside the implementation  // for more details.  //  // Note:  // The extra memory taken when you use a packed data section is also an   // artifact of my workaround for the lack of CFM introspection APIs.  In   // my opinion it's better to use an unpacked data section and consume more   // space on disk while saving memory.  In CodeWarrior you can switch to an   // unpacked data section by checking the &quot;Expand Uninitialized Data&quot;   // checkbox in the &quot;PPC PEF&quot; settings panel.  In MPW, specified the  // &quot;-packdata off&quot; option to PPCLink.  //  // When the routine returns, any symbols that you imported from the  // library named weakLinkedLibraryName will be resolved to the address  // of the symbol provided by the &quot;lookup&quot; callback routine.  //  // It is possible for an unresolved import to remain unresolved after  // this routine returns.  If the symbol import is marked as weak (as  // opposed to the library, which *must* be marked as weak) and the symbol  // is not found by the &quot;lookup&quot; callback, the routine will simple skip   // that symbol.  If the symbol isn't marked as weak, the routine will fail   // in that case.  //  // Most of the possible error results are co-opted CFM errors.  These  // include:  //  // cfragFragmentFormatErr  -- The fragment to fix is is an unknown format.  // cfragNoSectionErr       -- Could not find the loader section in the fragment to fix.  // cfragNoLibraryErr       -- The fragment to fix is not weak linked to weakLinkedLibraryName.  // cfragFragmentUsageErr   -- The fragment to fix doesn't have a data section.  //                         -- The fragment to fix is strong linked to weakLinkedLibraryName.  //                         -- The fragment doesn't have an init routine.  // cfragFragmentCorruptErr -- Encountered an undefined relocation opcode.  // unimpErr                -- Encountered an unimplement relocation opcode.  The  //                            relocation engine only implements a subset of the CFM  //                            relocation opcodes, the subset most commonly used by  //                            MPW and CodeWarrior PEF containers.  If you encounter  //                            this error, you'll probably have to add the weird  //                            relocation opcode to the engine, which shouldn't be  //                            be too hard.  // memFullErr         -- It's likely that this error is triggered by the memory   //                            needed to unpack your data section.  Either make your   //                            data section smaller, or unpack it (see above).  // errors returned by FindSymbol  // errors returned by Memory Manager  //  // The routine needs enough memory to hold the loader section of the fragment  // to fix in memory.  It allocates that memory using NewPtr and dispsoses of   // it before it returns.
