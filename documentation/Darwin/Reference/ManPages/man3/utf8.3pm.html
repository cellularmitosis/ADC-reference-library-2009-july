<b>NAME</b>
       utf8 - Perl pragma to enable/disable UTF-8 (or UTF-EBCDIC) in source code

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
           use utf8;
           no utf8;

           # Convert a Perl scalar to/from UTF-8.
           $num_octets = utf8::upgrade($string);
           $success    = utf8::downgrade($string[, FAIL_OK]);

           # Change the native bytes of a Perl scalar to/from UTF-8 bytes.
           utf8::encode($string);
           utf8::decode($string);

           $flag = utf8::is_utf8(STRING); # since Perl 5.8.1
           $flag = utf8::valid(STRING);

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The "use utf8" pragma tells the Perl parser to allow UTF-8 in the program text in the current lexical
       scope (allow UTF-EBCDIC on EBCDIC based platforms).  The "no utf8" pragma tells Perl to switch back
       to treating the source text as literal bytes in the current lexical scope.

       This pragma is primarily a compatibility device.  Perl versions earlier than 5.6 allowed arbitrary
       bytes in source code, whereas in future we would like to standardize on the UTF-8 encoding for source
       text.

       <b>Do</b> <b>not</b> <b>use</b> <b>this</b> <b>pragma</b> <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>than</b> <b>telling</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>script</b> <b>is</b> <b>written</b> <b>in</b> <b>UTF-8.</b> The
       utility functions described below are useful for their own purposes, but they are not really part of
       the "pragmatic" effect.

       Until UTF-8 becomes the default format for source text, either this pragma or the encoding pragma
       should be used to recognize UTF-8 in the source.  When UTF-8 becomes the standard source format, this
       pragma will effectively become a no-op.  For convenience in what follows the term <u>UTF-X</u> is used to
       refer to UTF-8 on ASCII and ISO Latin based platforms and UTF-EBCDIC on EBCDIC based platforms.

       See also the effects of the "-C" switch and its cousin, the $ENV{PERL_UNICODE}, in perlrun.

       Enabling the "utf8" pragma has the following effect:

          Bytes in the source text that have their high-bit set will be treated as being part of a literal
           UTF-8 character.  This includes most literals such as identifier names, string constants, and
           constant regular expression patterns.

           On EBCDIC platforms characters in the Latin 1 character set are treated as being part of a lit-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">eral&nbsp;literal</font>
           eral UTF-EBCDIC character.

       Note that if you have bytes with the eighth bit on in your script (for example embedded Latin-1 in
       your string literals), "use utf8" will be unhappy since the bytes are most probably not well-formed
       UTF-8.  If you want to have such bytes and use utf8, you can disable utf8 until the end the block (or
       file, if at top level) by "no utf8;".

       If you want to automatically upgrade your 8-bit legacy bytes to UTF-8, use the encoding pragma
       instead of this pragma.  For example, if you want to implicitly upgrade your ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1)
       bytes to UTF-8 as used in e.g. "chr()" and "\x{...}", try this:

           use encoding "latin-1";
           my $c = chr(0xc4);
           my $x = "\x{c5}";

       In case you are wondering: yes, "use encoding 'utf8';" works much the same as "use utf8;".

       <b>Utility</b> <b>functions</b>

       The following functions are defined in the "utf8::" package by the Perl core.  You do not need to say
       "use utf8" to use these and in fact you should not say that  unless you really want to have UTF-8
       source code.

       * $num_octets = utf8::upgrade($string)
           Converts in-place the octet sequence in the native encoding (Latin-1 or EBCDIC) to the equivalent
           character sequence in <u>UTF-X</u>.  <u>$string</u> already encoded as characters does no harm.  Returns the
           number of octets necessary to represent the string as <u>UTF-X</u>.  Can be used to make sure that the
           UTF-8 flag is on, so that "\w" or "lc()" work as Unicode on strings containing characters in the
           range 0x80-0xFF (on ASCII and derivatives).

           <b>Note</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>function</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>handle</b> <b>arbitrary</b> <b>encodings.</b>  Therefore <u>Encode.pm</u> is recommended
           for the general purposes.

           Affected by the encoding pragma.

       * $success = utf8::downgrade($string[, FAIL_OK])
           Converts in-place the character sequence in <u>UTF-X</u> to the equivalent octet sequence in the native
           encoding (Latin-1 or EBCDIC).  <u>$string</u> already encoded as octets does no harm.  Returns true on
           success. On failure dies or, if the value of "FAIL_OK" is true, returns false.  Can be used to
           make sure that the UTF-8 flag is off, e.g. when you want to make sure that the <u>substr()</u> or
           <u>length()</u> function works with the usually faster byte algorithm.

           <b>Note</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>function</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>handle</b> <b>arbitrary</b> <b>encodings.</b>  Therefore <u>Encode.pm</u> is recommended
           for the general purposes.

           <b>Not</b> affected by the encoding pragma.

           <b>NOTE:</b> this function is experimental and may change or be removed without notice.

       * utf8::encode($string)
           Converts in-place the character sequence to the corresponding octet sequence in <u>UTF-X</u>.  The UTF-8
           flag is turned off.  Returns nothing.

           <b>Note</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>function</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>handle</b> <b>arbitrary</b> <b>encodings.</b>  Therefore <u>Encode.pm</u> is recommended
           for the general purposes.

       * utf8::decode($string)
           Attempts to convert in-place the octet sequence in <u>UTF-X</u> to the corresponding character sequence.
           The UTF-8 flag is turned on only if the source string contains multiple-byte <u>UTF-X</u> characters.
           If <u>$string</u> is invalid as <u>UTF-X</u>, returns false; otherwise returns true.

           <b>Note</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>function</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>handle</b> <b>arbitrary</b> <b>encodings.</b>  Therefore <u>Encode.pm</u> is recommended
           for the general purposes.

           <b>NOTE:</b> this function is experimental and may change or be removed without notice.

       * $flag = utf8::is_utf8(STRING)
           (Since Perl 5.8.1)  Test whether STRING is in UTF-8.  Functionally the same as <u>Encode::is</u><b>_</b><u>utf8()</u>.

       * $flag = utf8::valid(STRING)
           [INTERNAL] Test whether STRING is in a consistent state regarding UTF-8.  Will return true is
           well-formed UTF-8 and has the UTF-8 flag on <b>or</b> if string is held as bytes (both these states are
           'consistent').  Main reason for this routine is to allow Perl's testsuite to check that opera-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tions&nbsp;operations</font>
           tions have left strings in a consistent state.  You most probably want to use <u>utf8::is</u><b>_</b><u>utf8()</u>
           instead.

       "utf8::encode" is like "utf8::upgrade", but the UTF8 flag is cleared.  See perlunicode for more on
       the UTF8 flag and the C API functions "sv_utf8_upgrade", "sv_utf8_downgrade", "sv_utf8_encode", and
       "sv_utf8_decode", which are wrapped by the Perl functions "utf8::upgrade", "utf8::downgrade",
       "utf8::encode" and "utf8::decode".  Note that in the Perl 5.8.0 and 5.8.1 implementation the func-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tions&nbsp;functions</font>
       tions utf8::is_utf8, utf8::valid, utf8::encode, utf8::decode, utf8::upgrade, and utf8::downgrade are
       always available, without a "require utf8" statement-- this may change in future releases.

<b>BUGS</b>
       One can have Unicode in identifier names, but not in package/class or subroutine names.  While some
       limited functionality towards this does exist as of Perl 5.8.0, that is more accidental than
       designed; use of Unicode for the said purposes is unsupported.

       One reason of this unfinishedness is its (currently) inherent unportability: since both package names
       and subroutine names may need to be mapped to file and directory names, the Unicode capability of the
       filesystem becomes important-- and there unfortunately aren't portable answers.
