About QTEffectsDialog - Cocoa8/15/03This sample demonstrates how to display the standard effects parameters dialog box in a Cocoa application. First call QTGetEffectsList to get a QT atom container holding a list of the currently installed effects components. Then pass this container to QTCreateStandardParameterDialog to actually create the dialog. Next, pass a few null events to QTIsStandardParameterDialogEvent to make sure initialization of the dialog is complete. Finally, use the Carbon ModalDialog function to handle events in the dialog.
