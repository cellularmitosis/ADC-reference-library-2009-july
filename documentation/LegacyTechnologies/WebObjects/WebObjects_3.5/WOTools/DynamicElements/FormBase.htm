<h1> Creating Form-Based Dynamic Elements</h1>

</a><a name="6408">

In HTML, a form is a container element (one that can contain other elements). Typically, forms contain input elements (such as text fields, radio buttons and checkboxes) to capture user information, a button or active image to submit the form data, as well as display elements such as text and images. <p>

</a><a name="12644">

In WebObjects Builder, you create form elements by clicking one of the buttons in the Form Elements portion of the switchable toolbar (or using their menu equivalents).<p>

</a><a name="12692">

All the form elements you create in the toolbar are dynamic equivalents of standard HTML elements.<em> </em>You can convert any dynamic form element to its static equivalent (and vice versa) by using the Inspector (see <a href="Inspctrs.htm#9978">"Dynamic and Static Inspectors"</a>).<p>

</a><a name="10512">

If you add form elements without creating a WOForm first (for example, if you add a text field to an empty page, or if you add form elements outside of the form) WebObjects Builder assumes you want to create a new form and places a &lt;FORM&gt; tag before and a &lt;/FORM&gt; tag after the element.<p>

</a><a name="8928">

Most form elements have a <strong>value</strong> attribute that represents the information entered by the user. You bind this attribute to a variable so that your application can work with it. Others, such as WOSubmitButton, WOImageButton, or WOForm itself, don't receive information but contain an <strong>action</strong> attribute representing an action to be taken when the form is submitted. You bind form-based elements by the process described in <a href="Binding.htm#6549">"Binding Elements"</a>.<p>

</a><a name="6419">

<strong>Tip:</strong><strong> </strong>HTML forms don't allow you to have multiple submit buttons in a single form, but the WebObjects WOForm element does. If you want multiple submit buttons in a form, bind the <strong>multiplesubmit</strong> attribute of WOForm to the value YES (by typing it in the Inspector).<p>
