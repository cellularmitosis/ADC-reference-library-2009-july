However, particularly on the Mac OS, there are some situations where this cannot be guaranteed for the duration (until the <TT>mySetGWorld.reset()</TT> method is called).</P><P CLASS="T1-Text1"><A NAME="pgfId-29897"></A>Thus, a <TT>QDDrawer</TT> interface in the <TT>quicktime.qd</TT> package and <TT>QDGraphics.beginDraw (QDDrawer d)</TT> call has been added to <TT>QDGraphics</TT>. The port and device will remain set for the duration of the <TT>QDDrawer.draw</TT> call that is called by this begin draw method. In those recording operations, you must use this method to ensure correct and expected behaviour.</P><P CLASS="T1-Text1"><A NAME="pgfId-29899"></A>For other operations where your code is doing a great deal of drawing on a given <TT>QDGraphics</TT>, this can also be an efficient way of doing this, as the global context of port and device remains set for the duration of this call. The <TT>createPict</TT> sample code in the QuickTime for Java SDK contains an example usage of this call.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><B>Note:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B><A NAME="pgfId-29900"></A>There is also an export call on the <TT>QTImageDrawer</TT> class, owing to recent developer feedback about translating a <TT>java.awt.Image</TT> to some kind of QT image (like a PICT). This method is provided as a means to accomplish this. </P></BLOCKQUOTE><hr>&#169; 2000 Apple Computer, Inc.<!-- QTnavbar start --><P><I>Inside Macintosh: QuickTime Reference</I><P>| <A HREF="QT41WhatsNew-103.html">Previous</A> | <A HREF="QT41WhatsNew-1.html">Chapter Contents</A> | <A HREF="QT41WhatsNew.html">Chapter Top</A> | <A HREF="QT41WhatsNew-105.html">Next</A> |</P><!-- QTnavbar end --><!-- start of footer --><!--#include virtual="/includes/framesetfooter" --><!-- end of footer --></BODY></HTML>
