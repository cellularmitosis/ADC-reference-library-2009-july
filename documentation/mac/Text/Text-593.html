In inline input, entry and conversion of characters take place at the current line position--where the converted text is intended to appear--rather than in a separate window. Inline input is the principal example of the kind of text service supported by the Text Services Manager.<P>
 <B>input method  </B>A software facility for 2-byte script systems that converts phonetic or syllabic characters, entered from a keyboard, into ideographic or other complex representations of text. Because 2-byte script systems have too many characters to be entered directly from a keyboard, the input method uses a conversion technique, such as translating sequences of phonetic characters that are typed into a special input window. For example, the Japanese script system provides software for transcribing Kana (phonetic Japanese) into ideographic Kanji.<P>
 <B>insertion mode</B>  For a dictionary, the manner in which insertion of a new record occurs--for example, whether its data adds to or replaces data of an existing matching key.<P>

 <B>transliteration  </B>For the Macintosh script management system, the conversion of characters that are phonetic representations of the same sound sequence between subscripts within a script. In the Roman script system, this means case conversion. For Japanese, Chinese, and Korean, transliteration refers to the conversion, without linguistic or semantic considerations, of characters from one subscript to another subscript within a script. Examples include the transliteration of Japanese Hiragana to Katakana, and the transliteration of Korean Jamo to Hangul.<P>
 <B>transliteration resource  </B>An international resource of type <CODE>'trsl'</CODE>. The transliteration resource provides rules for converting text phonetically from one subscript to another within a script system. The transliteration resource is optional; it is used only by 2-byte script systems.<P>
 <CODE>'trsl'<B> resource  </B></CODE>See <B>transliteration resource</B>. See also <B>international resources.</B><P>
 <B>TSM-aware application  </B>An application that makes calls to the Text Services Manager. A TSM-aware application can use a variety of text services such as inline input.<P>
 <B>TSM document  </B>A private data structure maintained by the Text Services Manager that relates one or more text service components to a particular application window.<P>
 <B>2-byte extension  </B>See <B>WorldScript II.</B><P>
 <B>2-byte script system  </B>A script system that supports a writing system with a large character set (requires 2-byte characters) and requires sophisticated procedures for character input. Japanese, Chinese, and Korean are examples of 2-byte script systems.<P>
 <B>Unicode  </B>A standard for a universal character set now under development. Unicode assigns two bytes per character code, and includes all the characters of all the world's major writing systems in one character set.<P>
 <B>unidirectional text  </B>A sequence of text that <BR>has a single direction. Compare <B>mixed-directional text.</B><P>
 <B>universal script  </B>A 1-byte complex script system that is compatible with WorldScript I.<P>
 <B>untoken table  </B>A table in the tokens resource that converts script-independent tokens to text of a given script system.<P>
 <B>user dictionary  </B>Also called an <I>editable dictionary</I>. A file, complementary to the <B>main dictionary</B> used by input methods, in which users can add information that does not exist in the main dictionary.<P>
 <B>verb  </B>See <B>selector.</B><P>
 <B>view rectangle  </B>In TextEdit, the rectangle defining the portion of the window within which text is actually displayed. Text drawn in the <B>destination rectangle</B> is made visible to the application user in the view rectangle.<P>
 <B>virtual key code  </B>The key code that an application receives in keyboard events. It is the value produced after a <B>raw key code</B> has been mapped through the key-map (<CODE>'KMAP'</CODE>) and key-remap (<CODE>'itlk'</CODE>) resources.<P>
 <B>western numerals  </B>For the Macintosh script management system, the numerical symbols 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 0. Sometimes known as <I>Arabic numerals,</I> but not to be confused with the numerals native to the Arabic writing system. <P>
 <B>word wrap  </B>See <B>line breaking.</B><P>
 <B>WorldScript I  </B>A script extension used for all 1-byte complex script systems. Code in the extension reads tables in the script system's international resources in order to provide the proper text manipulation and formatting for that script. Simple 1-byte script systems do not need to use WorldScript I.<P>
 <B>WorldScript II  </B>A script extension used for all 2-byte script systems. Code in the extension reads tables in the script system's international resources in order to provide the proper text manipulation and formatting for that script.<P>
 <B>writing system  </B>A set of characters and the basic rules for their use in creating a visual depiction of language. Writing systems may differ in the direction in which their characters and lines run, the size of the character set used, and the context sensitivity of character selection. Writing systems include Roman, Japanese, Arabic, and Hebrew. Compare <B>script system.</B> See also <B>language, region.</B><P>
 <B>x-height  </B>The height of a lowercase <I>x</I> in a given font. It is the height, measured from the base line, of the main portion of most lowercase letters (excluding ascenders and descenders). See also <B>ascent line, base line, descent line.</B> <P>
 <B>Zhuyinfuhao  </B>Chinese phonetic characters. Also called <B>Bopomofo.</B><P>
