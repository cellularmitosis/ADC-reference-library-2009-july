/*------------------------------------------------------------------------------##	Apple Macintosh Developer Technical Support##	CLUTSample##	CLUTSample.h	-	Rez and C Include Source###   Loosely based in the sample SAMPLE this program shows#   how to create a window and display on it the colors of the CLUT#	associated with the device the window sits on top of.##	Left to the curious reader are some improvements such as, remembering the#	positions of each open window, so if you use this program to monitor your#	color tables it will position the windows in the last place you opened them.#	The treatment of direct devices is kind of 'casual' a better color display may #	be appropriate. Last, it may be desireable to change the size of the color#	rectangles depending on the depth of the color table.#	Check Sample sources for more detailed documentation.#	Copyright © 1989 Apple Computer, Inc.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/#define kMinSize	23				/* application's minimum size (in K) *//*	We made the preferred size bigger than the minimum size by 12K, so that	there would be even more room for the scrap, FKEYs, etc. */#define kPrefSize	35				/* application's preferred size (in K) */#define	rMenuBar	128				/* application's menu bar */#define	rAboutAlert	128				/* about alert */#define	rUserAlert	129				/* error user alert */#define	rWindow		128				/* application's window *//* kSysEnvironsVersion is passed to SysEnvirons to tell it which version of the   SysEnvRec we understand. */#define	kSysEnvironsVersion		1/* kOSEvent is the event number of the suspend/resume and mouse-moved events sent   by MultiFinder.
