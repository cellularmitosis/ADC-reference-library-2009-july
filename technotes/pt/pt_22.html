To aid in this concept, a third-party company wascontracted to write a speech synthesizer which would allow the Macintoshcomputer to introduce itself.  The contract was signed, and the work begun.</p><p>The outcome of this work was MacinTalk.  MacinTalk is a file that can be placedinto the System Folder of an ordinary Macintosh computer and allow text to betransformed into speech for the introduction in 1984.  It was felt to be aninteresting piece of software, so Apple made it available to developers.Interfaces to MacinTalk were published and Apple Software Licensing allowed itto be included with developers' products.</p><p>The original project was to get a speech driver for the Macintosh, but it didnot include obtaining the source code to this driver.  Apple only has exactlywhat it gives to developers:  a file to be copied into the System Folder, andthis file cannot be changed since Apple does not have the source code.</p><p>MacinTalk works by using a VBL task to write data directly to the soundhardware of the Macintosh Plus and SE logic boards--a method which Apple doesnot support.  It has only been through the efforts of the Sound Manager thatsoftware that writes directly to this sound hardware continues to work.MacinTalk continues to write to the hardware addresses of the Macintosh 128Klogic board, but the Sound Manager and the Apple Sound Chip work together toallow programs like MacinTalk to continue working on newer machines.  The SoundManager and the Apple Sound Chip were introduced with the Macintosh II.</p><p>The Sound Manager watches the hardware addresses that used to be present on theMacintosh.  When the Sound Manager detects activity at one of these addresses,it goes into a "compatibility" mode.  In this mode, it routes the data to thereal sound hardware, but while this is happening, proper Sound Manager codecannot run--even the Sound Manager's <code>_SysBeep</code> does not work whenMacinTalk is in use.  Furthermore, the compatibility mode cannot be turned offuntil the application requiring it calls <code>_ExitToShell</code>.  Even anapplication that uses sound properly, with correct code, does not work ifanother application opens the MacinTalk driver.  There are <b>no</b> solutionsto this incompatibility.  MultiFinder and System 7.0 allow more than oneapplication to run concurrently, so it is possible for an older applicationwhich uses MacinTalk to limit the features and abilities of a new and improvedapplication.Around the time of the Macintosh II introduction, Apple made asingle hack to MacinTalk to remove self-modifying code which caused a problemfor 68020-based machines.  This modified version, known as 1.31, was availablefrom APDA with the warning that "Apple does not provide any support forMacinTalk.  Not even to Apple Certified Developers."  While this warning isstill true and APDA continues to sell MacinTalk 1.31 as a "Class 3" product,the official Apple position about it is:  "Apple Computer, Inc. does notrecommend that you use Class 3 products for developing commercialsoftware--they are intended for your personal enjoyment only."</p><p>In other words, if you find MacinTalk interesting and entertaining--go aheadand purchase it.  Write some code and enjoy.  However, be warned that MacinTalkshould <b>not</b> be included as part of <b>any</b> commercial product.  AppleComputer, Inc. provides no support for MacinTalk other than what is purchasedwith the package itself, and there will be no support in the future.  Apple iscommitted to providing the developer community with an array of speechtechnologies integrated with the Sound Manager.  In preparation for certainsystem software changes, such as System 7.0, Apple does not recommend thecontinued use of the existing MacinTalk package.</p><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></p><a name="Section2"></a><h2>The Surgeon General Warning</h2><p>The development of MacinTalk ended with the introduction of the Macintosh in1984.  Nothing more will be done to this product.  It is a compatibility riskto use MacinTalk.  It causes the Sound Manager to fail.  It will <b>not</b>work with the new Sound Manager planned for System 7.0.  This system revisionwill also introduce the new feature of virtual memory; it is not expected thatMacinTalk will work while the user has Virtual Memory running.  It may not workat all with future versions of the Macintosh hardware.  Continued use ofMacinTalk is a major compatibility risk.  Do not operate heavy machinery whileunder the influence of this product.</p><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></p><a name="References"></a><h2>References</h2><P><i>Inside Macintosh</i>, Volume V, Compatibility Guidelines</p><P><i>The Sound Manager,</i> Interim Chapter (DTS)</p><P><A HREF = "../tb/tb_03.html">M.TB.ClicklessSound</a></p>         <a name=Downloads></A>                  <P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></p><h2>Downloadables</H2>                  <TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <td width=50 align=left>                  <P ALIGN=center><img src="images/acrobatsmall.gif" width=22 height=23 align=middle alt="Acrobat gif"></P>               </TD>               <td align="left">                  <P>Acrobat version of this Note (K).</P>               </TD>               <td width=60 align=left>                  <P><A HREF="pdf/pt_22.pdf">Download</A></P>               </TD>            </TR>                    </TABLE>         <BR></TD></TR></table></center><!-- begin_footer_information -->	<table width="680" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
