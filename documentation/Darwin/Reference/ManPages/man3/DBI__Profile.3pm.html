DBI::Profile(3)                      User Contributed Perl Documentation                     DBI::Profile(3)



<b>NAME</b>
       DBI::Profile - Performance profiling and benchmarking for the DBI

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       The easiest way to enable DBI profiling is to set the DBI_PROFILE environment variable to 2 and then
       run your code as usual:

         DBI_PROFILE=2 prog.pl

       This will profile your program and then output a textual summary grouped by query when the program
       exits.  You can also enable profiling by setting the Profile attribute of any DBI handle:

         $dbh-&gt;{Profile} = 2;

       Then the summary will be printed when the handle is destroyed.

       Many other values apart from are possible - see "ENABLING A PROFILE" below.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The DBI::Profile module provides a simple interface to collect and report performance and
       benchmarking data from the DBI.

       For a more elaborate interface, suitable for larger programs, see DBI::ProfileDumper and dbiprof.
       For Apache/mod_perl applications see DBI::ProfileDumper::Apache.

<b>OVERVIEW</b>
       Performance data collection for the DBI is built around several concepts which are important to
       understand clearly.

       Method Dispatch
           Every method call on a DBI handle passes through a single 'dispatch' function which manages all
           the common aspects of DBI method calls, such as handling the RaiseError attribute.

       Data Collection
           If profiling is enabled for a handle then the dispatch code takes a high-resolution timestamp
           soon after it is entered. Then, after calling the appropriate method and just before returning,
           it takes another high-resolution timestamp and calls a function to record the information.  That
           function is passed the two timestamps plus the DBI handle and the name of the method that was
           called.  That data about a single DBI method call is called a <u>profile</u> <u>sample</u>.

       Data Filtering
           If the method call was invoked by the DBI or by a driver then the call is ignored for profiling
           because the time spent will be accounted for by the original 'outermost' call for your code.

           For example, the calls that the <u>selectrow</u><b>_</b><u>arrayref()</u> method makes to <u>prepare()</u> and <u>execute()</u> etc.
           are not counted individually because the time spent in those methods is going to be allocated to
           the <u>selectrow</u><b>_</b><u>arrayref()</u> method when it returns. If this was not done then it would be very easy
           to double count time spent inside the DBI.

       Data Storage Tree
           The profile data is accumulated as 'leaves on a tree'. The 'path' through the branches of the
           tree to a particular leaf is determined dynamically for each sample.  This is a key feature of
           DBI profiliing.

           For each profiled method call the DBI walks along the Path and uses each value in the Path to
           step into and grow the Data tree.

           For example, if the Path is

             [ 'foo', 'bar', 'baz' ]

           then the new profile sample data will be <u>merged</u> into the tree at

             $h-&gt;{Profile}-&gt;{Data}-&gt;{foo}-&gt;{bar}-&gt;{baz}

           But it's not very useful to merge all the call data into one leaf node (except to get an overall
           'time spent inside the DBI' total).  It's more common to want the Path to include dynamic values
           such as the current statement text and/or the name of the method called to show what the time
           spent inside the DBI was for.

           The Path can contain some 'magic cookie' values that are automatically replaced by corresponding
           dynamic values when they're used. These magic cookies always start with a punctuation character.

           For example a value of '"!MethodName"' in the Path causes the corresponding entry in the Data to
           be the name of the method that was called.  For example, if the Path was:

             [ 'foo', '!MethodName', 'selectall_arrayref' ]

           and the <u>selectall</u><b>_</b><u>arrayref()</u> method was called, then the profile sample data for that call will
           be merged into the tree at:

             $h-&gt;{Profile}-&gt;{Data}-&gt;{foo}-&gt;{selectall_arrayref}-&gt;{bar}

       Profile Data
           Profile data is stored at the 'leaves' of the tree as references to an array of numeric values.
           For example:

             [
               106,                  # 0: count of samples at this node
               0.0312958955764771,   # 1: total duration
               0.000490069389343262, # 2: first duration
               0.000176072120666504, # 3: shortest duration
               0.00140702724456787,  # 4: longest duration
               1023115819.83019,     # 5: time of first sample
               1023115819.86576,     # 6: time of last sample
             ]

           After the first sample, later samples always update elements 0, 1, and 6, and may update 3 or 4
           depending on the duration of the sampled call.

<b>ENABLING</b> <b>A</b> <b>PROFILE</b>
       Profiling is enabled for a handle by assigning to the Profile attribute. For example:

         $h-&gt;{Profile} = DBI::Profile-&gt;new();

       The Profile attribute holds a blessed reference to a hash object that contains the profile data and
       attributes relating to it.

       The class the Profile object is blessed into is expected to provide at least a DESTROY method which
       will dump the profile data to the DBI trace file handle (STDERR by default).

       All these examples have the same effect as each other:

         $h-&gt;{Profile} = 0;
         $h-&gt;{Profile} = "/DBI::Profile";
         $h-&gt;{Profile} = DBI::Profile-&gt;new();
         $h-&gt;{Profile} = {};
         $h-&gt;{Profile} = { Path =&gt; [] };

       Similarly, these examples have the same effect as each other:

         $h-&gt;{Profile} = 6;
         $h-&gt;{Profile} = "6/DBI::Profile";
         $h-&gt;{Profile} = "!Statement:!MethodName/DBI::Profile";
         $h-&gt;{Profile} = { Path =&gt; [ '!Statement', '!MethodName' ] };

       If a non-blessed hash reference is given then the DBI::Profile module is automatically "require"'d
       and the reference is blessed into that class.

       If a string is given then it is processed like this:

           ($path, $module, $args) = split /\//, $string, 3

           @path = split /:/, $path
           @args = split /:/, $args

           eval "require $module" if $module
           $module ||= "DBI::Profile"

           $module-&gt;new( Path =&gt; \@Path, @args )

       So the first value is used to select the Path to be used (see below).  The second value, if present,
       is used as the name of a module which will be loaded and it's "new" method called. If not present it
       defaults to DBI::Profile. Any other values are passed as arguments to the "new" method. For example:
       ""2/DBIx::OtherProfile/Foo:42"".

       Numbers can be used as a shorthand way to enable common Path values.  The simplest way to explain how
       the values are interpreted is to show the code:

           push @Path, "DBI"           if $path_elem &amp; 0x01;
           push @Path, "!Statement"    if $path_elem &amp; 0x02;
           push @Path, "!MethodName"   if $path_elem &amp; 0x04;
           push @Path, "!MethodClass"  if $path_elem &amp; 0x08;
           push @Path, "!Caller2"      if $path_elem &amp; 0x10;

       So "2" is the same as "!Statement" and "6" (2+4) is the same as "!Statement:!Method".  Those are the
       two most commonly used values.  Using a negative number will reverse the path. Thus "-6" will group
       by method name then statement.

       The spliting and parsing of string values assigned to the Profile attribute may seem a little odd,
       but there's a good reason for it.  Remember that attributes can be embedded in the Data Source Name
       string which can be passed in to a script as a parameter. For example:

           dbi:DriverName(Profile=&gt;2):dbname
           dbi:DriverName(Profile=&gt;{Username}:!Statement/MyProfiler/Foo:42):dbname

       And also, if the "DBI_PROFILE" environment variable is set then The DBI arranges for every driver
       handle to share the same profile object. When perl exits a single profile summary will be generated
       that reflects (as nearly as practical) the total use of the DBI by the application.

<b>THE</b> <b>PROFILE</b> <b>OBJECT</b>
       The DBI core expects the Profile attribute value to be a hash reference and if the following values
       don't exist it will create them as needed:

       <b>Data</b>

       A reference to a hash containing the collected profile data.

       <b>Path</b>

       The Path value is a reference to an array. Each element controls the value to use at the
       corresponding level of the profile Data tree.

       The elements of Path array can be one of the following types:

       Special Constant
           <b>!Statement</b>

           Use the current Statement text. Typically that's the value of the Statement attribute for the
           handle the method was called with. Some methods, like <u>commit()</u> and <u>rollback()</u>, are unrelated to a
           particular statement. For those methods !Statement records an empty string.

           For statement handles this is always simply the string that was given to <u>prepare()</u> when the
           handle was created.  For database handles this is the statement that was last prepared or
           executed on that database handle. That can lead to a little 'fuzzyness' because, for example,
           calls to the <u>quote()</u> method to build a new statement will typically be associated with the
           previous statement. In practice this isn't a significant issue and the dynamic Path mechanism can
           be used to setup your own rules.

           <b>!MethodName</b>

           Use the name of the DBI method that the profile sample relates to.

           <b>!MethodClass</b>

           Use the fully qualified name of the DBI method, including the package, that the profile sample
           relates to. This shows you where the method was implemented. For example:

             'DBD::_::db::selectrow_arrayref' =&gt;
                 0.022902s
             'DBD::mysql::db::selectrow_arrayref' =&gt;
                 2.244521s / 99 = 0.022445s avg (first 0.022813s, min 0.022051s, max 0.028932s)

           The "DBD::_::db::selectrow_arrayref" shows that the driver has inherited the selectrow_arrayref
           method provided by the DBI.

           But you'll note that there is only one call to DBD::_::db::selectrow_arrayref but another 99 to
           DBD::mysql::db::selectrow_arrayref. Currently the first call Pern't record the true location.
           That may change.

           <b>!Caller</b>

           Use a string showing the filename and line number of the code calling the method.

           <b>!Caller2</b>

           Use a string showing the filename and line number of the code calling the method, as for !Caller,
           but also include filename and line number of the code that called that. Calls from DBI:: and
           DBD:: packages are skipped.

           <b>!File</b>

           Same as !Caller above except that only the filename is included, not the line number.

           <b>!File2</b>

           Same as !Caller2 above except that only the filenames are included, not the line number.

       Code Reference
           Not yet implemented.

           The subroutine is passed the DBI method name and the handle it was called on.  It should return a
           list of values to used at this point in the Path.  If it returns an empty list then the method
           call is not profiled.

       Attribute Specifier
           A string enclosed in braces, such as '"{Username}"', specifies that the current value of the
           corresponding database handle attribute should be used at that point in the Path.

       Other Values
           Any other values are stringified and used literally.

           (References, and values that begin with punctuation characters are reserved.)

       Only the first 100 elements in Path are used.

       If the value of Path is anything other than an array reference, it is treated as if it was:

               [ DBI::Profile::!Statement ]

<b>REPORTING</b>
       <b>Report</b> <b>Format</b>

       The current accumulated profile data can be formatted and output using

           print $h-&gt;{Profile}-&gt;format;

       To discard the profile data and start collecting fresh data you can do:

           $h-&gt;{Profile}-&gt;{Data} = undef;

       The default results format looks like this:

         DBI::Profile: 0.001015s 42.7% (5 calls) programname @ YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
         '' =&gt;
             0.000024s / 2 = 0.000012s avg (first 0.000015s, min 0.000009s, max 0.000015s)
         'SELECT mode,size,name FROM table' =&gt;
             0.000991s / 3 = 0.000330s avg (first 0.000678s, min 0.000009s, max 0.000678s)

       Which shows the total time spent inside the DBI, with a count of the total number of method calls and
       the name of the script being run, then a formated version of the profile data tree.

       If the results are being formated when the perl process is exiting (which is usually the case when
       the DBI_PROFILE environment variable is used) then the percentage of time the process spent inside
       the DBI is also shown. If the process is not exiting then the percentage is calculated using the time
       between the first and last call to the DBI.

       In the example above the paths in the tree are only one level deep and use the Statement text as the
       value (that's the default behaviour).

       The merged profile data at the 'leaves' of the tree are presented as total time spent, count, average
       time spent (which is simply total time divided by the count), then the time spent on the first call,
       the time spent on the fastest call, and finally the time spent on the slowest call.

       The 'avg', 'first', 'min' and 'max' times are not particularly useful when the profile data path only
       contains the statement text.  Here's an extract of a more detailed example using both statement text
       and method name in the path:

         'SELECT mode,size,name FROM table' =&gt;
             'FETCH' =&gt;
                 0.000076s
             'fetchrow_hashref' =&gt;
                 0.036203s / 108 = 0.000335s avg (first 0.000490s, min 0.000152s, max 0.002786s)

       Here you can see the 'avg', 'first', 'min' and 'max' for the 108 calls to <u>fetchrow</u><b>_</b><u>hashref()</u> become
       rather more interesting.  Also the data for FETCH just shows a time value because it was only called
       once.

       Currently the profile data is output sorted by branch names. That may change in a later version so
       the leaf nodes are sorted by total time per leaf node.

       <b>Report</b> <b>Destination</b>

       The default method of reporting is for the DESTROY method of the Profile object to format the results
       and write them using:

           DBI-&gt;trace_msg($results, 0);  # see $ON_DESTROY_DUMP below

       to write them to the DBI <u>trace()</u> filehandle (which defaults to STDERR). To direct the DBI trace
       filehandle to write to a file without enabling tracing the <u>trace()</u> method can be called with a trace
       level of 0. For example:

           DBI-&gt;trace(0, $filename);

       The same effect can be achieved without changing the code by setting the "DBI_TRACE" environment
       variable to "0=filename".

       The $DBI::Profile::ON_DESTROY_DUMP variable holds a code ref that's called to perform the output of
       the formatted results.  The default value is:

         $ON_DESTROY_DUMP = sub { DBI-&gt;trace_msg($results, 0) };

       Apart from making it easy to send the dump elsewhere, it can also be useful as a simple way to
       disable dumping results.

<b>CHILD</b> <b>HANDLES</b>
       Child handles inherit a reference to the Profile attribute value of their parent.  So if profiling is
       enabled for a database handle then by default the statement handles created from it all contribute to
       the same merged profile data tree.

<b>CUSTOM</b> <b>DATA</b> <b>MANIPULATION</b>
       Recall that "$h-"{Profile}-&gt;{Data}&gt; is a reference to the collected data.  Either to a 'leaf' array
       (when the Path is empty, i.e., DBI_PROFILE env var is 1), or a reference to hash containing values
       that are either further hash references or leaf array references.

       Sometimes it's useful to be able to summarise some or all of the collected data.  The
       <u>dbi</u><b>_</b><u>profile</u><b>_</b><u>merge()</u> function can be used to merge leaf node values.

       <b>dbi_profile_merge</b>

         use DBI qw(dbi_profile_merge);

         $time_in_dbi = dbi_profile_merge(my $totals=[], @$leaves);

       Merges profile data node. Given a reference to a destination array, and zero or more references to
       profile data, merges the profile data into the destination array.  For example:

         $time_in_dbi = dbi_profile_merge(
             my $totals=[],
             [ 10, 0.51, 0.11, 0.01, 0.22, 1023110000, 1023110010 ],
             [ 15, 0.42, 0.12, 0.02, 0.23, 1023110005, 1023110009 ],
         );

       $totals will then contain

         [ 25, 0.93, 0.11, 0.01, 0.23, 1023110000, 1023110010 ]

       and $time_in_dbi will be 0.93;

       For example, to get the time spent 'inside' the DBI during an http request, your logging code run at
       the end of the request (i.e. mod_perl LogHandler) could use:

         my $time_in_dbi = 0;
         if (my $Profile = $dbh-&gt;{Profile}) { # if DBI profiling is enabled
             $time_in_dbi = dbi_profile_merge(my $total=[], $Profile-&gt;{Data});
             $Profile-&gt;{Data} = {}; # reset the profile data
         }

       If profiling has been enabled then $time_in_dbi will hold the time spent inside the DBI for that
       handle (and any other handles that share the same profile data) since the last request.

<b>CUSTOM</b> <b>DATA</b> <b>COLLECTION</b>
       <b>Using</b> <b>The</b> <b>Path</b> <b>Attribute</b>

         XXX example to be added later using a selectall_arrayref call
         XXX nested inside a fetch loop where the first column of the
         XXX outer loop is bound to the profile Path using
         XXX bind_column(1, \${ $dbh-&gt;{Profile}-&gt;{Path}-&gt;[0] })
         XXX so you end up with separate profiles for each loop
         XXX (patches welcome to add this to the docs :)

       <b>Adding</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Own</b> <b>Samples</b>

       The <u>dbi</u><b>_</b><u>profile()</u> function can be used to add extra sample data into the profile data tree. For
       example:

           use DBI;
           use DBI::Profile (dbi_profile dbi_time);

           my $t1 = dbi_time(); # floating point high-resolution time

           ... execute code you want to profile here ...

           my $t2 = dbi_time();
           dbi_profile($h, $statement, $method, $t1, $t2);

       The $h parameter is the handle the extra profile sample should be associated with. The $statement
       parameter is the string to use where the Path specifies !Statement. If $statement is undef then
       $h-&gt;{Statement} will be used. Similarly $method is the string to use if the Path specifies
       !MethodName. There is no default value for $method.

       The $h-&gt;{Profile}{Path} attribute is processed by <u>dbi</u><b>_</b><u>profile()</u> in the usual way.

       It is recommended that you keep these extra data samples separate from the DBI profile data samples
       by using values for $statement and $method that are distinct from any that are likely to appear in
       the profile data normally.

<b>SUBCLASSING</b>
       Alternate profile modules must subclass DBI::Profile to help ensure they work with future versions of
       the DBI.

<b>CAVEATS</b>
       Applications which generate many different statement strings (typically because they don't use
       placeholders) and profile with !Statement in the Path (the default) will consume memory in the
       Profile Data structure for each statement. Use a code ref in the Path to return an edited
       (simplified) form of the statement.

       If a method throws an exception itself (not via RaiseError) then it won't be counted in the profile.

       If a HandleError subroutine throws an exception (rather than returning 0 and letting RaiseError do
       it) then the method call won't be counted in the profile.

       Time spent in DESTROY is added to the profile of the parent handle.

       Time spent in DBI-&gt;*() methods is not counted. The time spent in the driver connect method,
       $drh-&gt;<u>connect()</u>, when it's called by DBI-&gt;connect is counted if the DBI_PROFILE environment variable
       is set.

       Time spent fetching tied variables, $DBI::errstr, is counted.

       Time spent in FETCH for $h-&gt;{Profile} is not counted, so getting the profile data doesn't alter it.

       DBI::PurePerl does not support profiling (though it could in theory).

       A few platforms don't support the <u>gettimeofday()</u> high resolution time function used by the DBI (and
       available via the <u>dbi</u><b>_</b><u>time()</u> function).  In which case you'll get integer resolution time which is
       mostly useless.

       On Windows platforms the <u>dbi</u><b>_</b><u>time()</u> function is limited to millisecond resolution. Which isn't
       sufficiently fine for our needs, but still much better than integer resolution. This limited
       resolution means that fast method calls will often register as taking 0 time. And timings in general
       will have much more 'jitter' depending on where within the 'current millisecond' the start and and
       timing was taken.

       This documentation could be more clear. Probably needs to be reordered to start with several examples
       and build from there.  Trying to explain the concepts first seems painful and to lead to just as many
       forward references.  (Patches welcome!)
