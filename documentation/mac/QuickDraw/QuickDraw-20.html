<H1><A NAME=MARKER-9-54></A>Using Basic QuickDraw</H1>
 To create a basic QuickDraw drawing environment, you generally<P>
<UL>
<LI>initialize QuickDraw
<LI>create one or more graphics ports--typically, by using the Window Manager or the <CODE>NewGWorld</CODE> function
<LI>set a current graphics port whenever your application has multiple graphics ports into which it can draw
<LI>use the coordinate system--local or global--appropriate for the QuickDraw or Macintosh Toolbox routine you wish to use next
<LI>move the document's bit image in relation to the port rectangle of the graphics port when scrolling through a document in a window<P>
</UL>
 These tasks are explained in greater detail in the rest of this chapter. After performing these tasks, your application can draw into the current graphics port, as described in the next chapter, "QuickDraw Drawing." <P>
 <A NAME=MARKER-2-181></A>System 7 added new features to basic QuickDraw that were not available in earlier versions of system software. In particular, System 7 added <P>
<UL>
<LI>the capability to work with the offscreen graphics worlds described in the chapter "Offscreen Graphics Worlds" 
<LI>support for the <CODE>OpenCPicture</CODE> function to create--and the ability to display--the extended version 2 pictures described in the chapter "Pictures" 
<LI>additional capabilities to the <CODE>CopyBits</CODE> procedure as described in the chapter "QuickDraw Drawing" 
<LI>support for the Color QuickDraw routines <CODE>RGBForeColor</CODE>, <CODE>RGBBackColor</CODE>, <CODE>GetForeColor</CODE>, and <CODE>GetBackColor</CODE> (which are described in the chapter "Color QuickDraw") 
<LI>support for the <CODE>DeviceLoop</CODE> procedure (described in the chapter "Graphics Devices" in this book), which provides your application with information about the current device's pixel depth and other attributes 
<LI>support for the Picture Utilities, as described in the chapter "Pictures" in this book (however, when collecting color information on a computer running only basic QuickDraw, the Picture Utilities return <CODE>NIL</CODE> instead of handles to <CODE>Palette</CODE> and <CODE>ColorTable</CODE> records)<P>
</UL>
 Before using these capabilities, you should make sure they are available by using the <CODE>Gestalt</CODE> function with the <CODE>gestaltSystemVersion</CODE> selector. Test the low-order word in the <CODE>response</CODE> parameter; if the value is $0700 or greater, then the System 7 features of basic QuickDraw are supported.<P>
 You can test whether a computer supports only basic QuickDraw with no <BR>Color QuickDraw support by using the <CODE>Gestalt</CODE> function with the selector <CODE>gestaltQuickDrawVersion</CODE>. The <CODE>Gestalt</CODE> function returns a 4-byte value in its <CODE>response</CODE> parameter; the low-order word contains QuickDraw version data. If <CODE>Gestalt</CODE> returns the value represented by the constant <CODE>gestaltOriginalQD</CODE>, then Color QuickDraw is not supported.<P>
 The <CODE>Gestalt</CODE> function is described in the chapter "Gestalt Manager" of <I><A HREF="../OSUtilities/OSUtilities-2.html">Inside Macintosh: Operating System Utilities</A></I>.<A NAME=MARKER-2-183></A><P>

The <CODE>InitGraf</CODE> procedure initializes both basic QuickDraw and, on computers that suppport it, Color QuickDraw.<P>

 When your application starts up, the Finder sets the cursor to a wristwatch; this indicates that a lengthy operation is in progress. See the chapter "Cursor Utilities" in this book for information about changing the cursor when appropriate.<A NAME=MARKER-2-185></A><P>

<H2>Creating Basic Graphics Ports</H2>
 <A NAME=MARKER-2-186></A><A NAME=MARKER-2-106></A>All graphics operations are performed in graphics ports. Before a basic graphics port can be used, it must be allocated and initialized with the <CODE>OpenPort</CODE> procedure. Normally, you don't call <CODE>OpenPort</CODE> yourself. In most cases your application draws into a window you've created with the <CODE>GetNewWindow</CODE> or <CODE>NewWindow</CODE> function (or, for color windows, <CODE>GetNewCWindow</CODE> or <CODE>NewCWindow</CODE>), or it draws into an offscreen graphics world created with the <CODE>NewGWorld</CODE> function. These Window Manager functions (described in the chapter "Window Manager" in <I><A HREF="../Toolbox/Toolbox-2.html">Inside Macintosh: Macintosh Toolbox Essentials</A></I>) and the <CODE>NewGWorld</CODE> function (described in the chapter "Offscreen Graphics Worlds" in this book) call <CODE>OpenPort</CODE> to create a basic graphics port. See the description of the <CODE>OpenPort</CODE> procedure on <A HREF=QuickDraw-32.html#MARKER-9-209>page 2-35</A> for a table of initial values for a basic graphics port.<P>
 <A HREF=#MARKER-9-62>Listing 2-2</A> shows a simplified application-defined procedure called <CODE>DoNew</CODE> that uses the Window Manager function <CODE>GetNewWindow</CODE> to create a basic graphics port for computers that do not support color. The <CODE>GetNewWindow</CODE> function returns a window pointer, which is defined to be a pointer to graphics port. <P>

   windStorage:   Ptr;  {memory for window record}
BEGIN
   window := NIL;
   {allocate memory for window record from previously allocated block}
   windStorage := MyPtrAllocationProc;
   IF windStorage &lt;&gt; NIL THEN {memory allocation succeeded}
   BEGIN
      IF gColorQDAvailable THEN {use Gestalt to determine color availability}
         window := GetNewCWindow(rDocWindow, windStorage, WindowPtr(-1))
      ELSE        {create a basic graphics port for a black-and-white screen}
         window := GetNewWindow(rDocWindow, windStorage, WindowPtr(-1));
   END;
   IF (window &lt;&gt; NIL) and (myData &lt;&gt; NIL) THEN
       SetPort(window);
END;
</PRE>
 You can allow <CODE>GetNewWindow</CODE> to allocate the memory for your window record and its associated basic graphics port. You can maintain more control over memory use, however, by allocating the memory yourself from a block allocated for such purposes during your own initialization routine, and then passing the pointer to <CODE>GetNewWindow</CODE>, as shown in <A HREF=#MARKER-9-62>Listing 2-2</A>. <P>
 When you call the <CODE>CloseWindow</CODE> or <CODE>DisposeWindow</CODE> procedure to close or dispose of a window, the Window Manager disposes of the graphics port's regions by calling the <CODE>ClosePort</CODE> procedure. If you use the <CODE>CloseWindow</CODE> procedure, you also dispose of the window record containing the graphics port by calling the Memory Manager procedure <CODE>DisposePtr</CODE>.<P>

<H2>Setting the Graphics Port</H2>

If your application draws into more than one graphics port, you can call <CODE>SetPort</CODE> to set the graphics port into which you want to draw. At times you may need to preserve the current graphics port. As shown in <BR><A HREF=#MARKER-9-69>Listing 2-3</A>, you can do this by calling the <CODE>GetPort</CODE> procedure to save the current graphics port, <CODE>SetPort</CODE> to set the graphics port you want to draw in, and then <CODE>SetPort</CODE> again when you need to restore the previous graphics port. (The procedures also work with color graphics ports.)<P>

<PRE>
PROCEDURE DrawInPort (thePort: GrafPtr);

   origPort: GrafPtr;

   DoDrawWindow(thePort);  {draw into the new port}
   SetPort(origPort);      {restore the original port}
END;
</PRE>
 In this example, the application calling <CODE>DrawInPort</CODE> may need to temporarily turn an inactive window into the current graphics port for updating purposes. After drawing into the inactive window, <CODE>DrawInPort</CODE> makes the user's active window the current graphics port again.<A NAME=MARKER-2-426></A><A NAME=MARKER-2-189></A><A NAME=MARKER-2-72></A><A NAME=MARKER-2-73></A><A NAME=MARKER-2-196></A><P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Note</B>
<DD>When your application runs in Color QuickDraw or uses offscreen graphics worlds, it should use the <CODE>GetGWorld</CODE> procedure instead of <CODE>GetPort</CODE>, and it should use the <CODE>SetGWorld</CODE> procedure instead of <CODE>SetPort</CODE>. These procedures save and restore the current graphics port for basic and color graphics ports as well as offscreen graphics worlds.

<H2>Switching Between Global and Local Coordinate Systems</H2>
 <A NAME=MARKER-2-436></A><A NAME=MARKER-2-190></A>Each graphics port has its own local coordinate system. Some Toolbox routines return or expect points that are expressed in the global coordinate system, while others use local coordinates. Sometimes you need to use the <CODE>GlobalToLocal</CODE> procedure to convert global coordinates to local coordinates, and sometimes you need the <CODE>LocalToGlobal</CODE> procedure for the reverse operation. For example, when the Event Manager function <CODE>WaitNextEvent</CODE> reports an event, it gives the cursor location (also called the <I>mouse location</I>) in global coordinates; but when you call the Control Manager function <CODE>FindControl</CODE> to find out whether the user clicked a control in one of your windows, you pass the cursor location in local coordinates, as shown in <A HREF=#MARKER-9-77>Listing 2-4</A>. (The Event Manager and the Control Manager are described in <I><A HREF="../Toolbox/Toolbox-2.html">Inside Macintosh: Macintosh Toolbox Essentials</A></I>.)<P>

<H2><A NAME=MARKER-9-78></A>Scrolling the Pixels in the Port Rectangle</H2>
 <A NAME=MARKER-2-129></A>If your application scrolls a document in a window, your application can use the <CODE>ScrollRect</CODE> procedure to shift the pixels currently displayed for that document, and then it can use the <CODE>SetOrigin</CODE> procedure to adjust the window's local coordinate system for drawing a new portion of the document inside the update region of the window. <P>
 Scrolling a document in response to the user's manipulation of a scroll bar requires you to use the Control Manager, the Window Manager, and the File Manager in addition to QuickDraw. The chapter "Control Manager" in <I><A HREF="../Toolbox/Toolbox-2.html">Inside Macintosh: Macintosh Toolbox Essentials</A></I> provides a thorough explanaticn of how to scroll through documents. An overview of the necessary tasks is provided here.<P>
 A window record contains a graphics port in its first field, and the Window Manager uses the port rectangle of the graphics port as the content area of the window. This allows you to use the QuickDraw routines <CODE>ScrollRect</CODE> and <CODE>SetOrigin</CODE>--which normally operate on the port rectangle of a graphics port--to manipulate the content area of the window.<P>
 <A NAME=MARKER-2-328></A>The left side of <A HREF=#MARKER-9-83>Figure 2-5</A> illustrates a case where the user has just opened an existing document, and the application displays the top of the document. In this example, the document consists of 35 lines of monospaced text, and the line height throughout is 10 pixels. Therefore, the document is 350 pixels long. The application stores the document in a document record of its own creation. This document record assigns its own coordinate system to the document. When the user first opens the document, the upper-left point of the graphics port's port rectangle (the window origin) is identical to the upper-left point of the document record's own coordinate system: both have a horizontal coordinate of 0 and a vertical coordinate of 0.<A NAME=MARKER-2-134></A><P>
 In this example, the content area--that is, the port rectangle--of the window displays 15 lines of text, which amount to 150 pixels.<P>
 Imagine that the user drags the scroll box part way down the vertical scroll bar. Because the user wishes to scroll down, the application must move the document up so that more of the bottom of the document shows. Moving a document <I>up</I> in response to a user request to scroll <I>down</I> requires a scrolling distance with a <I>negative</I> value. (Likewise, moving a document <I>down</I> in response to a user request to scroll <I>up</I> requires a scrolling distance with a <I>positive</I> value.)<P>
 Using the Control Manager functions <CODE>FindControl</CODE>, <CODE>TrackControl</CODE>, and <CODE>GetControlValue</CODE>, the application in this example determines that it must move the document up by 100 pixels--that is, by a scrolling distance of -100 pixels. <P>
 <A NAME=MARKER-2-131></A>The application uses the QuickDraw procedure <CODE>ScrollRect</CODE> to shift the pixels currently displayed in the port rectangle of the window by a distance of -100 pixels. This moves the portion of the document displayed in the window upward by 100 pixels (that is, by 10 lines); 5 lines that were previously displayed at the bottom of the window now appear at the top of the window, and the application adds the rest of the window to an update region for later updating.<P>
<B>Figure 2-5  <A NAME=MARKER-9-83></A>Moving a document relative to its window</B><P>
<IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "graphics/BASIC-L-06.jpg"><BR>
 The <CODE>ScrollRect</CODE> procedure doesn't change the coordinate system of the graphics port for the window; instead it moves the pixels in a specified rectangle (in this case, the port rectangle) to new coordinates that are still in the graphics port's local coordinate system. For purposes of updating the window, you can think of this as changing the coordinates used by the application's document record, as illustrated in the right side of <A HREF=#MARKER-9-83>Figure 2-5</A>.<P>
 The <CODE>ScrollRect</CODE> procedure takes four parameters: a rectangle to scroll, a horizontal distance to scroll, a vertical distance to scroll, and a region handle. Typically, when specifying the rectangle to scroll, your application passes a value representing the port rectangle (that is, the window's content region) minus the scroll bar regions, as shown in <A HREF=#MARKER-9-84>Listing 2-5</A>.<P>
<B>Listing 2-5  <A NAME=MARKER-9-84></A>Using <CODE>ScrollRect</CODE> to scroll the bits displayed in the window</B><P>
<PRE>
PROCEDURE DoGraphicsScroll (window: WindowPtr;
                            hDistance,vDistance: Integer);
VAR
   myScrollRect: Rect;
   updateRegion: RgnHandle;
BEGIN
   {initially, use the window's portRect as the rectangle to scroll:}
   myScrollRect := window^.portRect;
   {subtract vertical and horizontal scroll bars from rectangle}
   myScrollRect.right := myScrollRect.right - 15;
   myScrollRect.bottom := myScrollRect.bottom - 15;
   updateRegion := NewRgn;    {always initialize the update region}
   ScrollRect(myScrollRect, hDistance, vDistance, updateRegion);
   InvalRgn(updateRegion);
   DisposeRgn(updateRegion);
END; {of DoGraphicsScroll}
</PRE>
 The pixels that <CODE>ScrollRect</CODE> shifts outside of the rectangle specified by the <CODE>myScrollRect</CODE> variable are not drawn on the screen, and the bits they represent are not saved--it is your application's responsibility to keep track of this data.<P>
 The <CODE>ScrollRect</CODE> procedure shifts the image displayed inside the port rectangle by a distance of <CODE>hDistance</CODE> pixels horizontally and <CODE>vDistance</CODE> pixels vertically; when the <CODE>DoGraphicsScroll</CODE> procedure passes positive values in these parameters, <CODE>ScrollRect</CODE> shifts the pixels in <CODE>myScrollRect</CODE> to the right and down, respectively. This is appropriate when the user intends to scroll left or up because, when the application finishes updating the window, the user sees more of the left and top of the document, respectively. (Remember: to scroll up or left, move the pixels down or right, both of which are in the positive direction.)<P>
 When <CODE>DoGraphicsScroll</CODE> passes negative values in these parameters, <CODE>ScrollRect</CODE> shifts the pixels in <CODE>myScrollRect</CODE> to the left or up. This is appropriate when the user intends to scroll right or down because, when the application finishes updating the window, the user sees more of the right and the bottom of the document. (Remember: to scroll down or right, move the bit image up or left, both of which are in the negative direction.)<P>
 In <A HREF=#MARKER-9-83>Figure 2-5</A>, the application determines a vertical scrolling distance of -100, which it passes in the <CODE>vDistance</CODE> parameter as shown here:<P>
<PRE>
ScrollRect(myScrollRect, 0, -100, updateRegion);
</PRE>
 If, however, the user were to move the scroll box back to the beginning of the document at this point, the application would determine that it has a distance of 100 pixels to scroll up, and it would therefore pass a positive value of 100 in the <CODE>vDistance</CODE> parameter.<P>
 By creating an update region for the window, <CODE>ScrollRect</CODE> forces an update event. After using <CODE>ScrollRect</CODE> to move the bit image that already exists in the window, the application must use its own window-updating code to draw pixels in the update region of the window. (See the chapter "QuickDraw Drawing" in this book for information about drawing into a window.)<P>
 <A NAME=MARKER-2-97></A><A NAME=MARKER-2-136></A>As previously explained, <CODE>ScrollRect</CODE> in effect changes the coordinates of the application's document record relative to the local coordinates of the port rectangle. In terms of the graphics port's local coordinate system, the upper-left corner of the document now has a vertical coordinate of -100, as shown on the right side of <A HREF=#MARKER-9-83>Figure 2-5</A> on <A HREF=#MARKER-9-83>page 2-19</A>. To facilitate updating the window, the application uses the <CODE>SetOrigin</CODE> procedure to change the window origin of the port rectangle so that the application can treat the upper-left corner of the document as again having a local horizontal coordinate of 0 and a local vertical coordinate of 0.<A NAME=MARKER-2-135></A><P>
 The <CODE>SetOrigin</CODE> procedure takes two parameters: the first is a new horizontal coordinate for the upper-left corner of the port rectangle, and the second is a new vertical coordinate for the upper-left corner of the port rectangle. <P>
 Any time you are ready to update a window (for example, after scrolling it), you can use the Control Manager function <CODE>GetControlValue</CODE> to determine the current setting of the horizontal scroll bar, and you can pass this value to <CODE>SetOrigin</CODE> as the new horizontal coordinate for the window origin. Then use <CODE>GetControlValue</CODE> to determine the current setting of the vertical scroll bar. Pass this value to <CODE>SetOrigin</CODE> as the new vertical coordinate for the window origin. Using <CODE>SetOrigin</CODE> in this fashion lets you treat the upper-left corner of the document as always having a horizontal coordinate of 0 and a vertical coordinate of 0 when you update (that is, redraw) the document within a window.<P>
 For example, after the user manipulates the vertical scroll bar to move (either up or down) to a location 100 pixels from the top of the document, the application makes the following call:<P>
<PRE>
SetOrigin(0, 100);
</PRE>
 Although the scrolling distance in <A HREF=#MARKER-9-83>Figure 2-5</A> is -100, which is relative, the current setting for the scroll bar on the right side of the figure is now at 100. <P>
 <A NAME=MARKER-9-167></A>The left side of <A HREF=#MARKER-9-89>Figure 2-6</A> shows how the application uses the <CODE>SetOrigin</CODE> procedure to move the window origin so that the upper-left corner of the document now has a horizontal coordinate of 0 and a vertical coordinate of 0 in the graphics port's local coordinate system. This restores the coordinates that the application originally assigned to the document in its document record and makes it easier for the application to draw in the update region of the window.<P>
<B>Figure 2-6  <A NAME=MARKER-9-89></A>Updating the contents of a scrolled window</B><P>
<IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "graphics/BASIC-L-07.jpg"><BR>
 After restoring the document's original coordinates, the application updates the window, as shown on the right side of <A HREF=#MARKER-9-89>Figure 2-6</A>. The application draws lines 16 through 24, which it stores in its own document record as beginning at a vertical coordinate of 160 and ending at a vertical coordinate of 250.<A NAME=MARKER-2-90></A><P>
 To review what has happened up to this point: the user has dragged the scroll box down the vertical scroll bar; the application determines that this amounts to a scroll distance <BR>of -100 pixels; the application passes this distance to <CODE>ScrollRect</CODE>, which shifts the document displayed in the window upward by 100 pixels and creates an update region for the rest of the window; the application passes the vertical scroll bar's current setting (100 pixels) in a parameter to <CODE>SetOrigin</CODE> so that the upper-left corner of the document has a horizontal coordinate of 0 and a vertical coordinate of 0 in the local coordinate system of the graphics port; and, finally, the application draws the text in the update region of the window.<P>
 However, the window origin of the port rectangle cannot be left at the point with a horizontal value of 0 and a vertical value of 100; instead, the application must use <CODE>SetOrigin</CODE> to reset it to a horizontal coordinate of 0 and a vertical coordinate of 0 after performing its own drawing, because the Window Manager and Control Manager always assume the window's upper-left point has a horizontal coordinate of 0 and a vertical coordinate of 0 when they draw in a window. <A HREF=#MARKER-9-91>Figure 2-7</A> shows how the application uses <CODE>SetOrigin</CODE> to set the upper-left corner of the port rectangle back to a horizontal coordinate of 0 and a vertical coordinate of 0 at the conclusion of its window-updating routine.<P>
<B>Figure 2-7  <A NAME=MARKER-9-91></A>Restoring the window origin of the port rectangle to a horizontal coordinate of 0 and a vertical coordinate of 0</B><P>
<IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "graphics/BASIC-L-08.jpg"><BR>
 This example illustrates how to use <CODE>SetOrigin</CODE> to offset the port rectangle's coordinate system so that you can treat objects in a document as fixed in the document's own coordinate space. Alternatively, it's possible to leave the coordinate system for the graphics port fixed and instead offset the items in a document by the amount equal to the scroll bar settings. The <CODE>OffsetRect</CODE> and <CODE>OffsetRgn</CODE> procedures (which are described in the chapter "QuickDraw Drawing"), the <CODE>SubPt</CODE> procedure (described on <A HREF=QuickDraw-52.html#MARKER-9-311>page 2-49</A>), and the <CODE>AddPt</CODE> procedure (described on <A HREF=QuickDraw-51.html#MARKER-9-306>page 2-48</A>) are useful if you pursue this approach. However, it is recommended that you use <CODE>SetOrigin</CODE> instead.<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>IMPORTANT</B>
<DD>For optimal performance and future compatibility, you should use the <CODE>SetOrigin</CODE> procedure when reconciling document coordinate space with the local coordinate system of your graphics port.<EM></EM> <A NAME=MARKER-2-139></A>  <IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "graphics/triangle.gif">
</DL>
 The <CODE>SetOrigin</CODE> procedure does not move the window's clipping region. If you use clipping regions in your windows, use the <CODE>GetClip</CODE> procedure (described on <A HREF=QuickDraw-43.html#MARKER-9-266>page 2-44</A>) to store your clipping region immediately after your first call to <CODE>SetOrigin</CODE>. Before calling your own window-drawing routine, use the <CODE>ClipRect</CODE> procedure (described on <A HREF=QuickDraw-45.html#MARKER-9-279>page 2-45</A>) to define a new clipping region--to avoid drawing over your scroll bars, for example. (<A HREF=QuickDraw-60.html#MARKER-9-122>Listing 3-9 on page 3-25</A> in the chapter "QuickDraw Drawing" illustrates how to do this.) After calling your own window-drawing routine, use the <CODE>SetClip</CODE> procedure (described on <A HREF=QuickDraw-44.html#MARKER-9-274>page 2-44</A>) to restore the original clipping region. You can then call <CODE>SetOrigin</CODE> again to restore the window origin to a horizontal coordinate of 0 and a vertical coordinate of 0 with your original clipping region intact.<A NAME=MARKER-2-93></A> <A NAME=MARKER-9-12></A><P>
