<p>WebObjects recognizes the need for distributed,
three-tier application solutions with more complex, rich, and responsive
user interfaces than HTML allows. So, in addition to HTML-based
WebObjects applications, you can also write Java-based WebObjects
desktop applications that use Swing for the user interface. The
client part of these applications run as real desktop applications
in the client's Java virtual machine. This feature of WebObjects is
called Java Client.</p>
<p>WebObjects Java Client is a three-tier network application
solution that allows you to develop platform-agnostic desktop applications
with database access and rich user interfaces. Java Client applications
are WebObjects applications: They share much of their API with traditional
HTML-based WebObjects applications such as the Enterprise Object technology
for database access, the WebObjects framework for session management,
and the rule system, which enables rapid development and provides
a flexible rule-based approach to application development.</p><br><table border = "0" BGCOLOR="#E6E6E6">

<tr>
<td scope="row"><b>Note: </b>This
book describes WebObjects 5.1. Future versions of WebObjects may
include API and other changes that affect the tutorials, sample
code, and concepts described herein.</td>
</tr>

</table><br>
<p>This book introduces you to Java Client by first presenting
key concepts such as architecture, enterprise objects, client-server
communication, object distribution, the Model-View-Controller paradigm,
and rule-based application development. Then, you are led through
the development of simple yet practical tutorials that introduce
you to the WebObjects developer tools and the features of Java Client.
Finally, the book provides a number of task-specific chapters that
teach you how to add features to applications like access controls,
custom menu items, and sophisticated user interfaces.</p>
<p>There are two starting points in Java Client development&#151;the
Direct to Java Client project type and the Java Client project type.
This book teaches you how to build Java Client applications starting
with the Direct to Java Client approach. This approach reduces the amount
of code you need to write and lets you take advantage of some of
the best features of WebObjects such as the rule system and rule-based
rapid development. And you can easily integrate all aspects of the
nondirect approach (such as hand-built user interfaces) into the
direct approach for maximum flexibility.</p>
<p>Some of the customizations you'll perform in the tutorials&#151;such
as building user interfaces in Interface Builder&#151;teach you just
about everything you need to know to build strictly nondirect Java
Client applications. So if you're an experienced Java Client developer,
don't think that this book isn't for you. By learning how to
leverage the features of the Direct to Java Client approach, you'll
learn how to build better Java Client applications.</p>
