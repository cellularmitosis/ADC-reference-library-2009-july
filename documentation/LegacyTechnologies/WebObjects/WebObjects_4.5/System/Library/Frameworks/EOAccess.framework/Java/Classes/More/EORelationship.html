Each source-destinationpair of attributes is encapsulated in an EOJoin object. For example,to create a relationship from the Movie entity to the Studio entity,a join has to be created from the <b>studioId</b> attributeof the Movie entity to the same attribute of the Studio entity.The values of these two attributes must be equal for a match toresult. Note that <b>studioId</b> is the primarykey attribute for the Studio entity, so there can only be one studioper movie; this relationship is therefore to-one.</p><p>This code excerpt creates an EORelationship for the relationshipdescribed above and adds it to the EOEntity for the Movie entity:</p><blockquote><pre>EOEntity movieEntity;       // Assume this exists. EOEntity studioEntity;      // Assume this exists.EOAttribute studioIDAttribute;EOAttribute movieStudioIDAttribute;EOJoin toStudioJoin;EORelationship toStudioRelationship;    studioIDAttribute = studioEntity.attributeNamed("studioId");movieStudioIDAttribute = movieEntity.attributeNamed("studioId");	toStudioJoin = new EOJoin(movieStudioIDAttribute, studioIDAttribute);    toStudioRelationship = new EORelationship();toStudioRelationship.setName("studio");movieEntity.addRelationship(toStudioRelationship);toStudioRelationship.addJoin(toStudioJoin);toStudioRelationship.setToMany(false);toStudioRelationship.setJoinSemantic(EORelationship.InnerJoin);</pre></blockquote><br><p>This code first gets the attributes from the source and destinationentities, and then creates an EOJoin with them. Next, a new EORelationshipis created, its name is set, and it's added to <b>movieEntity</b>.The EOJoin is added to the relationship and the relationship isset to be to-one. Finally, in the <b>setJoinSemantic</b> line,  <a frame= "conv" href="../EORelationship.html#CHJIHGEA">InnerJoin</a> indicates that only objectsthat actually have a matching destination object will be includedin the result when the relationship is traversed. </p><p>Creating a to-many relationship in the opposite directionmerely swaps the source and destination attributes, and assignsthe relationship to the EOEntity for the Studio entity:</p><blockquote><pre>EOJoin toMoviesJoin;EORelationship toMoviesRelationship;toMoviesJoin = new EOJoin(studioIDAttribute, movieStudioIDAttribute);toMoviesRelationship = new EORelationship();toMoviesRelationship.setName("movies");studioEntity.addRelationship(toMoviesRelationship);toMoviesRelationship.addJoin(toMoviesJoin);toMoviesRelationship.setToMany(true);toMoviesRelationship.setJoinSemantic(EORelationship.InnerJoin);</pre></blockquote><br><p>Note that this relationship is to-many precisely because thedestination attribute isn't the primary key for its entity (Movie),and therefore isn't unique with regard to that entity.</p><p>A relationship isn't restricted to only one EOJoin. It'sentirely possible for a relationship to be defined based on twoor more attributes in the source and destination entities. For example,consider an employees database that contains a picture of each employeeidentified by first and last name. You'd define the relationshipby joining each of the first and last names in the Employee entityto the same attribute in the <b>EmpPhoto</b> attribute.</p><p>A simple relationship is considered to reference all of theattributes in its joins. You can use the  <a frame= "conv" href="../EORelationship.html#//apple_ref/java/instm/EORelationship/referencesProperty">referencesProperty</a> methodto find out if an EORelationship references a particular attribute.</p><br><a name = "CHJDAGED"><h2>Creating a Flattened Relationship</h2></a><p>A flattened relationship depends on several simple relationshipsalready existing. Assuming that several do exist, creating a flattenedrelationship is straightforward. For example, suppose that the Movieentity has a to-many relationship to the Director entity, called <b>toDirectors</b>.The Director entity in turn has a relationship to the Talent entitycalled <b>toTalent</b>. In the Movies database,the Director table acts as an intermediate table between Movie andTalent. In this situation, it make sense to flatten the relationshipMovies has to Director (<b>toDirectors</b>) togive Movie access to the Talent table through Director's <b>toTalent</b> relationship.For more discussion of when to use flattened relationships, seethe chapters "Designing Enterprise Objects" and "AdvancedEnterprise Object Modeling" in the <i>Enterprise ObjectsFramework Developer's Guide</i>.</p><p>This code excerpt creates a flattened relationship from Movieto Talent:</p><blockquote><pre>EOEntity movieEntity;   // Assume this exists.       EORelationship toDirectorsRelationship = new EORelationship();toDirectorsRelationship.setName("directors");toDirectorsRelationship.setEntity(movieEntity);movieEntity.addRelationship(toDirectorsRelationship);toDirectorsRelationship.setDefinition:("toDirector.toTalent");</pre></blockquote><br><p>All that's needed to establish the relationship is a datapath (also called the definition) naming each component relationshipconnected, with the names separated by periods. Note that becausethe cardinality of a flattened relationship is determinable fromits components, no  <a frame= "conv" href="../EORelationship.html#//apple_ref/java/instm/EORelationship/setToMany">setToMany</a> message is required here.</p><p>A simple relationship is considered to reference all of therelationships in its definition, plus every attribute referencedby the component relationships. You can use the  <a frame= "conv" href="../EORelationship.html#//apple_ref/java/instm/EORelationship/referencesProperty">referencesProperty</a> methodto find out if an EORelationship references another relationshipor attribute.</p><dd></dd><br><a href="../../EOAccessTOC.html"><img src="../../../../../../../images/up.gif" border="0" alt="Table of Contents"></a> </BODY></HTML>
