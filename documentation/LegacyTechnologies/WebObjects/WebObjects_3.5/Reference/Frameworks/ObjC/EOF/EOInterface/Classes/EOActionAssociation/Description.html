<p><h3>Class At a Glance:</h3>

<p><dl><dt><h4>Purpose</h4>

</dl>An EOActionAssociation displays no values, but instead sends a message to the objects selected in its EODisplayGroup when the display object, an NSControl or NSActionCell, sends its action.<p>

<dl><dt><h4>Usable With</h4>

</dl>Any NSControl or NSActionCell<p>

<dl><dt><h4>Aspects</h4>

</dl><dl><dt>action

<dl><dt>Bound to a key that names a method implemented by the objects. The method must take no arguments if the 

<B>argument </B> aspect isn't bound, one argument if it is.

</dl><dt>argument

<dl><dt>An object attribute or relationship of the selected object, passed as an argument to the action method. (Usually 

bound to a different EODisplayGroup than that bound to <B>action </B>.)

</dl><dt>enabled

<dl><dt>A boolean attribute of the selected object, which determines whether the display object is enabled.

</dl></dl><dl><dt><h4>Object Keys Taken</h4>

</dl><dl><dt>target

<dl><dt>On receiving an action message from the display object, an EOActionAssocation sends its action to the selected 

objects.

<h3>Class Description </h3>

</a>EOActionAssociation allows you to set up an interface object, such as a button, to send a message to the selected objects when it's acted on.<p>

<a name="72">

<h3> Examples</h3>

</a>Suppose you have an application that manages member accounts, each of which has a restriction on the outstanding balance allowed. Further, the Member class defines a <B>boostRestrictions </B> method that increases the limit by 20%. You can set up a button in the application to invoke this method by connecting it to the Member display group and binding the <B>action </B> aspect to the "boostRestrictions" key (which you add in Interface Builder).<p>

In another scenario, one EODisplayGroup shows Members, while another shows video tapes available for rent. Here, you can bind a button to the Members EODisplayGroup with the action <B>rentVideoTape: </B>. Similarly, you bind the VideoTape EODisplayGroup to the <B>argument </B> aspect. Now, when the user selects a Member and a VideoTape and clicks the button, the Member is sent a <B>rentVideoTape: </B> message with the VideoTape.<p>
