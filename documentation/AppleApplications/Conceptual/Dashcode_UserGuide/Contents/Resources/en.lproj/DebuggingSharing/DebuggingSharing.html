Dashcode includes its own Dashboard environment so you can run and test a widget in Dashcode without having to open it in Dashboard. Similarly, Dashcode includes a simulator application that mimics some of the features of iPhone and iPod touch, so you can easily test a web application.</p><p>In addition to running widgets and web applications, Dashcode also includes tools that help you debug and fix problems that may arise. This chapter includes information on how to trace events and inspect variable values while a widget or web application executes. It also includes information on sharing a widget and deploying a web application.</p>

<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004692-CH16-SW8" title="Testing a Widget or a Web Application"></a><h2>Testing a Widget or a Web Application</h2><p>To run a widget or a web application in Dashcode, choose Debug > Run or click Run in the toolbar. Depending on your project type, this has a different effect:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>For widgets, this runs the widget in Dashcode without having to open it in Dashboard. The widget behaves here as it would in Dashboard. </p></li><li class="li"><p>For web applications, this runs the web application in a simulator application without having to deploy it and run it in a device. The simulator allows your web application to behave as it would in a device.</p></li></ul><p>In addition, you have two options when testing a web application in Dashcode version 2.0.1 and later:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Run the web application with the Safari interface visible (that is, with the Safari toolbar and navigation bar visible). This simulates what users can see when they use Safari to navigate to your web application.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Run the web application with the Safari interface hidden (that is, in full-screen mode). This simulates what users can see when they tap a Web Clip icon to open a web application that can run in full-screen mode.</p></li></ul><p>You can access these options by clicking and holding the Run button in the Dashcode project window. From the menu that appears, choose “Run” or “Run Full-screen.” After you make your choice, clicking Run or choosing Debug > Run runs your web application in that mode until you change it.</p><p>When your widget or web application loads, test it out to see if it functions as you expect. When an error occurs, an <strong>exception</strong> is thrown and, by default, execution pauses. When this happens, there are a number of tools at your disposal that help you see where the problem is and inspect variable values:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>The run log lists errors and other useful information. If you enable tracing, the run log notes the invocation of functions as well. See <span class="content_text"><a href="DebuggingSharing.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004692-CH16-SW1">“The Run Log and Tracing Execution”</a></span> for details.</p></li><li class="li"><p>The Stackframe &amp; Variables table shows you the value of any variable a widget or web application uses. See <span class="content_text"><a href="DebuggingSharing.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004692-CH16-SW3">“Checking Values in Memory”</a></span> for details.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Step-by-step execution enables walking through the execution line-by-line so you can see the effects of the code. See <span class="content_text"><a href="DebuggingSharing.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004692-CH16-SW5">“Pausing and Step-by-Step Execution”</a></span> for details.</p></li><li class="li"><p>The Evaluator is a console where you enter individual lines of code to be executed immediately. See <span class="content_text"><a href="DebuggingSharing.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004692-CH16-SW4">“The Code Evaluator”</a></span> for details.</p></li></ul><p>To continue a paused widget or web application, choose Debug > Continue or click Continue in the toolbar. To turn off pausing when an exception occurs, deselect Debug > Break on Exceptions.</p><p>To pause a widget or web application at any time, choose Debug > Pause or click the pause button in the toolbar. While a widget or web application is paused, you can step through its code line-by-line as discussed in <span class="content_text"><a href="DebuggingSharing.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004692-CH16-SW5">“Pausing and Step-by-Step Execution.”</a></span> You can also pause a widget or web application when execution reaches a specific line of code using a breakpoint, as discussed in <span class="content_text"><a href="DebuggingSharing.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004692-CH16-SW6">“Breakpoints.”</a></span></p><p>To stop running a widget or web application in its testing environment, choose Debug > Stop or click Stop in the toolbar.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004692-CH16-SW1" title="The Run Log and Tracing Execution"></a><h2>The Run Log and Tracing Execution</h2><p>When you run a widget or web application in Dashcode, the canvas is replaced by the run log. Any errors that Dashcode encounters while running the widget or web application are reported here. For example, a call to a function that doesn’t exist appears in the run log as an “object that doesn’t allow calls.“</p><p>If the run log is replaced by another view, choose View > Run Log to show it. When possible, selecting a row in the run log reveals the associated line of code in the source code editor.</p><p>In addition to reporting errors, the run log can be used to trace execution of a widget or web application. Tracing means that an entry in the run log is made whenever a function starts and finishes. This is useful when you’re watching the flow of execution in a widget or web application.</p><p>When the run log is visible, you can filter the contents of the run log by typing a term into the search field in the toolbar.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004692-CH16-SW5" title="Pausing and Step-by-Step Execution"></a><h2>Pausing and Step-by-Step Execution</h2><p>At any time, you can pause the execution of a widget or web application. Pausing execution is useful if you want to inspect the values of variables. To pause, choose Debug > Pause or click Pause in the toolbar. When the widget or web application is paused, the run log is replaced with the Stackframe &amp; Variables table.</p><p>When the execution of a widget or web application is paused, you can inspect the values of the variables within the scope of the current function and the global scope. Also, the line of code that is paused is highlighted in the source code editor. In the shortcuts under the source code editor, you can see a hierarchy of functions that leads to the currently executing function. If you click another function name in the shortcuts, the function’s variables are shown in the Stackframes &amp; Variables table and its code is shown in the code editor. You can also search for a specific variable by typing its name into the search field in the toolbar.</p><p>When you’re finished examining variables, you can continue executing the widget or web application in a few different ways:</p><dl class="termdef">	<dt><strong>Continue</strong></dt><dd><p>Choose Debug > Continue or click Continue in the toolbar to continue execution with no interruption.</p></dd><dt><strong>Step Into</strong></dt><dd><p>Choose Debug > Step Into or click Step Into in the toolbar to execute the next line of code and step into function calls so you can see the effect that line of code has.</p></dd><dt><strong>Step Over</strong></dt><dd><p>Choose Debug > Step Over or click Step Over in the toolbar to execute the next line of code so you can see the effects that line of code has.</p></dd><dt><strong>Step to End</strong></dt><dd><p>Choose Debug > Step to End or click Step to End in the toolbar to execute the rest of the current function; execution pauses when the function is finished so that you can inspect its variables before they are relinquished.</p></dd></dl><p>Also, execution pauses whenever an exception occurs. When an exception occurs, the execution of a web application or widget is paused and an entry in the run log explains what the problem is. If you click the entry, the line of code in which the exception occurred is highlighted. By default, this option is enabled. You can control this option by choosing Debug > Break on Exceptions.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004692-CH16-SW3" title="Checking Values in Memory"></a><h2>Checking Values in Memory</h2><p>The Stackframe &amp; Variables table shows the value of the variables used in a widget or web application. When the widget or web application is running, its global variables are available for inspection. When you pause a widget or web application, as described in <span class="content_text"><a href="DebuggingSharing.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004692-CH16-SW5">“Pausing and Step-by-Step Execution,”</a></span> the current function gets its own heading in the table with its variables listed underneath. If the function was called by another function, the second function’s variables are listed under the first, and so on.</p><p>Double-clicking a variable in the table adds the variable name to the code evaluator, as discussed in <span class="content_text"><a href="DebuggingSharing.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004692-CH16-SW4">“The Code Evaluator.”</a></span></p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004692-CH16-SW6" title="Breakpoints"></a><h2>Breakpoints</h2><p>In addition to pausing the execution of a widget or web application using the Pause option, you can set places in your code for execution to pause, called breakpoints. You can add a breakpoint in two ways. One way is to click in the gutter of the source code editor. If the gutter is not showing, go to Editing preferences and select the Show Gutter option. </p><p>A blue arrow in the gutter means that before that line of code is executed, execution will halt. To temporarily disable the breakpoint, click it; it turns from blue to gray to indicate that it’s disabled. To remove the breakpoint, drag it outside of the gutter.</p><p>The other way to set a breakpoint is to use the Breakpoints window. To show the Breakpoints window choose Debug > Show Breakpoints Window or double-click in the gutter. In the Breakpoints window, click the plus (+) button and specify either a filename and line number or a function name to break on. For instance, if you wanted to break in <code>Untitled.js</code> on line 42, you enter <code>Untitled.js:42</code>. Alternatively, you can supply the name of the function you want to break on (for instance, <code>showFront</code> in a widget).</p><p>In addition to the breakpoint, you can set a condition for the breakpoint. A condition is a JavaScript statement that evaluates to either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. If the condition evaluates to <code>true</code> when execution passes the breakpoint, execution pauses.</p><p>In the Breakpoints Window, you can remove a breakpoint by selecting a breakpoint from the table and clicking the minus (-) button or you can disable it by deselecting the checkbox next to a breakpoint’s item in the table.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004692-CH16-SW4" title="The Code Evaluator"></a><h2>The Code Evaluator</h2><p>While you run a widget or a web application, it can be useful to execute just one line of code. The code evaluator lets you do this. To show the code evaluator, choose View > Evaluator or choose Evaluator from the View menu in the toolbar. In the evaluator, you enter arbitrary code and press the Return key to execute the code immediately. </p><p>If you double-click a value in the Stackframes &amp; Variables table, its name is automatically entered into the code evaluator. Also, if your cursor is at the prompt and you press the up arrow key, you cycle through the history of entries in the code evaluator. </p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004692-CH16-SW9" title="Sharing a Widget"></a><h2>Sharing a Widget</h2><p>When you’re finished developing a widget, you can share it with others. There are two commands for deploying a widget, and both export the widget from the project as a <code>.wdgt</code> bundle, ready to run in Dashboard. When you click Share in the navigator, the share pane gives you the choice of deploying the widget for use in Mac OS X v10.4.3 or later or for use in all versions of Mac OS X v10.4. In most cases, deploying a widget for use in Mac OS X v10.4.3 or later is advisable, because it results in a smaller widget.</p><p>If you want to share your widget by, for example, sending it in an email, click Save to Disk in the share pane and choose a convenient save location. If you want to make sure the widget project is automatically saved to disk before deploying, select the “Save project to disk before deploying” checkbox. Note that this checkbox is available after you’ve saved the widget project for the first time.</p><p>If the widget is for your use only, choose File > Deploy Widget to install it on your computer.</p><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004692-CH16-SW7" title="Deploying a Web Application"></a><h2>Deploying a Web Application</h2><p></p><p>When you’re ready to deploy your web application, you choose where you want Dashcode to place your application’s code and resource files and how they should be saved. These files include the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, image files, and your application’s Web Clip icon. (Note that Dashcode removes some Dashcode-specific content from the HTML file during deployment.)</p><p>By default Dashcode deploys these files to a folder in your <code>~/Library/Sites</code> directory, using the localhost account. You can modify this behavior by making choices in the Share pane (click Share in the navigator to open the Share pane).</p><p>Dashcode gives you three deployment options:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Deploy to localhost. Dashcode places your web application files in a folder you specify in your <code>~/Library/Sites</code> directory.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Deploy to a remote server. Dashcode uses WebDAV or MobileMe to upload your web application files to a server you specify.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Save to disk. Dashcode saves your web application files in a folder whose name and location you supply.</p></li></ul><p></p><p>If you want to save a copy of your web application files in a folder on disk, click Save to Disk at the bottom of the Share pane and supply a folder name and location. If you want to deploy the application to a local or remote server, you can customize the deployment behavior in the Destination section of the Share pane:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Use the Path field to supply a name for the folder (otherwise, Dashcode creates a folder called Untitled).</p></li><li class="li"><p>Use the Account pop-up menu if you want to select an account other than the default localhost account.</p><p>If you want to add a new account, select Add Account in the pop-up menu to open Dashcode’s Accounts preferences and set up a new account.</p></li></ul><p>In the Options section of the Share pane, you can determine save behavior and deployment notification:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Select the Save behavior checkbox if you want your web application project to be saved before every deployment (this checkbox is available after you’ve saved the project for the first time).</p></li><li class="li"><p>Select the Notification checkbox if you want Dashcode to send an email message containing a link to your application every time you deploy it. Use the field below the Notification checkbox to supply the recipient’s email address (or multiple email addresses, separated by commas).</p></li></ul><p>After you finish making your selections, click Deploy at the bottom of the Share pane, or choose File > Deploy Web Application, to deploy your web application. To view your web application on an iPhone OS-based device, navigate to the location of the <code>index.html</code> file on the appropriate server.</p><div class="notebox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004692-CH16-DontLinkElementID_13" title="Note"></a><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;As mentioned above, Dashcode uses WebDAV or MobileMe to upload your application files to a remote server. It does not support SSH, FTP, or SFTP.</p></div><p></p><p></p><div class="warningbox"><img src="../../../../../../../Resources/Images/icon_warning.gif" alt="!" width="20" height="20" border="0" class="warningicon" /><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004692-CH16-DontLinkElementID_14" title="Warning:"></a><p><strong>Warning:</strong>&nbsp;Web browsers, including Safari on iPhone, implement a security model known as “same source.” This means that webpages are not allowed to request information from Internet domains other than the one from which they came. If you have built a web application that fetches information from other websites to display, it will work when you test it in Dashcode’s simulator application, but not when you install it in your web server and run it in iPhone or iPod touch.</p><p>There are ways to configure your web server and alter your web application to make it possible to fetch information from other websites, but these techniques are beyond the scope of this document.
