<!-- 
	Purpose: To show the basic use of system.run() and system.runOnce()						
	Overview: system.run() and system.runOnce() are built-ins that allow you to run custom code to do a check that is not built-in to distributions.  The first argument is the executable (relative to the resources directory of a distribution script's bundle) and the remaining arguments are the arguments for the script or executable.  The return value is an integer.  There is no access to stdout or stdin, use the return value to validate your check.  system.runOnce() is the same as system.run(), but it will only be run once during the course of an Install session for the same executable and arguments.  system.runOnce() should not be used for things that will change over time.  Also, note that performance may be degraded if system.run() is used on any operation that may take an extended amount of time.

<!--
	In this example, we are using system.runOnce() to run our script "checkArchitecture" with two arguments (the path and the architecture).  If the return value is 1 then the Installer is really a ppc64 app (it isn't).  We use system.runOnce() because the arguments do not change (per volume) and the answer never changes.

				system.log('The Installer is a ppc64 application');
			}else{
				system.log('The Installer is not a ppc64 application');
			}
			
			return true;
