The routine should allocate global variables in the appropriate heap	and call SetComponentInstanceStorage() so the Component Manager can remember	the globals and pass them to all the method calls.	Determining the heap to use can be tricky. The Component Manager will normally	load the component code into the system heap, which is good, since many applications	will be sharing this component to play sound. In this case, the component's global	variable storage should also be created in the system heap.	However, if system heap memory is tight, the Component Manager will load	the component into the application heap of the first application that plays sound.	When this happens, the component should create global storage in the application heap	instead. The Sound Manager will make sure that other applications will not try	to play sound while the component is in this application heap.	To determine the proper heap to use, call GetComponentInstanceA5(). If the value	returned is 0, then the component was loaded into the system heap, and all storage	should be allocated there. If the value returned is non-zero, the component is in	the application heap specified by returned A5 value, and all storage should be	allocated in this application heap.	NOTE: If the component is loaded into the application heap, the value returned by	GetComponentRefCon() will be 0.	NOTE: Do not attempt to initialize or access hardware in this call, since the	Component Manager will call SoundOutputOpen() BEFORE calling RegisterComponent().	Instead, initialize the hardware during InitOutputDevice(), described below.	NOTE: This routine is never called at interrupt time.*/PASCAL_RTN ComponentResult __SoundOutputOpen (SoundOutputGlobalsPtr globals, ComponentInstance self){	OSErr		result;	// get space for globals in appropriate heap	globals = (SoundOutputGlobalsPtr)NewPtrSysClear(sizeof(SoundOutputGlobals));	FailWithAction(globals == nil, result = MemError(), Failure);	// If a component is loaded into an application's heap, then it gets an A5 value.	// This also means that the component's refCon is 0. All of this means we need	// to go and get the preferences just like we're being registered for the first time.		if (GetComponentInstanceA5(self) != 0)	{		globals->inAppHeap = true;		result = GetPreferences(globals);		FailIf(result != noErr, NoPrefs);	}	globals->self = self;	globals->prefs = (HardwarePrefsHandle)GetComponentRefcon((Component)self);#ifdef FakeInterrupts	gGlobals = globals;#endif	SetComponentInstanceStorage(self, (Handle) globals); 	// save pointer to our globals	return (noErr);NoPrefs:	DisposePtr((Ptr)globals);Failure:	return (result);}/*	SoundOutputClose	This routine is called when the Component Manager is closing the instance of	this component. The routine should make sure all remaining data is written	to the hardware and that the hardware is completely turned off. It should	delete all global storage and close any other components that were opened.	NOTE: Be sure to check that the globals pointer passed in to this routine is	not set to NIL. If the SoundOutputOpen() routine fails for any reason, the Component	Manager will call this routine passing in a NIL for the globals.	NOTE: This routine is never called at interrupt time.*/PASCAL_RTN ComponentResult __SoundOutputClose (SoundOutputGlobalsPtr globals, ComponentInstance self){	if (globals != nil)											// we have some globals	{		ReleaseHardware(globals);								// make sure the hardware is off and release it		if (globals->sourceComponent)			CloseMixerSoundComponent(globals->sourceComponent);	// close mixer		if (globals->prefsChanged)			ErrorMessage(SetSoundPreference(kAIFFWriterSubType, kAIFFWriterName, (Handle)globals->prefs));		if (globals->inAppHeap)			DisposeHandle((Handle)globals->prefs);		if (globals->ioBuffers[0].buffer != nil)			DisposePtr(globals->ioBuffers[0].buffer);			// dispose of buffers		if (globals->ioBuffers[1].buffer != nil)			DisposePtr(globals->ioBuffers[1].buffer);			// dispose of buffers		DisposePtr((Ptr)globals);								// torch our storage	}	return (noErr);}/*	SoundOutputRegister	This routine is called once, usually at boot time, when the Component Manager	is first registering this component. This routine should check to see if the proper	hardware is installed and return 0 if it is. If the hardware is not installed,	the routine should return 1 and this component will not be registered. This is	also an opportunity to do one-time initializations and perhaps register this	component again if more than one hardware device is available. Global state information	can also be saved in the component refcon by calling SetComponentRefCon();	NOTE: The cmpWantsRegisterMessage bit must be set in the component flags of the	component in order for this routine to be called.	NOTE: This routine is never called at interrupt time.*/PASCAL_RTN ComponentResult __SoundOutputRegister (SoundOutputGlobalsPtr globals){	NumVersion			installedVersion;	ComponentResult		result;	OSErr				err;	// we can only run if version 3.0 or greater of the Sound Manager is running;	// we can check the entire long because the format of NumVersion is BCD data	installedVersion = SndSoundManagerVersion();	if (installedVersion.majorRev < 3)		result = 1;									// component doesn't want to be registered	else	{		result = 0;									// component wants to be registered		err = GetPreferences(globals);		FailWithAction(err != noErr, result = 1, Exit);	}Exit:	return result;}PASCAL_RTN ComponentResult __SoundOutputVersion (SoundOutputGlobalsPtr globals){	globals; // suppress "unused variable" warning for all compilers	return (kSoundComponentVersion);}/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Sound component functions//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////*	InitOutputDevice	This routine is called once when the Sound Manager first opens this component.	The routine should initialize the hardware to default values, allocate the	appropriate mixer component and create any other memory that is required.	NOTE: This routine is never called at interrupt time.*/PASCAL_RTN ComponentResult __SoundOutputInitOutputDevice (SoundOutputGlobalsPtr globals, long actions){	ComponentResult		result;	actions;			// suppress "unused variable" warning for all compilers		result = SetupHardware(globals);	FailIf(result != noErr, Failure);	// if any of the preferences are needed during the interrupts,	// then locked the preferences handle now	// first create a mixer and tell it the type of data it should output.

A	4-byte OSType selector is used to determine the type and size of the information	to return. If the component does not support a selector, it should delegate this	call on up the component chain.	NOTE: This can be called at interrupt time.
