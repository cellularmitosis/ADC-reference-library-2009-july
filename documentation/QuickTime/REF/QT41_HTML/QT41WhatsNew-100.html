As such, this controller represents a logical collection of members that the application wishes to control -- in a sense, as a group. Your application can add any number of listeners to such controllers and filter the activation of the listener based on the state of the modifier keys when the event was generated.</P><P CLASS="T1-Text1"><A NAME="pgfId-29880"></A>If there are no particular logical groups of members, then a single target controller with alternate listeners that are activated appropriately for the different behaviors required can be created.</P><H4><A HREF="QT41WhatsNew-101.html" CLASS="Hypertext">New DragAdaptor and TranslateMatrix Classes</A></H4><hr>&#169; 2000 Apple Computer, Inc.<!-- QTnavbar start --><P><I>Inside Macintosh: QuickTime Reference</I><P>| <A HREF="QT41WhatsNew-99.html">Previous</A> | <A HREF="QT41WhatsNew-1.html">Chapter Contents</A> | <A HREF="QT41WhatsNew.html">Chapter Top</A> | <A HREF="QT41WhatsNew-101.html">Next</A> |</P><!-- QTnavbar end --><!-- start of footer --><!--#include virtual="/includes/framesetfooter" --><!-- end of footer --></BODY></HTML>
