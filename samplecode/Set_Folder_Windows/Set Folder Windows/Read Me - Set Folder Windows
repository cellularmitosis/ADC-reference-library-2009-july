	This little AppleScript droplet is used to setup drive and folder windows in preperation for	burning a CD. It requires the scriptable Finder from System 7.5 or later. It seems to be more reliable than SWAt at setting things up right, since it uses the Finder rather than directly manipulating desktop information.		Set the values of the properties in the script, using your favorite script editor, to control the offset, height, and width	of each window. See the comments in the script for info on how to set each value.			This script will take a while to run, since it uses the Finder to	set things up. Maybe as long as an hour, depending on the size of the	disk to be setup, the number of folders it contains, and the machine	that is doing the procesing.Andy Bachorski - Apple DTS - andyb@apple.comLast modified 3/97
