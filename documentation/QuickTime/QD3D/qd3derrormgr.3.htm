For example, when the first error occurs, that error is posted both as the first and as the most recent error. Any subsequent error is posted as the most recent error to occur.</P><P CLASS="T1.Text1"><A NAME="pgfId=1377"> </A>When you call a <TT CLASS="cv">_Get</TT> function to retrieve an error, warning, or notice, the function returns, as its function result, the most recent error, warning, or notice. For example, when you call <TT CLASS="cv">Q3Error_Get</TT>, it returns, as its function result, the most recent error. <TT CLASS="cv">Q3Error_Get</TT> also returns, through its <TT CLASS="cv">firstError</TT> parameter, the oldest unreported error that occurred during a QuickDraw&nbsp;3D routine. You can set this parameter to <TT CLASS="cv">NULL</TT> if you do not care about the oldest unreported error.</P><P CLASS="Note"><A NAME="pgfId=1426"> </A>The oldest unreported error, warning, or notice is sometimes called <I CLASS="italics">sticky</I>. </P><P CLASS="T1.Text1"><A NAME="pgfId=1358"> </A>Once you've called the <TT CLASS="cv">Q3Error_Get</TT> function to retrieve the most recent and the oldest unreported QuickDraw&nbsp;3D errors, the Error Manager automatically clears those error codes the next time you call a QuickDraw&nbsp;3D function that is not part of the Error Manager.</P><P CLASS="T1.Text1"><A NAME="pgfId=1493"> </A>If an error occurs in the operating system on which QuickDraw&nbsp;3D is running, the Error Manager posts an error indicating which the operating system encountered the error. You can then call an appropriate function to retrieve the system-specific error. For instance, if an error occurs while reading or writing a file in the Macintosh Operating System, then the <TT CLASS="cv">Q3Error_Get</TT> function returns the error <TT CLASS="cv">kQ3ErrorMacintoshError</TT>. In that case, you can call the <TT CLASS="cv">Q3MacintoshError_Get</TT> function to get the Macintosh-specific error code.</P><hr>&#169; 1997 Apple Computer, Inc.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><!-- start of footer --><!--#include virtual="/includes/framesetfooter" --><!-- end of footer --></BODY></HTML>
