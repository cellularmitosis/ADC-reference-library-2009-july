This section describeshow Java Client compares with the Client JDBC and JDBC three-tierarchitectures.</font></p><a name = "TPXREF113"></a><h3><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande">ClientJDBC Architecture</font></h3><p><font face="Times">Client JDBC applications use the same "fat-client" architecturethat desktop applications do. Custom code invokes JDBC on the client,which in turn goes through a driver to communicate with a JDBC proxyon the server; this proxy makes the necessary client-library callson the server. The shortcomings of this type of architecture aretypical of all fat-client architectures. Security is a problem becausethe compiled Java on the client is easily decompiled, leaving bothsensitive data and business rules at risk. The server has to beopen to allow all client operations without being able to controlwhat the client is doing. In addition, such an architecture doesn'tscale; it is expensive to move data over the channel to the client.</font></p><p><font face="Times">Java Client has none of these problems. Sensitive data andbusiness rules can be confined to the server, so the server doesn'thave to allow indiscriminate access to data and operations. Additionally,because the client part of a Java Client application contains nonsensitivedata and business logic, it doesn't make nearly as many roundtrips to the server or move as much data back and forth.</font></p><a name = "TPXREF114"></a><h3><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande">JDBCThree-Tier Architecture</font></h3><p><font face="Times">A JDBC three-tier application (with CORBA as the transport)is a big improvement over Client JDBC. In this architecture theclient can be thin because all that is required on the client sideis the JFC, non-sensitive custom code (usually for managing theuser interface), and CORBA stubs for communicating with the server.Sensitive business logic as well as logic related to database connectionare stored on the server. In addition, the server handles all data-intensivecomputations.</font></p><p><font face="Times">Although the JDBC three-tier architecture is an improvementover Client JDBC, it has its own weaknesses.</font></p><ul><p><li>The JDBCthree-tier architecture results in too much network traffic. Becausethis architecture uses "proxy" business objects on the clientas handles to the real objects on the server, each client requestfor an attribute is forwarded to the server, causing a separateround trip and precipitating a "message storm."</li></p><p><li>The JDBC three-tier architecture requires developers to writemuch of the code themselves, from code for database access and datapackaging to code for user-interface synchronization and changetracking.</li></p><p><li>The JDBC three-tier architecture does not provide much ofthe functionality associated with application servers, such as applicationmonitoring and load balancing, nor does it provide HTML integration.</li></p></ul><p><font face="Times">Java Client addresses these problems as well. First, insteadof using proxy business objects on the client, the Java Client applicationmakes use of "copies" of the objects. Second, WebObjects providesall of the database access and user interface synchronization withits enterprise objects technology. Finally, it provides applicationserver functionality and HTML integration.</font></p>    <br><a href="Java_Client_Architecture.html" target="_right"><img src="../Images/previous.gif" border="0" alt="Previous"></a><a href="Development_s_and_Tools.html" target="_right"><img src="../Images/next.gif" border="0" alt="Next"></a>&nbsp;<p><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="1">&#169; 2001 Apple Computer, Inc.</font></p><!-- start of footer --><!--#include virtual="/includes/framesetfooter" --><!-- end of footer --></body></html>
