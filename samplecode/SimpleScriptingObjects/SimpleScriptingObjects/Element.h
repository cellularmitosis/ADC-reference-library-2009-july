	/* The Element class is the root class for all of the AppleScript
	objects we provide in our application.
	
	It is in this class that take care of most of the 'infrastructure'
	type operations needed for maintaining our objects.  In our application
	we assume that all of our objects will have a 'name' property and an
	'id' property and we maintain those properties in this class.
	
	Given that's taken care of here, we implement the objectSpecifier method
	based on the id property.  By doing that here, we don't have to worry about
	implementing an objectSpecifier method in any of our other sub-classes.
	
	For most intentions and purposes, you should be able to use this class
	unmodified as a superclass for your own scriptable objects.  
	*/
@interface Element : NSObject {
		/* the following two fields are used in calculating the objectSpecifier
		for this object.  To do that, we maintain a reference to the containing
		object (container) and the name of the Cocoa key (containerProperty) on
		that container where our instance is being stored.  For example, the Bucket
		class contains a list of 'trinket' objects in it.  A trinket contained in
		an instance of the Bucket class would retain a reference to the Bucket object
		it is stored in along with the name of the Cocoa key ('trinkets') being used
		to reference the list of trinkets inside of that Bucket. */
	id container; /* reference to the object containing this object */
	NSString* containerProperty; /* name of the cocoa key on container specifying the 
	                               list property where this object is stored */
	
		/* storage for our id and name AppleScript properties. */
	NSString* uniqueID; /* a unique id value for this object */
	NSString* name; /* the name property for this object */
}

	/* storage management
	
	The normal sequence of events when an object is created is as follows:
	
	1. an AppleScript 'make' command will allocate and initialize an instance
	of the class it has been asked to create.  For example, it may create a Trinket.
	
	2. then it will call the insertInXXXXX: insertInXXXXX:atIndex: method on the container
	object where the new object will be stored.  For example, if we were being asked
	to create a Trinket in a Bucket, then the make command would create an instance
	of Trinket and then it would call insertInTrinkets: on the Bucket object.
	
	3. Inside of the insertInXXXXX: or insertInXXXXX:atIndex: you must record the
	parent object and the parent's property key for the new object being created so
	you can create a objectSpecifier later.  In this class, we have defined the
	setContainer:andProperty: for that purpose.  For example, inside of our
	insertInTrinkets: method on our Bucket object, we the setContainer:andProperty:
	method on the trinket object like so:
	   [trinket setContainer:self andProperty:@"trinkets"]
	to inform the trinket object who its container is and the name of the Cocoa key
	on that container object used for the list of trinkets.

	a category of NSApplication that always returns nil (the default value
