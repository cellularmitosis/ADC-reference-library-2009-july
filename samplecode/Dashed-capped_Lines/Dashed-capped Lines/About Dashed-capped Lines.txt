Hey!  What the Hell is this?!sample: Dashed-capped LinesLanguage: MPW Pascal 3.2This sample demonstrates how to draw dashed line objects on PostScript printers.  In this case, they are capped PostScript lines.  I use round caps, which means that the ends of the lines are rounded.This simple example does not deal with QuickDraw printers, on which it draws solid black lines.This is a derivative of the “Dashed Lines” sample.- Dave “gd” Hersey  MacDTS  10/9/91
