It is upto the developer to control how this distribution occurs. </p><p>In all multi-tier intranet applications, it's vitally importantthat the developer has control over where the business logic sits.Some information, such as credit card numbers and passwords, areimportant elements of business logic but should never be sent tothe client. Likewise, certain algorithms represent confidentialbusiness logic and should live only on the application server. Bypartitioning your business logic into a client side and a server side,you can improve performance and secure business rules and legacydata.In pure Java applications, object distribution is crucial inprotecting business rules. Since Java byte code can quite easilybe decompiled, it's important that you have control over the objectswhich live on the client. Object distribution, coupled with remotemethod invocation, lets you build secure, high-performance applications.</p><br>    <br><a href="Better_User_Experience.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/previous.gif" border="0"></a><a href="The_Best_of_WebObjects.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/next.gif" border="0"></a>&nbsp;<br><br><p><hr><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">&#169; 2002 Apple Computer, Inc.
