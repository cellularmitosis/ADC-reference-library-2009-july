<P>The Classes window changes its display as the main window changes. If the main window is a component window, the Classes window shows you that component's classes. If the main window is the application window and the Application tab or Session tab is selected, the Classes window shows you application's classes.
<P>When you're creating a class, be careful that you are creating it where you intend to create it. Check the window's titlebar to see what you are editing.
