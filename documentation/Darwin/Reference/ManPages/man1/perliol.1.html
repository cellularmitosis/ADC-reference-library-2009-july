<b>NAME</b>
       perliol - C API for Perl's implementation of IO in Layers.

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
           /* Defining a layer ... */
           #include &lt;perliol.h&gt;

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       This document describes the behavior and implementation of the PerlIO abstraction described in perla-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">pio&nbsp;perlapio</font>
       pio when "USE_PERLIO" is defined (and "USE_SFIO" is not).

       <b>History</b> <b>and</b> <b>Background</b>

       The PerlIO abstraction was introduced in perl5.003_02 but languished as just an abstraction until
       perl5.7.0. However during that time a number of perl extensions switched to using it, so the API is
       mostly fixed to maintain (source) compatibility.

       The aim of the implementation is to provide the PerlIO API in a flexible and platform neutral manner.
       It is also a trial of an "Object Oriented C, with vtables" approach which may be applied to perl6.

       <b>Basic</b> <b>Structure</b>

       PerlIO is a stack of layers.

       The low levels of the stack work with the low-level operating system calls (file descriptors in C)
       getting bytes in and out, the higher layers of the stack buffer, filter, and otherwise manipulate the
       I/O, and return characters (or bytes) to Perl.  Terms <u>above</u> and <u>below</u> are used to refer to the rela-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tive&nbsp;relative</font>
       tive positioning of the stack layers.

       A layer contains a "vtable", the table of I/O operations (at C level a table of function pointers),
       and status flags.  The functions in the vtable implement operations like "open", "read", and "write".

       When I/O, for example "read", is requested, the request goes from Perl first down the stack using
       "read" functions of each layer, then at the bottom the input is requested from the operating system
       services, then the result is returned up the stack, finally being interpreted as Perl data.

       The requests do not necessarily go always all the way down to the operating system: that's where Per-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lIO&nbsp;PerlIO</font>
       lIO buffering comes into play.

       When you do an <u>open()</u> and specify extra PerlIO layers to be deployed, the layers you specify are
       "pushed" on top of the already existing default stack.  One way to see it is that "operating system
       is on the left" and "Perl is on the right".

       What exact layers are in this default stack depends on a lot of things: your operating system, Perl
       version, Perl compile time configuration, and Perl runtime configuration.  See PerlIO, "PERLIO" in
       perlrun, and open for more information.

       <u>binmode()</u> operates similarly to <u>open()</u>: by default the specified layers are pushed on top of the
       existing stack.

       However, note that even as the specified layers are "pushed on top" for <u>open()</u> and <u>binmode()</u>, this
       doesn't mean that the effects are limited to the "top": PerlIO layers can be very 'active' and
       inspect and affect layers also deeper in the stack.  As an example there is a layer called "raw"
       which repeatedly "pops" layers until it reaches the first layer that has declared itself capable of
       handling binary data.  The "pushed" layers are processed in left-to-right order.

       <u>sysopen()</u> operates (unsurprisingly) at a lower level in the stack than <u>open()</u>.  For example in UNIX
       or UNIX-like systems <u>sysopen()</u> operates directly at the level of file descriptors: in the terms of
       PerlIO layers, it uses only the "unix" layer, which is a rather thin wrapper on top of the UNIX file
       descriptors.

       <b>Layers</b> <b>vs</b> <b>Disciplines</b>

       Initial discussion of the ability to modify IO streams behaviour used the term "discipline" for the
       entities which were added. This came (I believe) from the use of the term in "sfio", which in turn
       borrowed it from "line disciplines" on Unix terminals. However, this document (and the C code) uses
       the term "layer".

       This is, I hope, a natural term given the implementation, and should avoid connotations that are
       inherent in earlier uses of "discipline" for things which are rather different.

       <b>Data</b> <b>Structures</b>

       The basic data structure is a PerlIOl:

               typedef struct _PerlIO PerlIOl;
               typedef struct _PerlIO_funcs PerlIO_funcs;
               typedef PerlIOl *PerlIO;

               struct _PerlIO
               {
                PerlIOl *      next;       /* Lower layer */
                PerlIO_funcs * tab;        /* Functions for this layer */
                IV             flags;      /* Various flags for state */
               };

       A "PerlIOl *" is a pointer to the struct, and the <u>application</u> level "PerlIO *" is a pointer to a
       "PerlIOl *" - i.e. a pointer to a pointer to the struct. This allows the application level "PerlIO *"
       to remain constant while the actual "PerlIOl *" underneath changes. (Compare perl's "SV *" which
       remains constant while its "sv_any" field changes as the scalar's type changes.) An IO stream is then
       in general represented as a pointer to this linked-list of "layers".

       It should be noted that because of the double indirection in a "PerlIO *", a "&amp;(perlio-&gt;next)" "is" a
       "PerlIO *", and so to some degree at least one layer can use the "standard" API on the next layer
       down.

       A "layer" is composed of two parts:

       1.  The functions and attributes of the "layer class".

       2.  The per-instance data for a particular handle.

       <b>Functions</b> <b>and</b> <b>Attributes</b>

       The functions and attributes are accessed via the "tab" (for table) member of "PerlIOl". The func-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tions&nbsp;functions</font>
       tions (methods of the layer "class") are fixed, and are defined by the "PerlIO_funcs" type. They are
       broadly the same as the public "PerlIO_xxxxx" functions:

         struct _PerlIO_funcs
         {
          Size_t               fsize;
          char *               name;
          Size_t               size;
          IV           kind;
          IV           (*Pushed)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f,const char *mode,SV *arg, PerlIO_funcs *tab);
          IV           (*Popped)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);
          PerlIO *     (*Open)(pTHX_ PerlIO_funcs *tab,
                               AV *layers, IV n,
                               const char *mode,
                               int fd, int imode, int perm,
                               PerlIO *old,
                               int narg, SV **args);
          IV           (*Binmode)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);
          SV *         (*Getarg)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f, CLONE_PARAMS *param, int flags)
          IV           (*Fileno)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);
          PerlIO *     (*Dup)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f, PerlIO *o, CLONE_PARAMS *param, int flags)
          /* Unix-like functions - cf sfio line disciplines */
          SSize_t      (*Read)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f, void *vbuf, Size_t count);
          SSize_t      (*Unread)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f, const void *vbuf, Size_t count);
          SSize_t      (*Write)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f, const void *vbuf, Size_t count);
          IV           (*Seek)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f, Off_t offset, int whence);
          Off_t        (*Tell)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);
          IV           (*Close)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);
          /* Stdio-like buffered IO functions */
          IV           (*Flush)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);
          IV           (*Fill)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);
          IV           (*Eof)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);
          IV           (*Error)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);
          void         (*Clearerr)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);
          void         (*Setlinebuf)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);
          /* Perl's snooping functions */
          STDCHAR *    (*Get_base)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);
          Size_t       (*Get_bufsiz)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);
          STDCHAR *    (*Get_ptr)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);
          SSize_t      (*Get_cnt)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);
          void         (*Set_ptrcnt)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f,STDCHAR *ptr,SSize_t cnt);
         };

       The first few members of the struct give a function table size for compatibility check "name" for the
       layer, the  size to "malloc" for the per-instance data, and some flags which are attributes of the
       class as whole (such as whether it is a buffering layer), then follow the functions which fall into
       four basic groups:

       1.  Opening and setup functions

       2.  Basic IO operations

       3.  Stdio class buffering options.

       4.  Functions to support Perl's traditional "fast" access to the buffer.

       A layer does not have to implement all the functions, but the whole table has to be present. Unimple-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mented&nbsp;Unimplemented</font>
       mented slots can be NULL (which will result in an error when called) or can be filled in with stubs
       to "inherit" behaviour from a "base class". This "inheritance" is fixed for all instances of the
       layer, but as the layer chooses which stubs to populate the table, limited "multiple inheritance" is
       possible.

       <b>Per-instance</b> <b>Data</b>

       The per-instance data are held in memory beyond the basic PerlIOl struct, by making a PerlIOl the
       first member of the layer's struct thus:

               typedef struct
               {
                struct _PerlIO base;       /* Base "class" info */
                STDCHAR *      buf;        /* Start of buffer */
                STDCHAR *      end;        /* End of valid part of buffer */
                STDCHAR *      ptr;        /* Current position in buffer */
                Off_t          posn;       /* Offset of buf into the file */
                Size_t         bufsiz;     /* Real size of buffer */
                IV             oneword;    /* Emergency buffer */
               } PerlIOBuf;

       In this way (as for perl's scalars) a pointer to a PerlIOBuf can be treated as a pointer to a Per-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lIOl.&nbsp;PerlIOl.</font>
       lIOl.

       <b>Layers</b> <b>in</b> <b>action.</b>

                       table           perlio          unix
                   |           |
                   +-----------+    +----------+    +--------+
          PerlIO -&gt;|           |---&gt;|  next    |---&gt;|  NULL  |
                   +-----------+    +----------+    +--------+
                   |           |    |  buffer  |    |   fd   |
                   +-----------+    |          |    +--------+
                   |           |    +----------+

       The above attempts to show how the layer scheme works in a simple case.  The application's "PerlIO *"
       points to an entry in the <!-- a -->table(s)<!-- /a --> representing open (allocated) handles. For example the first three
       slots in the table correspond to "stdin","stdout" and "stderr". The table in turn points to the cur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">rent&nbsp;current</font>
       rent "top" layer for the handle - in this case an instance of the generic buffering layer "perlio".
       That layer in turn points to the next layer down - in this case the lowlevel "unix" layer.

       The above is roughly equivalent to a "stdio" buffered stream, but with much more flexibility:

          If Unix level "read"/"write"/"lseek" is not appropriate for (say) sockets then the "unix" layer
           can be replaced (at open time or even dynamically) with a "socket" layer.

          Different handles can have different buffering schemes. The "top" layer could be the "mmap" layer
           if reading disk files was quicker using "mmap" than "read". An "unbuffered" stream can be imple-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mented&nbsp;implemented</font>
           mented simply by not having a buffer layer.

          Extra layers can be inserted to process the data as it flows through.  This was the driving need
           for including the scheme in perl 5.7.0+ - we needed a mechanism to allow data to be translated
           between perl's internal encoding (conceptually at least Unicode as UTF-8), and the "native" for-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mat&nbsp;format</font>
           mat used by the system. This is provided by the ":encoding(xxxx)" layer which typically sits
           above the buffering layer.

          A layer can be added that does "\n" to CRLF translation. This layer can be used on any platform,
           not just those that normally do such things.

       <b>Per-instance</b> <b>flag</b> <b>bits</b>

       The generic flag bits are a hybrid of "O_XXXXX" style flags deduced from the mode string passed to
       "PerlIO_open()", and state bits for typical buffer layers.

       PERLIO_F_EOF
           End of file.

       PERLIO_F_CANWRITE
           Writes are permitted, i.e. opened as "w" or "r+" or "a", etc.

       PERLIO_F_CANREAD
           Reads are permitted i.e. opened "r" or "w+" (or even "a+" - ick).

       PERLIO_F_ERROR
           An error has occurred (for "PerlIO_error()").

       PERLIO_F_TRUNCATE
           Truncate file suggested by open mode.

       PERLIO_F_APPEND
           All writes should be appends.

       PERLIO_F_CRLF
           Layer is performing Win32-like "\n" mapped to CR,LF for output and CR,LF mapped to "\n" for
           input. Normally the provided "crlf" layer is the only layer that need bother about this. "Per-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lIO_binmode()"&nbsp;"PerlIO_binmode()"</font>
           lIO_binmode()" will mess with this flag rather than add/remove layers if the "PERLIO_K_CANCRLF"
           bit is set for the layers class.

       PERLIO_F_UTF8
           Data written to this layer should be UTF-8 encoded; data provided by this layer should be consid-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ered&nbsp;considered</font>
           ered UTF-8 encoded. Can be set on any layer by ":utf8" dummy layer. Also set on ":encoding"
           layer.

       PERLIO_F_UNBUF
           Layer is unbuffered - i.e. write to next layer down should occur for each write to this layer.

       PERLIO_F_WRBUF
           The buffer for this layer currently holds data written to it but not sent to next layer.

       PERLIO_F_RDBUF
           The buffer for this layer currently holds unconsumed data read from layer below.

       PERLIO_F_LINEBUF
           Layer is line buffered. Write data should be passed to next layer down whenever a "\n" is seen.
           Any data beyond the "\n" should then be processed.

       PERLIO_F_TEMP
           File has been "unlink()"ed, or should be deleted on "close()".

       PERLIO_F_OPEN
           Handle is open.

       PERLIO_F_FASTGETS
           This instance of this layer supports the "fast "gets"" interface.  Normally set based on "PER-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">LIO_K_FASTGETS"&nbsp;"PERLIO_K_FASTGETS"</font>
           LIO_K_FASTGETS" for the class and by the existence of the <!-- a -->function(s)<!-- /a --> in the table. However a
           class that normally provides that interface may need to avoid it on a particular instance. The
           "pending" layer needs to do this when it is pushed above a layer which does not support the
           interface.  (Perl's "sv_gets()" does not expect the streams fast "gets" behaviour to change dur-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;during</font>
           ing one "get".)

       <b>Methods</b> <b>in</b> <b>Detail</b>


       fsize
                   Size_t fsize;

           Size of the function table. This is compared against the value PerlIO code "knows" as a compati-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">bility&nbsp;compatibility</font>
           bility check. Future versions <u>may</u> be able to tolerate layers compiled against an old version of
           the headers.

       name
                   char * name;

           The name of the layer whose <u>open()</u> method Perl should invoke on <u>open()</u>.  For example if the layer
           is called APR, you will call:

             open $fh, "&gt;:APR", ...

           and Perl knows that it has to invoke the <u>PerlIOAPR</u><b>_</b><u>open()</u> method implemented by the APR layer.

       size
                   Size_t size;

           The size of the per-instance data structure, e.g.:

             sizeof(PerlIOAPR)

           If this field is zero then "PerlIO_pushed" does not malloc anything and assumes layer's Pushed
           function will do any required layer stack manipulation - used to avoid malloc/free overhead for
           dummy layers.  If the field is non-zero it must be at least the size of "PerlIOl", "Per-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lIO_pushed"&nbsp;"PerlIO_pushed"</font>
           lIO_pushed" will allocate memory for the layer's data structures and link new layer onto the
           stream's stack. (If the layer's Pushed method returns an error indication the layer is popped
           again.)

       kind
                   IV kind;

           * PERLIO_K_BUFFERED
               The layer is buffered.

           * PERLIO_K_RAW
               The layer is acceptable to have in a binmode(FH) stack - i.e. it does not (or will configure
               itself not to) transform bytes passing through it.

           * PERLIO_K_CANCRLF
               Layer can translate between "\n" and CRLF line ends.

           * PERLIO_K_FASTGETS
               Layer allows buffer snooping.

           * PERLIO_K_MULTIARG
               Used when the layer's <u>open()</u> accepts more arguments than usual. The extra arguments should
               come not before the "MODE" argument. When this flag is used it's up to the layer to validate
               the args.

       Pushed
                   IV      (*Pushed)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f,const char *mode, SV *arg);

           The only absolutely mandatory method. Called when the layer is pushed onto the stack.  The "mode"
           argument may be NULL if this occurs post-open. The "arg" will be non-"NULL" if an argument string
           was passed. In most cases this should call "PerlIOBase_pushed()" to convert "mode" into the
           appropriate "PERLIO_F_XXXXX" flags in addition to any actions the layer itself takes.  If a layer
           is not expecting an argument it need neither save the one passed to it, nor provide "Getarg()"
           (it could perhaps "Perl_warn" that the argument was un-expected).

           Returns 0 on success. On failure returns -1 and should set errno.

       Popped
                   IV      (*Popped)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);

           Called when the layer is popped from the stack. A layer will normally be popped after "Close()"
           is called. But a layer can be popped without being closed if the program is dynamically managing
           layers on the stream. In such cases "Popped()" should free any resources (buffers, translation
           tables, ...) not held directly in the layer's struct.  It should also "Unread()" any unconsumed
           data that has been read and buffered from the layer below back to that layer, so that it can be
           re-provided to what ever is now above.

           Returns 0 on success and failure.  If "Popped()" returns <u>true</u> then <u>perlio.c</u> assumes that either
           the layer has popped itself, or the layer is super special and needs to be retained for other
           reasons.  In most cases it should return <u>false</u>.

       Open
                   PerlIO *        (*Open)(...);

           The "Open()" method has lots of arguments because it combines the functions of perl's "open",
           "PerlIO_open", perl's "sysopen", "PerlIO_fdopen" and "PerlIO_reopen".  The full prototype is as
           follows:

            PerlIO *       (*Open)(pTHX_ PerlIO_funcs *tab,
                                   AV *layers, IV n,
                                   const char *mode,
                                   int fd, int imode, int perm,
                                   PerlIO *old,
                                   int narg, SV **args);

           Open should (perhaps indirectly) call "PerlIO_allocate()" to allocate a slot in the table and as-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sociate&nbsp;associate</font>
           sociate it with the layers information for the opened file, by calling "PerlIO_push".  The <u>layers</u>
           AV is an array of all the layers destined for the "PerlIO *", and any arguments passed to them, <u>n</u>
           is the index into that array of the layer being called. The macro "PerlIOArg" will return a (pos-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sibly&nbsp;(possibly</font>
           sibly "NULL") SV * for the argument passed to the layer.

           The <u>mode</u> string is an ""fopen()"-like" string which would match the regular expression
           "/^[I#]?[rwa]\+?[bt]?$/".

           The 'I' prefix is used during creation of "stdin".."stderr" via special "PerlIO_fdopen" calls;
           the '#' prefix means that this is "sysopen" and that <u>imode</u> and <u>perm</u> should be passed to "Perl-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">LIO_open3";&nbsp;"PerlLIO_open3";</font>
           LIO_open3"; 'r' means <b>r</b>ead, 'w' means <b>w</b>rite and 'a' means <b>a</b>ppend. The '+' suffix means that both
           reading and writing/appending are permitted.  The 'b' suffix means file should be binary, and 't'
           means it is text. (Almost all layers should do the IO in binary mode, and ignore the b/t bits.
           The ":crlf" layer should be pushed to handle the distinction.)

           If <u>old</u> is not "NULL" then this is a "PerlIO_reopen". Perl itself does not use this (yet?) and
           semantics are a little vague.

           If <u>fd</u> not negative then it is the numeric file descriptor <u>fd</u>, which will be open in a manner com-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">patible&nbsp;compatible</font>
           patible with the supplied mode string, the call is thus equivalent to "PerlIO_fdopen". In this
           case <u>nargs</u> will be zero.

           If <u>nargs</u> is greater than zero then it gives the number of arguments passed to "open", otherwise
           it will be 1 if for example "PerlIO_open" was called.  In simple cases SvPV_nolen(*args) is the
           pathname to open.

           Having said all that translation-only layers do not need to provide "Open()" at all, but rather
           leave the opening to a lower level layer and wait to be "pushed".  If a layer does provide
           "Open()" it should normally call the "Open()" method of next layer down (if any) and then push
           itself on top if that succeeds.

           If "PerlIO_push" was performed and open has failed, it must "PerlIO_pop" itself, since if it's
           not, the layer won't be removed and may cause bad problems.

           Returns "NULL" on failure.

       Binmode
                   IV        (*Binmode)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);

           Optional. Used when ":raw" layer is pushed (explicitly or as a result of binmode(FH)). If not
           present layer will be popped. If present should configure layer as binary (or pop itself) and
           return 0.  If it returns -1 for error "binmode" will fail with layer still on the stack.

       Getarg
                   SV *      (*Getarg)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f,
                                       CLONE_PARAMS *param, int flags);

           Optional. If present should return an SV * representing the string argument passed to the layer
           when it was pushed. e.g. ":encoding(ascii)" would return an SvPV with value "ascii". (<u>param</u> and
           <u>flags</u> arguments can be ignored in most cases)

           "Dup" uses "Getarg" to retrieve the argument originally passed to "Pushed", so you must implement
           this function if your layer has an extra argument to "Pushed" and will ever be "Dup"ed.

       Fileno
                   IV        (*Fileno)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);

           Returns the Unix/Posix numeric file descriptor for the handle. Normally "PerlIOBase_fileno()"
           (which just asks next layer down) will suffice for this.

           Returns -1 on error, which is considered to include the case where the layer cannot provide such
           a file descriptor.

       Dup
                   PerlIO * (*Dup)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f, PerlIO *o,
                                   CLONE_PARAMS *param, int flags);

           XXX: Needs more docs.

           Used as part of the "clone" process when a thread is spawned (in which case param will be
           non-NULL) and when a stream is being duplicated via '&amp;' in the "open".

           Similar to "Open", returns PerlIO* on success, "NULL" on failure.

       Read
                   SSize_t (*Read)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f, void *vbuf, Size_t count);

           Basic read operation.

           Typically will call "Fill" and manipulate pointers (possibly via the API).  "PerlIOBuf_read()"
           may be suitable for derived classes which provide "fast gets" methods.

           Returns actual bytes read, or -1 on an error.

       Unread
                   SSize_t (*Unread)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f,
                                     const void *vbuf, Size_t count);

           A superset of stdio's "ungetc()". Should arrange for future reads to see the bytes in "vbuf". If
           there is no obviously better implementation then "PerlIOBase_unread()" provides the function by
           pushing a "fake" "pending" layer above the calling layer.

           Returns the number of unread chars.

       Write
                   SSize_t (*Write)(PerlIO *f, const void *vbuf, Size_t count);

           Basic write operation.

           Returns bytes written or -1 on an error.

       Seek
                   IV      (*Seek)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f, Off_t offset, int whence);

           Position the file pointer. Should normally call its own "Flush" method and then the "Seek" method
           of next layer down.

           Returns 0 on success, -1 on failure.

       Tell
                   Off_t   (*Tell)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);

           Return the file pointer. May be based on layers cached concept of position to avoid overhead.

           Returns -1 on failure to get the file pointer.

       Close
                   IV      (*Close)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);

           Close the stream. Should normally call "PerlIOBase_close()" to flush itself and close layers
           below, and then deallocate any data structures (buffers, translation tables, ...) not  held
           directly in the data structure.

           Returns 0 on success, -1 on failure.

       Flush
                   IV      (*Flush)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);

           Should make stream's state consistent with layers below. That is, any buffered write data should
           be written, and file position of lower layers adjusted for data read from below but not actually
           consumed.  (Should perhaps "Unread()" such data to the lower layer.)

           Returns 0 on success, -1 on failure.

       Fill
                   IV      (*Fill)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);

           The buffer for this layer should be filled (for read) from layer below.  When you "subclass" Per-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lIOBuf&nbsp;PerlIOBuf</font>
           lIOBuf layer, you want to use its <b>_</b><u>read</u> method and to supply your own fill method, which fills
           the PerlIOBuf's buffer.

           Returns 0 on success, -1 on failure.

       Eof
                   IV      (*Eof)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);

           Return end-of-file indicator. "PerlIOBase_eof()" is normally sufficient.

           Returns 0 on end-of-file, 1 if not end-of-file, -1 on error.

       Error
                   IV      (*Error)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);

           Return error indicator. "PerlIOBase_error()" is normally sufficient.

           Returns 1 if there is an error (usually when "PERLIO_F_ERROR" is set, 0 otherwise.

       Clearerr
                   void    (*Clearerr)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);

           Clear end-of-file and error indicators. Should call "PerlIOBase_clearerr()" to set the "PER-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">LIO_F_XXXXX"&nbsp;"PERLIO_F_XXXXX"</font>
           LIO_F_XXXXX" flags, which may suffice.

       Setlinebuf
                   void    (*Setlinebuf)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);

           Mark the stream as line buffered. "PerlIOBase_setlinebuf()" sets the PERLIO_F_LINEBUF flag and is
           normally sufficient.

       Get_base
                   STDCHAR *       (*Get_base)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);

           Allocate (if not already done so) the read buffer for this layer and return pointer to it. Return
           NULL on failure.

       Get_bufsiz
                   Size_t  (*Get_bufsiz)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);

           Return the number of bytes that last "Fill()" put in the buffer.

       Get_ptr
                   STDCHAR *       (*Get_ptr)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);

           Return the current read pointer relative to this layer's buffer.

       Get_cnt
                   SSize_t (*Get_cnt)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);

           Return the number of bytes left to be read in the current buffer.

       Set_ptrcnt
                   void    (*Set_ptrcnt)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f,
                                         STDCHAR *ptr, SSize_t cnt);

           Adjust the read pointer and count of bytes to match "ptr" and/or "cnt".  The application (or
           layer above) must ensure they are consistent.  (Checking is allowed by the paranoid.)

       <b>Utilities</b>

       To ask for the next layer down use PerlIONext(PerlIO *f).

       To check that a PerlIO* is valid use PerlIOValid(PerlIO *f).  (All this does is really just to check
       that the pointer is non-NULL and that the pointer behind that is non-NULL.)

       PerlIOBase(PerlIO *f) returns the "Base" pointer, or in other words, the "PerlIOl*" pointer.

       PerlIOSelf(PerlIO* f, type) return the PerlIOBase cast to a type.

       Perl_PerlIO_or_Base(PerlIO* f, callback, base, failure, args) either calls the <u>callback</u> from the
       functions of the layer <u>f</u> (just by the name of the IO function, like "Read") with the <u>args</u>, or if
       there is no such callback, calls the <u>base</u> version of the callback with the same args, or if the f is
       invalid, set errno to EBADF and return <u>failure</u>.

       Perl_PerlIO_or_fail(PerlIO* f, callback, failure, args) either calls the <u>callback</u> of the functions of
       the layer <u>f</u> with the <u>args</u>, or if there is no such callback, set errno to EINVAL.  Or if the f is
       invalid, set errno to EBADF and return <u>failure</u>.

       Perl_PerlIO_or_Base_void(PerlIO* f, callback, base, args) either calls the <u>callback</u> of the functions
       of the layer <u>f</u> with the <u>args</u>, or if there is no such callback, calls the <u>base</u> version of the callback
       with the same args, or if the f is invalid, set errno to EBADF.

       Perl_PerlIO_or_fail_void(PerlIO* f, callback, args) either calls the <u>callback</u> of the functions of the
       layer <u>f</u> with the <u>args</u>, or if there is no such callback, set errno to EINVAL.  Or if the f is invalid,
       set errno to EBADF.

       <b>Implementing</b> <b>PerlIO</b> <b>Layers</b>

       If you find the implementation document unclear or not sufficient, look at the existing PerlIO layer
       implementations, which include:

       * C implementations
           The <u>perlio.c</u> and <u>perliol.h</u> in the Perl core implement the "unix", "perlio", "stdio", "crlf",
           "utf8", "byte", "raw", "pending" layers, and also the "mmap" and "win32" layers if applicable.
           (The "win32" is currently unfinished and unused, to see what is used instead in Win32, see
           "Querying the layers of filehandles" in PerlIO .)

           PerlIO::encoding, PerlIO::scalar, PerlIO::via in the Perl core.

           PerlIO::gzip and APR::PerlIO (mod_perl 2.0) on CPAN.

       * Perl implementations
           PerlIO::via::QuotedPrint in the Perl core and PerlIO::via::* on CPAN.

       If you are creating a PerlIO layer, you may want to be lazy, in other words, implement only the meth-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ods&nbsp;methods</font>
       ods that interest you.  The other methods you can either replace with the "blank" methods

           PerlIOBase_noop_ok
           PerlIOBase_noop_fail

       (which do nothing, and return zero and -1, respectively) or for certain methods you may assume a
       default behaviour by using a NULL method.  The Open method looks for help in the 'parent' layer.  The

       <b>Core</b> <b>Layers</b>

       The file "perlio.c" provides the following layers:

       "unix"
           A basic non-buffered layer which calls Unix/POSIX "read()", "write()", "lseek()", "close()". No
           buffering. Even on platforms that distinguish between O_TEXT and O_BINARY this layer is always
           O_BINARY.

       "perlio"
           A very complete generic buffering layer which provides the whole of PerlIO API. It is also
           intended to be used as a "base class" for other layers. (For example its "Read()" method is
           implemented in terms of the "Get_cnt()"/"Get_ptr()"/"Set_ptrcnt()" methods).

           "perlio" over "unix" provides a complete replacement for stdio as seen via PerlIO API. This is
           the default for USE_PERLIO when system's stdio does not permit perl's "fast gets" access, and
           which do not distinguish between "O_TEXT" and "O_BINARY".

       "stdio"
           A layer which provides the PerlIO API via the layer scheme, but implements it by calling system's
           stdio. This is (currently) the default if system's stdio provides sufficient access to allow
           perl's "fast gets" access and which do not distinguish between "O_TEXT" and "O_BINARY".

       "crlf"
           A layer derived using "perlio" as a base class. It provides Win32-like "\n" to CR,LF translation.
           Can either be applied above "perlio" or serve as the buffer layer itself. "crlf" over "unix" is
           the default if system distinguishes between "O_TEXT" and "O_BINARY" opens. (At some point "unix"
           will be replaced by a "native" Win32 IO layer on that platform, as Win32's read/write layer has
           various drawbacks.) The "crlf" layer is a reasonable model for a layer which transforms data in
           some way.

       "mmap"
           If Configure detects "mmap()" functions this layer is provided (with "perlio" as a "base") which
           does "read" operations by <u>mmap()</u>ing the file. Performance improvement is marginal on modern sys-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tems,&nbsp;systems,</font>
           tems, so it is mainly there as a proof of concept. It is likely to be unbundled from the core at
           some point. The "mmap" layer is a reasonable model for a minimalist "derived" layer.

       "pending"
           An "internal" derivative of "perlio" which can be used to provide <u>Unread()</u> function for layers
           which have no buffer or cannot be bothered.  (Basically this layer's "Fill()" pops itself off the
           stack and so resumes reading from layer below.)

       "raw"
           A dummy layer which never exists on the layer stack. Instead when "pushed" it actually pops the
           stack removing itself, it then calls Binmode function table entry on all the layers in the stack
           - normally this (via PerlIOBase_binmode) removes any layers which do not have "PERLIO_K_RAW" bit
           set. Layers can modify that behaviour by defining their own Binmode entry.

       "utf8"
           Another dummy layer. When pushed it pops itself and sets the "PERLIO_F_UTF8" flag on the layer
           which was (and now is once more) the top of the stack.

       In addition <u>perlio.c</u> also provides a number of "PerlIOBase_xxxx()" functions which are intended to be
       used in the table slots of classes which do not need to do anything special for a particular method.

       <b>Extension</b> <b>Layers</b>

       Layers can made available by extension modules. When an unknown layer is encountered the PerlIO code
       will perform the equivalent of :

          use PerlIO 'layer';

       Where <u>layer</u> is the unknown layer. <u>PerlIO.pm</u> will then attempt to:

          require PerlIO::layer;

       If after that process the layer is still not defined then the "open" will fail.

       The following extension layers are bundled with perl:

       ":encoding"
              use Encoding;

           makes this layer available, although <u>PerlIO.pm</u> "knows" where to find it.  It is an example of a
           layer which takes an argument as it is called thus:

              open( $fh, "&lt;:encoding(iso-8859-7)", $pathname );

       ":scalar"
           Provides support for reading data from and writing data to a scalar.

              open( $fh, "+&lt;:scalar", \$scalar );

           When a handle is so opened, then reads get bytes from the string value of <u>$scalar</u>, and writes
           change the value. In both cases the position in <u>$scalar</u> starts as zero but can be altered via
           "seek", and determined via "tell".

           Please note that this layer is implied when calling <u>open()</u> thus:

              open( $fh, "+&lt;", \$scalar );

       ":via"
           Provided to allow layers to be implemented as Perl code.  For instance:

              use PerlIO::via::StripHTML;
              open( my $fh, "&lt;:via(StripHTML)", "index.html" );

           See PerlIO::via for details.

<b>TODO</b>
       Things that need to be done to improve this document.

          Explain how to make a valid fh without going through <u>open()</u>(i.e. apply a layer). For example if
           the file is not opened through perl, but we want to get back a fh, like it was opened by Perl.

           How PerlIO_apply_layera fits in, where its docs, was it made public?

           Currently the example could be something like this:

             PerlIO *foo_to_PerlIO(pTHX_ char *mode, ...)
             {
                 char *mode; /* "w", "r", etc */
                 const char *layers = ":APR"; /* the layer name */
                 PerlIO *f = PerlIO_allocate(aTHX);
                 if (!f) {
                     return NULL;
                 }

                 PerlIO_apply_layers(aTHX_ f, mode, layers);

                 if (f) {
                     PerlIOAPR *st = PerlIOSelf(f, PerlIOAPR);
                     /* fill in the st struct, as in _open() */
                     st-&gt;file = file;
                     <!-- a -->PerlIOBase(f)<!-- /a -->-&gt;flags |= PERLIO_F_OPEN;

                     return f;
                 }
                 return NULL;
             }

          fix/add the documentation in places marked as XXX.

          The handling of errors by the layer is not specified. e.g. when $!  should be set explicitly,
           when the error handling should be just delegated to the top layer.

           Probably give some hints on using <u>SETERRNO()</u> or pointers to where they can be found.

          I think it would help to give some concrete examples to make it easier to understand the API. Of
           course I agree that the API has to be concise, but since there is no second document that is more
           of a guide, I think that it'd make it easier to start with the doc which is an API, but has exam-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ples&nbsp;examples</font>
           ples in it in places where things are unclear, to a person who is not a PerlIO guru (yet).
