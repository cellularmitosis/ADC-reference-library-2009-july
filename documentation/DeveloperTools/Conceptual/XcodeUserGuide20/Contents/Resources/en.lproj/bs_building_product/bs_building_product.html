in a target into a product, you must build that target. You can
build from the Xcode application or from the command-line, using <code>xcodebuild</code>. Building
from the application provides detailed feedback about the progress
of the build operation and integration with the Xcode user interface.
For example, when you build from the Xcode application, you can
easily jump from an error message to its location in a source file,
make the fix and try the build again. Building from the command
line lets you easily automate builds of a large number of targets
across multiple projects. </p>
<p>This chapter describes how to initiate a build from the Xcode
application or from the command line; describes build locations
in Xcode and shows you how to create a shared build folder; and
shows you how to view build status, errors, and warnings in Xcode.</p>

<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000833-BAJCIICC" title="Build Locations"></a><h2>Build Locations</h2>
<p>When Xcode builds a target, it generates intermediate files,
such as object files, as well as the product defined by the target. As
you build software with Xcode, you need to know where Xcode places
the output of a build. For example, suppose you have an application in
one project that depends on a library created by a second project.
When building the application, Xcode must be able to locate the
library to link it into the application.</p>
<p>By default, Xcode places both the build products and the intermediate
files that it generates in the build folder inside of your project
directory. If the software you are developing is contained in a
single project, this default location is probably fine. However, if
you have many interdependent targets&#8212;particularly if these targets
are divided across multiple projects&#8212;you&#8217;ll need a shared build
folder to ensure that Xcode can automatically find and use the product
created by each of those targets.</p>
<p>Xcode lets you control where the results of a build are placed. In
the Building pane of the Xcode Preferences window, you can specify
where Xcode should put build products&#8212;that is, the products of
a build&#8212;for all projects that you create. You can override this
location on a per-project basis. Therefore, a useful approach is
to set your Building preferences to support your most common behavior,
then change that behavior in a particular project when you need
a different behavior.</p>
<p>For example, if you are developing a group of related applications,
libraries, plug-ins, and so on, you might set a shared build location
in Xcode Preferences. Then the output of each project will end up
in the same location, and can be accessed when building the other projects
(such as the previously-mentioned application that needs to link
to a separately-built library).</p>
<p>Xcode also supports the concept of an installation location,
which is supported by the Deployment Location and Installation Path
build settings. If you&#8217;re building a Deployment build and you
turn on the Deployment Location build setting and you supply a path
for the Installation Path build setting, the built product is placed
at the specified location.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000833-DontLinkElementID_35" title="Changing the Default Build Location for All Projects"></a><h3>Changing the Default Build
Location for All Projects</h3>
<p>When you first start up Xcode as a new user, Xcode asks you
to specify the directories in which it places the files generated
by the build system, both intermediate files and built products.
This default build location is used for all new projects that you
create. </p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t supply a build location, Xcode sets the path
to the build folder to <code>/</code>, indicating a relative
path in the project directory. Xcode creates a build folder in the
project directory and places any build products in this build folder;
by default, it also places intermediate files in a subdirectory
of the build folder. </p>
<p>You can change the default build location used for projects
that you create in the Building pane of the Xcode Preferences window.
To open this pane, choose Xcode &gt; Preferences and click Building. <span class="content_text">Figure 27-1</span> shows
the Building pane of the Xcode Preferences window.</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000833-BAJBIFHD" title="Figure 27-1Specifying the default location for build results"></a><p><strong>Figure 27-1&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Specifying the default location for
build results</p><img src = "../Art/buildlocationinprefs.gif" alt = "" width="628" height="478"></div><br/>
<p>To specify the default location for build products, use the
&#8220;Place Build Products in&#8221; options. These are:</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Project directory. Xcode
places build products in the <code>build</code> folder
inside of the project directory. This option is set in Xcode by
default.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Customized location. Xcode places build products in the folder
identified in this field. Type the full path to the folder, or click
Choose and navigate to the folder you want to use.</p><p>Choose this
option to create a shared build folder into which Xcode places the
build products of all of your projects. When Xcode builds a target,
it looks first in the project&#8217;s build location for any files it
depends upon. For example, given an application target that links
against a library built by a target in different project, using
a shared build folder, Xcode automatically finds the most recently
built version of the library and links against it when it builds
the application. Without a shared build folder, you must manually
add the library&#8217;s build folder into the application&#8217;s library
search path.</p><p>People who use the same project can set
their own build folders. This means that every person on a team
can have his or her own shared build folder.</p><div class="notebox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000833-DontLinkElementID_257" title="Note"></a><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp; If
you use a shared build folder, your products must have different
names. Otherwise, products with the same name overwrite each other.</p></div></li></ul>
<p>To set the default location used for the intermediate files&#8212;such
as object files&#8212;generated by Xcode during a build, use the &#8220;Place
Intermediate Build Files in&#8221; options. Choose one of the following:</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>With build
products. Xcode places the intermediate build files at the same location
as the build products, whether this is in the project directory
or in a separate folder that you have specified. This option is
set in Xcode by default.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Customized location. Xcode places intermediate files in the
folder identified in this field. Type the full path to the folder,
or click Choose and navigate to the folder you want to use.</p></li></ul>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000833-DontLinkElementID_36" title="Overriding the Default Build Location for a Project"></a><h3>Overriding the Default Build
Location for a Project</h3>
<p>Each time you create a new project, Xcode sets the build location
for that project to the default build location specified in the
Building pane of the Xcode Preferences window. You can, however,
override this default build location on a per-project basis. This
lets you choose a default build location that works best for most
of your projects, and specify another location for the build results
of individual projects as needed.</p>
<p>You can override the build location used for an individual
project in the General pane of the project inspector. To override
the default location for a project&#8217;s build products, use the options
under &#8220;Place Build Products In.&#8221; These are:</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Default build
products location. Xcode uses the default location for build products, specified
in Xcode Preferences. This option is set by default for each project
you create.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Custom location. Xcode places the build products for the project
in the folder specified in this field. Type the full path to the
folder in the text field, or click Choose and navigate to the desired
location.</p></li></ul>
<p>To override the default location for a project&#8217;s intermediate
build files, use the options under &#8220;Place Intermediate Build Files
In.&#8221; These are: </p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Default intermediates location.
Xcode uses the default location for intermediate build files, as
specified in Xcode Preferences. This option is set by default for each
project you create.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Build products location. Xcode places intermediate build files
with the build products, whether this is the default location specified
in Xcode Preferences or a separate location specified for the individual
project.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Custom location. Xcode places the intermediate build files
for the project in the folder specified in this field. Type the full path
to the folder in the text field, or click Choose and select the
folder in the resulting dialog.</p></li></ul>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000833-DontLinkElementID_37" title="Building From the Xcode Application"></a><h2>Building From the Xcode Application</h2>
<p>You can perform all of the common build operations directly
in the Xcode application. Building in the Xcode application, you
can view build system output, see error and warning messages, and
jump to the location of an error or warning in source files, all
in a single window.</p>
<p>You can perform a full build of the active target and any
targets on which it depends, compile a single file, or view the
preprocessor output for a file. You can also remove the build products
and intermediate files generated by the build system for a target.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000833-BAJFIBIH" title="Setting the Active Target and Build Style"></a><h3>Setting the Active Target and
Build Style</h3>
<p>When you build from the Xcode application, Xcode uses the
current, or active, target to determine which product to create. Xcode also
applies any build settings defined by the active build style to
the target and its dependencies. </p>
<p>Before you start a build, make sure that the target you want
to build is the active target. To make a target active, you can
choose it from the Active Target pop-up menu or from the Project
&gt; Set Active Target menu. </p>
<p>To make a build style active, choose it from the Active Build
Style pop-up menu in the Build Results window, or choose it from
the Project &gt; Set Active Build Style menu. </p>
<p>To learn more about configuring a target, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../bs_targets/bs_targets.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH227-CIHEHECG">“Targets”</a></span>; to learn how to configure
a build style, see <span class="content_text"><a href="../bs_build_styles/bs_build_styles.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001440-CH230-CJBGEAAG">“Editing Build Styles.”</a></span></p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000833-BAJGFGCD" title="Initiating a Full Build"></a><h3>Initiating a Full Build</h3>
<p>When it does a full build of a target, the build system performs
all of the tasks specified by the build phases in that target, and
in all targets that it depends on. After the initial build of the
target, Xcode performs only those actions necessary to update changed
files during subsequent builds. For example, if the only change
to the target since the last time it was built was a minor edit
to a single source code file, Xcode recompiles that file and relinks the
object files to create the finished product.</p>
<p>There are several different ways you can initiate a build:</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>To build
the active target&#8217;s product, choose Build &gt; Build or click
the Build button. </p></li>
<li class="li"><p>To build the active target&#8217;s product and run it if the build
succeeds, choose Build &gt; Build and Run, or click the Build and
Run button. </p></li>
<li class="li"><p>To build the active target&#8217;s product and start the debugger
if the build succeeds, choose Build &gt; Build and Debug, or click
the Build and Debug button. </p></li></ul>
<p>You may encounter errors or warnings when building your target;
see <span class="content_text"><a href="bs_building_product.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000833-BAJBHEFI">“Viewing Errors and Warnings”</a></span> for information on how to find
and fix build errors. </p>
<p>If your product does not build properly and there are no error
messages, make sure your files have correct dates. Files with invalid
dates (before 1970) won&#8217;t compile correctly. </p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000833-DontLinkElementID_38" title="Viewing Preprocessor Output"></a><h3>Viewing Preprocessor Output</h3>
<p>You can see the preprocessor output for a C, C++, or Objective-C
source file in the active target. To do so, select that file and
choose Build &gt; Preprocess.</p>
<p>You can see a list of all <code>#define</code> directives
in effect for a file by adding the flag <code>-dM</code> to
the Other C Flags (OTHER_C_FLAGS) build setting in your target.
Instead of the normal preprocessor output, Xcode shows all of the
macros defined during the execution of the preprocessor (including
predefined macros) when you choose Build &gt; Preprocess. For more
information on the C preprocessor, see <em>GNU C Preprocessor</em>.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000833-DontLinkElementID_39" title="Compiling a Single File"></a><h3>Compiling a Single File</h3>
<p>A full build can take a long time if you have a large project.
You can compile a single file to ensure that it builds correctly
without having to rebuild the entire target. To compile a single
file</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><p>Open the
file in an editor window or select the file in the Groups &amp;
Files list.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Choose Build &gt; Compile or type Command-K. You can also
Control-click in the editor or on the file in the Groups &amp; Files
list to bring up a contextual menu. Choose Compile from this menu
to build the file.</p></li></ol>
<p>The file must be part of the active target. Note that if you
are trying to compile a file that is open in an editor, the editor
must have focus for the Compile menu item to be available.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000833-DontLinkElementID_40" title="Cleaning a Target"></a><h3>Cleaning a Target</h3>
<p>As you learned in <span class="content_text"><a href="bs_building_product.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000833-BAJGFGCD">“Initiating a Full Build,”</a></span> after the initial build of a target,
Xcode performs only those actions required to update changed files
during subsequent builds. You can, however, force Xcode to do a
full rebuild of the target by cleaning that target and rebuilding. </p>
<p>When you clean a target, Xcode removes all of the product
files, as well as any object files (.o files) or other intermediate
files created during the build process. The next time you build,
every file in every build phase is processed according to the action
associated with that phase. </p>
<p>To clean only the active target, choose Build &gt; Clean or
click the Clean button. To clean all targets in your project, choose
Build &gt; Clean All Targets or click the Clean All button.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000833-BAJGIFGI" title="Viewing Build Status"></a><h2>Viewing Build Status</h2>
<p>During a build, you want to see how that build is progressing.
Especially for long build operations, it is useful to know the status
of that operation. When you build from the Xcode application, Xcode
displays the build status in the project window status bar. The
status bar message lets you know the operation currently being performed,
as in the figure below. It also displays the name of the target
and build style used for the build. When the build is complete,
Xcode displays the result of the build&#8212;whether the build succeeded
or failed and whether there were any errors or warnings&#8212;on the
right side of the status bar. </p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000833-DontLinkElementID_258" title="Figure 27-2Build status message in the project window"></a><p><strong>Figure 27-2&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Build
status message in the project window</p><img src = "../Art/buildstatusinwindow.gif" alt = "" width="861" height="47"></div><br/>
<p>You can click the build message in the status bar to see more
detailed information about the build in the Build Results window. You
can also click the progress indicator in the status bar during the
course of the build to open the Activity Viewer, as described in <span class="content_text"><a href="../pr_project_window/pr_project_window.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001204-BABBFDDD">“Viewing the Progress of Operations in Xcode.”</a></span></p>
<p>In addition, Xcode displays a progress indicator which shows
the status of the build in its dock icon. If an error or warning
occurs, Xcode indicates the number of errors or warnings with a
red badge on the dock icon.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000833-BAJIFJJB" title="Viewing Detailed Build Results"></a><h3>Viewing Detailed Build Results</h3>
<p>The Build Results window lets you see a more detailed account
of the progress of a build. It shows each step of the build process,
as well as the full output of the build system, and can take you
directly to the source of any errors or warnings. To open the Build
Results window choose Build &gt; Build Results or click the build
result message&#8212;&#8221;Failed,&#8221; &#8220;Succeeded&#8221; and so on&#8212;on the
right side of the project window status bar. <span class="content_text">Figure 27-3</span> shows
the Build Results window.</p><div class="notebox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000833-DontLinkElementID_259" title="Note"></a><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp; If
you are using the All-In-One project window layout, this opens the
Build pane in the build page. You can also navigate to this page
by clicking the hammer icon in the page control and clicking Build.

<p>Here&#8217;s what you see in the Build Results window:</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Toolbar.
The toolbar of the Build Results window contains buttons that let
you perform common build-related tasks, such as building, cleaning
a target, and running or debugging the built product. By default,
they also contain pop-up menus to let you change the active target,
active executable, and active build style.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Status Bar. The status bar displays the current status of
the build. It contains the same build information as the status
bar of the project window.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Build results. This pane shows status output from the Xcode
build system. You can control what information is shown here with
the view options described below.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>View options. The buttons below the build results pane let
you control how to view detailed build results. These options are
as follows:</p><ul class="nested">
<li class="nested li"><p>The build steps button, indicated by a checkmark icon, determines
whether each of the individual build steps is shown as part of the
detailed build results. Select this option to display each of the
individual steps used to build the product, such as compiling and
copying files. Otherwise, Xcode shows only those build steps that produce warnings
or errors.</p></li>
<li class="nested li"><p>The show warnings button, indicated by a warning icon, controls
whether Xcode shows warning messages in the detailed build results. If
this option is selected, Xcode displays both error and warning messages;
otherwise, Xcode shows only error messages.</p></li>
<li class="nested li"><p>The build log button, indicated by an icon showing console
text, opens and closes the build log, described below. Select this
option to reveal the build log; deselect it to close the build log.</p></li>
<li class="nested li"><p>The arrow button brings up a menu that lets you choose when
to display detailed build results. You can have Xcode automatically
show and hide the Build Results window in the course of a build.
To specify when detailed build results are shown, choose an item
under &#8220;Temporarily Open During [<em>project name</em>]
Builds.&#8221; To specify when detailed build results are hidden, choose
an item under &#8220;Temporarily Hide After [<em>project name</em>]
Builds.&#8221; These options are described further in <span class="content_text"><a href="bs_building_product.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000833-BAJDBGGE">“Specifying When Detailed Build Results are Shown.”</a></span></p><p>Choosing an item from
this menu affects only the current project. Changes made here do
not persist across Xcode sessions. To set the default behavior of
the Build Results window for all projects choose Open Global Build
Preferences to open Xcode Preferences.</p></li></ul></li>
<li class="li"><p>Build log. The build log displays all of the commands used
to build your target and the outputs of those commands, including
compiler invocations. For example, you can see the flags passed
to the compiler in this log. You can show and hide the build log
using the build log button. When you select a build step in the
top pane of the build window, Xcode selects the corresponding command
in the build log.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Editor. The Build Results window includes an attached editor.
Selecting an error or warning message in the build results pane

<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000833-BAJDBGGE" title="Specifying When Detailed Build Results are Shown"></a><h3>Specifying When Detailed Build
Results are Shown</h3>
<p>Having to open and close the Build Results window can get
repetitive if you do it every time you build. If you know you always
want to see the detailed build results when building, you can have
Xcode automatically open the Build Results window when you start
a build. Likewise, you can have Xcode automatically close the Build
Results window when the build is complete. Xcode provides preferences
to control the default behavior of the Build Results window. By
default, Xcode does not automatically open or close the Build Results
window when building.</p>
<p>To change Xcode&#8217;s default behavior for showing and hiding
detailed build results for all projects, choose Xcode &gt; Preferences
and click Building. Under &#8220;Build Results Window,&#8221; use the following
menus:</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>To control
when the Build Results window is shown, use the &#8220;Open during builds&#8221; menu</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>To control when the Build Results window is hidden, use the
&#8220;Close after builds&#8221; menu.</p></li></ul>
<p>You can temporarily override this default behavior for an
individual project using the pop-up menu in the Build Results window,
as described in <span class="content_text"><a href="bs_building_product.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000833-BAJIFJJB">“Viewing Detailed Build Results.”</a></span></p>
<p>Choose one of the following options to control when the Build
Results window is shown:</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Never. Xcode
does not automatically open the Build Results window. This is the default
value of this setting.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Always. Xcode always automatically opens the Build Results
window when a build starts.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>On Errors. Xcode automatically opens the Build Results window
only if an error is encountered during the build.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>On Errors or Warnings. Xcode automatically opens the Build
Results window when an error or warning occurs.</p></li></ul>
<p>Choose one of the following options to control when the Build
Results window is hidden:</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Never. Once
opened, the Build Results window stays open until you close it or
the project. This is the default value for this setting.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Always. Xcode automatically closes the Build Results window immediately
after the build stops, whether the build was successful or not.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>On Success. Xcode automatically closes the Build Results window when
the build successfully completes and the product is built.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>On No Errors. Xcode automatically closes the Build Results
window after the build is complete only if there are no errors.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>On No Errors or Warnings. Xcode automatically closes the Build Results
window after the build is complete only if there are no errors or
warnings.</p></li></ul>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000833-BAJBHEFI" title="Viewing Errors and Warnings"></a><h2>Viewing Errors and Warnings</h2>
<p>The Xcode application lets you easily see any errors or warnings
generated during a build. You can view errors and warnings directly
in the project window with the Errors and Warnings smart group,
or you can view them in the Build Results window. You can also jump
directly from the error or warning message to the location of errors
or warnings in source files. This lets you quickly fix the problem
and try the build again. </p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000833-DontLinkElementID_41" title="Viewing Errors and Warnings in the Project Window"></a><h3>Viewing Errors and Warnings
in the Project Window</h3>
<p>If you prefer to keep the project window in front of you while
you are working, Xcode lets you view errors and warnings directly
in the project window. You can view errors and warnings in the Errors
and Warnings smart group in the Groups &amp; Files list, as shown below.
Before you build your project, the Errors and Warnings group is
empty; it is populated as errors and warnings occur during the build.</p>
<p>To view errors and warnings, you can:</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Click the
disclosure triangle next to the Errors and Warnings smart group.
This displays the list of files in which errors or warnings occurred.
To see the errors and warning messages for a particular file, select
that file.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Select the Errors and Warnings smart group in the Groups &amp;
Files list. This displays all errors and warnings generated during
the last build attempt in the detail view.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Click the error or warning icon that appears on the right
of the project window or editor window status bar. This opens the
Build Results window and selects the first error or warning in the
build steps pane and in the build log.</p></li></ul>
<p>You can also specify that Xcode automatically open the Errors
and Warnings smart group in the Groups &amp; Files view when an
error or warning occurs during a build, as described later in this
section. </p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000833-DontLinkElementID_260" title="Figure 27-4Viewing errors and warnings in the project window"></a><p><strong>Figure 27-4&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Viewing
errors and warnings in the project window</p><img src = "../Art/errorinprojwindow.gif" alt = "" width="665" height="407"></div><br/>
<p>When you select the Error and Warnings group or any of its
members in the Groups &amp; Files list, the detail view to the right
displays the error and warning messages and the location at which
each occurred. The icon next to each item in the detail view identifies
it as an error or a warning. </p>
<p>Similar to the Build Results window, you can have Xcode automatically
show and hide the contents of the Errors and Warnings smart group.
To control when Xcode hides and shows the contents of the Errors
and Warnings smart group, choose Xcode &gt; Preferences, click Building,
and use the menus under &#8220;Errors and Warnings Smart Group.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;Open during builds&#8221; menu lets you choose when Xcode
automatically selects the Errors and Warnings smart group and discloses
its contents in the Groups &amp; Files list. It provides the following
options:</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Never. Xcode
does not automatically open the Errors and Warnings smart group, even
if an error or warning occurs during a build. This is the default.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Always. Xcode always automatically opens the Errors and Warnings
smart group when a build starts.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>On Errors. Xcode automatically opens the Errors and Warnings
group only if an error is encountered in the build.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>On Errors and Warnings. Xcode automatically opens the Errors
and Warnings group if an error or warning occurs during the build.</p></li></ul>
<p>The &#8220;Close after builds&#8221; menu gives you the following
options for controlling when Xcode hides the Errors and Warnings
group:</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Never. Once
opened, the Errors and Warnings group stays open until you close
it. This is the default.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Always. Xcode automatically closes the Errors and Warnings
group immediately after the build stops.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>On Success. Xcode automatically closes the Errors and Warnings
group when the build is successfully completed and the product is
built.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>On No Errors. If there are no errors, Xcode automatically
closes the Errors and Warnings group after the build is complete.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>On No Warnings. If there are no errors or warnings, Xcode
automatically closes the Errors and Warnings group after the build
is complete.</p></li></ul>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000833-DontLinkElementID_42" title="Viewing Errors and Warnings in the Build Results Window"></a><h3>Viewing Errors and Warnings
in the Build Results Window</h3>
<p>The Build Results window also displays all the warnings and
errors that occur as Xcode builds your target. The example below
shows an error in the Build Results window.</p>
<br/><div><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000833-DontLinkElementID_261" title="Figure 27-5An error in the Build Results window"></a><p><strong>Figure 27-5&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>An
error in the Build Results window</p><img src = "../Art/errorinbuildwindow.gif" alt = "" width="594" height="477"></div><br/>
<p>To navigate through warning and error messages even when the
Build Results window is hidden, choose Build &gt; Next Build Warning
or Error (Command&#8211;equals-sign) and Build &gt; Previous Build Warning
or Error (Command&#8211;plus-sign). This highlights the next error or warning
in the Build Results window. It does not, however, bring the Build
Results window forward if it is hidden. If you are working in an
editor window, choosing Build &gt; Next / Previous Build Warning
or Error highlights the line at which the error or warning occurred,
opening the related file if it is not already open.</p>
<p>You can easily copy error and warning messages, so you can
include them in email messages or other documents. To copy error
and warning messages, select the messages and drag them to another
document.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000833-DontLinkElementID_43" title="Viewing Source Code for an Error or Warning"></a><h3>Viewing Source Code for an
Error or Warning</h3>
<p>From either the project window or the Build Results window,
you can jump directly to the source code associated with an error
or warning. In the project window, select the error or warning in
the detail view; in the Build Results window, select the error or
warning in the build steps pane. If the option to automatically
disclose the attached editor is enabled, Xcode reveals the editor
in the project or Build Results window and opens the source file to
the location of the problem. Otherwise, you can double-click the
error or warning to open the file in a separate editor window.</p>
<p>Xcode also displays error and warning icons in the gutter
of the editor, next to the lines at which the errors and warnings
occurred. This allows you to easily spot the errors and warnings
in a file, either from the attached editor in the project or Build
Results windows, or from a dedicated editor window. Marks in the
scrollbar of an editor let you quickly scroll to the location of
an error or warning; you can Option-click on a mark to jump to that location.
If you pause with the mouse above an error or warning in the status
bar, the detail view, or the gutter, Xcode displays a tooltip with
the full text of the error message.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000833-DontLinkElementID_44" title="Controlling Errors and Warnings"></a><h3>Controlling Errors and Warnings</h3>
<p>You can choose what Xcode does when it first encounters an
error while building a project. To choose whether Xcode stops building when
it encounters an errors or continues to compile the next file in the
target, choose Xcode &gt; Preferences and click Building. Use the
&#8220;Continue building after errors&#8221; checkbox in the Build Options.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000833-BAJDHEEG" title="Building From the Command Line"></a><h2>Building From the Command Line</h2>
<p>In addition to building your product from within the Xcode
application, you can use <code>xcodebuild</code> to
build a target from the command line. Building from the command
line gives you additional flexibility compared to building from
within the Xcode application that may be useful in certain circumstances.
For example, using the <code>xcodebuild</code> tool,
you can create a script that automatically builds your product at
a specific time or build targets from multiple projects at the same
time.</p><div class="notebox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000833-DontLinkElementID_262" title="Note"></a><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;If
you need root privileges to install a product in its deployment
location, you must build the product with the <code>xcodebuild</code> tool, because
Xcode cannot grant you these privileges. </p></div>
<p>The <code>xcodebuild</code> tool
reads your <code>.xcode</code> project
bundle and uses the target information it finds there to build a
product. However, there are differences between building within Xcode and
building from the command line:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>When you
build within Xcode, it uses the active target and build style. When
you build from the command line, <code>xcodebuild</code> uses
the first target in the project&#8217;s target list and no build style,
unless you specify a target or build style with a command-line option.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>If you run <code>xcodebuild</code> as
the root user, the preferences you set in the Xcode Preferences window
are not used. Preferences are stored per user, and there are no
preferences stored for the root user (unless you logged in as root
and used Xcode at some point).</p></li></ul>
<p>To build a target using <code>xcodebuild</code>,
use the <code>cd</code> command to
change to your project&#8217;s directory and enter the <code>xcodebuild</code> command
with any command-line options you wish to specify. The project&#8217;s
directory contains your project&#8217;s <code>.xcode</code> bundle.
For example, if your project is in <code>~me/Projects/MyProj</code>,
enter <code>cd ~me/Projects/MyProj</code>.</p>
<p>You can use <code>xcodebuild</code> to
build a product suited for deployment and install the product in its
final destination path. To do that, use the <code>xcodebuild</code> tool
with the <code>install</code> option,
which places the product in the distribution root specified by the
DSTROOT, Installation Path (INSTALL_PATH), and Deployment Location
(DEPLOYMENT_LOCATION) build settings. For example, to install a
framework in <code>/Library/Frameworks</code>,
configure the build settings as shown in <span class="content_text">Table 27-1</span>.</p>
