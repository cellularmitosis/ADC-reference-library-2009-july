The folder contains the following sub-folders:¥ Rotation Controller demo 1.0.1          This folder contains a demo program and an experiment showing five rotation controller interfaces for rotating three-dimensional objects with the mouse.¥ Virtual Sphere Sample Code 1.1          This folder contains the source code for implementing the Virtual Sphere rotation controller.  For those who have asked me for source code, here it is!¥ Related Papers          This folder contains an electronic version of the paper "A Study in Interactive 3-D Rotation Using 2-D Control Devices" by Michael Chen, S. Joy Mountford and Abigail Sellen published in the ACM Siggraph '88 proceedings (Volume 22, Number 4, August 1988).  It describes the issues of designing 3-D rotational interfaces and an experiment to compare these interfaces.
