For example, theStudio enterprise object corresponds to the STUDIO table in thedatabase, which has NAME and BUDGET columns. The Studio enterpriseobject class in turn has <code>name</code> and <code>budget</code> instancevariables, or class properties (instance variables based on databasedata are called "class properties"). In the application, Studioobjects are instantiated using the data from a corresponding databaserow, as shown in the following figure:</font></p> <img src = "../Art/eo.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/eo.gif]"><p><font face="Times">The enterprise objects in your application do not merely forma static representation of your database data, however. Enterpriseobjects add behavior to your data. For example, the Studio enterpriseobject class has a method for calculating the studio's portfoliovalue based on the revenue of its movies. It also has a method forbuying all of the movies starring a specified actor.</font></p><p><font face="Times">In Java Client WebObjects applications, Enterprise ObjectsFramework manages the interaction between the database (on the server),your enterprise objects (on the server and client), and the userinterface (on the client).
