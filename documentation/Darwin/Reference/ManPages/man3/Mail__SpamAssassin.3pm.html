Mail::SpamAssassin(3)                User Contributed Perl Documentation               Mail::SpamAssassin(3)



<b>NAME</b>
       Mail::SpamAssassin - Spam detector and markup engine

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
         my $spamtest = Mail::SpamAssassin-&gt;new();
         my $mail = $spamtest-&gt;parse($message);
         my $status = $spamtest-&gt;check($mail);

         if ($status-&gt;is_spam()) {
           $message = $status-&gt;rewrite_mail();
         }
         else {
           ...
         }
         ...

         $status-&gt;finish();
         $mail-&gt;finish();

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       Mail::SpamAssassin is a module to identify spam using several methods including text analysis,
       internet-based realtime blacklists, statistical analysis, and internet-based hashing algorithms.

       Using its rule base, it uses a wide range of heuristic tests on mail headers and body text to
       identify "spam", also known as unsolicited bulk email.  Once identified as spam, the mail can then be
       tagged as spam for later filtering using the user's own mail user agent application or at the mail
       transfer agent.

       If you wish to use a command-line filter tool, try the "spamassassin" or the "spamd"/"spamc" tools
       provided.

<b>METHODS</b>
       $t = Mail::SpamAssassin-&gt;new( { opt =&gt; val, ... } )
           Constructs a new "Mail::SpamAssassin" object.  You may pass a hash reference to the constructor
           which may contain the following attribute- value pairs.

           debug
               This is the debug options used to determine logging level.  It exists to allow sections of
               debug messages (called "facilities") to be enabled or disabled.  If this is a string, it is
               treated as a comma-delimited list of the debug facilities.  If it's a hash reference, then
               the keys are treated as the list of debug facilities and if it's a array reference, then the
               elements are treated as the list of debug facilities.

               There are also two special cases: (1) if the special case of "info" is passed as a debug
               facility, then all informational messages are enabled; (2) if the special case of "all" is
               passed as a debug facility, then all debugging facilities are enabled.

           rules_filename
               The filename/directory to load spam-identifying rules from. (optional)

           site_rules_filename
               The directory to load site-specific spam-identifying rules from. (optional)

           userprefs_filename
               The filename to load preferences from. (optional)

           userstate_dir
               The directory user state is stored in. (optional)

           config_tree_recurse
               Set to 1 to recurse through directories when reading configuration files, instead of just
               reading a single level.  (optional, default 0)

           config_text
               The text of all rules and preferences.  If you prefer not to load the rules from files, read
               them in yourself and set this instead.  As a result, this will override the settings for
               "rules_filename", "site_rules_filename", and "userprefs_filename".

           post_config_text
               Similar to "config_text", this text is placed after config_text to allow an override of
               config files.

           force_ipv4
               If set to 1, DNS tests will not attempt to use IPv6. Use if the existing tests for IPv6
               availablity produce incorrect results or crashes.

           languages_filename
               If you want to be able to use the language-guessing rule "UNWANTED_LANGUAGE_BODY", and are
               using "config_text" instead of "rules_filename", "site_rules_filename", and
               "userprefs_filename", you will need to set this.  It should be the path to the <b>languages</b> file
               normally found in the SpamAssassin <b>rules</b> directory.

           local_tests_only
               If set to 1, no tests that require internet access will be performed. (default: 0)

           ignore_site_cf_files
               If set to 1, any rule files found in the "site_rules_filename" directory will be ignored.
               *.pre files (used for loading plugins) found in the "site_rules_filename" directory will
               still be used. (default: 0)

           dont_copy_prefs
               If set to 1, the user preferences file will not be created if it doesn't already exist.
               (default: 0)

           save_pattern_hits
               If set to 1, the patterns hit can be retrieved from the "Mail::SpamAssassin::PerMsgStatus"
               object.  Used for debugging.

           home_dir_for_helpers
               If set, the <b>HOME</b> environment variable will be set to this value when using test applications
               that require their configuration data, such as Razor, Pyzor and DCC.

           username
               If set, the "username" attribute will use this as the current user's name.  Otherwise, the
               default is taken from the runtime environment (ie. this process' effective UID under UNIX).

           If none of "rules_filename", "site_rules_filename", "userprefs_filename", or "config_text" is
           set, the "Mail::SpamAssassin" module will search for the configuration files in the usual
           installed locations using the below variable definitions which can be passed in.

           PREFIX
               Used as the root for certain directory paths such as:

                 '__prefix__/etc/mail/spamassassin'
                 '__prefix__/etc/spamassassin'

               Defaults to "@@PREFIX@@".

           DEF_RULES_DIR
               Location where the default rules are installed.  Defaults to "@@DEF_RULES_DIR@@".

           LOCAL_RULES_DIR
               Location where the local site rules are installed.  Defaults to "@@LOCAL_RULES_DIR@@".

           LOCAL_STATE_DIR
               Location of the local state directory, mainly used for installing updates via "sa-update" and
               compiling rulesets to native code.  Defaults to "@@LOCAL_STATE_DIR@@".

       parse($message, $parse_now)
           Parse will return a Mail::SpamAssassin::Message object with just the headers parsed.  When
           calling this function, there are two optional parameters that can be passed in: $message is
           either undef (which will use STDIN), a scalar of the entire message, an array reference of the
           message with 1 line per array element, or a file glob which holds the entire contents of the
           message; and $parse_now, which specifies whether or not to create the MIME tree at parse time or
           later as necessary.

           The <u>$parse</u><b>_</b><u>now</u> option, by default, is set to false (0).  This allows SpamAssassin to not have to
           generate the tree of internal data nodes if the information is not going to be used.  This is
           handy, for instance, when running "spamassassin -d", which only needs the pristine header and
           body which is always parsed and stored by this function.

           For more information, please see the "Mail::SpamAssassin::Message" and
           "Mail::SpamAssassin::Message::Node" POD.

       $status = $f-&gt;check ($mail)
           Check a mail, encapsulated in a "Mail::SpamAssassin::Message" object, to determine if it is spam
           or not.

           Returns a "Mail::SpamAssassin::PerMsgStatus" object which can be used to test or manipulate the
           mail message.

           Note that the "Mail::SpamAssassin" object can be re-used for further messages without affecting
           this check; in OO terminology, the "Mail::SpamAssassin" object is a "factory".   However, if you
           do this, be sure to call the "finish()" method on the status objects when you're done with them.

       $status = $f-&gt;check_message_text ($mailtext)
           Check a mail, encapsulated in a plain string $mailtext, to determine if it is spam or not.

           Otherwise identical to "check()" above.

       $status = $f-&gt;learn ($mail, $id, $isspam, $forget)
           Learn from a mail, encapsulated in a "Mail::SpamAssassin::Message" object.

           If $isspam is set, the mail is assumed to be spam, otherwise it will be learnt as non-spam.

           If $forget is set, the attributes of the mail will be removed from both the non-spam and spam
           learning databases.

           $id is an optional message-identification string, used internally to tag the message.  If it is
           "undef", the Message-Id of the message will be used.  It should be unique to that message.

           Returns a "Mail::SpamAssassin::PerMsgLearner" object which can be used to manipulate the learning
           process for each mail.

           Note that the "Mail::SpamAssassin" object can be re-used for further messages without affecting
           this check; in OO terminology, the "Mail::SpamAssassin" object is a "factory".   However, if you
           do this, be sure to call the "finish()" method on the learner objects when you're done with them.

           "learn()" and "check()" can be run using the same factory.  "init_learner()" must be called
           before using this method.

       $f-&gt;init_learner ( [ { opt =&gt; val, ... } ] )
           Initialise learning.  You may pass the following attribute-value pairs to this method.

           caller_will_untie
               Whether or not the code calling this method will take care of untie'ing from the Bayes
               databases (by calling "finish_learner()") (optional, default 0).

           force_expire
               Should an expiration run be forced to occur immediately? (optional, default 0).

           learn_to_journal
               Should learning data be written to the journal, instead of directly to the databases?
               (optional, default 0).

           wait_for_lock
               Whether or not to wait a long time for locks to complete (optional, default 0).

           opportunistic_expire_check_only
               During the opportunistic journal sync and expire check, don't actually do the expire but
               report back whether or not it should occur (optional, default 0).

           no_relearn
               If doing a learn operation, and the message has already been learned as the opposite type,
               don't re-learn the message.

       $f-&gt;rebuild_learner_caches ({ opt =&gt; val })
           Rebuild any cache databases; should be called after the learning process.  Options include:
           "verbose", which will output diagnostics to "stdout" if set to 1.

       $f-&gt;finish_learner ()
           Finish learning.

       $f-&gt;<u>dump</u><b>_</b><u>bayes</u><b>_</b><u>db()</u>
           Dump the contents of the Bayes DB

       $f-&gt;signal_user_changed ( [ { opt =&gt; val, ... } ] )
           Signals that the current user has changed (possibly using "setuid"), meaning that SpamAssassin
           should close any per-user databases it has open, and re-open using ones appropriate for the new
           user.

           Note that this should be called <u>after</u> reading any per-user configuration, as that data may
           override some paths opened in this method.  You may pass the following attribute-value pairs:

           username
               The username of the user.  This will be used for the "username" attribute.

           user_dir
               A directory to use as a 'home directory' for the current user's data, overriding the system
               default.  This directory must be readable and writable by the process.  Note that the
               resulting "userstate_dir" will be the ".spamassassin" subdirectory of this dir.

           userstate_dir
               A directory to use as a directory for the current user's data, overriding the system default.
               This directory must be readable and writable by the process.  The default is
               "user_dir/.spamassassin".

       $f-&gt;report_as_spam ($mail, $options)
           Report a mail, encapsulated in a "Mail::SpamAssassin::Message" object, as human-verified spam.
           This will submit the mail message to live, collaborative, spam-blocker databases, allowing other
           users to block this message.

           It will also submit the mail to SpamAssassin's Bayesian learner.

           Options is an optional reference to a hash of options.  Currently these can be:

           dont_report_to_dcc
               Inhibits reporting of the spam to DCC.

           dont_report_to_pyzor
               Inhibits reporting of the spam to Pyzor.

           dont_report_to_razor
               Inhibits reporting of the spam to Razor.

           dont_report_to_spamcop
               Inhibits reporting of the spam to SpamCop.

       $f-&gt;revoke_as_spam ($mail, $options)
           Revoke a mail, encapsulated in a "Mail::SpamAssassin::Message" object, as human-verified ham
           (non-spam).  This will revoke the mail message from live, collaborative, spam-blocker databases,
           allowing other users to block this message.

           It will also submit the mail to SpamAssassin's Bayesian learner as nonspam.

           Options is an optional reference to a hash of options.  Currently these can be:

           dont_report_to_razor
               Inhibits revoking of the spam to Razor.

       $f-&gt;add_address_to_whitelist ($addr)
           Given a string containing an email address, add it to the automatic whitelist database.

       $f-&gt;add_all_addresses_to_whitelist ($mail)
           Given a mail message, find as many addresses in the usual headers (To, Cc, From etc.), and the
           message body, and add them to the automatic whitelist database.

       $f-&gt;remove_address_from_whitelist ($addr)
           Given a string containing an email address, remove it from the automatic whitelist database.

       $f-&gt;remove_all_addresses_from_whitelist ($mail)
           Given a mail message, find as many addresses in the usual headers (To, Cc, From etc.), and the
           message body, and remove them from the automatic whitelist database.

       $f-&gt;add_address_to_blacklist ($addr)
           Given a string containing an email address, add it to the automatic whitelist database with a
           high score, effectively blacklisting them.

       $f-&gt;add_all_addresses_to_blacklist ($mail)
           Given a mail message, find addresses in the From headers and add them to the automatic whitelist
           database with a high score, effectively blacklisting them.

           Note that To and Cc addresses are not used.

       $text = $f-&gt;remove_spamassassin_markup ($mail)
           Returns the text of the message, with any SpamAssassin-added text (such as the report, or X-Spam-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">Status&nbsp;X-SpamStatus</font>
           Status headers) stripped.

           Note that the <b>$mail</b> object is not modified.

           Warning: if the input message in <b>$mail</b> contains a mixture of CR-LF (Windows-style) and LF (UNIX-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">style)&nbsp;(UNIXstyle)</font>
           style) line endings, it will be "canonicalized" to use one or the other consistently throughout.

       $f-&gt;read_scoreonly_config ($filename)
           Read a configuration file and parse user preferences from it.

           User preferences are as defined in the "Mail::SpamAssassin::Conf" manual page.  In other words,
           they include scoring options, scores, whitelists and blacklists, and so on, but do not include
           rule definitions, privileged settings, etc. unless "allow_user_rules" is enabled; and they never
           include the administrator settings.

       $f-&gt;load_scoreonly_sql ($username)
           Read configuration paramaters from SQL database and parse scores from it.  This will only take
           effect if the perl "DBI" module is installed, and the configuration parameters "user_scores_dsn",
           "user_scores_sql_username", and "user_scores_sql_password" are set correctly.

           The username in $username will also be used for the "username" attribute of the
           Mail::SpamAssassin object.

       $f-&gt;load_scoreonly_ldap ($username)
           Read configuration paramaters from an LDAP server and parse scores from it.  This will only take
           effect if the perl "Net::LDAP" and "URI" modules are installed, and the configuration parameters
           "user_scores_dsn", "user_scores_ldap_username", and "user_scores_ldap_password" are set
           correctly.

           The username in $username will also be used for the "username" attribute of the
           Mail::SpamAssassin object.

       $f-&gt;set_persistent_address_list_factory ($factoryobj)
           Set the persistent address list factory, used to create objects for the automatic whitelist
           algorithm's persistent-storage back-end.  See "Mail::SpamAssassin::PersistentAddrList" for the
           API these factory objects must implement, and the API the objects they produce must implement.

       $f-&gt;compile_now ($use_user_prefs, $keep_userstate)
           Compile all patterns, load all configuration files, and load all possibly-required Perl modules.

           Normally, Mail::SpamAssassin uses lazy evaluation where possible, but if you plan to <u>fork()</u> or
           start a new perl interpreter thread to process a message, this is suboptimal, as each
           process/thread will have to perform these actions.

           Call this function in the master thread or process to perform the actions straightaway, so that
           the sub-processes will not have to.

           If $use_user_prefs is 0, this will initialise the SpamAssassin configuration without reading the
           per-user configuration file and it will assume that you will call "read_scoreonly_config" at a
           later point.

           If $keep_userstate is true, <u>compile</u><b>_</b><u>now()</u> will revert any configuration options which have a
           default with <b>__</b><u>userstate</u><b>__</b> in it post-<u>init()</u>, and then re-change the option before returning.
           This lets you change <u>$ENV{'HOME'}</u> to a temp directory, have <u>compile</u><b>_</b><u>now()</u> and create any files
           there as necessary without disturbing the actual files as changed by a configuration option.  By
           default, this is disabled.

       $f-&gt;debug_diagnostics ()
           Output some diagnostic information, useful for debugging SpamAssassin problems.

       $failed = $f-&gt;lint_rules ()
           Syntax-check the current set of rules.  Returns the number of syntax errors discovered, or 0 if
           the configuration is valid.

       $f-&gt;<u>finish()</u>
           Destroy this object, so that it will be garbage-collected once it goes out of scope.  The object
           will no longer be usable after this method is called.

       $fullpath = $f-&gt;find_rule_support_file ($filename)
           Find a rule-support file, such as "languages" or "triplets.txt", in the system-wide rules
           directory, and return its full path if it exists, or undef if it doesn't exist.

           (This API was added in SpamAssassin 3.1.1.)

       $f-&gt;create_default_prefs ($filename, $username [ , $userdir ] )
           Copy default preferences file into home directory for later use and modification, if it does not
           already exist and "dont_copy_prefs" is not set.

       $f-&gt;copy_config ( [ $source ], [ $dest ] )
           Used for daemons to keep a persistent Mail::SpamAssassin object's configuration correct if
           switching between users.  Pass an associative array reference as either $source or $dest, and set
           the other to 'undef' so that the object will use its current configuration.  i.e.:

             # create object w/ configuration
             my $spamtest = Mail::SpamAssassin-&gt;new( ... );

             # backup configuration to %conf_backup
             my %conf_backup = ();
             $spamtest-&gt;copy_config(undef, \%conf_backup) ||
               die "config: error returned from copy_config!\n";

             ... do stuff, perhaps modify the config, etc ...

             # reset the configuration back to the original
             $spamtest-&gt;copy_config(\%conf_backup, undef) ||
               die "config: error returned from copy_config!\n";

           Note that the contents of the associative arrays should be considered opaque by calling code.

       @plugins = $f-&gt;get_loaded_plugins_list ( )
           Return the list of plugins currently loaded by this SpamAssassin object's configuration; each
           entry in the list is an object of type "Mail::SpamAssassin::Plugin".

           (This API was added in SpamAssassin 3.2.0.)
