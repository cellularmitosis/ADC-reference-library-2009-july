There are a few problems, though, that are not fixed withSystem 3.2 - most of these bugs have been corrected in System 4.1/4.2. Any thatare not fixed will be detailed here. ROM code for future machines will, ofcourse, include the corrections.</p><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><a name="Section2"></a><h2>ROM boot code problems</h2><p>In the process of looking for a bootable SCSI device, the boot code issues aSCSI bus reset before each attempt to read block 0 from a device. If the readfails for any reason, the boot code goes on to the next device. SCSI deviceswhich implement the <code>Unit Attention</code> condition as defined by theRevision 17B SCSI standard will fail to boot in this case. The read will failbecause the drive is attempting to report the <code>Unit Attention</code> conditionfor the first command it receives after the SCSI bus reset. The boot code doesnot read the sense bytes and does not retry the failed command; it simplyresets the SCSI bus and goes on to the next device.</p><p>If no other device is bootable, the boot code will eventually cycle back to thesame SCSI device ID, reset the bus (causing <code>Unit Attention</code> in thedrive again), and try to read block 0 (which fails for the same reason).</p><p>The `new' Macintosh Plus ROMs that are included in the platinum Macintosh Plushave only one change. The change was to simply do a single SCSI Bus Reset afterpower up instead of a Reset each time through the SCSI boot loop. This was doneto allow <code>Unit</code> <code>Attention</code> drives to be bootable. It was anobject code patch (affecting approximately 30 bytes) and no other bugs werefixed. For details on the three versions of Macintosh Plus ROMs, see TechnicalNote #154.</p><p>We recommend that you choose an SCSI controller which does not require the<code>Unit Attention</code> feature--either an older controller (most of the SCSIcontrollers currently available were designed before Revision 17B), or one ofthe newer Revision-17B-compatible controllers which can enable/disable <code>UnitAttention</code> as a formatting option (such as those from Seagate, Rodime, etal). Since the vast majority of Macintosh Plus computers have the ROMs whichcannot use <code>Unit Attention</code> drives, we still recommend that you choosean SCSI controller that does not require the <code>Unit</code> <code>Attention</code>feature.</p><ul type="circle">	<li>If an SCSI device goes into the <code>Status</code> phase after being selected by the boot code, this leads to the SCSI bus being left in the <code>Status</code> phase indefinitely, and no SCSI devices can be accessed. The current Macintosh Plus boot code does not handle this change to <code>Status</code> phase, which means that the presence of an SCSI device with this behavior (as in some tape controllers we've seen) will prevent any SCSI devices from being accessed by the SCSI Manager, even if they already had drivers loaded from them. The result is that any SCSI peripheral that is turned on at boot time must not go into <code>Status</code> phase immediately after selection; otherwise, the Macintosh Plus SCSI bus will be left hanging. Unless substantially revised ROMs are released for the Macintosh Plus (highly unlikely within the next year or so), this problem will never be fixed on the Macintosh Plus, so you should design for old ROMs.<BR><BR></li>	<li>The Macintosh Plus would try to read 256 bytes of blocks 0 and 1, ignoring the extra data. The Macintosh SE and Macintosh II try to read 512 bytes from blocks 0 and 1, ignoring errors if the sector size is larger (but not smaller) than 512 bytes. Random access devices (disks, tapes, CD ROMS, etc.) can be booted as long as the blocks are at least 512 bytes, blocks 0, 1 and other partition blocks are correctly set up, and there is a driver on it. With the new partition layout (documented in <i>Inside Macintosh</i> volume V), more than 256 bytes per sector may be required in some partition map entries. This is why we dropped support for 256-byte sectors. Disks with tag bytes (532-byte sectors) or larger block sizes (1K, 2K, etc.) can be booted on any Macintosh with an SCSI port. Of course, the driver has to take care of data blocking and de-blocking, since HFS likes to work with 512-byte sectors.<br><br></li></ul><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><a name="Section3"></a><h2>Problems with ROM SCSI Manager routines</h2><p>Note that the following problems are fixed after the System file has beenopened; for a device to boot properly, it must not depend on these fixes. Thesample SCSI driver contains an example of how to find out if the fixes are in place.</p><ul type="circle">	<li><b>Prior to System file 3.2,</b> blind transfers (both reads and writes) would not work properly with many SCSI controllers. Since blind operation depends on the drive's ability to transfer data fast enough, it is the responsibility of the driver writer to make sure blind operation is safe for a particular device.<BR><BR></li>	<li><b>Prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>System file 3.2,</b> the SCSI Manager dropped a byte when the driver did two or more <code>SCSIReads</code> or <code>SCSIRBlinds</code> in a row. (Each <code>Read</code> or <code>RBlind</code> has to have a Transfer Information Block (TIB) pointer passed in.) The TIB itself can be as big and complex as you want--it is the process of returning from one <code>SCSIRead</code> or <code>SCSIRBlind</code> and entering another one (while still on the same SCSI command) that causes the first byte for the other <code>SCSIReads</code> to be lost.<BR><BR></li>	<li>Note that this precludes use of file-system tags. Apple no longer recommends that you support tags; see Technical Note #94 for more information.<BR><BR></li>	<li><b>Prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>System</b> <b>file</b> <b>3.2, </b><code>SCSIStat</code> didn't work; the new version works correctly.<BR><BR></li>	<li><b>Running under</b> <b>System</b> <b>file</b> <b>3.2,</b> the SCSI Manager does not check to make sure that the last byte of a write operation (to the peripheral) was  handshaked while operating in pseudo-DMA mode. The SCSI Manager writes the final byte to  the NCR 5380's one-byte buffer and then turns pseudo-DMA mode off shortly thereafter  (reported to be 10-15 microseconds). If the peripheral is somewhat slow in actually reading  the last byte of data, it asserts <code>REQ</code> after the Macintosh has already turned off  pseudo-DMA mode and never gets an <code>ACK</code>. The CPU then expects to go into the <code>Status</code> phase since it thinks everything went OK, but the peripheral is still waiting for <code>ACK</code>. Unless the driver can recover from this somehow, the SCSI bus  is `hung' in the <code>Data</code> <code>Out</code> phase. In this case, all successive SCSI Manager calls  will fail until the bus is reset.<BR><BR></li>	<li><b>Running under</b> <b>System file 4.1/4.2,</b> the SCSI Manager waits for the last byte of a write operation to be handshaked while operating in pseudo-DMA mode; it checks for a final <code>DRQ</code> (or a phase change) at the end of a <code>SCSIWrite</code> or <code>SCSIWBlind</code> before turning off the pseudo-DMA mode. Drivers that could recover from this problem by writing the last byte again if the bus was still in a <code>Data</code> <code>Out</code> phase will still work correctly, as long as they were checking the bus state.<BR><BR></li>	<li><b>Running under</b> <b>System</b> <b>file</b> <b>3.2, </b>the SCSI Manager does not time out if the peripheral fails to finish transferring the expected number of bytes for polled reads and writes. (Blind operation does poll for the first byte of each requested data transfer in the Transfer Information Block.)<BR><BR></li>	<li><b>Running under System file 4.1/4.2,</b> <code>SCSIRead</code> and <code>SCSIWrite</code> return an error to the caller if the peripheral changes the bus phase in the middle of a transfer, as might happen if the peripheral fails to transfer the expected number of bytes. The computer is no longer left in a hung state.<BR><BR></li>	<li><b>Running under</b> <b>System</b> <b>file</b> <b>3.2,</b> the Selection timeout value is very short (900 microseconds). Patches to the SCSI Manager <b>in</b> <b>System</b> <b>4.1/4.2</b> ensure that this value is the recommended 250 milliseconds.<BR><BR></li>	<li><b>Running</b> <b>under</b> <b>System</b> <b>file</b> <b>3.2, </b>the SCSI Manager routine <code>SCSIGet</code> (which arbitrates for the bus) will fail if the <code>BSY</code> line is still asserted. Some devices are a bit slow in releasing <code>BSY</code> after the completion of an SCSI operation, meaning that <code>BSY</code> may not have been released before the driver issues a <code>SCSIGet</code>  call to start the next SCSI operation. A work-around for this is to call <code>SCSIGet</code>  again if it failed the first time. (Rarely has it been necessary to try it a third time.) This assumes, of course, that the bus has not been left `hanging' by an improperly terminated  SCSI operation before calling <code>SCSIGet</code>.<BR><BR></li>    	<li><b>Running</b> <b>under</b> <b>System</b> <b>file</b> <b>4.1/4.2,</b> the <code>SCSIGet</code> function has been made more tolerant of devices that are slow to release the <code>BSY</code> line after a SCSI operation. The SCSI Manager now waits up to 200 milliseconds before returning an error.<BR><BR></li></ul><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><a name="Section4"></a><h2>Problems with the SCSI Manager that haven't been fixed yet</h2><p>These problems currently exist in the Macintosh Plus, SE, and II SCSI Manager.We plan to fix these problems in a future release of the System Tools disk, butin the mean time, you should try to work around the problems (but don't"require" the problems!).</p><ul type="circle">	<li>Multiple calls to <code>SCSIRead</code> or <code>SCSIRBlind</code> after issuing a command and before calling <code>SCSIComplete</code> may not work. Suppose you want to read some mode sense data from the drive. After sending the command with <code>SCSICmd</code>, you might want to call <code>SCSIRead</code> with a TIB that reads four bytes (typically a header). After reading the field (in the four-byte header) that tells how many remaining bytes are available, you might call <code>SCSIRead</code> again with a TIB to read the remaining bytes. The problem is that the first byte of the second <code>SCSIRead</code> data will be lost because of the way the SCSI Manager handles reads in pseudo-DMA mode. The work-around is to issue two separate SCSI commands: the first to read only the four-byte header, the second to read the four-byte header plus the remaining bytes. We recommend that you not use a clever TIB that contains two data transfers, the second of which gets the transfer length from the first transfer's received data (the header). These two step TIBs will not work in the future. This bug will probably not be fixed.<br><br></li>	<li>On read operations, some devices may be slow in de-asserting <code>REQ</code> after sending the last byte to the CPU. The current SCSI Manager (all machines) will return to the caller without waiting for <code>REQ</code> to be de-asserted. Usually the next call that the driver would make is <code>SCSIComplete</code>. On the Macintosh SE and II, the <code>SCSIComplete</code> call will check the bus to be sure that it is in <code>Status</code> phase. If not, the SCSI Manager will return a new error code that indicates the bus was in Data In/Data Out phase when <code>SCSIComplete</code> was called. The combination of the speed of the Macintosh II and a slow peripheral can cause <code>SCSIComplete</code> to detect that the bus is still in Data In phase before the peripheral has finally changed the bus to <code>Status</code> phase. This results in a false error being passed back by <code>SCSIComplete</code>.<br><br></li>	<li>The <code>scComp </code>(compare) TIB opcode does not work in System 4.1 on the Macintosh Plus only. It returns an error code of 4 (bad parameters). This has been fixed in System 4.2.<br><br></li></ul><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><a name="Section5"></a><h2>Other SCSI Manager Issues</h2><ul type="circle">	<li>At least one third-party SCSI peripheral driver used to issue SCSI commands from a VBL task. It didn't check to see if the bus was in the free state before sending the command! This is guaranteed to wipe out any other SCSI command that may have been in progress, since the SCSI Manager on the Macintosh Plus does not mask out (or use) interrupts.<br><br></li></ul><p>We strongly recommend that you avoid calling the SCSI Manager from interrupthandlers (such as VBL tasks). If you must send SCSI commands from a VBL task(like for a removable media system), do a <code>SCSIStat</code> call first to seeif the bus is currently busy. If it's free (<code>BSY</code> is not asserted), thenit's probably safe; otherwise the VBL task should not send the command. Notethat you can't call <code>SCSIStat</code> before the System file fixes are inplace. Since SCSI operations during VBL are not guaranteed, you should checkall errors from SCSI Manager calls.</p><ul type="circle">	<li>A new SCSI Manager call will be added in the future. This will be a high-level call; it will have some kind of parameter block in which you give a pointer to a command buffer, a pointer to your TIB, a pointer to a sense data buffer (in case something goes wrong, the SCSI Manager will automatically read the sense bytes into the buffer for you), and a few other fields. The SCSI Manager will take care of arbitration, selection, sending the command, interpreting the TIB for the data transfer, and getting the status and message bytes (and the sense bytes, if there was an error). It should make SCSI device drivers much easier to write, since the driver will no longer have to worry about unexpected phase changes, getting the sense bytes, and so on. In the future, this will be the recommended way to use the SCSI Manager.<br><br></li>	<li>The SCSI Manager (all machines) does not currently support interrupt-driven (asynchronous) operations. The Macintosh Plus can never support it since there is no interrupt capability, although a polled scheme may be implemented by the SCSI Manager. The Macintosh SE has a maskable interrupt for <code>IRQ</code>, and the Macintosh II has maskable interrupts for both <code>IRQ</code> and <code>DRQ</code>.  Apple is working on an implementation of the SCSI Manager that will support  asynchronous operations on the Macintosh II and probably on the SE as well.  Because the interrupt hardware will interact adversely with any asynchronous  schemes that are polled, it is strongly recommended  that third parties do not  attempt asynchronous operations until the new SCSI Manager is released. Apple will  not attempt to be compatible with any products that bypass some or all of the  SCSI Manager. In order to implement software-based (polled) asynchronous operations  it is necessary to bypass the SCSI Manager.<br><br></li></ul><p>The SCSI Manager section of the alpha draft of <i>Inside Macintosh</i> volumeV documented the <code>Disconnect</code> and <code>Reselect</code> routines which were intended to beused for asynchronous I/O. Those routines cannot be used. Those routines havebeen removed from the manual. Any software that uses those routines will haveto be revised when the SCSI Manager becomes interrupt-driven. Drivers whichsend SCSI commands from VBL tasks may also have to be modified.</p><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><a name="Section6"></a><h2>Hardware in the SCSI</h2><p>There is some confusion on how many terminators can be used on the bus, and thebest way to use them. There can be no more than two terminators on the bus. Ifyou have more than one SCSI drive you must have two terminators. If you onlyhave one drive, you should use a single terminator. If you have more than onedrive, the two terminators should be on opposite ends of the chain. The idea isto terminate both ends of the wire that goes through all of the devices. Oneterminator should be on the end of the system cable that comes out of theMacintosh. The other terminator would be on the very end of the last device onthe chain. If you have an SE or II with an internal hard disk, there is alreadyone terminator on the front of the chain, inside the computer.</p><p>On the Macintosh SE and II, there is additional hardware support for the SCSIbus transfers in pseudo-DMA mode. The hardware makes it possible to handshakethe data in Blind mode so that the Blind mode is safe for all transfers. On theMacintosh Plus, the Blind transfers are heavily timing dependent and canoverrun or underrun during the transfer with no error generated. Assuring thatBlind mode is safe on the Macintosh Plus depends upon the peripheral beingused. On the SE and II, the transfer is hardware assisted to prevent overrunsor underruns.</p><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><a name="Section7"></a><h2>Changes in SCSI for SE and II</h2><p>The changes made to the SCSI Manager found in the Macintosh SE and Macintosh IIare primarily bug fixes. No new functionality was added. The newer SCSI Manageris more robust and has more error checking. Since the Macintosh Plus SCSIManager only did limited error checking, it is possible to have code that wouldfunction (with bugs) on the Macintosh Plus, but will not work correctly on theSE or II. The Macintosh Plus could mask some bugs in the caller by not checkingerrors. An example of this is sending or receiving the wrong number of bytes ina blind transfer. On the Macintosh Plus, no error would be generated sincethere was no way to be sure how many bytes were sent or received. On the SE andII, if the wrong number of bytes are transferred an error will be returned tothe caller. The exact timing of transfers has changed on the SE and II as well,since the computers run at different speeds. Devices that are unwittinglydependent upon specific timing in transfers may have problems on the newercomputers. To find problems of this sort it is usually only necessary toexamine the error codes that are passed back by the SCSI Manager routines. Theerror codes will generally point out where the updated SCSI Manager found errors.</p><P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><a name="Section8"></a><h2>To report other bugs or make suggestions</h2><p>Please send additional bug reports and suggestions to us at the address inTechnical Note #0.
