<b>NAME</b>
       IO::Socket::SSL -- Nearly transparent SSL encapsulation for IO::Socket::INET.

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
           use IO::Socket::SSL;

           my $client = IO::Socket::SSL-&gt;new("www.example.com:https");

           if ($client) {
               print $client "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n";
               print &lt;$client&gt;;
               close $client;
           } else {
               warn "I encountered a problem: ",
                 IO::Socket::SSL::errstr();
           }

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       This module is a true drop-in replacement for IO::Socket::INET that uses SSL to encrypt data before
       it is transferred to a remote server or client.  IO::Socket::SSL supports all the extra features that
       one needs to write a full-featured SSL client or server application: multiple SSL contexts, cipher
       selection, certificate verification, and SSL version selection.  As an extra bonus, it works
       perfectly with mod_perl.

       If you have never used SSL before, you should read the appendix labelled 'Using SSL' before
       attempting to use this module.

       If you have used this module before, read on, as versions 0.93 and above have several changes from
       the previous IO::Socket::SSL versions (especially see the note about return values).

       If you are using non-blocking sockets read on, as version 0.98 added better support for non-blocking.

<b>METHODS</b>
       IO::Socket::SSL inherits its methods from IO::Socket::INET, overriding them as necessary.  If there
       is an SSL error, the method or operation will return an empty list (false in all contexts).  The
       methods that have changed from the perspective of the user are re-documented here:

       <b>new(...)</b>
           Creates a new IO::Socket::SSL object.  You may use all the friendly options that came bundled
           with IO::Socket::INET, plus (optionally) the ones that follow:

           SSL_version
             Sets the version of the SSL protocol used to transmit data.  The default is SSLv2/3, which
             auto-negotiates between SSLv2 and SSLv3.  You may specify 'SSLv2', 'SSLv3', or 'TLSv1' (case-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">insensitive)&nbsp;(caseinsensitive)</font>
             insensitive) if you do not want this behavior.

           SSL_cipher_list
             If this option is set the cipher list for the connection will be set to the given value, e.g.
             something like 'ALL:!LOW:!EXP:!ADH'. Look into the OpenSSL documentation
             (&lt;<a href="http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html#CIPHER_STRINGS">http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html#CIPHER_STRINGS</a>) for more details.  If this
             option is not used the openssl builtin default is used which is suitable for most cases.

           SSL_use_cert
             If this is set, it forces IO::Socket::SSL to use a certificate and key, even if you are setting
             up an SSL client.  If this is set to 0 (the default), then you will only need a certificate and
             key if you are setting up a server.

           SSL_key_file
             If your RSA private key is not in default place (<u>certs/server-key.pem</u> for servers,
             <u>certs/client-key.pem</u> for clients), then this is the option that you would use to specify a
             different location.  Keys should be PEM formatted, and if they are encrypted, you will be
             prompted to enter a password before the socket is formed (unless you specified the
             SSL_passwd_cb option).

           SSL_key
             This is an EVP_PKEY* and can be used instead of SSL_key_file.  Useful if you don't have your
             key in a file but create it dynamically or get it from a string (see openssl
             PEM_read_bio_PrivateKey etc for getting a EVP_PKEY* from a string).

           SSL_cert_file
             If your SSL certificate is not in the default place (<u>certs/server-cert.pem</u> for servers,
             <u>certs/client-cert.pem</u> for clients), then you should use this option to specify the location of
             your certificate.  Note that a key and certificate are only required for an SSL server, so you
             do not need to bother with these trifling options should you be setting up an unauthenticated
             client.

           SSL_cert
             This is an X509* or an array of X509*.  The first X509* is the internal representation of the
             certificate while the following ones are extra certificates. Useful if you create your
             certificate dynamically (like in a SSL intercepting proxy) or get it from a string (see openssl
             PEM_read_bio_X509 etc for getting a X509* from a string).

           SSL_dh_file
             If you want Diffie-Hellman key exchange you need to supply a suitable file here or use the
             SSL_dh parameter. See dhparam command in openssl for more information.

           SSL_dh
             Like SSL_dh_file, but instead of giving a file you use a preloaded or generated DH*.

           SSL_passwd_cb
             If your private key is encrypted, you might not want the default password prompt from
             Net::SSLeay.  This option takes a reference to a subroutine that should return the password
             required to decrypt your private key.

           SSL_ca_file
             If you want to verify that the peer certificate has been signed by a reputable certificate
             authority, then you should use this option to locate the file containing the <!-- a -->certificate(s)<!-- /a --> of
             the reputable certificate authorities if it is not already in the file <u>certs/my-ca.pem</u>.

           SSL_ca_path
             If you are unusually friendly with the OpenSSL documentation, you might have set yourself up a
             directory containing several trusted certificates as separate files as well as an index of the
             certificates.  If you want to use that directory for validation purposes, and that directory is
             not <u>ca/</u>, then use this option to point IO::Socket::SSL to the right place to look.

           SSL_verify_mode
             This option sets the verification mode for the peer certificate.  The default (0x00) does no
             authentication.  You may combine 0x01 (verify peer), 0x02 (fail verification if no peer
             certificate exists; ignored for clients), and 0x04 (verify client once) to change the default.

           SSL_verify_callback
             If you want to verify certificates yourself, you can pass a sub reference along with this
             parameter to do so.  When the callback is called, it will be passed: 1) a true/false value that
             indicates what OpenSSL thinks of the certificate, 2) a C-style memory address of the
             certificate store, 3) a string containing the certificate's issuer attributes and owner
             attributes, and 4) a string containing any errors encountered (0 if no errors).  The function
             should return 1 or 0, depending on whether it thinks the certificate is valid or invalid.  The
             default is to let OpenSSL do all of the busy work.

           SSL_check_crl
             If you want to verify that the peer certificate has not been revoked by the signing authority,
             set this value to true.  OpenSSL will search for the CRL in your SSL_ca_path.  See the
             Net::SSLeay documentation for more details.  Note that this functionality appears to be broken
             with OpenSSL &lt; v0.9.7b, so its use with lower versions will result in an error.

           SSL_reuse_ctx
             If you have already set the above options (SSL_version through SSL_check_crl; this does not
             include SSL_cipher_list yet) for a previous instance of IO::Socket::SSL, then you can reuse the
             SSL context of that instance by passing it as the value for the SSL_reuse_ctx parameter.  You
             may also create a new instance of the IO::Socket::SSL::SSL_Context class, using any context
             options that you desire without specifying connection options, and pass that here instead.

             If you use this option, all other context-related options that you pass in the same call to
             <u>new()</u> will be ignored unless the context supplied was invalid.  Note that, contrary to versions
             of IO::Socket::SSL below v0.90, a global SSL context will not be implicitly used unless you use
             the <u>set</u><b>_</b><u>default</u><b>_</b><u>context()</u> function.

           SSL_session_cache_size
             If you make repeated connections to the same host/port and the SSL renegotiation time is an
             issue, you can turn on client-side session caching with this option by specifying a positive
             cache size.  For successive connections, pass the SSL_reuse_ctx option to the <u>new()</u> calls (or
             use <u>set</u><b>_</b><u>default</u><b>_</b><u>context()</u>) to make use of the cached sessions.  The session cache size refers
             to the number of unique host/port pairs that can be stored at one time; the oldest sessions in
             the cache will be removed if new ones are added.

           SSL_error_trap
             When using the <u>accept()</u> or <u>connect()</u> methods, it may be the case that the actual socket
             connection works but the SSL negotiation fails, as in the case of an HTTP client connecting to
             an HTTPS server.  Passing a subroutine ref attached to this parameter allows you to gain
             control of the orphaned socket instead of having it be closed forcibly.  The subroutine, if
             called, will be passed two parameters: a reference to the socket on which the SSL negotiation
             failed and and the full text of the error message.

       <b>close(...)</b>
           There are a number of nasty traps that lie in wait if you are not careful about using <u>close()</u>.
           The first of these will bite you if you have been using <u>shutdown()</u> on your sockets.  Since the
           SSL protocol mandates that a SSL "close notify" message be sent before the socket is closed, a
           <u>shutdown()</u> that closes the socket's write channel will cause the <u>close()</u> call to hang.  For a
           similar reason, if you try to close a copy of a socket (as in a forking server) you will affect
           the original socket as well.  To get around these problems, call close with an object-oriented
           syntax (e.g. $socket-&gt;close(SSL_no_shutdown =&gt; 1)) and one or more of the following parameters:

           SSL_no_shutdown
             If set to a true value, this option will make <u>close()</u> not use the <u>SSL</u><b>_</b><u>shutdown()</u> call on the
             socket in question so that the close operation can complete without problems if you have used
             <u>shutdown()</u> or are working on a copy of a socket.

           SSL_ctx_free
             If you want to make sure that the SSL context of the socket is destroyed when you close it, set
             this option to a true value.

       <b>peek(...)</b>
           This function has exactly the same syntax as <u>sysread()</u>, and performs nearly the same task
           (reading data from the socket) but will not advance the read position so that successive calls to
           <u>peek()</u> with the same arguments will return the same results.  This function requires OpenSSL
           0.9.6a or later to work.

       <u></u><b><u>p</u></b><u></u><b><u>n</u></b><u></u><b><u>i</u></b><u></u><b><u>g</u></b><u></u><b><u>)</u></b>
           This function will let you know how many bytes of data are immediately ready for reading from the
           socket.  This is especially handy if you are doing reads on a blocking socket or just want to
           know if new data has been sent over the socket.

       <u></u><b><u>g</u></b><u></u><b><u>t</u></b><b>_</b><u></u><b><u>c</u></b><u></u><b><u>p</u></b><u></u><b><u>e</u></b><u></u><b><u>(</u></b>
           Returns the string form of the cipher that the IO::Socket::SSL object is using.

       <u></u><b><u>d</u></b><u></u><b><u>m</u></b><b>_</b><u></u><b><u>p</u></b><u></u><b><u>e</u></b><b>_</b><u></u><b><u>c</u></b><u></u><b><u>r</u></b><u></u><b><u>i</u></b><u></u><b><u>i</u></b><u></u><b><u>a</u></b><u></u><b><u>e</u></b><u></u><b><u>)</u></b>
           Returns a parsable string with select fields from the peer SSL certificate.  This method directly
           returns the result of the <u>dump</u><b>_</b><u>peer</u><b>_</b><u>certificate()</u> method of Net::SSLeay.

       <b>peer_certificate($field)</b>
           If a peer certificate exists, this function can retrieve values from it.  Right now, the only
           fields it can return are "authority" and "owner" (or "issuer" and "subject" if you want to use
           OpenSSL names), corresponding to the certificate authority that signed the peer certificate and
           the owner of the peer certificate.  This function returns a string with all the information about
           the particular field in one parsable line.  If no field is given it returns the full certificate
           (x509).

       <u></u><b><u>e</u></b><u></u><b><u>r</u></b><u></u><b><u>t</u></b><u></u><b><u>(</u></b>
           Returns the last error (in string form) that occurred.  If you do not have a real object to
           perform this method on, call <u>IO::Socket::SSL::errstr()</u> instead.

           For read and write errors on non-blocking sockets, this method may include the string "SSL wants
           a read first!" or "SSL wants a write first!" meaning that the other side is expecting to read
           from or write to the socket and wants to be satisfied before you get to do anything. But with
           version 0.98 you are better comparing the global exported variable $SSL_ERROR against the
           exported symbols SSL_WANT_READ and SSL_WANT_WRITE.

       <b>IO::Socket::SSL-&gt;start_SSL($socket,</b> <b>...</b> <b>)</b>
           This will convert a glob reference or a socket that you provide to an IO::Socket::SSL object.
           You may also pass parameters to specify context or connection options as with a call to <u>new()</u>.
           If you are using this function on an <u>accept()</u>ed socket, you must set the parameter "SSL_server"
           to 1, i.e. IO::Socket::SSL-&gt;start_SSL($socket, SSL_server =&gt; 1).  If you have a class that
           inherits from IO::Socket::SSL and you want the $socket to be blessed into your own class instead,
           use MyClass-&gt;start_SSL($socket) to achieve the desired effect.

           Note that if <u>start</u><b>_</b><u>SSL()</u> fails in SSL negotiation, $socket will remain blessed in its original
           class.  For non-blocking sockets you better just upgrade the socket to IO::Socket::SSL and call
           accept_SSL or connect_SSL and the upgraded object. To just upgrade the socket set
           <b>SSL_startHandshake</b> explicitly to 0. If you call start_SSL w/o this parameter it will revert to
           blocking behavior for accept_SSL and connect_SSL.

       <b>IO::Socket::SSL-&gt;new_from_fd($fd,</b> <b>...)</b>
           This will convert a socket identified via a file descriptor into an SSL socket.  Note that the
           argument list does not include a "MODE" argument; if you supply one, it will be thoughtfully
           ignored (for compatibility with IO::Socket::INET).  Instead, a mode of '+&lt;' is assumed, and the
           file descriptor passed must be able to handle such I/O because the initial SSL handshake requires
           bidirectional communication.

       <b>IO::Socket::SSL::set_default_context(...)</b>
           You may use this to make IO::Socket::SSL automatically re-use a given context (unless
           specifically overridden in a call to <u>new()</u>).  It accepts one argument, which should be either an
           IO::Socket::SSL object or an IO::Socket::SSL::SSL_Context object.  See the SSL_reuse_ctx option
           of <u>new()</u> for more details.  Note that this sets the default context globally, so use with caution
           (esp. in mod_perl scripts).

       The following methods are unsupported (not to mention futile!) and IO::Socket::SSL will emit a large
       <u>CROAK()</u> if you are silly enough to use them:

       truncate
       stat
       ungetc
       setbuf
       setvbuf
       fdopen
       send/recv
           Note that <u>send()</u> and <u>recv()</u> cannot be reliably trapped by a tied filehandle (such as that used by
           IO::Socket::SSL) and so may send unencrypted data over the socket.  Object-oriented calls to
           these functions will fail, telling you to use the print/printf/syswrite and read/sysread families
           instead.

<b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b>
       A few changes have gone into IO::Socket::SSL v0.93 and later with respect to return values.  The
       behavior on success remains unchanged, but for <u>all</u> functions, the return value on error is now an
       empty list.  Therefore, the return value will be false in all contexts, but those who have been using
       the return values as arguments to subroutines (like "mysub(IO::Socket::SSL(...)-"new, ...)&gt;) may run
       into problems.  The moral of the story: <u>always</u> check the return values of these functions before
       using them in any way that you consider meaningful.

<b>IPv6</b>
       Support for IPv6 with IO::Socket::SSL is expected to work, but is experimental, as none of the
       author's machines use IPv6 and hence he cannot test IO::Socket::SSL with them.  However, a few brave
       people have used it without incident, so if you wish to make IO::Socket::SSL IPv6 aware, pass the
       'inet6' option to IO::Socket::SSL when calling it (i.e. "use IO::Socket::SSL qw(inet6);").  You will
       need IO::Socket::INET6 and Socket6 to use this option, and you will also need to write "use Socket6;"
       before using IO::Socket::SSL.  If you absolutely do not want to use this (or want a quick change back
       to IPv4), pass the 'inet4' option instead.

       Currently, there is no support for using IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously in a single program, but it is
       planned for a future release.

<b>DEBUGGING</b>
       If you are having problems using IO::Socket::SSL despite the fact that can recite backwards the
       section of this documentation labelled 'Using SSL', you should try enabling debugging.  To specify
       the debug level, pass 'debug#' (where # is a number from 0 to 4) to IO::Socket::SSL when calling it:

       use IO::Socket::SSL qw(debug0);
           #No debugging (default).

       use IO::Socket::SSL qw(debug1);
           #Only print out errors.

       use IO::Socket::SSL qw(debug2);
           #Print out errors and cipher negotiation.

       use IO::Socket::SSL qw(debug3);
           #Print out progress, ciphers, and errors.

       use IO::Socket::SSL qw(debug4);
           #Print out everything, including data.

       You can also set $IO::Socket::SSL::DEBUG to 0-4, but that's a bit of a mouthful, isn't it?

<b>EXAMPLES</b>
       See the 'example' directory.

<b>BUGS</b>
       IO::Socket::SSL is not threadsafe.  This is because IO::Socket::SSL is based on Net::SSLeay which
       uses a global object to access some of the API of openssl and is therefore not threadsafe.

<b>LIMITATIONS</b>
       IO::Socket::SSL uses Net::SSLeay as the shiny interface to OpenSSL, which is the shiny interface to
       the ugliness of SSL.  As a result, you will need both Net::SSLeay and OpenSSL on your computer before
       using this module.

       If you have Scalar::Util (standard with Perl 5.8.0 and above) or WeakRef, IO::Socket::SSL sockets
       will auto-close when they go out of scope, just like IO::Socket::INET sockets.  If you do not have
       one of these modules, then IO::Socket::SSL sockets will stay open until the program ends or you
       explicitly close them.  This is due to the fact that a circular reference is required to make
       IO::Socket::SSL sockets act simultaneously like objects and glob references.

<b>DEPRECATIONS</b>
       The following functions are deprecated and are only retained for compatibility:

       <u>context</u><b>_</b><u>init()</u>
         (use the SSL_reuse_ctx option if you want to re-use a context)

       <u>socketToSSL()</u> and <u>socket</u><b>_</b><u>to</u><b>_</b><u>SSL()</u>
         (use IO::Socket::SSL-&gt;<u>start</u><b>_</b><u>SSL()</u> instead)

       <u>get</u><b>_</b><u>peer</u><b>_</b><u>certificate()</u> and friends
         (use the <u>peer</u><b>_</b><u>certificate()</u> function instead)

       The following classes have been removed:

       SSL_SSL
         (not that you should have been directly accessing this anyway):

       X509_Certificate
         (but <u>get</u><b>_</b><u>peer</u><b>_</b><u>certificate()</u> will still Do The Right Thing)

<b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b>
       IO::Socket::INET, IO::Socket::INET6, Net::SSLeay.

<b>Appendix:</b> <b>Using</b> <b>SSL</b>
       If you are unfamiliar with the way OpenSSL works, good references may be found in both the book
       "Network Security with OpenSSL" (Oreilly &amp; Assoc.) and the web site
       &lt;<a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/SSL-Certificates-HOWTO/">http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/SSL-Certificates-HOWTO/</a>.  Read on for a quick overview.

       <b>The</b> <b>Long</b> <b>of</b> <b>It</b> <b>(Detail)</b>

       The usual reason for using SSL is to keep your data safe.  This means that not only do you have to
       encrypt the data while it is being transported over a network, but you also have to make sure that
       the right person gets the data.  To accomplish this with SSL, you have to use certificates.  A
       certificate closely resembles a Government-issued ID (at least in places where you can trust them).
       The ID contains some sort of identifying information such as a name and address, and is usually
       stamped with a seal of Government Approval.  Theoretically, this means that you may trust the
       information on the card and do business with the owner of the card.  The same ideas apply to SSL
       certificates, which have some identifying information and are "stamped" [most people refer to this as
       <u>signing</u> instead] by someone (a Certificate Authority) who you trust will adequately verify the
       identifying information.  In this case, because of some clever number theory, it is extremely
       difficult to falsify the stamping process.  Another useful consequence of number theory is that the
       certificate is linked to the encryption process, so you may encrypt data (using information on the
       certificate) that only the certificate owner can decrypt.

       What does this mean for you?  It means that at least one person in the party has to have an ID to get
       drinks :-).  Seriously, it means that one of the people communicating has to have a certificate to
       ensure that your data is safe.  For client/server interactions, the server must <b>always</b> have a
       certificate.  If the server wants to verify that the client is safe, then the client must also have a
       personal certificate.  To verify that a certificate is safe, one compares the stamped "seal"
       [commonly called an <u>encrypted</u> <u>digest/hash/signature</u>] on the certificate with the official "seal" of
       the Certificate Authority to make sure that they are the same.  To do this, you will need the
       [unfortunately named] certificate of the Certificate Authority.  With all these in hand, you can set
       up a SSL connection and be reasonably confident that no-one is reading your data.

       <b>The</b> <b>Short</b> <b>of</b> <b>It</b> <b>(Summary)</b>

       For servers, you will need to generate a cryptographic private key and a certificate request.  You
       will need to send the certificate request to a Certificate Authority to get a real certificate back,
       after which you can start serving people.  For clients, you will not need anything unless the server
       wants validation, in which case you will also need a private key and a real certificate.  For more
       information about how to get these, see &lt;<a href="http://www.modssl.org/docs/2.8/ssl_faq.html#ToC24">http://www.modssl.org/docs/2.8/ssl_faq.html#ToC24</a>.
