The comments//  cover the differences for each routine.  If there's a difference//  that's not commented, it's most probably a bug and you should let//  me know.extern pascal OSErr TradInstallDriverFromPtr(DRVRHeaderPtr driver,                        UnitNumber beginningUnit,                        UnitNumber endingUnit,                        DriverRefNum *refNum);  // This routine is similar to InstallDriverFromMemory except  //  that you pass a pointer to the 'DRVR', rather than a base pointer  //  and length.  This pointer is copied verbatim into the dCtlDriver  //  field of the DCE, so you have to make sure that it's in  //  the system heap if the driver is going to hang around longer than  //  your application.  // One other deviation from InstallDriverFromMemory is that this  //  call won't replace an existing driver.  This is because 'DRVR's  //  don't have infrastructure to support this.  If there's already  //  a driver of the same name in the unit table, the call will fail  //  with a dupFNErr, and *refNum will be set to the refnum of the  //  existing driver.  // The semantics of the endingUnit match those of DriverLoaderLib,  //  ie the call will not grow the unit table unless endingUnit is  //  greater than TradHighestUnitNumber.  The simplest way to work  //  this is to pass TradHighestUnitNumber() + 1 to endingUnit.  // If the call fails, it's your responsibility to dispose of the  //  the driver pointer.  If it succeeds, the system has a copy  //  of the pointer, which can be disposed by calling TradRemoveDriver.extern pascal OSErr TradInstallDriverFromHandle(DRVRHeaderHandle driver,                        UnitNumber beginningUnit,                        UnitNumber endingUnit,                        DriverRefNum *refNum);  // This routine is similar to InstallDriverFromMemory except  //  that you pass a handle to the 'DRVR', rather than a base pointer  //  and length.  This is generally more convenient in the traditional  //  'DRVR' world.  // In most other respects, this routine works like TradInstallDriverFromPtr.  //  The routine simply creates a pointer in the system heap and copies  //  your driver into it, then calls TradInstallDriverFromPtr.  Because  //  a copy is made, you do not have to ensure that the handle you  //  pass in is in the system heap.  // Regardless of whether call succeeds or fails, it's your responsibility  //  to dispose of the driver handle.  extern pascal OSErr TradInstallDriverFromResource(SInt16 rsrcID, StringPtr rsrcName,                        UnitNumber beginningUnit,                        UnitNumber endingUnit,                        DriverRefNum *refNum);  // This call offers functionality like InstallDriverFromFile.  //  It differs from InstallDriverFromFile in that the driver is expected  //  to be in a resource in the current resource file.  If rsrcName is nil,  //  the call uses Get1Resource('DRVR', rsrcID) to get the driver.  If  //  rsrcName is not nil, it uses Get1NamedResource('DRVR', rsrcName)  //  to get the driver.  // In most other respects, this routine works like TradInstallDriverFromPtr.  // If the call fails, the routine will clean up after itself.  If the  //  call succeeds, the driver code is left as a memory block in the system  //  heap, which can be cleaned up by calling TradRemoveDriver.extern pascal OSErr TradGetDriverInformation(DriverRefNum refNum,                        UnitNumber *thisUnit,                        DriverFlags *flags,                        StringPtr name,                        DRVRHeaderPtr *driverHeader                        );  // This routine is like GetDriverInformation except that it only  //  returns information that's pertinant to the traditional 'DRVR'  //  world.  driverHeader comes back as a pointer to the beginning  //  of the 'DRVR' header.  // Note that this routine works for both drivers installed by  //  this library and other drivers, however for drivers not installed  //  by this library (ie 'RAM'-based drivers), driverHeader may be a   //  half dereferenced handle, locked or unlocked.  You have been warned.  // Also, driverHeader can come back set to nil, if the driver  //  is installed but its code has been purged, for example a DA.  //  You must check for this before deferencing it.  If driverHeader  //  is set to nil, name will be set to the empty string.extern pascal OSErr TradOpenInstalledDriver(DriverRefNum refNum, SInt8 ioPermission);  // This routine has the same semantics as OpenInstalledDriver  //  except that the ioPermission parameter must be fsRdWrPerm.  This is  //  because we call through to the Device Manager's OpenDriver routine,  //  and that doesn't support passing in permissions.  I could switch the  //  implementation to use PBOpen, but PBOpen is a trap fraught with much  //  danger, so I'm avoiding it at the moment.  // The danger associated with PBOpen is that it's highly overloaded,  //  being used for FSOpen, PBOpen, PBHOpen, OpenSlot, OpenDriver,  //  OpenDeskAcc, and so on.  If you get the glue wrong, you die in  //  strange and evil ways.  So I'm bypassing the entire problem by  //  ignoring ioPermission.  I may revisit this decision, but not soon.extern pascal OSErr TradRemoveDriver(DriverRefNum refNum, Boolean immediate);  // This routine implements similar semantics to RemoveDriver, except  //  that the Immediate parameter must be false.  This is because  //  we close the driver using PBCloseSync, which is a queued  //  command, just like all the others.  We have no way to bypass  //  this.  // An important thing to note is that you should only call this on drivers  //  you installed using this library's TradInstallDriverFromHandle  //  and TradInstallDriverFromResource routine.  Don't call it on  //  drivers installed by other people and be careful when calling it on  //  drivers installed using TradInstallDriverFromPtr because you might  //  be disposing the driver code even though a) it might not actually be a  //  Memory Manager pointer block, or b) it might be still in use  //  by another driver.extern pascal OSErr TradRenameDriver(DriverRefNum refNum, ConstStr255Param newDriverName);  // This routine is implemented with the caveat that you can't  //  make the driver name longer.  This is because the 'DRVR'  //  name is actually stored in the code resource which implements  //  the driver, and making it longer would cause it to run into  //  the code that immediately follows the name.  // The reason why I implemented this routine at all is because  //  it's useful for installing multiple copies of the same driver.  //  For example, you can install &quot;.Q_Out&quot;, then rename it to  //  &quot;.QAOut&quot;, and then install &quot;.Q_Out&quot; again, and rename that to  //  &quot;.QBOut&quot;.  This can be very useful when testing and debugging  //  your driver (or TradDriverLoaderLib for that matter :).  // You should take extreme care when calling this routine on drivers that  //  weren't installed with this library.  Some of these drivers might  //  not like being renamed in this way.///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// The following routines from DriverLoaderLib were not implemented because//  they make no sense at all in the world of 'DRVR's.// VerifyFragmentAsDriver// GetDriverMemoryFragment// GetDriverDiskFragment// InstallDriverFromFragment// SetDriverClosureMemory// -- If they've got fragment in the name, it's hard to map them into the// 'DRVR' world.  Traditional 'DRVR's just aren't code fragments!// InstallDriverFromFile -- This routine assumes that there's only//  one driver in a file, which is not the case for traditional 'DRVR's//  which are normally stored as resources.  The basic functionality has//  been subsumed by TradInstallDriverFromResource.// InstallDriverFromDisk// FindDriversForDevice// FindDriverCandidates// ScanDriverCandidates// GetDriverForDevice// InstallDriverForDevice// -- These routines all assume that there's some magic way of matching//  drivers to their name register nodes.  In the traditional world, there//  is no name registry and, even if there was, there's no way to match//  devices against hardware.  So these routines are not sensible in the//  traditional world. // ReplaceDriverWithFragment -- There's no good way to replace a traditional//  device driver; the infrastructure just isn't there.#ifdef __cplusplus}#endif</pre>
