Does the Macintosh Operating System support this?</p><p>Currently the Macintosh Operating System doesn't inherently support localizedresources for several languages, or choose the right language according to thelocalized version of the system. However, your approach of including alllocalized text items in the same application is absolutely feasible. Justinclude an option to let the user select the language - somewhere inPreferences, if not in a dedicated "Languages" menu - and design a numberingscheme for the resource IDs such that the resources to be loaded can bedetermined from the language code.</p><p>It's better to let the user choose the language, rather than derive it from thesystem. This provides for a choice in case the user lives in a multilingualregion, or in case your application doesn't include translations for thelanguage of the user's system.</p><p>Because menus, windows, and dialogs are displayed with the system font, thisapproach works only for languages supported by the application script. Usually,the application script is the same as the system script, so you're limited tolanguages supported by the system script. If the user has installed a languagekit however, he/she can register your application as belonging to a differentscript, and the system font of that script is used to display your userinterface items (see the technical note OV-20 <A HREF = "ov_20.html">"Internationalization Checklist"</a>, section "Working With Language Kits", for more information about language kits and application scripts). In that case, you should offer the languages of the selected script for which you have resources. Currently there is no way for an application to set its application script, nor is there a way to find out which language the user has selected for your application in the language register.</p> <P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><h2>Maintaining one application version with localized text</h2><p>Date written:  9/11/92</p><p>Last reviewed:  10/8/93</p><p>We need to localize our application for several international markets. Do youhave any special tools or recommendations for us?</p><p>You can use a localization tool called <A HREF = "downloads/AppleGlot_2.1.sea.hqx">AppleGlot</a> (on the <i>Developer CD Series</i> disc) to localize text in your application. Once a file has beenlocalized the first time, the tool can compare versions and copy over everything that has stayed the same (usually 99%) so that you can focus on the text that's different. It also creates anice audit trail and is pretty easy to use. It should save you a lot of time.</p><p>To take full advantage of this tool, you need common code for all localizedversions, which is what you're planning to do to avoid the mess of havingmultiple sources. Occasionally, your application might have features that makesense only on a particular script system; in that case, you can check for thatconfiguration and enable those routines when appropriate. Once you have commonsource and tools that help localize your application, you can add auxiliaryresources for various languages.</p><p>If you have only a small amount of text in your application, it makes sense tobundle everything together in one worldwide product. Apple's TrueType fonts,for example, have internal name tables with names and information such ascopyright strings in about a dozen languages. Each string is tagged with aplatform, script, and language. But if you have a fair amount of textualresources, it might make more sense to have optional files and resources thatcan be installed as needed.</p><p>Unless you intend to support every script and language, you'll probably want tohave a set of resources for unavailable languages. You can pick whateverlanguage you want for this other set (English is popular), but the trick is touse only 7-bit ASCII characters. All script systems use the same charactercodes for the range $00-$7F, which match ASCII. It's the 8-bit characters thatdiffer radically. This means that text that includes characters like ..., (TM),(c), and * will not display properly on non-Roman script systems. Justsubstitute text such as . . ., tm, (c), and * for them. You can decide what'sappropriate and necessary.</p><p>Another thing to consider is checking for and supporting secondary scriptsystems in your application. The Macintosh Toolbox doesn't fully supportsecondary scripts such as Japanese menus on an English system, but yourapplication can support secondary script data even with the current Toolboxlimitations, by using styled text commands.</p> <P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><h2>Macintosh 'vers' resource language field</h2><p>Date written:  9/11/92</p><p>Last reviewed:  10/8/93</p><p>How is the language portion of the <code>'vers'</code> resource used by the system software,if at all? I'd like to use the <code>'vers'</code> resource with my multilanguage application.</p><p>The language field in the <code>'vers'</code> resource is part of the version ID to make it unique. The Language Kit Extension, part of the Japanese and Chinese language kits, is the first pieceof Macintosh system software to reference the language of the <code>'vers'</code> resource. It uses this information to switch system fonts, making it possible to display localized (such as Japanese) application resources. A language registration utility can be used by the user to override the <code>'vers'</code> language.</p><p>See the Japanese or Chinese Language Kit and the technical note OV-20<A HREF = "ov_20.html">"Internationalization Checklist"</a>, section "Working With Language Kits", for more information.</p> <P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><h2>Disabling multiscript keyboard menu items</h2><p>Date written:  8/11/92</p><p>Last reviewed:  10/8/93</p><p>When a user launches our application, which doesn't support multiple scripts,on System 7.1 with multiple scripts installed, the user is led to believe thatmultiple scripts work with our application because the Process Manager enablesall items in the keyboard menu. How can we manually disable items in thekeyboard menu so users won't be confused?</p><p>In System 7.0 and 7.1 an application can call <code>KeyScript(smKeyDisableKybds)</code> todisable keyboards which are not in the system script or Roman (see <i>InsideMacintosh</i> Volume VI, pages 14-43 and 14-44). As of System 7.1, thiskeyboard disable state is part of an application's context and gets updatedwhen applications are activated and deactivated, so calling this from oneapplication will not affect others. This is not a complete solution, as it doesnot allow you to enable or disable selected keyboards, e.g., disable 2-bytescripts for password entry. At this point, there is no documented interface fordisabling or enabling selected keyboards.</p> <P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><h2>Human interface for wildcards and Boolean operators</h2><p>Date written:  6/11/91</p><p>Last reviewed:  10/8/93</p><p>Is there a universally recognized wildcard character for the Macintosh, likethe "*" in the MS-DOS world? Furthermore, for Boolean logic, should my application accept Pascal syntax (such as .NOT., .AND., .OR.), C syntax (such as !, &amp;&amp;, ||), or stillanother convention? My users aren't programming gurus.</p><p>First, see if there's a friendlier way to implement the wildcard's function.Take a look at System 7 Finder's Find command, for example. If you findwildcard use is necessary, "*" is common, though for file searching anycharacter other than ":" can be used in an HFS filename.</p><p>As for Boolean operators, nonprogrammers prefer a syntax that matches naturallanguage as closely as possible, so AND, OR, and NOT are better than their Ccounterparts. However, user testing indicates that the most intuitive,user-friendly way to put Boolean search criteria on a command line is to bringup a dialog with pop-up menus used to form a natural-language sentencedescribing the search (like System 7's Find). If you can make something likethis work for your application, your nontechnical users will love you.</p> <P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><h2>International documents reference list</h2><p>Date Written:  3/1/91</p><p>Last reviewed:  10/8/93</p><p>Overview Books</p><p>- Guide to Macintosh Software Localization (Addison-Wesley 1992)</p><p>- Localization for Japan</p><p>- Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines (Addison-Wesley 1993)</p><p>Inside Macintosh &amp; Co.</p><p>- Inside Macintosh: Text (Addison-Wesley 1993)</p><p>- Inside Macintosh, volume I (Addison-Wesley 1985)</p><p>- Inside Macintosh, volume V (Addison-Wesley 1987)</p><p>- Inside Macintosh, volume VI (Addison-Wesley 1991)</p><p>- Macintosh Worldwide Development: Guide to System Software, &szlig; draft</p><p>Technical Notes</p><p>- <A HREF = "ov_20.html">OV 20 - Internationalization Checklist</a></p><p>- <A HREF = "ov_510.html">OV 510 - Worldwide Overview Q&amp;As</a></p><p>- <A HREF = "../te/te_02.html">TE 2 - Font Family Numbers</a></p><p>- <A HREF = "../te/te_04.html">TE 4 - Font Names</a></p><p>- <A HREF = "../te/te_05.html">TE 5 -- Fonts and the Script Manager</a></p><p>- <A HREF = "../te/te_07.html">TE 7 - Modifying the Standard String Comparison</a></p><p>- <A HREF = "../te/te_09.html">TE 9 - Script Manager 2.0 Date &amp; Time Problems</a></p><p>- <A HREF = "../te/te_10.html">TE 10 - Script Manager Print Action Routine</a></p><p>- <A HREF = "../te/te_21.html">TE 21 - Fond of FONDs</a></p><p>- <A HREF = "../te/te_23.html">TE 23 - International Canceling</a></p><p>- <A HREF = "../te/te_25.html">TE 25 - How to Construct Word-Break Tables</a></p><p>- <A HREF = "../te/te_26.html">TE 26 - Inside Macintosh Text and Life Before 7.1</a></p><p>- <A HREF = "../te/te_505.html">TE 505 - Font Manager Q&amp;As</a></p><p>- <A HREF = "../te/te_510.html">TE 510 - International Resource Q&amp;As</a></p><p>- <A HREF = "../te/te_515.html">TE 515 - Keyboard Resource Q&amp;As</a></p><p>- <A HREF = "../te/te_520.html">TE 520 - Script Manager Q&amp;As</a></p><p>- <A HREF = "../tb/tb_12.html">TB 12 - Key Mapping</a></p> <P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><h2>International VBL timing on the Macintosh</h2><p>Date Written:  3/9/90</p><p>Last reviewed:  6/14/93</p><p>Do VBL tasks execute at 50 Hz in Europe?</p><p>Televisions use AC line frequency to determine the vertical retrace interval.The Macintosh does not.

Tasks installed by <code>_VInstall</code> are always timed bythis 60.15 Hz clock. Slotted Macintosh systems may have additional frequenciesdetermined by the installed video card. Tasks installed by <code>_SlotVInstall</code> aretimed by these card-specific clocks. In any case, VBL task frequency is notdetermined by the location of your power source.</p> <P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P>         <P><A NAME=Downloads></A></P>                   <P><A HREF="#top">Back to top</A></P><h2>Downloadables</H2>                  <TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <td width=50 align=left>                  <P ALIGN=center><img src="images/acrobatsmall.gif" width=22 height=23 align=middle alt="Acrobat gif"></P>               </TD>               <td align="left">                  <P>Acrobat version of this Note (56K).</P>               </TD>               <td width=60 align=left>                  <P><A HREF="pdf/ov_510.pdf">Download</A></P>               </TD>            </TR>                    </TABLE>         <BR></TD></TR></table></center><!-- begin_footer_information -->	<table width="680" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
