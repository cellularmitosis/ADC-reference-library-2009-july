FinderLaunchA routine for sending an open documents Apple event to the Finder.  This routine provides functionality equivalent to selecting a document/file/application and choosing the open command in the Finder's file menu.  Of interest in this example:An illustration of how to ask the Finder to open and display a directory's window.  Also, this sample shows how to route open and launch commands through the Finder (saves your application the trouble of trying to find the correct application to open a document).Other techniques illustrated:The file TestFinderLaunch.c includes a brief exploration of how to use Navigation Services (falling back to StandardFile) in a way that allows you to select any visible file or folder.  By John Montbriand.Copyright © 1999 by Apple Computer, Inc.All rights reserved worldwide.	Disclaimer:You may incorporate this sample code into your applications without restriction, though the sample code has been provided "AS IS" and the responsibility for its operation is 100% yours.
