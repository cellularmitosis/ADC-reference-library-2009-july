<h1> Creating Form-Based Dynamic Elements</h1>
</a><a name="6408">
In HTML, a form is a container element (one that can contain other elements). Typically, forms contain input elements (such as text fields, radio buttons and checkboxes) to capture user information, a button or active image to submit the form data, as well as display elements such as text and images. <p>
</a><a name="12644">
In WebObjects Builder, you create form elements by clicking one of the buttons in the Form Elements portion of the switchable toolbar (or using their menu equivalents).<p>

</a><a name="12692">
All the form elements you create in the toolbar are dynamic equivalents of standard HTML elements.<em> </em>You can convert any dynamic form element to its static equivalent (and vice versa) by using the Inspector (see <a href="DynamicElements11.html#9978">"Dynamic and Static Inspectors"</a>).<p>
</a><a name="8928">
Most form elements have a <strong>value</strong> attribute that represents the information entered by the user. You bind this attribute to a variable so that your application can work with it. Others, such as WOSubmitButton, WOImageButton, or WOForm itself, don't receive information but have an <strong>action</strong> attribute representing an action to be taken when the form is submitted. You bind form-based elements by the process described in <a href="DynamicElements9.html#6549">"Binding Elements"</a>.<p>
</a><a name="13632">
Usually you create a WOForm element to contain other form elements, including buttons. The submit and reset buttons will apply to all other elements inside the same form.<p>
</a><a name="13643">
By default, only one submit button is allowed in a single form. If you want multiple submit buttons, use the WOForm Inspector to set the <strong>multipleSubmit</strong> attribute to <strong>YES</strong>.<p>
