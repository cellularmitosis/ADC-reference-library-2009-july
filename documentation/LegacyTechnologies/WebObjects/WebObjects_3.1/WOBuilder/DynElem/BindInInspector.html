<P>Usually, you don't need to use the inspector window to bind elements. Instead you can just select the element and double-click a variable. See "<U><A HREF="BindElements.html#REF47465">Binding Elements</A></U>" for more information on how this works and for a list of cases where you might need to bind using the inspector.
<P>Sometimes, it's difficult to select the element you want to bind. For example, if you have a WORepetition that surrounds a table row, the WORepetition doesn't appear in the component window, and you can't select it. In this case, you can select the table row and then use the inspector's icon path to navigate to the WORepetition's bindings inspector. See "<U><A HREF="../HTMLEdit/SelectElements.html">Selecting Elements</A></U>" for more information.
