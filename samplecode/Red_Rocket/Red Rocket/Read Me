Red RocketAn example showing a simple sprite engine using OpenGLThis sample shows the integration of OpenGL as the back end to a simple sprite engine.  A sprite data file is selected on launch and which loads the sprite images and the descriptions of each sprite.  The engine draws he sprites using an othrographic projection and z values for depth sorting.  This allows rotation, translation, scaling and coloration for free.  The demo shows both loading a source color keyed, an 8-bit luminance and 8-bit alpha images.Version 1.0: Initial release (3/20/2002)Requirements: Carbon SetupGL sample. aglString sample, HID Utilities sample, Mac OS X 10.1+ and Project Builder.
