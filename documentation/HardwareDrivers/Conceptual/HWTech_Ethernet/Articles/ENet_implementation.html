The Ethernet controller has an internal Ethernet PHY that provides 10BASE-T/UTP, 100BASE-TX, or 1000BASE-T operation over a standard twisted-pair interface.

In operation, the actual speed of each link is auto-negotiated between the Ethernet PHY device that is internal to the Mid Bridge and the bridge, router, hub, switch, or other Mac or PC to which it is connected. The Ethernet port is auto-sensing and self-configuring to allow connection via either a cross-over or straight-through cable.</p><p>Both CAT 5 unshielded twisted pair (UTP) and shielded twisted pair (STP) cables work with the Ethernet port. An STP cable is recommended for noisy environments or runs of greater than 100 meters.</p>
