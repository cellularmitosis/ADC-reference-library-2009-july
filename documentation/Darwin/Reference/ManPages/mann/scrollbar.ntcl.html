<b>NAME</b>
       scrollbar - Create and manipulate scrollbar widgets

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>scrollbar</b> <u>pathName</u> ?<u>options</u>?

<b>STANDARD</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-activebackground</b>     <b>-highlightcolor</b>      <b>-repeatdelay</b>
       <b>-background</b>           <b>-highlightthickness</b>  <b>-repeatinterval</b>

       <b>-highlightbackground</b>  <b>-relief</b>

       See the <b>options</b> manual entry for details on the standard options.

<b>WIDGET-SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       Command-Line Name:<b>-activerelief</b>
       Database Name:  <b>activeRelief</b>
       Database Class: <b>ActiveRelief</b>

              Specifies  the  relief  to  use  when displaying the element that is active, if any.  Elements
              other than the active element are always displayed with a raised relief.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-command</b>
       Database Name:  <b>command</b>
       Database Class: <b>Command</b>

              Specifies the prefix of a Tcl command to invoke to change the view in  the  widget  associated
              with  the  scrollbar.  When a user requests a view change by manipulating the scrollbar, a Tcl
              command is invoked.  The actual command consists of this option followed by additional  infor-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">mation&nbsp;information</font>
              mation  as  described  later.   This  option  almost always has a value such as <b>.t</b> <b>xview</b> or <b>.t</b>
              <b>yview</b>, consisting of the name of a widget and either <b>xview</b> (if the scrollbar is for horizontal
              scrolling)  or  <b>yview</b>  (for  vertical scrolling).  All scrollable widgets have <b>xview</b> and <b>yview</b>
              commands that take exactly the additional arguments appended by the scrollbar as described  in
              SCROLLING COMMANDS below.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-elementborderwidth</b>
       Database Name:  <b>elementBorderWidth</b>
       Database Class: <b>BorderWidth</b>

              Specifies  the  width  of borders drawn around the internal elements of the scrollbar (the two
              arrows and the slider).  The value may have any of the forms acceptable to  <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.   If
              this value is less than zero, the value of the <b>borderWidth</b> option is used in its place.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-width</b>
       Database Name:  <b>width</b>
       Database Class: <b>Width</b>

              Specifies  the  desired narrow dimension of the scrollbar window, not including 3-D border, if
              any.  For vertical scrollbars this will be the width and for horizontal scrollbars  this  will
              be the height.  The value may have any of the forms acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________


<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  <b>scrollbar</b>  command  creates  a  new  window (given by the <u>pathName</u> argument) and makes it into a
       scrollbar widget.  Additional options, described above, may be specified on the command  line  or  in
       the  option  database  to  configure  aspects  of  the scrollbar such as its colors, orientation, and
       relief.  The <b>scrollbar</b> command returns its <u>pathName</u> argument.  At the time this command  is  invoked,
       there must not exist a window named <u>pathName</u>, but <u>pathName</u>'s parent must exist.

       A  scrollbar  is a widget that displays two arrows, one at each end of the scrollbar, and a <u>slider</u> in
       the middle portion of the scrollbar.  It provides information about what is visible in an  <u>associated</u>
       <u>window</u>  that displays an document of some sort (such as a file being edited or a drawing).  The posi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;position</font>
       tion and size of the slider indicate which portion of the document is visible in the associated  win-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dow.&nbsp;window.</font>
       dow.  For example, if the slider in a vertical scrollbar covers the top third of the area between the
       two arrows, it means that the associated window displays the top third of its document.

       Scrollbars can be used to adjust the view in the associated window by clicking or dragging  with  the
       mouse.  See the BINDINGS section below for details.


<b>ELEMENTS</b>
       A scrollbar displays five elements, which are referred to in the widget commands for the scrollbar:

       <b>arrow1</b>    The top or left arrow in the scrollbar.

       <b>trough1</b>   The region between the slider and <b>arrow1</b>.

       <b>slider</b>    The rectangle that indicates what is visible in the associated widget.

       <b>trough2</b>   The region between the slider and <b>arrow2</b>.

       <b>arrow2</b>    The bottom or right arrow in the scrollbar.


<b>WIDGET</b> <b>COMMAND</b>
       The  <b>scrollbar</b> command creates a new Tcl command whose name is <u>pathName</u>.  This command may be used to
       invoke various operations on the widget.  It has the following general form:
              <u>pathName</u> <u>option</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
       <u>Option</u> and the <u>arg</u>s determine the exact behavior of the command.  The following commands are possible
       for scrollbar widgets:

       <u>pathName</u> <b>activate</b> ?<u>element</u>?
              Marks the element indicated by <u>element</u> as active, which causes it to be displayed as specified
              by the <b>activeBackground</b> and <b>activeRelief</b> options.  The only element values understood by  this
              command are <b>arrow1</b>, <b>slider</b>, or <b>arrow2</b>.  If any other value is specified then no element of the
              scrollbar will be active.  If <u>element</u> is not specified, the command returns the  name  of  the
              element that is currently active, or an empty string if no element is active.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>cget</b> <u>option</u>
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <u>option</u>.  <u>Option</u> may have any of
              the values accepted by the <b>scrollbar</b> command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>configure</b> ?<u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no <u>option</u> is specified, returns a
              list  describing  all of the available options for <u>pathName</u> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for informa-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion&nbsp;information</font>
              tion on the format of this list).  If <u>option</u> is specified with  no  <u>value</u>,  then  the  command
              returns a list describing the one named option (this list will be identical to the correspond-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;corresponding</font>
              ing sublist of the value returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).  If  one  or  more  <u>option-value</u>
              pairs  are  specified,  then the command modifies the given widget <!-- a -->option(s)<!-- /a --> to have the given
              <!-- a -->value(s)<!-- /a -->;  in this case the command returns an empty string.  <u>Option</u> may have any of the  val-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ues&nbsp;values</font>
              ues accepted by the <b>scrollbar</b> command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>delta</b> <u>deltaX</u> <u>deltaY</u>
              Returns  a  real  number indicating the fractional change in the scrollbar setting that corre-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sponds&nbsp;corresponds</font>
              sponds to a given change in slider position.  For example, if the scrollbar is horizontal, the
              result  indicates  how much the scrollbar setting must change to move the slider <u>deltaX</u> pixels
              to the right (<u>deltaY</u> is ignored in this case).  If the scrollbar is vertical, the result indi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cates&nbsp;indicates</font>
              cates  how  much the scrollbar setting must change to move the slider <u>deltaY</u> pixels down.  The
              arguments and the result may be zero or negative.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>fraction</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u>
              Returns a real number between 0 and 1 indicating where the point given by <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> lies in  the
              trough  area  of the scrollbar.  The value 0 corresponds to the top or left of the trough, the
              value 1 corresponds to the bottom or right, 0.5 corresponds to the middle, and so on.  <u>X</u> and <u>y</u>
              must  be pixel coordinates relative to the scrollbar widget.  If <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> refer to a point out-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">side&nbsp;outside</font>
              side the trough, the closest point in the trough is used.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>get</b>
              Returns the scrollbar settings in the form of a list whose elements are the arguments  to  the
              most recent <b>set</b> widget command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>identify</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u>
              Returns the name of the element under the point given by <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> (such as <b>arrow1</b>), or an empty
              string if the point does not lie in any element of the scrollbar.  <u>X</u> and <u>y</u> must be pixel coor-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dinates&nbsp;coordinates</font>
              dinates relative to the scrollbar widget.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>set</b> <u>first</u> <u>last</u>
              This  command  is invoked by the scrollbar's associated widget to tell the scrollbar about the
              current view in the widget.  The command takes two arguments, each of which is a real fraction
              between  0  and  1.   The  fractions describe the range of the document that is visible in the
              associated widget.  For example, if <u>first</u> is 0.2 and <u>last</u> is 0.4, it means that the first part
              of  the  document  visible  in the window is 20% of the way through the document, and the last
              visible part is 40% of the way through.


<b>SCROLLING</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       When the user interacts with the scrollbar, for example by dragging the slider, the  scrollbar  noti-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fies&nbsp;notifies</font>
       fies  the  associated  widget  that it must change its view.  The scrollbar makes the notification by
       evaluating a Tcl command generated from the scrollbar's <b>-command</b> option.  The command may take any of
       the  following forms.  In each case, <u>prefix</u> is the contents of the <b>-command</b> option, which usually has
       a form like <b>.t</b> <b>yview</b>

       <u>prefix</u> <b>moveto</b> <u>fraction</u>
              <u>Fraction</u> is a real number between 0 and 1.  The widget should adjust  its  view  so  that  the
              point given by <u>fraction</u> appears at the beginning of the widget.  If <u>fraction</u> is 0 it refers to
              the beginning of the document.  1.0 refers to the end of the document, 0.333 refers to a point
              one-third of the way through the document, and so on.

       <u>prefix</u> <b>scroll</b> <u>number</u> <b>units</b>
              The  widget  should  adjust  its  view by <u>number</u> units.  The units are defined in whatever way
              makes sense for the widget, such as characters or lines in a text widget.  <u>Number</u> is either 1,
              which  means one unit should scroll off the top or left of the window, or -1, which means that
              one unit should scroll off the bottom or right of the window.

       <u>prefix</u> <b>scroll</b> <u>number</u> <b>pages</b>
              The widget should adjust its view by <u>number</u> pages.  It is up to the widget to define the mean-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;meaning</font>
              ing of a page;  typically it is slightly less than what fits in the window, so that there is a
              slight overlap between the old and new views.  <u>Number</u> is either 1, which means the  next  page
              should become visible, or -1, which means that the previous page should become visible.


<b>OLD</b> <b>COMMAND</b> <b>SYNTAX</b>
       In  versions  of  Tk before 4.0, the <b>set</b> and <b>get</b> widget commands used a different form.  This form is
       still supported for backward compatibility, but it is deprecated.  In the old command syntax, the <b>set</b>
       widget command has the following form:

       <u>pathName</u> <b>set</b> <u>totalUnits</u> <u>windowUnits</u> <u>firstUnit</u> <u>lastUnit</u>
              In  this  form  the arguments are all integers.  <u>TotalUnits</u> gives the total size of the object
              being displayed in the associated widget.  The meaning of one unit depends on  the  associated
              widget;   for  example, in a text editor widget units might correspond to lines of text.  <u>Win</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dowUnits&nbsp;WindowUnits</font>
              <u>dowUnits</u> indicates the total number of units that can fit in  the  associated  window  at  one
              time.   <u>FirstUnit</u>  and <u>lastUnit</u> give the indices of the first and last units currently visible
              in the associated window (zero corresponds to the first unit of the object).

       Under the old syntax the <b>get</b> widget command returns a  list  of  four  integers,  consisting  of  the
       <u>totalUnits</u>, <u>windowUnits</u>, <u>firstUnit</u>, and <u>lastUnit</u> values from the last <b>set</b> widget command.

       The commands generated by scrollbars also have a different form when the old syntax is being used:

       <u>prefix</u> <u>unit</u>
              <u>Unit</u> is an integer that indicates what should appear at the top or left of the associated wid-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">get's&nbsp;widget's</font>
              get's window.  It has the same meaning as the <u>firstUnit</u> and <u>lastUnit</u> arguments to the <b>set</b> wid-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">get&nbsp;widget</font>
              get command.

       The  most  recent <b>set</b> widget command determines whether or not to use the old syntax.  If it is given
       two real arguments then the new syntax will be used in the future, and if it is  given  four  integer
       arguments then the old syntax will be used.


<b>BINDINGS</b>
       Tk automatically creates class bindings for scrollbars that give them the following default behavior.
       If the behavior is different for vertical and  horizontal  scrollbars,  the  horizontal  behavior  is
       described in parentheses.


       [1]    Pressing  button  1 over <b>arrow1</b> causes the view in the associated widget to shift up (left) by
              one unit so that the document appears to move down (right) one unit.  If the  button  is  held
              down, the action auto-repeats.

       [2]    Pressing  button 1 over <b>trough1</b> causes the view in the associated widget to shift up (left) by
              one screenful so that the document appears to move down (right) one screenful.  If the  button
              is held down, the action auto-repeats.

       [3]    Pressing  button  1  over the slider and dragging causes the view to drag with the slider.  If
              the <b>jump</b> option is true, then the view doesn't drag along with the slider;   it  changes  only
              when the mouse button is released.

       [4]    Pressing  button 1 over <b>trough2</b> causes the view in the associated widget to shift down (right)
              by one screenful so that the document appears to move up (left) one screenful.  If the  button
              is held down, the action auto-repeats.

       [5]    Pressing  button  1 over <b>arrow2</b> causes the view in the associated widget to shift down (right)
              by one unit so that the document appears to move up (left) one unit.  If the  button  is  held
              down, the action auto-repeats.

       [6]    If  button  2  is pressed over the trough or the slider, it sets the view to correspond to the
              mouse position;  dragging the mouse with button 2 down causes the view to drag with the mouse.
              If  button 2 is pressed over one of the arrows, it causes the same behavior as pressing button
              1.

       [7]    If button 1 is pressed with the Control key down, then if the mouse is over <b>arrow1</b> or  <b>trough1</b>
              the  view  changes  to  the  very  top (left) of the document;  if the mouse is over <b>arrow2</b> or
              <b>trough2</b> the view changes to the very bottom (right) of the document;  if the mouse is anywhere
              else then the button press has no effect.

       [8]    In vertical scrollbars the Up and Down keys have the same behavior as mouse clicks over <b>arrow1</b>
              and <b>arrow2</b>, respectively.  In horizontal scrollbars these keys have no effect.

       [9]    In vertical scrollbars Control-Up and Control-Down have the same behavior as mouse clicks over
              <b>trough1</b> and <b>trough2</b>, respectively.  In horizontal scrollbars these keys have no effect.

       [10]   In  horizontal  scrollbars  the  Up  and Down keys have the same behavior as mouse clicks over
              <b>arrow1</b> and <b>arrow2</b>, respectively.  In vertical scrollbars these keys have no effect.

       [11]   In horizontal scrollbars Control-Up and Control-Down have the same behavior  as  mouse  clicks
              over <b>trough1</b> and <b>trough2</b>, respectively.  In vertical scrollbars these keys have no effect.

       [12]   The  Prior  and  Next  keys  have  the same behavior as mouse clicks over <b>trough1</b> and <b>trough2</b>,
              respectively.

       [13]   The Home key adjusts the view to the top (left edge) of the document.

       [14]   The End key adjusts the view to the bottom (right edge) of the document.
