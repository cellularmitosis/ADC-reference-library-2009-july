<p>Developers of frameworks have to be more careful than other developers in how they write their code. Many client applications could link in their framework and, because of this wide exposure, any deficiencies in the framework might be magnified throughout a system. The following items discuss programming techniques you can adopt to ensure the efficiency and integrity of your framework.</p>

<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001286-1001755" title="Initialization"></a><h2>Initialization</h2>
<p>The following suggestions and recommendations cover framework initialization.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001286-1002970" title="Class Initialization"></a><h3>Class Initialization</h3>
<p>The <code>initialize</code> class method gives you a place to have some code executed once, lazily, before any other method of the class is invoked. It is typically used to set the version numbers of classes (see <span class="content_text"><a href="FrameworkImpl.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001286-1001777">“Versioning and Compatibility”</a></span>). </p>
<p>The runtime sends <code>initialize</code> to each class in an inheritance chain, even if it hasn’t implemented it; thus it might invoke a class’s <code>initialize</code> method more than once (if, for example, a subclass hasn’t implemented it). Typically you only want the initialization code to be executed only once. One way to ensure this happens is to perform the following check: </p>
<div class="codesample"><table><tr><td scope="row"><pre>if (self == [NSFoo class]) {<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>    // the initializing code<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>}<span></span></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<p>You should never invoke the <code>initialize</code> method explicitly. If you need to trigger the initialization, invoke some harmless method, for example: </p>
<div class="codesample"><table><tr><td scope="row"><pre>[NSImage self];<span></span></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001286-1003343" title="Designated Initializers"></a><h3>Designated Initializers</h3>
<p>A designated initializer is an <code>init</code> method of a class that invokes an <code>init</code> method of the superclass. (Other initializers invoke the <code>init</code> methods defined by the class.) Every public class should have one or more designated initializers. As examples of designated initializers there is NSView’s <code>initWithFrame:</code> and NSResponder’s <code>init</code> method. Where <code>init</code> methods are not meant to be overridden, as is the case with NSString and other abstract classes fronting class clusters, the subclass is expected to implement its own.</p>
<p>Designated initializers should be clearly identified because this information is important to those who want to subclass your class. A subclass can just override the designated initializer and all other initializers will work as designed.</p>
<p>When you implement a class of a framework, you often have to implement its archiving methods as well: <code>initWithCoder:</code> and <code>encodeWithCoder:</code>. Be careful not to do things in the initialization code path that doesn’t happen when the object is unarchived. A good way to achieve this is to call a common routine from your designated initializers and <code>initWithCoder:</code> (which is a designated initializer itself) if your class implements archiving. </p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001286-1003669" title="Error Detection During Initialization"></a><h3>Error Detection During Initialization</h3>
<p>A well-designed initialization method should complete the following steps to ensure the proper detection and propagation of errors:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><p>Reassign self by invoking <code>super</code>'s <code>init</code> method.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Check the returned value for <code>nil</code>, which indicates that some error occurred in the superclass initialization.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>If an error occurs while initializing the current class, free the object and return <code>nil</code>. </p></li></ol>
<p><span class="content_text"><a href="FrameworkImpl.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001286-1004028-BAJBJCIA">Listing 1</a></span> illustrates how you might do this.</p>

<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001286-1001777" title="Versioning and Compatibility"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001286-1001777-BAJFFEEA" title="Versioning and Compatibility"></a><h2>Versioning and Compatibility</h2>
<p>When you add new classes or methods to your framework, it is not usually necessary to specify new version numbers for each new feature group. Developers typically perform (or should perform) Objective-C runtime checks such as <code>respondsToSelector:</code> to determine if a feature is available on a given system. These runtime tests are the preferred and most dynamic way to check for new features.</p>
<p>However, you can employ several techniques to make sure each new version of your framework are properly marked and made as compatible as possible with earlier versions.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001286-1004702" title="Framework Version"></a><h3>Framework Version</h3>
<p>When the presence of a new feature or bug fix isn’t easily detectable with runtime tests, you should provide developers with some way to check for the change. One way to achieve this is to store the exact version number of the framework and make this number accessible to developers:</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>Document the change (in a release note, for instance) under a version number.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Set the current version number of your framework and provide some way to make it globally accessible. You might store the version number in your framework’s information property list (<code>Info.plist</code>) and access it from there.</p></li></ul>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001286-1004921" title="Keyed Archiving"></a><h3>Keyed Archiving</h3>
<p>If the objects of your framework need to be written to nib files, they must be able to archive themselves. You also need to archive any documents that use the archiving mechanisms to store document data. For archiving, you can use the “old style” (<code>initWithCoder:</code> and <code>encodeWithCoder:</code>); but, for better compatibility with past, current, and future versions of your framework, you should use the keyed archiving mechanism.</p>
<p>Keyed archiving lets objects read and write archived values with keys. This approach gives you more flexibility in both backwards and forwards compatibility than the old archiving mechanism, which requires that code always maintain the same order for values read and written. Old-style archiving also does not have a good way to change what has been written out. For more information on keyed archiving, see <em><a href="../../Archiving/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000047i" target="_top">Archives and Serializations Programming Guide for Cocoa</a></em>.</p>
<p>Use keyed archiving for your new classes. If your previously released classes use the old style of archiving, you don’t need to do anything. Objects that implemented old archiving prior to Mac OS X version 10.2 need to be able to read and write their contents from and to old archives. However, if you add new attributes in Mac OS X v10.2 and later, you don’t have to store them in old archives, and in fact you shouldn’t (because this might render the old archives unreadable on older systems). You should switch to using keyed archiving for new attributes.</p>
<p>You should be aware of certain facts about keyed archiving:</p>
<ul class="spaceabove"><li class="li"><p>If a key is missing in an archive, asking for its value will return <code>nil</code>, <code>NULL</code>, <code>NO</code>, 0, or 0.0, depending on the type being asked for. Test for this return value to reduce the data that you write out. In addition, you can find out whether a key was written to the archive.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>With old-style archiving, the burden of compatibility fell on the implementation of <code>initWithCoder:</code>. With keyed archiving, both the encode and decode methods can do things to ensure compatibility. For instance, the encode method of a new version of a class might write new values using keys but can still write out older fields so that older versions of the class can still understand the object. In addition, decode methods might want to deal with missing values in some reasonable way to maintain some flexibility for future versions.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>A recommended naming convention for archive keys for framework classes is to begin with the prefix used for other API elements of the framework and then use the name of the instance variable. Just make sure that names cannot conflict with the names of any superclass or subclass.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>If you have a utility function that writes out a basic data type (in other words, a value that isn’t an object), be sure to use a unique key. For example, if you have an “archiveRect” routine that archives a rectangle should take a key argument, and either use that; or, if it writes out multiple values (for instance, four floats), it should append its own unique bits to the provided key.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Archiving bitfields as-is can be dangerous due to compiler and endianness dependencies. You should archive them only when, for performance reasons, a lot of bits need to be written out, many times. See <span class="content_text"><a href="FrameworkImpl.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001286-1005950">“Bitfields”</a></span> for a suggestion.</p></li></ul>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001286-1004941" title="Object Sizes and Reserved Fields"></a><h3>Object Sizes and Reserved Fields</h3>
<p>Each Objective-C object has a size that can be determined by the total size of its own instance variables plus the instance variables of all superclasses. You cannot change the size of a class without requiring the recompilation of subclasses that also have instance variables. To maintain binary compatibility, you usually cannot change object sizes by introducing new instance variables into your classes or getting rid of unneeded ones. </p>
<p>So, for new classes, it's a good idea to leave a few extra “reserved” fields for future expansion. If there are going to be few instances of a class this is clearly not an issue. But for classes instantiated by the thousands, you might want to keep the reserved variable small (say, four bytes for an arbitrary object). </p>
<p>For older classes whose objects have run out of room (and assuming the instance variables were not exported as public), you can move instance variables around, or pack them together in smaller fields. This rearranging may allow you to add new data without growing the total object size. Or you can treat one of the remaining reserved slots as a pointer to an additional block of memory, which the object allocates as it is initialized (and deallocates as it is released). Or you can put the extra data into an external hash table (such as a NSDictionary); this strategy works well for instance variables that are seldom created or used.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001286-1001797" title="Exceptions and Errors"></a><h2>Exceptions and Errors</h2>
<p>Most Cocoa framework methods do not force developers to catch and handle exceptions. That is because exceptions are not raised as a normal part of execution, and are not typically used to communicate expected runtime or user errors. Examples of these errors include: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>File not found</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>No such user</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Attempt to open a wrong type of document in an application</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Error in converting a string to a specified encoding</p></li></ul>
<p>However, Cocoa does raise exceptions to indicate programming or logic errors such as the following:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Array index out of bounds</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Attempt to mutate immutable objects</p></li>
<li class="li"><p>Bad argument type</p></li></ul>
<p>The expectation is that the developer will catch these kinds of errors during testing and address them before shipping the application; thus the application should not need to handle the exceptions at runtime. If an exception is raised and no part of the application catches it, the top-level default handler typically catches and reports the exception and execution then continues. Developers can choose to replace this default exception-catcher with one that gives more detail about what went wrong and offers the option to save data and quit the application. </p>
<p>Errors are another area where Cocoa frameworks differ from some other software libraries. Cocoa methods generally do not return error codes. In cases where there is one reasonable or likely reason for an error, the methods rely on a simple test of a boolean or object (<code>nil</code>/non-<code>nil</code>) returned value; the reasons for a <code>NO</code> or <code>nil</code> returned value are documented. You should not use error codes to indicate programming errors to be handled at runtime, but instead raise exceptions or in some cases simply log the error without raising an exception. </p>
<p>For instance, NSDictionary’s <code>objectForKey:</code> method either returns the found object or <code>nil</code> if it can’t find the object. NSArray’s <code>objectAtIndex:</code> method can never return <code>nil</code> (except for the overriding general language convention that any message to <code>nil</code> results in a <code>nil </code>return), because an NSArray object cannot store <code>nil</code> values, and by definition any out-of-bounds access is a programming error that should result in an exception. Many <code>init</code> methods return <code>nil</code> when the object cannot be initialized with the parameters supplied. </p>
<p>In the small number of cases where a method has a valid need for multiple distinct error codes, it should specify them in a by-reference argument that returns either an error code, a localized error string, or some other information describing the error. For example, you might want to return the error as an NSError object; look at the <code>NSError.h</code> header file in Foundation for details. This argument might be in addition to a simpler <code>BOOL</code> or <code>nil</code> that is directly returned. The method should also observe the convention that all by-reference arguments are optional and thus allow the sender to pass <code>NULL</code> for the error-code argument if they do not wish to know about the error. </p>
<div class="importantbox"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001286-DontLinkElementID_3" title="Important:"></a><p><strong>Important:</strong>&nbsp;

The NSError class was not publicly available until Mac OS X v10.3.</p><p></p></div>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001286-1001823" title="Framework Data"></a><h2>Framework Data</h2>
<p>How you handle framework data has implications for performance, cross-platform compatibility, and other purposes. This section discusses techniques involving framework data. </p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001286-1005930" title="Constant Data"></a><h3>Constant Data</h3>
<p>For performance reasons, it is good to mark as constant as much framework data as possible because doing so reduces the size of the <code>__DATA</code> segment of the Mach-O binary. Global and static data that is not <code>const</code> ends up in the <code>__DATA</code> section of the <code>__DATA</code> segment. This kind of data takes up memory in every running instance of an application that uses the framework. Although an extra 500 bytes (for example) might not seem so bad, it might cause an increment in the number of pages required—an additional four kilobytes per application. </p>
<p>You should mark any data that is constant as <code>const</code>. If there are no <code>char *</code> pointers in the block, this will cause the data to land in the <code>__TEXT</code> segment (which makes it truly constant); otherwise it will stay in the <code>__DATA</code> segment but will not be written on (unless prebinding is not done or is violated by having to slide the binary at load time). </p>
<p>You should initialize static variables to ensure that they are merged into the <code>__data</code> section of the <code>__DATA</code> segment as opposed to the <code>__bss</code> section. If there is no obvious value to use for initialization, use 0, <code>NULL</code>, 0.0, or whatever is appropriate. </p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001286-1005950" title="Bitfields"></a><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001286-1005950-BAJDCGCE" title="Bitfields"></a><h3>Bitfields</h3>
<p>Using signed values for bitfields, especially one-bit bitfields, can result in undefined behavior if code assumes the value is a boolean. One-bit bitfields should always be unsigned. Because the only values that can be stored in such a bitfield are 0 and -1 (depending on the compiler implementation), comparing this bitfield to 1 is false. For example, if you come across something like this in your code: </p>
<div class="codesample"><table><tr><td scope="row"><pre>BOOL isAttachment:1;<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>int startTracking:1;<span></span></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<p>You should change the type to <code>unsigned int</code>. </p>
<p>Another issue with bitfields is archiving. In general, you shouldn’t write bitfields to disk or archives in the form they are in, as the format might be different when they are read again on another architecture, or on another compiler.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001286-1005970" title="Memory Allocation"></a><h3>Memory Allocation</h3>
<p>In framework code, the best course is to avoid allocating memory altogether, if you can help it. If you need a temporary buffer for some reason, it’s usually better to use the stack than to allocate a buffer. However, stack is limited in size (usually 512 kilobytes altogether), so the decision to use the stack depends on the function and the size of the buffer you need. Typically if the buffer size is 1000 bytes (or <code>MAXPATHLEN</code>) or less, using the stack is acceptable. </p>
<p>One refinement is to start off using the stack, but switch to a <code>malloc</code>’ed buffer if the size requirements go beyond the stack buffer size. <span class="content_text"><a href="FrameworkImpl.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001286-1008754-BAJHEFCE">Listing 2</a></span> presents a code snippet that does just that: </p>

<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001286-1001843" title="Language Issues"></a><h2>Language Issues</h2>
<p>The following items discuss issues related to Objective-C, including protocols, object comparison, and when to send <code>autorelease</code> to objects.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001286-1006774" title="Messaging nil"></a><h3>Messaging nil</h3>
<p>In Objective-C, it is valid to send a message to a <code>nil</code> object as long as the message is typed to return an object, any pointer type, or any integer scalar of size less than or equal to <code>sizeof(void*)</code>; if it does, a message sent to <code>nil</code> returns <code>nil</code>. This language feature is a valuable programming asset, but there is one issue that you should be aware of. If the message sent to <code>nil</code> returns anything other than the forementioned value types (for example, if it returns any <code>struct</code> type, any floating-point type, or any vector type) the return value is undefined. In general, it is considered bad style to rely on this behavior for return types other than an object. Sending messages to a <code>nil</code> object with one of these methods might work fine on Power PC systems, but will not on other architectures. </p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001286-1007347" title="Object Comparison"></a><h3>Object Comparison</h3>
<p>You should be aware of an important difference between the generic object-comparison method <code>isEqual:</code> and the comparison methods that are associated with an object type, such as <code>isEqualToString:</code>. The <code>isEqual:</code> method allows you to pass arbitrary objects as arguments and returns <code>NO</code> if the objects aren’t of the same class. Methods such as <code>isEqualToString:</code> and <code>isEqualToArray:</code> usually assume the argument is of the specified type (which is that of the receiver). They therefore do not perform type-checking and consequently they are faster but not as safe. For values retrieved from external sources, such as an application’s information property list (<code>Info.plist</code>) or preferences, the use of <code>isEqual:</code> is preferred because it is safer; when the types are known, use <code>isEqualToString:</code> instead. </p>
<p>A further point about <code>isEqual:</code> is its connection to the <code>hash</code> method. One basic invariant for objects that are put in a hash-based Cocoa collection such as an NSDictionary or NSSet is that if <code>[A isEqual:B] == YES</code>, then <code>[A hash] == [B hash]</code>. So if you override <code>isEqual:</code> in your class, you should also override <code>hash</code> to preserve this invariant. By default <code>isEqual:</code> looks for pointer equality of each object’s address, and <code>hash</code> returns a hash value based on each object’s address, so this invariant holds.</p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001286-1006830" title="Protocols"></a><h3>Protocols</h3>
<p>Protocols are an interesting Objective-C concept, but they are of limited use in Cocoa APIs. One reason for this is that protocols are quite strict by design. For example, consider a hypothetical NSDataSource protocol with ten methods. If a developer conformed to this protocol and implemented all of its methods, and you later add a new method to the protocol, you would break their conformance. So protocols tend to be limited to the set of methods they had at the time they were first made public (unless the protocol is one that you do not expect other developers to ever implement). Consequently, you should use protocols only when you are certain that the set of methods is not likely to grow. If you have to expand the protocol, you should probably add a new protocol that augments the first one, or you could add a new method outside the protocol and check for the existence of the method before sending it. </p>
<p>Primarily because of this reason, you don’t use formal protocols to declare delegation methods. Another reason delegation methods are declared as (unimplemented) categories on NSObject—that is, informal protocols—is because implementing each of them is optional. </p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001286-1006856" title="Autoreleasing Objects"></a><h3>Autoreleasing Objects</h3>
<p>In your methods and functions that return object values, make sure that you return these values <code>autoreleased</code> <em>unless</em> they are object-creation or object-copy methods (<code>new</code>, <code>alloc</code>, copy and their variants). “Autoreleased” in this context does not necessarily mean the object has to be explicitly autoreleased—that is, sending <code>autorelease</code> to the object just before returning it. In a general sense, it simply means the return value is not freed by the caller. </p>
<p>For performance reasons, it’s advisable to avoid autoreleasing objects in method implementations whenever you can, especially with code that might be executed frequently within a short period; an example of such code would be a loop with unknown and potentially high loop count. For instance, instead of sending the following message:</p>
<div class="codesample"><table><tr><td scope="row"><pre>[NSString stringWithCharacters:]<span></span></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<p>Send the following message:</p>
<div class="codesample"><table><tr><td scope="row"><pre>[[NSString alloc] initWithCharacters:]<span></span></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<p>And explicitly release the string object when you are finished with it. Remember there are times, however, when you need to send <code>autorelease</code> to objects, as when returning such objects from a function or method. </p>
<a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001286-1006882" title="Accessor Methods"></a><h3>Accessor Methods</h3>
<p>An important question is what is the right thing to do in accessor methods. For instance, if you return an instance variable directly in a get method, and the set method is called right away, freeing the previous value might be dangerous because it might free the value you returned earlier. The guideline for Cocoa frameworks has been to implement set methods to autorelease previous value, unless there are situations in which the set method in question can be called very often, such as in tight loops. In practice this is rarely the case except for some low-level objects. In addition, generic collections such as NSAttributedString, NSArray, and NSDictionary never autorelease objects, mainly to preserve object life times. Instead they simply retain and release their objects. They also should document this fact so that the client is aware of the behavior. </p>
<p>For framework code now being written, the recommendation is to autorelease objects in the get methods, as this is the safest route: </p>
<div class="codesample"><table><tr><td scope="row"><pre>- (NSString *)title {<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>    return [[instanceVar retain] autorelease];<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>}<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre> <span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>- (void)setTitle:(NSString *)newTitle {<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>    if (instanceVar != newTitle) {<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>        [instanceVar release];<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>        instanceVar = [newTitle copy];<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>        // or retain, depending on object &amp; usage<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>    }<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>}<span></span></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<p>One more consideration in set methods is whether to use <code>copy</code> or <code>retain</code>. Use <code>copy</code> if you are interested in the value of the object and not the actual object itself. A general rule of thumb is to use <code>copy</code> for objects which implement the NSCopying protocol. (You wouldn’t do this check at runtime. just look it up in the reference documentation.) Typically value objects such as strings, colors, and URLs, should be copied; views, windows, and so on should be retained. For some other objects (arrays, for instance), whether to use <code>copy</code> or <code>retain</code> depends on the situation.   </p>
