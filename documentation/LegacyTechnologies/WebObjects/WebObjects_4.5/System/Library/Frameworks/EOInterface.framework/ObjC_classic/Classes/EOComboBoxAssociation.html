The itemsin the combo box can be entered manually, or for a relationship,constructed dynamically from values supplied by an EODisplayGroup. EOComboBoxAssociationis very similar to the EOPopUpAssociation.</p><br><table border = "1"><tr><td scope="row"><b>Usable With</b></td></tr><tr><td scope="row">NSComboBox (Application Kit)</td></tr></table><br><br><table border = "1"><tr><td scope="row"><b>Aspects</b></td></tr><tr><td scope="row">titles</td><td>Property of the enterprise objects in an EODisplayGroupthat supplies the titles for the items in the combo box list.</td></tr><tr><td scope="row">selectedTitle</td><td>String property of the enterprise object supplying thetitle to display in the combo box.

Each is described below.</p><br><h2>Selecting a String from a Static List</h2><p>Suppose you have a Movie display group and you want to providea combo box for setting the rating from a static list of strings.In this example, a Movie object's rating is a string propertyrather than a relationship to a Rating object). To do this, in InterfaceBuilder, type the list of ratings into the combo box. Control-draga connection from the combo box to the Movie display group. Choose EOComboBoxAssociationin the Connections inspector, and bind the selectedTitle aspectto the "rating" key.</p><br><h2>Selecting a String from a Dynamic List</h2><p>This example is similar to the previous one, except in thisexample, a Movie object's rating is chosen from strings in a Ratingdatabase table. There's a Rating EODisplayGroup that fetches theratings into Rating objects, and the combo box is filled from the"ratingString" property of the rating display group's Ratingobjects. To do this, in Interface Builder, control-drag a connectionfrom the combo box to the Ratings display group. Choose EOComboBoxAssociationin the Connections inspector, and bind the titles aspect to the"ratingString" key. Similarly, control-drag a connection fromthe combo box to the Movie display group. Again choose EOComboBoxAssociationin the Connections inspector, and bind the selectedTitle aspectto the "rating" key.</p><br><h2>Selecting the Destination of a To-One Relationship</h2><p>Suppose you have a list of employees and want to assign eachemployee a department. In terms of the object model, you want toassign a Department object as the destination of an Employee object's <b>department</b> relationship.To do this, in Interface Builder, control-drag a connection fromthe combo box to a Department display group. Choose EOComboBoxAssociationin the Connections inspector, and bind the titles aspect to the"name" key. Similarly, control-drag a connection from the combobox to the Employee display group. Again choose EOComboBoxAssociationin the Connections inspector, and bind the selectedObject to the"department" key.</p><p>If the selectedObject aspect is bound and the user types avalue that doesn't match any of those currently in the list, anerror panel is displayed.</p><br><BR><br><a href="../EOInterfaceTOC.html"><img src="../../../../../../images/up.gif" border="0" alt="Table of Contents"></a> </BODY></HTML>
