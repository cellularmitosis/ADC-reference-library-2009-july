<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       This module implements the "URI" class.  Objects of this class represent "Uniform Resource Identifier
       references" as specified in RFC 2396 (and updated by RFC 2732).

       A Uniform Resource Identifier is a compact string of characters that identifies an abstract or
       physical resource.  A Uniform Resource Identifier can be further classified as either a Uniform
       Resource Locator (URL) or a Uniform Resource Name (URN).  The distinction between URL and URN does
       not matter to the "URI" class interface. A "URI-reference" is a URI that may have additional
       information attached in the form of a fragment identifier.

       An absolute URI reference consists of three parts:  a <u>scheme</u>, a <u>scheme-specific</u> <u>part</u> and a <u>fragment</u>
       identifier.  A subset of URI references share a common syntax for hierarchical namespaces.  For
       these, the scheme-specific part is further broken down into <u>authority</u>, <u>path</u> and <u>query</u> components.
       These URIs can also take the form of relative URI references, where the scheme (and usually also the
       authority) component is missing, but implied by the context of the URI reference.  The three forms of
       URI reference syntax are summarized as follows:

         &lt;scheme&gt;:&lt;scheme-specific-part&gt;#&lt;fragment&gt;
         &lt;scheme&gt;://&lt;authority&gt;&lt;path&gt;?&lt;query&gt;#&lt;fragment&gt;
         &lt;path&gt;?&lt;query&gt;#&lt;fragment&gt;

       The components into which a URI reference can be divided depend on the <u>scheme</u>.  The "URI" class
       provides methods to get and set the individual components.  The methods available for a specific
       "URI" object depend on the scheme.

<b>CONSTRUCTORS</b>
       The following methods construct new "URI" objects:

       $uri = URI-&gt;new( $str )
       $uri = URI-&gt;new( $str, $scheme )
           Constructs a new URI object.  The string representation of a URI is given as argument, together
           with an optional scheme specification.  Common URI wrappers like "" and &lt;&gt;, as well as leading
           and trailing white space, are automatically removed from the $str argument before it is processed
           further.

           The constructor determines the scheme, maps this to an appropriate URI subclass, constructs a new
           object of that class and returns it.

           The $scheme argument is only used when $str is a relative URI.  It can be either a simple string
           that denotes the scheme, a string containing an absolute URI reference, or an absolute "URI"
           object.  If no $scheme is specified for a relative URI $str, then $str is simply treated as a
           generic URI (no scheme-specific methods available).

           The set of characters available for building URI references is restricted (see URI::Escape).
           Characters outside this set are automatically escaped by the URI constructor.

       $uri = URI-&gt;new_abs( $str, $base_uri )
           Constructs a new absolute URI object.  The $str argument can denote a relative or absolute URI.
           If relative, then it is absolutized using $base_uri as base. The $base_uri must be an absolute
           URI.

       $uri = URI::file-&gt;new( $filename )
       $uri = URI::file-&gt;new( $filename, $os )
           Constructs a new <u>file</u> URI from a file name.  See URI::file.

       $uri = URI::file-&gt;new_abs( $filename )
       $uri = URI::file-&gt;new_abs( $filename, $os )
           Constructs a new absolute <u>file</u> URI from a file name.  See URI::file.

       $uri = URI::file-&gt;cwd
           Returns the current working directory as a <u>file</u> URI.  See URI::file.

       $uri-&gt;clone
           Returns a copy of the $uri.

<b>COMMON</b> <b>METHODS</b>
       The methods described in this section are available for all "URI" objects.

       Methods that give access to components of a URI always return the old value of the component.  The
       value returned is "undef" if the component was not present.  There is generally a difference between
       a component that is empty (represented as "") and a component that is missing (represented as
       "undef").  If an accessor method is given an argument, it updates the corresponding component in
       addition to returning the old value of the component.  Passing an undefined argument removes the
       component (if possible).  The description of each accessor method indicates whether the component is
       passed as an escaped or an unescaped string.  A component that can be further divided into sub-parts
       are usually passed escaped, as unescaping might change its semantics.

       The common methods available for all URI are:

       $uri-&gt;scheme
       $uri-&gt;scheme( $new_scheme )
           Sets and returns the scheme part of the $uri.  If the $uri is relative, then $uri-&gt;scheme returns
           "undef".  If called with an argument, it updates the scheme of $uri, possibly changing the class
           of $uri, and returns the old scheme value.  The method croaks if the new scheme name is illegal;
           a scheme name must begin with a letter and must consist of only US-ASCII letters, numbers, and a
           few special marks: ".", "+", "-".  This restriction effectively means that the scheme must be
           passed unescaped.  Passing an undefined argument to the scheme method makes the URI relative (if
           possible).

           Letter case does not matter for scheme names.  The string returned by $uri-&gt;scheme is always
           lowercase.  If you want the scheme just as it was written in the URI in its original case, you
           can use the $uri-&gt;_scheme method instead.

       $uri-&gt;opaque
       $uri-&gt;opaque( $new_opaque )
           Sets and returns the scheme-specific part of the $uri (everything between the scheme and the
           fragment) as an escaped string.

       $uri-&gt;path
       $uri-&gt;path( $new_path )
           Sets and returns the same value as $uri-&gt;opaque unless the URI supports the generic syntax for
           hierarchical namespaces.  In that case the generic method is overridden to set and return the
           part of the URI between the <u>host</u> <u>name</u> and the <u>fragment</u>.

       $uri-&gt;fragment
       $uri-&gt;fragment( $new_frag )
           Returns the fragment identifier of a URI reference as an escaped string.

       $uri-&gt;as_string
           Returns a URI object to a plain string.  URI objects are also converted to plain strings
           automatically by overloading.  This means that $uri objects can be used as plain strings in most
           Perl constructs.

       $uri-&gt;canonical
           Returns a normalized version of the URI.  The rules for normalization are scheme-dependent.  They
           usually involve lowercasing the scheme and Internet host name components, removing the explicit
           port specification if it matches the default port, uppercasing all escape sequences, and
           unescaping octets that can be better represented as plain characters.

           For efficiency reasons, if the $uri is already in normalized form, then a reference to it is
           returned instead of a copy.

       $uri-&gt;eq( $other_uri )
       URI::eq( $first_uri, $other_uri )
           Tests whether two URI references are equal.  URI references that normalize to the same string are
           considered equal.  The method can also be used as a plain function which can also test two string
           arguments.

           If you need to test whether two "URI" object references denote the same object, use the '=='
           operator.

       $uri-&gt;abs( $base_uri )
           Returns an absolute URI reference.  If $uri is already absolute, then a reference to it is simply
           returned.  If the $uri is relative, then a new absolute URI is constructed by combining the $uri
           and the $base_uri, and returned.

       $uri-&gt;rel( $base_uri )
           Returns a relative URI reference if it is possible to make one that denotes the same resource
           relative to $base_uri.  If not, then $uri is simply returned.

<b>GENERIC</b> <b>METHODS</b>
       The following methods are available to schemes that use the common/generic syntax for hierarchical
       namespaces.  The descriptions of schemes below indicate which these are.  Unknown schemes are assumed
       to support the generic syntax, and therefore the following methods:

       $uri-&gt;authority
       $uri-&gt;authority( $new_authority )
           Sets and returns the escaped authority component of the $uri.

       $uri-&gt;path
       $uri-&gt;path( $new_path )
           Sets and returns the escaped path component of the $uri (the part between the host name and the
           query or fragment).  The path can never be undefined, but it can be the empty string.

       $uri-&gt;path_query
       $uri-&gt;path_query( $new_path_query )
           Sets and returns the escaped path and query components as a single entity.  The path and the
           query are separated by a "?" character, but the query can itself contain "?".

       $uri-&gt;path_segments
       $uri-&gt;path_segments( $segment, ... )
           Sets and returns the path.  In a scalar context, it returns the same value as $uri-&gt;path.  In a
           list context, it returns the unescaped path segments that make up the path.  Path segments that
           have parameters are returned as an anonymous array.  The first element is the unescaped path
           segment proper;  subsequent elements are escaped parameter strings.  Such an anonymous array uses
           overloading so it can be treated as a string too, but this string does not include the
           parameters.

           Note that absolute paths have the empty string as their first <u>path</u><b>_</b><u>segment</u>, i.e. the <u>path</u>
           "/foo/bar" have 3 <u>path</u><b>_</b><u>segments</u>; "", "foo" and "bar".

       $uri-&gt;query
       $uri-&gt;query( $new_query )
           Sets and returns the escaped query component of the $uri.

       $uri-&gt;query_form
       $uri-&gt;query_form( $key1 =&gt; $val1, $key2 =&gt; $val2, ... )
       $uri-&gt;query_form( \@key_value_pairs )
       $uri-&gt;query_form( \%hash )
           Sets and returns query components that use the <u>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</u> format.
           Key/value pairs are separated by "&amp;", and the key is separated from the value by a "=" character.

           The form can be set either by passing separate key/value pairs, or via an array or hash
           reference.  Passing an empty array or an empty hash removes the query component, whereas passing
           no arguments at all leaves the component unchanged.  The order of keys is undefined if a hash
           reference is passed.  The old value is always returned as a list of separate key/value pairs.
           Assigning this list to a hash is unwise as the keys returned might repeat.

           The values passed when setting the form can be plain strings or references to arrays of strings.
           Passing an array of values has the same effect as passing the key repeatedly with one value at a
           time.  All the following statements have the same effect:

               $uri-&gt;query_form(foo =&gt; 1, foo =&gt; 2);
               $uri-&gt;query_form(foo =&gt; [1, 2]);
               $uri-&gt;query_form([ foo =&gt; 1, foo =&gt; 2 ]);
               $uri-&gt;query_form([ foo =&gt; [1, 2] ]);
               $uri-&gt;query_form({ foo =&gt; [1, 2] });

           The "URI::QueryParam" module can be loaded to add further methods to manipulate the form of a
           URI.  See URI::QueryParam for details.

       $uri-&gt;query_keywords
       $uri-&gt;query_keywords( $keywords, ... )
       $uri-&gt;query_keywords( \@keywords )
           Sets and returns query components that use the keywords separated by "+" format.

           The keywords can be set either by passing separate keywords directly or by passing a reference to
           an array of keywords.  Passing an empty array removes the query component, whereas passing no
           arguments at all leaves the component unchanged.  The old value is always returned as a list of
           separate words.

<b>SERVER</b> <b>METHODS</b>
       For schemes where the <u>authority</u> component denotes an Internet host, the following methods are
       available in addition to the generic methods.

       $uri-&gt;userinfo
       $uri-&gt;userinfo( $new_userinfo )
           Sets and returns the escaped userinfo part of the authority component.

           For some schemes this is a user name and a password separated by a colon.  This practice is not
           recommended. Embedding passwords in clear text (such as URI) has proven to be a security risk in
           almost every case where it has been used.

       $uri-&gt;host
       $uri-&gt;host( $new_host )
           Sets and returns the unescaped hostname.

           If the $new_host string ends with a colon and a number, then this number also sets the port.

       $uri-&gt;port
       $uri-&gt;port( $new_port )
           Sets and returns the port.  The port is a simple integer that should be greater than 0.

           If a port is not specified explicitly in the URI, then the URI scheme's default port is returned.
           If you don't want the default port substituted, then you can use the $uri-&gt;_port method instead.

       $uri-&gt;host_port
       $uri-&gt;host_port( $new_host_port )
           Sets and returns the host and port as a single unit.  The returned value includes a port, even if
           it matches the default port.  The host part and the port part are separated by a colon: ":".

       $uri-&gt;default_port
           Returns the default port of the URI scheme to which $uri belongs.  For <u>http</u> this is the number
           80, for <u>ftp</u> this is the number 21, etc.  The default port for a scheme can not be changed.

<b>SCHEME-SPECIFIC</b> <b>SUPPORT</b>
       Scheme-specific support is provided for the following URI schemes.  For "URI" objects that do not
       belong to one of these, you can only use the common and generic methods.

       <b>data</b>:
           The <u>data</u> URI scheme is specified in RFC 2397.  It allows inclusion of small data items as
           "immediate" data, as if it had been included externally.

           "URI" objects belonging to the data scheme support the common methods and two new methods to
           access their scheme-specific components: $uri-&gt;media_type and $uri-&gt;data.  See URI::data for
           details.

       <b>file</b>:
           An old specification of the <u>file</u> URI scheme is found in RFC 1738.  A new RFC 2396 based
           specification in not available yet, but file URI references are in common use.

           "URI" objects belonging to the file scheme support the common and generic methods.  In addition,
           they provide two methods for mapping file URIs back to local file names; $uri-&gt;file and
           $uri-&gt;dir.  See URI::file for details.

       <b>ftp</b>:
           An old specification of the <u>ftp</u> URI scheme is found in RFC 1738.  A new RFC 2396 based
           specification in not available yet, but ftp URI references are in common use.

           "URI" objects belonging to the ftp scheme support the common, generic and server methods.  In
           addition, they provide two methods for accessing the userinfo sub-components: $uri-&gt;user and
           $uri-&gt;password.

       <b>gopher</b>:
           The <u>gopher</u> URI scheme is specified in &lt;draft-murali-url-gopher-1996-12-04&gt; and will hopefully be
           available as a RFC 2396 based specification.

           "URI" objects belonging to the gopher scheme support the common, generic and server methods. In
           addition, they support some methods for accessing gopher-specific path components:
           $uri-&gt;gopher_type, $uri-&gt;selector, $uri-&gt;search, $uri-&gt;string.

       <b>http</b>:
           The <u>http</u> URI scheme is specified in RFC 2616.  The scheme is used to reference resources hosted
           by HTTP servers.

           "URI" objects belonging to the http scheme support the common, generic and server methods.

       <b>https</b>:
           The <u>https</u> URI scheme is a Netscape invention which is commonly implemented.  The scheme is used
           to reference HTTP servers through SSL connections.  Its syntax is the same as http, but the
           default port is different.

       <b>ldap</b>:
           The <u>ldap</u> URI scheme is specified in RFC 2255.  LDAP is the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol.
           An ldap URI describes an LDAP search operation to perform to retrieve information from an LDAP
           directory.

           "URI" objects belonging to the ldap scheme support the common, generic and server methods as well
           as ldap-specific methods: $uri-&gt;dn, $uri-&gt;attributes, $uri-&gt;scope, $uri-&gt;filter,
           $uri-&gt;extensions.  See URI::ldap for details.

       <b>ldapi</b>:
           Like the <u>ldap</u> URI scheme, but uses a UNIX domain socket.  The server methods are not supported,
           and the local socket path is available as $uri-&gt;un_path.  The <u>ldapi</u> scheme is used by the
           OpenLDAP package.  There is no real specification for it, but it is mentioned in various OpenLDAP
           manual pages.

       <b>ldaps</b>:
           Like the <u>ldap</u> URI scheme, but uses an SSL connection.  This scheme is deprecated, as the
           preferred way is to use the <u>start</u><b>_</b><u>tls</u> mechanism.

       <b>mailto</b>:
           The <u>mailto</u> URI scheme is specified in RFC 2368.  The scheme was originally used to designate the
           Internet mailing address of an individual or service.  It has (in RFC 2368) been extended to
           allow setting of other mail header fields and the message body.

           "URI" objects belonging to the mailto scheme support the common methods and the generic query
           methods.  In addition, they support the following mailto-specific methods: $uri-&gt;to,
           $uri-&gt;headers.

       <b>mms</b>:
           The <u>mms</u> URL specification can be found at &lt;<a href="http://sdp.ppona.com/">http://sdp.ppona.com/</a> "URI" objects belonging to the
           mms scheme support the common, generic, and server methods, with the exception of userinfo and
           query-related sub-components.

       <b>news</b>:
           The <u>news</u>, <u>nntp</u> and <u>snews</u> URI schemes are specified in &lt;draft-gilman-news-url-01&gt; and will
           hopefully be available as an RFC 2396 based specification soon.

           "URI" objects belonging to the news scheme support the common, generic and server methods.  In
           addition, they provide some methods to access the path: $uri-&gt;group and $uri-&gt;message.

       <b>nntp</b>:
           See <u>news</u> scheme.

       <b>pop</b>:
           The <u>pop</u> URI scheme is specified in RFC 2384. The scheme is used to reference a POP3 mailbox.

           "URI" objects belonging to the pop scheme support the common, generic and server methods.  In
           addition, they provide two methods to access the userinfo components: $uri-&gt;user and $uri-&gt;auth

       <b>rlogin</b>:
           An old specification of the <u>rlogin</u> URI scheme is found in RFC 1738. "URI" objects belonging to
           the rlogin scheme support the common, generic and server methods.

       <b>rtsp</b>:
           The <u>rtsp</u> URL specification can be found in section 3.2 of RFC 2326.  "URI" objects belonging to
           the rtsp scheme support the common, generic, and server methods, with the exception of userinfo
           and query-related sub-components.

       <b>rtspu</b>:
           The <u>rtspu</u> URI scheme is used to talk to RTSP servers over UDP instead of TCP.  The syntax is the
           same as rtsp.

       <b>rsync</b>:
           Information about rsync is available from <a href="http://rsync.samba.org">http://rsync.samba.org</a>  "URI" objects belonging to the
           rsync scheme support the common, generic and server methods.  In addition, they provide methods
           to access the userinfo sub-components: $uri-&gt;user and $uri-&gt;password.

       <b>sip</b>:
           The <u>sip</u> URI specification is described in sections 19.1 and 25 of RFC 3261.  "URI" objects
           belonging to the sip scheme support the common, generic, and server methods with the exception of
           path related sub-components.  In addition, they provide two methods to get and set <u>sip</u>
           parameters: $uri-&gt;params_form and $uri-&gt;params.

       <b>sips</b>:
           See <u>sip</u> scheme.  Its syntax is the same as sip, but the default port is different.

       <b>snews</b>:
           See <u>news</u> scheme.  Its syntax is the same as news, but the default port is different.

       <b>telnet</b>:
           An old specification of the <u>telnet</u> URI scheme is found in RFC 1738. "URI" objects belonging to
           the telnet scheme support the common, generic and server methods.

       <b>tn3270</b>:
           These URIs are used like <u>telnet</u> URIs but for connections to IBM mainframes.  "URI" objects
           belonging to the tn3270 scheme support the common, generic and server methods.

       <b>ssh</b>:
           Information about ssh is available at <a href="http://www.openssh.com/">http://www.openssh.com/</a>  "URI" objects belonging to the
           ssh scheme support the common, generic and server methods. In addition, they provide methods to
           access the userinfo sub-components: $uri-&gt;user and $uri-&gt;password.

       <b>urn</b>:
           The syntax of Uniform Resource Names is specified in RFC 2141.  "URI" objects belonging to the
           urn scheme provide the common methods, and also the methods $uri-&gt;nid and $uri-&gt;nss, which return
           the Namespace Identifier and the Namespace-Specific String respectively.

           The Namespace Identifier basically works like the Scheme identifier of URIs, and further divides
           the URN namespace.  Namespace Identifier assignments are maintained at
           &lt;<a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces">http://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces</a>.

           Letter case is not significant for the Namespace Identifier.  It is always returned in lower case
           by the $uri-&gt;nid method.  The $uri-&gt;_nid method can be used if you want it in its original case.

       <b>urn</b>:<b>isbn</b>:
           The "urn:isbn:" namespace contains International Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs) and is described
           in RFC 3187.  A "URI" object belonging to this namespace has the following extra methods (if the
           Business::ISBN module is available): $uri-&gt;isbn, $uri-&gt;isbn_publisher_code,
           $uri-&gt;isbn_country_code, $uri-&gt;isbn_as_ean.

       <b>urn</b>:<b>oid</b>:
           The "urn:oid:" namespace contains Object Identifiers (OIDs) and is described in RFC 3061.  An
           object identifier consists of sequences of digits separated by dots.  A "URI" object belonging to
           this namespace has an additional method called $uri-&gt;oid that can be used to get/set the oid
           value.  In a list context, oid numbers are returned as separate elements.

<b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>VARIABLES</b>
       The following configuration variables influence how the class and its methods behave:

       $URI::ABS_ALLOW_RELATIVE_SCHEME
           Some older parsers used to allow the scheme name to be present in the relative URL if it was the
           same as the base URL scheme.  RFC 2396 says that this should be avoided, but you can enable this
           old behaviour by setting the $URI::ABS_ALLOW_RELATIVE_SCHEME variable to a TRUE value.  The
           difference is demonstrated by the following examples:

             URI-&gt;new("http:foo")-&gt;abs("<a href="http://host/a/b">http://host/a/b</a>")
                 ==&gt;  "http:foo"

             local $URI::ABS_ALLOW_RELATIVE_SCHEME = 1;
             URI-&gt;new("http:foo")-&gt;abs("<a href="http://host/a/b">http://host/a/b</a>")
                 ==&gt;  "http:/host/a/foo"

       $URI::ABS_REMOTE_LEADING_DOTS
           You can also have the <u>abs()</u> method ignore excess ".."  segments in the relative URI by setting
           $URI::ABS_REMOTE_LEADING_DOTS to a TRUE value.  The difference is demonstrated by the following
           examples:

             URI-&gt;new("../../../foo")-&gt;abs("<a href="http://host/a/b">http://host/a/b</a>")
                 ==&gt; "<a href="http://host/../../foo">http://host/../../foo</a>"

             local $URI::ABS_REMOTE_LEADING_DOTS = 1;
             URI-&gt;new("../../../foo")-&gt;abs("<a href="http://host/a/b">http://host/a/b</a>")
                 ==&gt; "<a href="http://host/foo">http://host/foo</a>"

<b>BUGS</b>
       Using regexp variables like $1 directly as arguments to the URI methods does not work too well with
       current perl implementations.  I would argue that this is actually a bug in perl.  The workaround is
       to quote them. Example:

          /(...)/ || die;
          $u-&gt;query("$1");

<b>PARSING</b> <b>URIs</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>REGEXP</b>
       As an alternative to this module, the following (official) regular expression can be used to decode a
       URI:

         my($scheme, $authority, $path, $query, $fragment) =
         $uri =~ m|(?:([^:/?#]+):)?(?://([^/?#]*))?([^?#]*)(?:\?([^#]*))?(?:#(.*))?|;

       The "URI::Split" module provides the function <u>uri</u><b>_</b><u>split()</u> as a readable alternative.

       This module is based on the "URI::URL" module, which in turn was (distantly) based on the "wwwurl.pl"
       code in the libwww-perl for perl4 developed by Roy Fielding, as part of the Arcadia project at the
       University of California, Irvine, with contributions from Brooks Cutter.

       "URI::URL" was developed by Gisle Aas, Tim Bunce, Roy Fielding and Martijn Koster with input from
       other people on the libwww-perl mailing list.

       "URI" and related subclasses was developed by Gisle Aas.
