<LI>If you are using the OpenBase Lite adaptor, exit Interface Builder before you launch your application, otherwise your application will exit immediately. The OpenBase Lite adaptor forbids you to have more than one database connection open at a time, and Interface Builder opens a connection to the database and keeps it open as long as it is running. The other database adaptors do not have this limitation.</P></UL>

Enterprise Objects Framework provides additional action methods that you can use in connections: <B>fetch</B>
 (EODisplayGroup) and <B>refetch</B>
 (EOEditingContext). Try adding controls (such as buttons or menu items) to the application and connecting them to some of these action methods.</P>

Until now you have still not written a single line of code. However, because of the built-in features of Enterprise Objects Framework, all of the following have been provided for you:</P>

As described in the section<A HREF="CSJ_Tutorial.11.html#11704" CLASS="XRef">
Assigning Primary Keys</A>
, every row in a database is uniquely identified by its primary key value. When you create a new object in your application and save it to the database, you're adding a new row to a database table, and this row needs a primary key (that is, it needs to have a unique value for the primary key attribute you set in EOModeler). Enterprise Objects Framework handles generating this unique value for you.</P>

Enterprise Objects Framework keeps all parts of an application synchronized with the current view of the data. For example, if you have two windows in an application that are displaying the same data and you change the values in one window, the other will automatically be updated to reflect the changes.
