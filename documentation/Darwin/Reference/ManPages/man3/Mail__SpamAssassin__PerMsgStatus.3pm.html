Mail::SpamAssassin::PerMsgStatus(3)  User Contributed Perl Documentation Mail::SpamAssassin::PerMsgStatus(3)



<b>NAME</b>
       Mail::SpamAssassin::PerMsgStatus - per-message status (spam or not-spam)

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
         my $spamtest = new Mail::SpamAssassin ({
           'rules_filename'      =&gt; '/etc/spamassassin.rules',
           'userprefs_filename'  =&gt; $ENV{HOME}.'/.spamassassin/user_prefs'
         });
         my $mail = $spamtest-&gt;parse();

         my $status = $spamtest-&gt;check ($mail);

         my $rewritten_mail;
         if ($status-&gt;is_spam()) {
           $rewritten_mail = $status-&gt;rewrite_mail ();
         }
         ...

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The Mail::SpamAssassin "check()" method returns an object of this class.  This object encapsulates
       all the per-message state.

<b>METHODS</b>
       $status-&gt;check ()
           Runs the SpamAssassin rules against the message pointed to by the object.

       $status-&gt;<u>learn()</u>
           After a mail message has been checked, this method can be called.  If the score is outside a
           certain range around the threshold, ie. if the message is judged more-or-less definitely spam or
           definitely non-spam, it will be fed into SpamAssassin's learning systems (currently the naive
           Bayesian classifier), so that future similar mails will be caught.

       $score = $status-&gt;<u>get</u><b>_</b><u>autolearn</u><b>_</b><u>points()</u>
           Return the message's score as computed for auto-learning.  Certain tests are ignored:

             - rules with tflags set to 'learn' (the Bayesian rules)

             - rules with tflags set to 'userconf' (user white/black-listing rules, etc)

             - rules with tflags set to 'noautolearn'

           Also note that auto-learning occurs using scores from either scoreset 0 or 1, depending on what
           scoreset is used during message check.  It is likely that the message check and auto-learn scores
           will be different.

       $score = $status-&gt;<u>get</u><b>_</b><u>head</u><b>_</b><u>only</u><b>_</b><u>points()</u>
           Return the message's score as computed for auto-learning, ignoring all rules except for header-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">based&nbsp;headerbased</font>
           based ones.

       $score = $status-&gt;<u>get</u><b>_</b><u>learned</u><b>_</b><u>points()</u>
           Return the message's score as computed for auto-learning, ignoring all rules except for learning-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">based&nbsp;learningbased</font>
           based ones.

       $score = $status-&gt;<u>get</u><b>_</b><u>body</u><b>_</b><u>only</u><b>_</b><u>points()</u>
           Return the message's score as computed for auto-learning, ignoring all rules except for body-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">based&nbsp;bodybased</font>
           based ones.

       $isspam = $status-&gt;is_spam ()
           After a mail message has been checked, this method can be called.  It will return 1 for mail
           determined likely to be spam, 0 if it does not seem spam-like.

       $list = $status-&gt;get_names_of_tests_hit ()
           After a mail message has been checked, this method can be called. It will return a comma-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">separated&nbsp;commaseparated</font>
           separated string, listing all the symbolic test names of the tests which were trigged by the
           mail.

       $list = $status-&gt;get_names_of_subtests_hit ()
           After a mail message has been checked, this method can be called.  It will return a comma-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">separated&nbsp;commaseparated</font>
           separated string, listing all the symbolic test names of the meta-rule sub-tests which were
           trigged by the mail.  Sub-tests are the normally-hidden rules, which score 0 and have names
           beginning with two underscores, used in meta rules.

       $num = $status-&gt;get_score ()
           After a mail message has been checked, this method can be called.  It will return the message's
           score.

       $num = $status-&gt;get_required_score ()
           After a mail message has been checked, this method can be called.  It will return the score
           required for a mail to be considered spam.

       $num = $status-&gt;get_autolearn_status ()
           After a mail message has been checked, this method can be called.  It will return one of the
           following strings depending on whether the mail was auto-learned or not: "ham", "no", "spam",
           "disabled", "failed", "unavailable".

       $report = $status-&gt;get_report ()
           Deliver a "spam report" on the checked mail message.  This contains details of how many spam
           detection rules it triggered.

           The report is returned as a multi-line string, with the lines separated by "\n" characters.

       $preview = $status-&gt;get_content_preview ()
           Give a "preview" of the content.

           This is returned as a multi-line string, with the lines separated by "\n" characters, containing
           a fully-decoded, safe, plain-text sample of the first few lines of the message body.

       $msg = $status-&gt;<u>get</u><b>_</b><u>message()</u>
           Return the object representing the message being scanned.

       $status-&gt;rewrite_mail ()
           Rewrite the mail message.  This will at minimum add headers, and at maximum MIME-encapsulate the
           message text, to reflect its spam or not-spam status.  The function will return a scalar of the
           rewritten message.

           The actual modifications depend on the configuration (see "Mail::SpamAssassin::Conf" for more
           information).

           The possible modifications are as follows:

           To:, From: and Subject: modification on spam mails
               Depending on the configuration, the To: and From: lines can have a user-defined RFC 2822
               comment appended for spam mail. The subject line may have a user-defined string prepended to
               it for spam mail.

           X-Spam-* headers for all mails
               Depending on the configuration, zero or more headers with names beginning with "X-Spam-" will
               be added to mail depending on whether it is spam or ham.

           spam message with report_safe
               If report_safe is set to true (1), then spam messages are encapsulated into their own
               message/rfc822 MIME attachment without any modifications being made.

               If report_safe is set to false (0), then the message will only have the above headers
               added/modified.

       $status-&gt;set_tag($tagname, $value)
           Set a template tag, as used in "add_header", report templates, etc. This API is intended for use
           by plugins.   Tag names will be converted to an all-uppercase representation internally.

           $value can be a subroutine reference, which will be evaluated each time the template is expanded.
           Note that perl supports closures, which means that variables set in the caller's scope can be
           accessed inside this "sub".  For example:

               my $text = "hello world!";
               $status-&gt;set_tag("FOO", sub {
                         return $text;
                       });

           See "Mail::SpamAssassin::Conf"'s "TEMPLATE TAGS" section for more details on how template tags
           are used.

           "undef" will be returned if a tag by that name has not been defined.

       $string = $status-&gt;get_tag($tagname)
           Get the current value of a template tag, as used in "add_header", report templates, etc. This API
           is intended for use by plugins.  Tag names will be converted to an all-uppercase representation
           internally.  See "Mail::SpamAssassin::Conf"'s "TEMPLATE TAGS" section for more details on tags.

           "undef" will be returned if a tag by that name has not been defined.

       $status-&gt;set_spamd_result_item($subref)
           Set an entry for the spamd result log line.  $subref should be a code reference for a subroutine
           which will return a string in 'name=VALUE' format, similar to the other entries in the spamd
           result line:

             Jul 17 14:10:47 radish spamd[16670]: spamd: result: Y 22 - ALL_NATURAL,
             DATE_IN_FUTURE_03_06,DIET_1,DRUGS_ERECTILE,DRUGS_PAIN,
             TEST_FORGED_YAHOO_RCVD,TEST_INVALID_DATE,TEST_NOREALNAME,
             TEST_NORMAL_HTTP_TO_IP,UNDISC_RECIPS scantime=0.4,size=3138,user=jm,
             uid=1000,required_score=5.0,rhost=localhost,raddr=127.0.0.1,
             rport=33153,mid=&lt;9PS291LhupY&gt;,autolearn=spam

           "name" and "VALUE" must not contain "=" or "," characters, as it is important that these log
           lines are easy to parse.

           The code reference will be called by spamd after the message has been scanned, and the
           "PerMsgStatus::check()" method has returned.

       $status-&gt;finish ()
           Indicate that this $status object is finished with, and can be destroyed.

           If you are using SpamAssassin in a persistent environment, or checking many mail messages from
           one "Mail::SpamAssassin" factory, this method should be called to ensure Perl's garbage
           collection will clean up old status objects.

       $name = $status-&gt;<u>get</u><b>_</b><u>current</u><b>_</b><u>eval</u><b>_</b><u>rule</u><b>_</b><u>name()</u>
           Return the name of the currently-running eval rule.  "undef" is returned if no eval rule is
           currently being run.  Useful for plugins to determine the current rule name while inside an eval
           test function call.

       $status-&gt;get_decoded_body_text_array ()
           Returns the message body, with <b>base64</b> or <b>quoted-printable</b> encodings decoded, and non-text parts
           or non-inline attachments stripped.

           It is returned as an array of strings, with each string representing one newline-separated line
           of the body.

       $status-&gt;get_decoded_stripped_body_text_array ()
           Returns the message body, decoded (as described in <u>get</u><b>_</b><u>decoded</u><b>_</b><u>body</u><b>_</b><u>text</u><b>_</b><u>array()</u>), with HTML
           rendered, and with whitespace normalized.

           It will always render text/html, and will use a heuristic to determine if other text/* parts
           should be considered text/html.

           It is returned as an array of strings, with each string representing one 'paragraph'.
           Paragraphs, in plain-text mails, are double-newline-separated blocks of multi-line text.

       $status-&gt;get (header_name [, default_value])
           Returns a message header, pseudo-header, real name or address.  "header_name" is the name of a
           mail header, such as 'Subject', 'To', etc.  If "default_value" is given, it will be used if the
           requested "header_name" does not exist.

           Appending ":raw" to the header name will inhibit decoding of quoted-printable or base-64 encoded
           strings.

           Appending ":addr" to the header name will cause everything except the first email address to be
           removed from the header.  For example, all of the following will result in "example@foo":

           example@foo
           example@foo (Foo Blah)
           example@foo, example@bar
           display: example@foo (Foo Blah), example@bar ;
           Foo Blah &lt;example@foo&gt;
           "Foo Blah" &lt;example@foo&gt;
           "'Foo Blah'" &lt;example@foo&gt;

           Appending ":name" to the header name will cause everything except the first real name to be
           removed from the header.  For example, all of the following will result in "Foo Blah"

           example@foo (Foo Blah)
           example@foo (Foo Blah), example@bar
           display: example@foo (Foo Blah), example@bar ;
           Foo Blah &lt;example@foo&gt;
           "Foo Blah" &lt;example@foo&gt;
           "'Foo Blah'" &lt;example@foo&gt;

           There are several special pseudo-headers that can be specified:

           "ALL" can be used to mean the text of all the message's headers.
           "ALL-TRUSTED" can be used to mean the text of all the message's headers that could only have been
           added by trusted relays.
           "ALL-INTERNAL" can be used to mean the text of all the message's headers that could only have
           been added by internal relays.
           "ALL-UNTRUSTED" can be used to mean the text of all the message's headers that may have been
           added by untrusted relays.  To make this pseudo-header more useful for header rules the
           'Received' header that was added by the last trusted relay is included, even though it can be
           trusted.
           "ALL-EXTERNAL" can be used to mean the text of all the message's headers that may have been added
           by external relays.  Like "ALL-UNTRUSTED" the 'Received' header added by the last internal relay
           is included.
           "ToCc" can be used to mean the contents of both the 'To' and 'Cc' headers.
           "EnvelopeFrom" is the address used in the 'MAIL FROM:' phase of the SMTP transaction that
           delivered this message, if this data has been made available by the SMTP server.
           "MESSAGEID" is a symbol meaning all Message-Id's found in the message; some mailing list software
           moves the real 'Message-Id' to 'Resent-Message-Id' or 'X-Message-Id', then uses its own one in
           the 'Message-Id' header.  The value returned for this symbol is the text from all 3 headers,
           separated by newlines.
           "X-Spam-Relays-Untrusted" is the generated metadata of untrusted relays the message has passed
           through
           "X-Spam-Relays-Trusted" is the generated metadata of trusted relays the message has passed
           through
       $status-&gt;get_uri_list ()
           Returns an array of all unique URIs found in the message.  It takes a combination of the URIs
           found in the rendered (decoded and HTML stripped) body and the URIs found when parsing the HTML
           in the message.  Will also set $status-&gt;{uri_list} (the array as returned by this function).

           The returned array will include the "raw" URI as well as "slightly cooked" versions.  For
           example, the single URI '<a href="http://%77&amp;#00119;%77.example.com/">http://%77&amp;#00119;%77.example.com/</a>' will get turned into: (
           '<a href="http://%77&amp;#00119;%77.example.com/">http://%77&amp;#00119;%77.example.com/</a>', '<a href="http://www.example.com/">http://www.example.com/</a>' )

       $status-&gt;get_uri_detail_list ()
           Returns a hash reference of all unique URIs found in the message and various data about where the
           URIs were found in the message.  It takes a combination of the URIs found in the rendered
           (decoded and HTML stripped) body and the URIs found when parsing the HTML in the message.  Will
           also set $status-&gt;{uri_detail_list} (the hash reference as returned by this function).  This
           function will also set $status-&gt;{uri_domain_count} (count of unique domains).

           The hash format looks something like this:

             raw_uri =&gt; {
               types =&gt; { a =&gt; 1, img =&gt; 1, parsed =&gt; 1 },
               cleaned =&gt; [ canonified_uri ],
               anchor_text =&gt; [ "click here", "no click here" ],
               domains =&gt; { domain1 =&gt; 1, domain2 =&gt; 1 },
             }

           "raw_uri" is whatever the URI was in the message itself (<a href="http://spamassassin.apache%2Eorg/)">http://spamassassin.apache%2Eorg/)</a>

           "types" is a hash of the HTML tags (lowercase) which referenced the raw_uri.  <u>parsed</u> is a faked
           type which specifies that the raw_uri was seen in the rendered text.

           "cleaned" is an array of the raw and canonified version of the raw_uri
           (<a href="http://spamassassin.apache%2Eorg/">http://spamassassin.apache%2Eorg/</a> <a href="http://spamassassin.apache.org/)">http://spamassassin.apache.org/)</a>

           "anchor_text" is an array of the anchor text (text between &lt;a&gt; and &lt;/a&gt;), if any, which linked to
           the URI.

           "domains" is a hash of the domains found in the canonified URIs.

       $status-&gt;<u>clear</u><b>_</b><u>test</u><b>_</b><u>state()</u>
           Clear test state, including test log messages from "$status-&gt;test_log()".

       $status-&gt;got_hit ($rulename, $desc_prepend [, name =&gt; value, ...])
           Register a hit against a rule in the ruleset.

           There are two mandatory arguments. These are $rulename, the name of the rule that fired, and
           $desc_prepend, which is a short string that will be prepended to the rules "describe" string in
           output reports.

           In addition, callers can supplement that with the following optional data:

           score =&gt; $num
               Optional: the score to use for the rule hit.  If unspecified, the value from the
               "Mail::SpamAssassin::Conf" object's "{scores}" hash will be used.

           value =&gt; $num
               Optional: the value to assign to the rule; the default value is 1.  <u>tflags</u> <u>multiple</u> rules use
               values of greater than 1 to indicate multiple hits.  This value is accessible to meta rules.

           ruletype =&gt; $type
               Optional, but recommended: the rule type string.  This is used in the "hit_rule" plugin call,
               called by this method.  If unset, <u>'unknown'</u> is used.

           Backwards compatibility: the two mandatory arguments have been part of this API since
           SpamAssassin 2.x.  The optional <u>name=&lt;gt</u>value&gt; pairs, however, are a new addition in SpamAssassin
           3.2.0.

       $status-&gt;create_fulltext_tmpfile (fulltext_ref)
           This function creates a temporary file containing the passed scalar reference data (typically the
           full/pristine text of the message).  This is typically used by external programs like pyzor and
           dccproc, to avoid hangs due to buffering issues.   Methods that need this, should call
           $self-&gt;create_fulltext_tmpfile($fulltext) to retrieve the temporary filename; it will be created
           if it has not already been.

           Note: This can only be called once until $status-&gt;<u>delete</u><b>_</b><u>fulltext</u><b>_</b><u>tmpfile()</u> is called.

       $status-&gt;delete_fulltext_tmpfile ()
           Will cleanup after a $status-&gt;<u>create</u><b>_</b><u>fulltext</u><b>_</b><u>tmpfile()</u> call.  Deletes the temporary file and
           uncaches the filename.
