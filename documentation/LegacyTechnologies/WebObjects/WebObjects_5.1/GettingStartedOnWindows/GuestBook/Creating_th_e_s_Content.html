In additionto the standard static HTML elements found in all web pages, WebObjectsallows you to create <em>dynamic elements</em>, whoselook and behavior are determined at runtime.</font></p><p><font face="Times">To create elements, you use the toolbar buttons. There arethree groups of buttons:</font></p><ul><p><li>Structures <img src = "../Art/structurestoolbar.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/structurestoolbar.gif]"><code>.</code> Usethese buttons to create paragraphs, lists, images, and other staticHTML elements.</li></p><p><li>Dynamic form elements <img src = "../Art/formtoolbar.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/formtoolbar.gif]"> <code>.</code> Usethese buttons to create form elements in which users enter information.WebObjects gives your application access to the data entered byusers by allowing you to associate, or <em>bind</em>,these elements to variables in your application.</li></p><p><li>Other WebObjects <img src = "../Art/otherwotoolbar.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/otherwotoolbar.gif]"><code>.</code> Usethese buttons to create other dynamic elements, that you can bindto variables and methods in your program to control how they aredisplayed. Some of these (such as hyperlinks) have direct HTML equivalents.Others are <em>abstract dynamic elements</em>, suchas repetitions and conditionals, that determine how many times anelement is displayed or whether it is displayed at all.</li></p></ul><a name = "TPXREF104"></a><h3><font face="Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande">EnteringStatic Text</font></h3><p><font face="Times">The simplest way to add text to a page is to type it directlyinto the component's window. To demonstrate this, add a titlefor the GuestBook's page.</font></p><ol><p><li>Type My GuestBook and press Shift-Enter (on the keyboard).<p>The text is displayedat the insertion point, in this case at the beginning of the page.</p></li></p><p><li>Select the text you just typed. </li></p><p><li>Click the <img src = "../Art/heading.gif" alt = "[image: ../Art/heading.gif]"> buttonin the toolbar.
