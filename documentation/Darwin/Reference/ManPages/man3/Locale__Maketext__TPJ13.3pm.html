<b>Localization</b> <b>and</b> <b>Perl:</b> <b>gettext</b> <b>breaks,</b> <b>Maketext</b> <b>fixes</b>
       by Sean M. Burke and Jordan Lachler

       This article points out cases where gettext (a common system for localizing software interfaces --<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">i.e.,&nbsp;-i.e.,</font>
       i.e., making them work in the user's language of choice) fails because of basic differences between
       human languages.  This article then describes Maketext, a new system capable of correctly treating
       these differences.

       <b>A</b> <b>Localization</b> <b>Horror</b> <b>Story:</b> <b>It</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Happen</b> <b>To</b> <b>You</b>

           "There are a number of languages spoken by human beings in this world."

           -- Harald Tveit Alvestrand, in RFC 1766, "Tags for the Identification of Languages"

       Imagine that your task for the day is to localize a piece of software -- and luckily for you, the
       only output the program emits is two messages, like this:

         I scanned 12 directories.

         Your query matched 10 files in 4 directories.

       So how hard could that be?  You look at the code that produces the first item, and it reads:

         printf("I scanned %g directories.",
                $directory_count);

       You think about that, and realize that it doesn't even work right for English, as it can produce this
       output:

         I scanned 1 directories.

       So you rewrite it to read:

         printf("I scanned %g %s.",
                $directory_count,
                $directory_count == 1 ?
                  "directory" : "directories",
         );

       ...which does the Right Thing.  (In case you don't recall, "%g" is for locale-specific number inter-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">polation,&nbsp;interpolation,</font>
       polation, and "%s" is for string interpolation.)

       But you still have to localize it for all the languages you're producing this software for, so you
       pull Locale::gettext off of CPAN so you can access the "gettext" C functions you've heard are stan-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dard&nbsp;standard</font>
       dard for localization tasks.

       And you write:

         printf(gettext("I scanned %g %s."),
                $dir_scan_count,
                $dir_scan_count == 1 ?
                  gettext("directory") : gettext("directories"),
         );

       But you then read in the gettext manual (Drepper, Miller, and Pinard 1995) that this is not a good
       idea, since how a single word like "directory" or "directories" is translated may depend on context
       -- and this is true, since in a case language like German or Russian, you'd may need these words with
       a different case ending in the first instance (where the word is the object of a verb) than in the
       second instance, which you haven't even gotten to yet (where the word is the object of a preposition,
       "in %g directories") -- assuming these keep the same syntax when translated into those languages.

       So, on the advice of the gettext manual, you rewrite:

         printf( $dir_scan_count == 1 ?
                  gettext("I scanned %g directory.") :
                  gettext("I scanned %g directories."),
                $dir_scan_count );

       So, you email your various translators (the boss decides that the languages du jour are Chinese, Ara-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">bic,&nbsp;Arabic,</font>
       bic, Russian, and Italian, so you have one translator for each), asking for translations for "I
       scanned %g directory." and "I scanned %g directories.".  When they reply, you'll put that in the lex-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">icons&nbsp;lexicons</font>
       icons for gettext to use when it localizes your software, so that when the user is running under the
       "zh" (Chinese) locale, gettext("I scanned %g directory.") will return the appropriate Chinese text,
       with a "%g" in there where printf can then interpolate $dir_scan.

       Your Chinese translator emails right back -- he says both of these phrases translate to the same
       thing in Chinese, because, in linguistic jargon, Chinese "doesn't have number as a grammatical cate-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">gory"&nbsp;category"</font>
       gory" -- whereas English does.  That is, English has grammatical rules that refer to "number", i.e.,
       whether something is grammatically singular or plural; and one of these rules is the one that forces
       nouns to take a plural suffix (generally "s") when in a plural context, as they are when they follow
       a number other than "one" (including, oddly enough, "zero").  Chinese has no such rules, and so has
       just the one phrase where English has two.  But, no problem, you can have this one Chinese phrase
       appear as the translation for the two English phrases in the "zh" gettext lexicon for your program.

       Emboldened by this, you dive into the second phrase that your software needs to output: "Your query
       matched 10 files in 4 directories.".  You notice that if you want to treat phrases as indivisible, as
       the gettext manual wisely advises, you need four cases now, instead of two, to cover the permutations
       of singular and plural on the two items, $dir_count and $file_count.  So you try this:

         printf( $file_count == 1 ?
           ( $directory_count == 1 ?
            gettext("Your query matched %g file in %g directory.") :
            gettext("Your query matched %g file in %g directories.") ) :
           ( $directory_count == 1 ?
            gettext("Your query matched %g files in %g directory.") :
            gettext("Your query matched %g files in %g directories.") ),
          $file_count, $directory_count,
         );

       (The case of "1 file in 2 [or more] directories" could, I suppose, occur in the case of symlinking or
       something of the sort.)

       It occurs to you that this is not the prettiest code you've ever written, but this seems the way to
       go.  You mail off to the translators asking for translations for these four cases.  The Chinese guy
       replies with the one phrase that these all translate to in Chinese, and that phrase has two "%g"s in
       it, as it should -- but there's a problem.  He translates it word-for-word back: "In %g directories
       contains %g files match your query."  The %g slots are in an order reverse to what they are in
       English.  You wonder how you'll get gettext to handle that.

       But you put it aside for the moment, and optimistically hope that the other translators won't have
       this problem, and that their languages will be better behaved -- i.e., that they will be just like
       English.

       But the Arabic translator is the next to write back.  First off, your code for "I scanned %g direc-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tory."&nbsp;directory."</font>
       tory." or "I scanned %g directories."  assumes there's only singular or plural.  But, to use linguis-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tic&nbsp;linguistic</font>
       tic jargon again, Arabic has grammatical number, like English (but unlike Chinese), but it's a three-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">term&nbsp;threeterm</font>
       term category: singular, dual, and plural.  In other words, the way you say "directory" depends on
       whether there's one directory, or <u>two</u> of them, or <u>more</u> <u>than</u> <u>two</u> of them.  Your test of "($directory
       == 1)" no longer does the job.  And it means that where English's grammatical category of number
       necessitates only the two permutations of the first sentence based on "directory [singular]" and
       "directories [plural]", Arabic has three -- and, worse, in the second sentence ("Your query matched
       %g file in %g directory."), where English has four, Arabic has nine.  You sense an unwelcome, expo-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nential&nbsp;exponential</font>
       nential trend taking shape.

       Your Italian translator emails you back and says that "I searched 0 directories" (a possible English
       output of your program) is stilted, and if you think that's fine English, that's your problem, but
       that <u>just</u> <u>will</u> <u>not</u> <u>do</u> in the language of Dante.  He insists that where $directory_count is 0, your
       program should produce the Italian text for "I <u>didn't</u> scan <u>any</u> directories.".  And ditto for "I
       didn't match any files in any directories", although he says the last part about "in any directories"
       should probably just be left off.

       You wonder how you'll get gettext to handle this; to accomodate the ways Arabic, Chinese, and Italian
       deal with numbers in just these few very simple phrases, you need to write code that will ask gettext
       for different queries depending on whether the numerical values in question are 1, 2, more than 2, or
       in some cases 0, and you still haven't figured out the problem with the different word order in Chi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">nese.&nbsp;Chinese.</font>
       nese.

       Then your Russian translator calls on the phone, to <u>personally</u> tell you the bad news about how really
       unpleasant your life is about to become:

       Russian, like German or Latin, is an inflectional language; that is, nouns and adjectives have to
       take endings that depend on their case (i.e., nominative, accusative, genitive, etc...) -- which is
       roughly a matter of what role they have in syntax of the sentence -- as well as on the grammatical
       gender (i.e., masculine, feminine, neuter) and number (i.e., singular or plural) of the noun, as well
       as on the declension class of the noun.  But unlike with most other inflected languages, putting a
       number-phrase (like "ten" or "forty-three", or their Arabic numeral equivalents) in front of noun in
       Russian can change the case and number that noun is, and therefore the endings you have to put on it.

       He elaborates:  In "I scanned %g directories", you'd <u>expect</u> "directories" to be in the accusative
       case (since it is the direct object in the sentnce) and the plural number, except where $direc-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tory_count&nbsp;$directory_count</font>
       tory_count is 1, then you'd expect the singular, of course.  Just like Latin or German.  <u>But!</u>  Where
       $directory_count % 10 is 1 ("%" for modulo, remember), assuming $directory count is an integer, and
       except where $directory_count % 100 is 11, "directories" is forced to become grammatically singular,
       which means it gets the ending for the accusative singular...  You begin to visualize the code it'd
       take to test for the problem so far, <u>and</u> <u>still</u> <u>work</u> <u>for</u> <u>Chinese</u> <u>and</u> <u>Arabic</u> <u>and</u> <u>Italian</u>, and how many
       gettext items that'd take, but he keeps going...  But where $directory_count % 10 is 2, 3, or 4
       (except where $directory_count % 100 is 12, 13, or 14), the word for "directories" is forced to be
       genitive singular -- which means another ending... The room begins to spin around you, slowly at
       first...  But with <u>all</u> <u>other</u> integer values, since "directory" is an inanimate noun, when preceded by
       a number and in the nominative or accusative cases (as it is here, just your luck!), it does stay
       plural, but it is forced into the genitive case -- yet another ending...  And you never hear him get
       to the part about how you're going to run into similar (but maybe subtly different) problems with
       other Slavic languages like Polish, because the floor comes up to meet you, and you fade into uncon-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sciousness.&nbsp;unconsciousness.</font>
       sciousness.

       The above cautionary tale relates how an attempt at localization can lead from programmer consterna-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion,&nbsp;consternation,</font>
       tion, to program obfuscation, to a need for sedation.  But careful evaluation shows that your choice
       of tools merely needed further consideration.

       <b>The</b> <b>Linguistic</b> <b>View</b>

           "It is more complicated than you think."

           -- The Eighth Networking Truth, from RFC 1925

       The field of Linguistics has expended a great deal of effort over the past century trying to find
       grammatical patterns which hold across languages; it's been a constant process of people making gen-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">eralizations&nbsp;generalizations</font>
       eralizations that should apply to all languages, only to find out that, all too often, these general-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">izations&nbsp;generalizations</font>
       izations fail -- sometimes failing for just a few languages, sometimes whole classes of languages,
       and sometimes nearly every language in the world except English.  Broad statistical trends are evi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dent&nbsp;evident</font>
       dent in what the "average language" is like as far as what its rules can look like, must look like,
       and cannot look like.  But the "average language" is just as unreal a concept as the "average person"
       -- it runs up against the fact no language (or person) is, in fact, average.  The wisdom of past
       experience leads us to believe that any given language can do whatever it wants, in any order, with
       appeal to any kind of grammatical categories wants -- case, number, tense, real or metaphoric charac-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">teristics&nbsp;characteristics</font>
       teristics of the things that words refer to, arbitrary or predictable classifications of words based
       on what endings or prefixes they can take, degree or means of certainty about the truth of statements
       expressed, and so on, ad infinitum.

       Mercifully, most localization tasks are a matter of finding ways to translate whole phrases, gener-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ally&nbsp;generally</font>
       ally sentences, where the context is relatively set, and where the only variation in content is <u>usu</u>-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ally&nbsp;usually</font>
       <u>ally</u> in a number being expressed -- as in the example sentences above.  Translating specific, fully-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">formed&nbsp;fullyformed</font>
       formed sentences is, in practice, fairly foolproof -- which is good, because that's what's in the
       phrasebooks that so many tourists rely on.  Now, a given phrase (whether in a phrasebook or in a get-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">text&nbsp;gettext</font>
       text lexicon) in one language <u>might</u> have a greater or lesser applicability than that phrase's trans-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">lation&nbsp;translation</font>
       lation into another language -- for example, strictly speaking, in Arabic, the "your" in "Your query
       matched..." would take a different form depending on whether the user is male or female; so the Ara-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">bic&nbsp;Arabic</font>
       bic translation "your[feminine] query" is applicable in fewer cases than the corresponding English
       phrase, which doesn't distinguish the user's gender.  (In practice, it's not feasable to have a pro-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">gram&nbsp;program</font>
       gram know the user's gender, so the masculine "you" in Arabic is usually used, by default.)

       But in general, such surprises are rare when entire sentences are being translated, especially when
       the functional context is restricted to that of a computer interacting with a user either to convey a
       fact or to prompt for a piece of information.  So, for purposes of localization, translation by
       phrase (generally by sentence) is both the simplest and the least problematic.

       <b>Breaking</b> <b>gettext</b>

           "It Has To Work."

           -- First Networking Truth, RFC 1925

       Consider that sentences in a tourist phrasebook are of two types: ones like "How do I get to the mar-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ketplace?"&nbsp;marketplace?"</font>
       ketplace?" that don't have any blanks to fill in, and ones like "How much do these ___ cost?", where
       there's one or more blanks to fill in (and these are usually linked to a list of words that you can
       put in that blank: "fish", "potatoes", "tomatoes", etc.)  The ones with no blanks are no problem, but
       the fill-in-the-blank ones may not be really straightforward. If it's a Swahili phrasebook, for exam-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ple,&nbsp;example,</font>
       ple, the authors probably didn't bother to tell you the complicated ways that the verb "cost" changes
       its inflectional prefix depending on the noun you're putting in the blank.  The trader in the market-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">place&nbsp;marketplace</font>
       place will still understand what you're saying if you say "how much do these potatoes cost?" with the
       wrong inflectional prefix on "cost".  After all, <u>you</u> can't speak proper Swahili, <u>you're</u> just a
       tourist.  But while tourists can be stupid, computers are supposed to be smart; the computer should
       be able to fill in the blank, and still have the results be grammatical.

       In other words, a phrasebook entry takes some values as parameters (the things that you fill in the
       blank or blanks), and provides a value based on these parameters, where the way you get that final
       value from the given values can, properly speaking, involve an arbitrarily complex series of opera-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tions.&nbsp;operations.</font>
       tions.  (In the case of Chinese, it'd be not at all complex, at least in cases like the examples at
       the beginning of this article; whereas in the case of Russian it'd be a rather complex series of
       operations.  And in some languages, the complexity could be spread around differently: while the act
       of putting a number-expression in front of a noun phrase might not be complex by itself, it may
       change how you have to, for example, inflect a verb elsewhere in the sentence.  This is what in syn-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tax&nbsp;syntax</font>
       tax is called "long-distance dependencies".)

       This talk of parameters and arbitrary complexity is just another way to say that an entry in a
       phrasebook is what in a programming language would be called a "function".  Just so you don't miss
       it, this is the crux of this article: <u>A</u> <u>phrase</u> <u>is</u> <u>a</u> <u>function;</u> <u>a</u> <u>phrasebook</u> <u>is</u> <u>a</u> <u>bunch</u> <u>of</u> <u>functions.</u>

       The reason that using gettext runs into walls (as in the above second-person horror story) is that
       you're trying to use a string (or worse, a choice among a bunch of strings) to do what you really
       need a function for -- which is futile.  Preforming (s)printf interpolation on the strings which you
       get back from gettext does allow you to do <u>some</u> common things passably well... sometimes... sort of;
       but, to paraphrase what some people say about "csh" script programming, "it fools you into thinking
       you can use it for real things, but you can't, and you don't discover this until you've already spent
       too much time trying, and by then it's too late."

       <b>Replacing</b> <b>gettext</b>

       So, what needs to replace gettext is a system that supports lexicons of functions instead of lexicons
       of strings.  An entry in a lexicon from such a system should <u>not</u> look like this:

         "J'ai trouv\xE9 %g fichiers dans %g r\xE9pertoires"

       [\xE9 is e-acute in Latin-1.  Some pod renderers would scream if I used the actual character here. --<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">SB]&nbsp;-SB]</font>
       SB]

       but instead like this, bearing in mind that this is just a first stab:

         sub I_found_X1_files_in_X2_directories {
           my( $files, $dirs ) = @_[0,1];
           $files = sprintf("%g %s", $files,
             $files == 1 ? 'fichier' : 'fichiers');
           $dirs = sprintf("%g %s", $dirs,
             $dirs == 1 ? "r\xE9pertoire" : "r\xE9pertoires");
           return "J'ai trouv\xE9 $files dans $dirs.";
         }

       Now, there's no particularly obvious way to store anything but strings in a gettext lexicon; so it
       looks like we just have to start over and make something better, from scratch.  I call my shot at a
       gettext-replacement system "Maketext", or, in CPAN terms, Locale::Maketext.

       When designing Maketext, I chose to plan its main features in terms of "buzzword compliance".  And
       here are the buzzwords:

       <b>Buzzwords:</b> <b>Abstraction</b> <b>and</b> <b>Encapsulation</b>

       The complexity of the language you're trying to output a phrase in is entirely abstracted inside (and
       encapsulated within) the Maketext module for that interface.  When you call:

         print $lang-&gt;maketext("You have [quant,_1,piece] of new mail.",
                              scalar(@messages));

       you don't know (and in fact can't easily find out) whether this will involve lots of figuring, as in
       Russian (if $lang is a handle to the Russian module), or relatively little, as in Chinese.  That kind
       of abstraction and encapsulation may encourage other pleasant buzzwords like modularization and
       stratification, depending on what design decisions you make.

       <b>Buzzword:</b> <b>Isomorphism</b>

       "Isomorphism" means "having the same structure or form"; in discussions of program design, the word
       takes on the special, specific meaning that your implementation of a solution to a problem <u>has</u> <u>the</u>
       <u>same</u> <u>structure</u> as, say, an informal verbal description of the solution, or maybe of the problem
       itself.  Isomorphism is, all things considered, a good thing -- it's what problem-solving (and solu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tion-implementing)&nbsp;solution-implementing)</font>
       tion-implementing) should look like.

       What's wrong the with gettext-using code like this...

         printf( $file_count == 1 ?
           ( $directory_count == 1 ?
            "Your query matched %g file in %g directory." :
            "Your query matched %g file in %g directories." ) :
           ( $directory_count == 1 ?
            "Your query matched %g files in %g directory." :
            "Your query matched %g files in %g directories." ),
          $file_count, $directory_count,
         );

       is first off that it's not well abstracted -- these ways of testing for grammatical number (as in the
       expressions like "foo == 1 ?  singular_form : plural_form") should be abstracted to each language
       module, since how you get grammatical number is language-specific.

       But second off, it's not isomorphic -- the "solution" (i.e., the phrasebook entries) for Chinese maps
       from these four English phrases to the one Chinese phrase that fits for all of them.  In other words,
       the informal solution would be "The way to say what you want in Chinese is with the one phrase 'For
       your question, in Y directories you would find X files'" -- and so the implemented solution should
       be, isomorphically, just a straightforward way to spit out that one phrase, with numerals properly
       interpolated.  It shouldn't have to map from the complexity of other languages to the simplicity of
       this one.

       <b>Buzzword:</b> <b>Inheritance</b>

       There's a great deal of reuse possible for sharing of phrases between modules for related dialects,
       or for sharing of auxiliary functions between related languages.  (By "auxiliary functions", I mean
       functions that don't produce phrase-text, but which, say, return an answer to "does this number
       require a plural noun after it?".  Such auxiliary functions would be used in the internal logic of
       functions that actually do produce phrase-text.)

       In the case of sharing phrases, consider that you have an interface already localized for American
       English (probably by having been written with that as the native locale, but that's incidental).
       Localizing it for UK English should, in practical terms, be just a matter of running it past a
       British person with the instructions to indicate what few phrases would benefit from a change in
       spelling or possibly minor rewording.  In that case, you should be able to put in the UK English
       localization module <u>only</u> those phrases that are UK-specific, and for all the rest, <u>inherit</u> from the
       American English module.  (And I expect this same situation would apply with Brazilian and Continen-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tal&nbsp;Continental</font>
       tal Portugese, possbily with some <u>very</u> closely related languages like Czech and Slovak, and possibly
       with the slightly different "versions" of written Mandarin Chinese, as I hear exist in Taiwan and
       mainland China.)

       As to sharing of auxiliary functions, consider the problem of Russian numbers from the beginning of
       this article; obviously, you'd want to write only once the hairy code that, given a numeric value,
       would return some specification of which case and number a given quanitified noun should use.  But
       suppose that you discover, while localizing an interface for, say, Ukranian (a Slavic language
       related to Russian, spoken by several million people, many of whom would be relieved to find that
       your Web site's or software's interface is available in their language), that the rules in Ukranian
       are the same as in Russian for quantification, and probably for many other grammatical functions.
       While there may well be no phrases in common between Russian and Ukranian, you could still choose to
       have the Ukranian module inherit from the Russian module, just for the sake of inheriting all the
       various grammatical methods.  Or, probably better organizationally, you could move those functions to
       a module called "_E_Slavic" or something, which Russian and Ukranian could inherit useful functions
       from, but which would (presumably) provide no lexicon.

       <b>Buzzword:</b> <b>Concision</b>

       Okay, concision isn't a buzzword.  But it should be, so I decree that as a new buzzword, "concision"
       means that simple common things should be expressible in very few lines (or maybe even just a few
       characters) of code -- call it a special case of "making simple things easy and hard things possi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ble",&nbsp;possible",</font>
       ble", and see also the role it played in the MIDI::Simple language, discussed elsewhere in this issue
       [TPJ#13].

       Consider our first stab at an entry in our "phrasebook of functions":

         sub I_found_X1_files_in_X2_directories {
           my( $files, $dirs ) = @_[0,1];
           $files = sprintf("%g %s", $files,
             $files == 1 ? 'fichier' : 'fichiers');
           $dirs = sprintf("%g %s", $dirs,
             $dirs == 1 ? "r\xE9pertoire" : "r\xE9pertoires");
           return "J'ai trouv\xE9 $files dans $dirs.";
         }

       You may sense that a lexicon (to use a non-committal catch-all term for a collection of things you
       know how to say, regardless of whether they're phrases or words) consisting of functions <u>expressed</u> as
       above would make for rather long-winded and repetitive code -- even if you wisely rewrote this to
       have quantification (as we call adding a number expression to a noun phrase) be a function called
       like:

         sub I_found_X1_files_in_X2_directories {
           my( $files, $dirs ) = @_[0,1];
           $files = quant($files, "fichier");
           $dirs =  quant($dirs,  "r\xE9pertoire");
           return "J'ai trouv\xE9 $files dans $dirs.";
         }

       And you may also sense that you do not want to bother your translators with having to write Perl code
       -- you'd much rather that they spend their <u>very</u> <u>costly</u> <u>time</u> on just translation.  And this is to say
       nothing of the near impossibility of finding a commercial translator who would know even simple Perl.

       In a first-hack implementation of Maketext, each language-module's lexicon looked like this:

        %Lexicon = (
          "I found %g files in %g directories"
          =&gt; sub {
             my( $files, $dirs ) = @_[0,1];
             $files = quant($files, "fichier");
             $dirs =  quant($dirs,  "r\xE9pertoire");
             return "J'ai trouv\xE9 $files dans $dirs.";
           },
         ... and so on with other phrase =&gt; sub mappings ...
        );

       but I immediately went looking for some more concise way to basically denote the same phrase-function
       -- a way that would also serve to concisely denote <u>most</u> phrase-functions in the lexicon for <u>most</u> lan-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">guages.&nbsp;languages.</font>
       guages.  After much time and even some actual thought, I decided on this system:

       * Where a value in a %Lexicon hash is a contentful string instead of an anonymous sub (or, conceiv-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ably,&nbsp;conceivably,</font>
       ably, a coderef), it would be interpreted as a sort of shorthand expression of what the sub does.
       When accessed for the first time in a session, it is parsed, turned into Perl code, and then eval'd
       into an anonymous sub; then that sub replaces the original string in that lexicon.  (That way, the
       work of parsing and evaling the shorthand form for a given phrase is done no more than once per ses-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sion.)&nbsp;session.)</font>
       sion.)

       * Calls to "maketext" (as Maketext's main function is called) happen thru a "language session han-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">dle",&nbsp;handle",</font>
       dle", notionally very much like an IO handle, in that you open one at the start of the session, and
       use it for "sending signals" to an object in order to have it return the text you want.

       So, this:

         $lang-&gt;maketext("You have [quant,_1,piece] of new mail.",
                        scalar(@messages));

       basically means this: look in the lexicon for $lang (which may inherit from any number of other lexi-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">cons),&nbsp;lexicons),</font>
       cons), and find the function that we happen to associate with the string "You have [quant,_1,piece]
       of new mail" (which is, and should be, a functioning "shorthand" for this function in the native
       locale -- English in this case).  If you find such a function, call it with $lang as its first param-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">eter&nbsp;parameter</font>
       eter (as if it were a method), and then a copy of scalar(@messages) as its second, and then return
       that value.  If that function was found, but was in string shorthand instead of being a fully speci-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">fied&nbsp;specified</font>
       fied function, parse it and make it into a function before calling it the first time.

       * The shorthand uses code in brackets to indicate method calls that should be performed.  A full
       explanation is not in order here, but a few examples will suffice:

         "You have [quant,_1,piece] of new mail."

       The above code is shorthand for, and will be interpreted as, this:

         sub {
           my $handle = $_[0];
           my(@params) = @_;
           return join '',
             "You have ",
             $handle-&gt;quant($params[1], 'piece'),
             "of new mail.";
         }

       where "quant" is the name of a method you're using to quantify the noun "piece" with the number
       $params[0].

       A string with no brackety calls, like this:

         "Your search expression was malformed."

       is somewhat of a degerate case, and just gets turned into:

         sub { return "Your search expression was malformed." }

       However, not everything you can write in Perl code can be written in the above shorthand system --<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">not&nbsp;-not</font>
       not by a long shot.  For example, consider the Italian translator from the beginning of this article,
       who wanted the Italian for "I didn't find any files" as a special case, instead of "I found 0 files".
       That couldn't be specified (at least not easily or simply) in our shorthand system, and it would have
       to be written out in full, like this:

         sub {  # pretend the English strings are in Italian
           my($handle, $files, $dirs) = @_[0,1,2];
           return "I didn't find any files" unless $files;
           return join '',
             "I found ",
             $handle-&gt;quant($files, 'file'),
             " in ",
             $handle-&gt;quant($dirs,  'directory'),
             ".";
         }

       Next to a lexicon full of shorthand code, that sort of sticks out like a sore thumb -- but this <u>is</u> a
       special case, after all; and at least it's possible, if not as concise as usual.

       As to how you'd implement the Russian example from the beginning of the article, well, There's More
       Than One Way To Do It, but it could be something like this (using English words for Russian, just so
       you know what's going on):

         "I [quant,_1,directory,accusative] scanned."

       This shifts the burden of complexity off to the quant method.  That method's parameters are: the
       numeric value it's going to use to quantify something; the Russian word it's going to quantify; and
       the parameter "accusative", which you're using to mean that this sentence's syntax wants a noun in
       the accusative case there, although that quantification method may have to overrule, for grammatical
       reasons you may recall from the beginning of this article.

       Now, the Russian quant method here is responsible not only for implementing the strange logic neces-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">sary&nbsp;necessary</font>
       sary for figuring out how Russian number-phrases impose case and number on their noun-phrases, but
       also for inflecting the Russian word for "directory".  How that inflection is to be carried out is no
       small issue, and among the solutions I've seen, some (like variations on a simple lookup in a hash
       where all possible forms are provided for all necessary words) are straightforward but <u>can</u> become
       cumbersome when you need to inflect more than a few dozen words; and other solutions (like using
       algorithms to model the inflections, storing only root forms and irregularities) <u>can</u> involve more
       overhead than is justifiable for all but the largest lexicons.

       Mercifully, this design decision becomes crucial only in the hairiest of inflected languages, of
       which Russian is by no means the <u>worst</u> case scenario, but is worse than most.  Most languages have
       simpler inflection systems; for example, in English or Swahili, there are generally no more than two
       possible inflected forms for a given noun ("error/errors"; "kosa/makosa"), and the rules for produc-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ing&nbsp;producing</font>
       ing these forms are fairly simple -- or at least, simple rules can be formulated that work for most
       words, and you can then treat the exceptions as just "irregular", at least relative to your ad hoc
       rules.  A simpler inflection system (simpler rules, fewer forms) means that design decisions are less
       crucial to maintaining sanity, whereas the same decisions could incur overhead-versus-scalability
       problems in languages like Russian.  It may <u>also</u> be likely that code (possibly in Perl, as with Lin-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">gua::EN::Inflect,&nbsp;Lingua::EN::Inflect,</font>
       gua::EN::Inflect, for English nouns) has already been written for the language in question, whether
       simple or complex.

       Moreover, a third possibility may even be simpler than anything discussed above: "Just require that
       all possible (or at least applicable) forms be provided in the call to the given language's quant
       method, as in:"

         "I found [quant,_1,file,files]."

       That way, quant just has to chose which form it needs, without having to look up or generate any-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">thing.&nbsp;anything.</font>
       thing.  While possibly not optimal for Russian, this should work well for most other languages, where
       quantification is not as complicated an operation.

       <b>The</b> <b>Devil</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Details</b>

       There's plenty more to Maketext than described above -- for example, there's the details of how lan-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">guage&nbsp;language</font>
       guage tags ("en-US", "i-pwn", "fi", etc.) or locale IDs ("en_US") interact with actual module naming
       ("BogoQuery/Locale/en_us.pm"), and what magic can ensue; there's the details of how to record (and
       possibly negotiate) what character encoding Maketext will return text in (UTF8? Latin-1? KOI8?).
       There's the interesting fact that Maketext is for localization, but nowhere actually has a ""use
       locale;"" anywhere in it.  For the curious, there's the somewhat frightening details of how I actu-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ally&nbsp;actually</font>
       ally implement something like data inheritance so that searches across modules' %Lexicon hashes can
       parallel how Perl implements method inheritance.

       And, most importantly, there's all the practical details of how to actually go about deriving from
       Maketext so you can use it for your interfaces, and the various tools and conventions for starting
       out and maintaining individual language modules.

       That is all covered in the documentation for Locale::Maketext and the modules that come with it,
       available in CPAN.  After having read this article, which covers the why's of Maketext, the documen-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">tation,&nbsp;documentation,</font>
       tation, which covers the how's of it, should be quite straightfoward.

       <b>The</b> <b>Proof</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pudding:</b> <b>Localizing</b> <b>Web</b> <b>Sites</b>

       Maketext and gettext have a notable difference: gettext is in C, accessible thru C library calls,
       whereas Maketext is in Perl, and really can't work without a Perl interpreter (although I suppose
       something like it could be written for C).  Accidents of history (and not necessarily lucky ones)
       have made C++ the most common language for the implementation of applications like word processors,
       Web browsers, and even many in-house applications like custom query systems.  Current conditions make
       it somewhat unlikely that the next one of any of these kinds of applications will be written in Perl,
       albeit clearly more for reasons of custom and inertia than out of consideration of what is the right
       tool for the job.

       However, other accidents of history have made Perl a well-accepted language for design of server-side
       programs (generally in CGI form) for Web site interfaces.  Localization of static pages in Web sites
       is trivial, feasable either with simple language-negotiation features in servers like Apache, or with
       some kind of server-side inclusions of language-appropriate text into layout templates.  However, I
       think that the localization of Perl-based search systems (or other kinds of dynamic content) in Web
       sites, be they public or access-restricted, is where Maketext will see the greatest use.

       I presume that it would be only the exceptional Web site that gets localized for English <u>and</u> Chinese
       <u>and</u> Italian <u>and</u> Arabic <u>and</u> Russian, to recall the languages from the beginning of this article -- to
       say nothing of German, Spanish, French, Japanese, Finnish, and Hindi, to name a few languages that
       benefit from large numbers of programmers or Web viewers or both.

       However, the ever-increasing internationalization of the Web (whether measured in terms of amount of
       content, of numbers of content writers or programmers, or of size of content audiences) makes it
       increasingly likely that the interface to the average Web-based dynamic content service will be
       localized for two or maybe three languages.  It is my hope that Maketext will make that task as sim-<font color="#ffffff" class="whiteout">ple&nbsp;simple</font>
       ple as possible, and will remove previous barriers to localization for languages dissimilar to
       English.
