In addition, it provides a framework on with n-tier applicationscan be seamlessly deployed.</p><p>Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) is an important part of J2EE. Itprovides an environment in which components from several manufacturerscan be assembled into a working application. The application assembler,with deep knowledge of the requirements of the business, can choosethe component that best matches the task at hand. For instance,she could use transaction-processing beans from one company; customer,order, and product beans from another vendor; and shipping beansfrom a third provider. She would then end up with an applicationcapable of accepting orders, charging the customer, and process shipmentswithout having to write code.</p><p>JavaServer Pages (JSP) and servlets are also part of the J2EEarchitecture. JSP is a specification that defines interfaces thatvendors can implement to provide developers the ability to createdynamic Web pages, which are files with the extension <code>.jsp</code>.HTTP servers that support JSP, interpret these files and createservlets to process HTTP requests and produce responses. Servletsare server plugins (specialized applications) that extend the capabilitiesof your HTTP server. They provide a straightforward deployment mechanism foryour applications.</p><p>Java Naming and Directory Service (JNDI) provides a mechanismthrough wich components and applications can locate shared resources.For example, it allows you to place a server-side resource anywherein your system, while the application that uses the resource onlyneeds to know its name, not the name or IP address of the host inwhich it resides.</p><p>The following sections give a more detailed explanation ofeach of these technologies.</p><br>    <br><a href="../WODesktopApps/iCustomizing_t_Approach_.html" target="_top"><img src="../images/previous.gif" border="0"></a><a href="Enterprise_JavaBeans.html" target="_right"><img src="../images/next.gif" border="0"></a>&nbsp;<br><br><p><hr><font face="Geneva,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">&#169; 2002 Apple Computer, Inc.
